We were very pleased with the resort. It is very clean and well maintained. The food at the restaurants was top notch and the service great as well. We also chose to cook some of our own meals in the little kitchen (small fridge, microwave and 2 burner stovetop) and that worked well and saved some money. Pans, utensils, dishes etc that we needed were provided in the room. There was also a blender, toaster and coffee pot (with filters). The beach isn't the best- it's rocky at the waterline, so you really can't swim there, but there is enough soft sand to go on a nice walk. The pool areas are HUGE. You can rent a big palapa at the pool with a double \"bed\" for $30- but you get the $30 back in food and beverage credit. We did that for a day and it was very relaxing. To do this, you need to get to the Balche poolside restaurant at 6:45 to get in line to reserve a palapa for the following day. They only take reservations for the current day and the next, but it's so popular you will only be able to make the reservations for the next day. EVERY staff member we encountered (and I mean every, even the groundskeepers) were incredibly friendly. The resort is giant, so there is a lot a ground to cover to get from place to place. They do offer shuttles, but we never used them, choosing to walk off the margarita calories instead. The location is about 45 minutes South of the Cancun airport and 25 minutes North of Playa del Carmen. We rented a car and found the area really easy to navigate and the roads were good. There is lots to do in the area!

We had a one-bedroom in Grand Mayan Bldg. 3 with a great patio with a small plunge pool and peaceful views. Other family members had a 2-bedroom unit. No issues with the rooms and the kitchens and bathrooms were fully renovated. Lovely amenities and the small patio pools were a nice touch. I really enjoyed the use of the spa amenities (Brio?) and found the huge store to be very handy. (The store carried basic groceries too.) I'm used to All-inclusive travel, so paying for food and drinks did add up. However, the quality of those drinks and meals were fabulous and well worth the price. I am also used to smaller resorts and the size of this resort was a bit overwhelming at first but every square foot of this resort is impeccably maintained, beautifully designed and landscaped. The pools were beautiful, especially the quiet Grand Mayan pool with the Bali beds. The one let-down was the beach and not being able to enter the water from the resort beach. We had to walk quite a ways to the left in order to find a sandy stretch for playing in the big waves. The beach area itself is great, I was just surprised/disappointed by the complete coral barrier. The resort itself is truly beautiful and my review may be biased as I did not have to deal with any timeshare business at all. I was not even approached, although there were many, many salespeople around. (It may be a different story for my family, the owners, as I only tagged along for a few days on their 2-week vacation.) It's an easy ride to the airport and into Playa Del Carmen, both reasonably priced. Excursions can be booked in the lobby and this can also be done through your concierge. I'd love to stay again for a longer vacation or explore another nearby resort with a more accessible beach for swimming. It was about 15 years since my last trip to Mexico and I hope to return very soon. Overall, it's true 5* resort for food, rooms, amenities, pools but a 3* for the beach.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAmazing experience!\u201d", "Author": "Amanda S", "ReviewID": "UR126255166", "Content": "We stayed at the Mayan Palace just last week and thought it was outstanding! Before going to the resort, we heard a lot of bad things about the timeshare presentation. We were approached once but other than that, they left us alone. We also read a lot of reviews on how hard the beds were. I agree that they were pretty stiff, but I slept really good the whole trip. There are always a lot of people at the pool (maybe because we went during spring break) but the pool is so big that you never feel crowded. The staff at the Mayan Palace is amazing! I don't think I passed one employee without getting a smile and a hello! Every day the cleaning staff would come and tidy up our room, and every night they would turn down our beds. It did take around 10 minutes for us to walk to the pool (We were in building 11, right next to the lobby) but you walk through a beautiful trail full of trees and other plants. If you don't want to walk, there is a shuttle that takes you from the lobby to the pool about every 15 minutes. The beach right by the resort is not good for swimming, but if you walk about 10 minutes to the left, there is a roped off area that is great for swimming. We did not do an all-inclusive, and we're glad we chose not to. Going to different restaurants outside of the resort definitely taught us more about the culture, and the prices were way cheaper!

The pool was outstanding, five star food and drink service pool side, For shade there were cabanas with large comfy lounges for rent 350.00 pesos but fee was removed if you bought that much in drinks or food. Plenty of lounge chairs with no fees pool side. Yes you do have a long walk to pool, beach, cafes but the walk is through some fab gardens with numerous birds in trees, flowers. What is not to enjoy!!!! The beach is not a good swimming area, but nice for sports, walking. The location is out of crowded Playa del Carmen, just a bit north of PDC and you can use hotel van service for 50pesos at the front door or walk to main road for 30pesos saving about Usa 1.75 for a 15/20 minute walk. The room service was excellent, the pool bar had outstanding ceviche, breakfast was available ala cart or buffet style. If you cannot find happiness on vacation here, well? I did not waste time attending a time share presentation since I was not interested in any purchase. I rented a car from Ismail at the Alamo car rental, he was excellent in taking care of a problem.

We had signed up with Mayan Palace in Cabo last summer and this was our first stay at one of their sites. We were anxious because of the negative comments and I'd like to make clear what I saw and felt during our stay. The weather was great the entire time. We were picked up at the airport as promised and arrived to discover the Mayan Bliss building was only one month old and spotless. The decor was pleasing, and our concierge, Claudia, friendly and endlessly helpful. We had a one bedroom suite and while the kitchen was compact (2burner stove and half sized fridge) it met our needs. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously maintained. We took the hotel shuttle into Playa Del Carmen (for $5 each, each way) to grocery shop and discovered it conveniently arrives at and leaves from the Walmart. We did agree to a timeshare presentation to get an update on the development plans Mayan Palace is working on and this gave us access to some great promo prices on excursions that were easy to book in the lobby, 1000 pesos, and 10% off our final bill. We were nervous because of the negative comments we had read about the sales staff, but were pleasantly surprised that we enjoyed our free breakfast and brief review of new developments. My husband set the timer on his i-phone for 90 minutes. Our contract was reviewed and it was quickly determined that we didn't benefit from any upgrades and we were out of there! No pressure-no large amount of time wasted. I usually took a shuttle down to the pools and beach, but my husband found a shortcut and often walked the distance-about 10 minutes from our building. The pools are beautiful, extensive, and clean. Even at 85% capacity there was no sense of crowding in the water. There is a lively exercise session with music from 12 to 1 every day, but no other music or annoying PA type announcements to disturb our relaxation time. And relax we did! The very best deal at the resort is to rent a huge palapa with a cushioned, double bed and 2 chaises for $30. These palapas surround the pool and the first $30 you spend on drinks and food are then deducted from your bill. Food comes from the great Mexican restaurant by the pool and the bar and wait staff (especially Daniel and Mauricio) are very friendly and cheerful.

We found that the store (grocery) was very expensive, it was cheaper to take a shuttle to town, and a cab back, just to buy a case of beer than it was to buy a case of beer on site. The rooms themselves were large, and clean and pleasant enough. There was no view of anything from the rooms which was disappointing. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. When the coffee maker broke, they replaced it instantly. The folks we met at the time share were all very nice. The time share stuff was total crap. They wasted our entire morning and part of our afternoon, threw seven different people at us and would not let us leave or get our free stuff for the longest time. - six hours between breakfast and the presentation. We made it really clear from the onset of the presentation that we had plans and had to leave by 12:45, and that we really did not want to buy anything. We were with my sister and her husband, and three of us finally just got up and walked out at 3:00 before they finally let us go.

We arrived at the Mayan Palace with a quick checkin, only to discover they had us in building 21. We weren't happy because, we talked with the concierge 3 weeks in advance to make sure we had a room in buildings 1-5. They quickly changed it and put us in building 12, which was ok, bc we were right next to the lobby. We booked a romantic dinner on the beach, on the pier over the water, which was very nice and decorated for a perfect romantic dinner, just the two of us, A+ on the beach dinner!

Prior to our stay: Because of the Groupon, I was nervous about booking through what seemed like a third party, so I called three days prior to arrival to confirm my stay, and to reserve spots for their free shuttle from the airport to the resort. The shuttle doesn't leave until it fills up, but it's a shuttle for people going to both Mayan Palace and the Grand Mayan, so we only waited for about 15-20 minutes. Check-in: Based on advice from other reviews, I requested a low numbered building when I called to confirm, but none were available - we got a room in building 17. It really is not a bad walk to the hotel lobby area or pool area (10-15 minute stroll). We only used the shuttle our first night because we weren't familiar with the property yet, but the walk is better than wait. They advised that we check again the next day however, and we were able to get a room in building 3! Room: We weren't planning to use a kitchenette, so we requested a standard two double bed room. The furniture is a bit old (seemingly older in the building 17 room than the building 3 room). The rooms were fairly clean, but housekeeping sometimes didn't come until late in the day. Air conditioning worked well, and having the ceiling fan to circulate the humid air was good. I was annoyed about having to pay high prices for internet wifi access - ~$13/day or ~$60/week Property: The pool area is huge, clean, and beautiful. Canopied beds (palapas) are available throughout for $35 (with returned $35 credit that can be used for food/drinks), but make sure you reserve them 1-2 days in advance - they go quickly! There are also areas near the pool for kids to engage in activities, including a ping pong table, giant chess, temporary tattoo stations and hair braiding. Lots of chairs also by the beach for sunbathing, but the water is a little rocky. There's a spa and a clean small fitness center available with several machines and weight areas; yoga and pilates classes are available for 100 pesos per class. There's also a large shopping center - combination gift shop and grocery store/deli with insanely inflated prices. Food: DO NOT GO TO HAVANA MOON! The food here was disgusting/nearly inedible, and the service was horrible. The menu consisted of primarily American food (nothing Mexican/authentic). You find better options at Balche (aka Frida's) - we ate here for their breakfast buffet and also had dinner here one night. The breakfast (a la carte and buffet) at Greenbreak was good too. Prices for food in the resort were expensive/inflated for tourists - we had better and less expensive meals in town. Tours: We booked two tours through the hotel: Chichen Itza and Tulum. Be sure to book at least the day prior to when you want to leave. Though we initially grumbled about paying more for the 'premier' option for the Chichen Itza, it was absolutely worth it for the better bus, the unlimited drinks/food and the friendly/intelligent/well spoken/knowledgeable tour guides. We did the Tulum express tour - also good, although they tried to sell us on stuff more. The ruins and the beach at Tulum were magnificent, although the water was rocky. Transportation: There are several shuttles to Playa del Carmen daily for 50 pesos per person each way; a cab ride to Playa del Carmen is about 225 pesos if you don't want to wait for the shuttle times. We never used the local bus - it seemed like a long walk from the main property to the front gate, and we were worried about safety. There's also a shuttle that goes to Cancun twice a week. A taxi back to the airport is 370 pesos; the hotel shuttle to the airport is about 150 pesos per person. Amazingly, we were not asked once to sit for a time-share presentation. Maybe because we spent a lot outside the resort? All in all, a good stay for the deal. This place is probably ideal for families, maybe couples?; not so great for single people. Probably won't come back because the amenities are average, but it can be a good deal for anyone looking for a cheap vacation.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Clemente, California", "Title": "\u201cMayan Palace Riviera Maya: Just Outstanding\u201d", "Author": "Charles C", "ReviewID": "UR125592336", "Content": "Fantastic vacation -- took our best friends.

Try to request a room in th lower numbered buildings (1-8), to be close to the pools. BTW, the pool complex is one of the largest anywhere, south of the U.S. border.

We had a wonderful time and well deserved honeymoon. We were in a one bedroom and yes it was not the Ritz but it was a very pleasant stay. Air conditioner worked, beds were not hard at all and it was comfortable. We stayed in building 10 which is the main building. It was a walk to the pool but not outrageous. The reviews are correct that the lower the number the closer you are to the pool. I prefer quiet so building 10 was perfect! The beach is beautiful but there are way tooo much rocks in the water so you have to go to Puert Morelos or Playa del Carmen which were both awesome to get in the water. Upon check in we were approached by the timesharing speech but once we said a firm no it was no pressure or problem. We actually did decide to go on the tour a few days later to get the discount, eat free breakfast and get the free pesos. Our tour guide was Jorge and he was GREAT! He was down to earth, he was thorough and there was no pressure. We did decide to buy. The entire process which included breakfast for 1 hr was about 4 hours. The pool is breathtaking. There are palapas that you can rent for the day that come with a king size bed and two lounge chairs. In order to get it you must get to the pool by 7 am and you have to spend $35 US dollars at the bar or restaurant. Please keep in mind that you cannot pay anything with cash at the resort. Everything is charged to your room. There is a shuttle to take you within the resort as well as to cancun and other places. I do recommend that you go to La Mega or Walmart to get some food and snack items as this will cut down the cost. We rented a car from thrifty for about $240 for 7 days with full insurance coverage. The best restaurant for us was in Puerto Morelos. It was called The Pelican beach club. The food was just Great and it was Cheap!! John Gray's restaurant was highly recommended however the food was ok and the service was no good to us. Mr. Gray himself came out and greeted the table of 10 and laughed and conversated but the two tables of 2 which included us didnt even get a look :(.

This place is stationing a network of its representatives at all the rental car places around the Cancun area to steer unsuspecting rental car customers to a timeshare presentation. This happened to us at Alamo and the guy had a desk with maps of the area set up to give directions. He told us about the Mayan palace after we said we already had reservations elsewhere and he said it was a Mexican owned hotel business and they just wanted people to look at their property for future consideration and in return they would offer tickets to area attractions like Xcaret. He wrote up the offer on a Mayan palace form and so there was no misunderstanding about what the offer was. The guy had a business card identifying himself as a client services representative for the Mayan palace hotel. When we got there we were asked to sign a form saying that we would listen to a 90 minute timeshare presentation, that was new but we had already driven there. Then we were lead to a huge sales center with dozens of others just like us and with scale models of properties, etc. and realized that this was something completely other than what we had been told. We were asked to produce credit cards to show we weren't dead-beats and were told it was to enroll us in a 'raffle'. It was all very high pressure. We were told that we could say yes/no at the end of the 90 minutes- maybe would not be an option. But then at the end of 90 minutes it was apparent that they didn't understand the word 'no' although it is the same word in english and spanish. So much so that we had to repeat 'no' to 5 others after we told this to the first salesperson. Not only that, but at this point it became apparent that we would be subjected to repeated sales pitches after saying no until we gave up and didn't receive the incentive they promised for attending. We decided that hell would freeze over before we left without them because of what we were subjected to. We got the tickets in the end, thank you very much. Long and short of it, the property is nice but the operation is being run like a scam which makes you question the integrity of the whole thing.

We wanted a resort that wasn't a time-share so we could travel to other attractions in the Mayan area. We had read many reviews and they were accurate and helpful. We pre-booked our pickup from the airport 48 hours in advance, and I also asked for a unit closer to the pool. We arrived at 2pm, well ahead of the 5 pm check-in time and I again reiterated my desire to be closer to the pool (units 1-7). We ended up being given unit 20!! I was quite concerned after what I had read but it was not a big deal at all. We didn't take the shuttle once during the week, but rather enjoyed the walk along the pristinely kept walkways. We were asked about going to the timeshare, and called once, but not hassled at all. We chose not to go, some people we spoke to had an enjoyable 90 minute tour and let go afterwards, some had a 3 hour tour/sales pitch which was ugly. You take your chances. We went into Mega Mart and Walmart during the week for shopping, they were both fine and it kept our cost down considerably. The units were comfortable, we had 5 in a one bedroom unit and space wasnt an issue. The fridge was small, and the microwave not great, but you adapt. The pool and pool service was excellent, the beach is not swimmable by the resort, but our kids went 10 minutes down the shoreline to where they could go in. We booked a car through the front lobby which was handy, but not glitch free. You have to double or triple check what you need. We booked an automatic, then were told when we arrived they had none on the resort. After some 'discussion' they were able to locate one for us. It was more expensive than booking in Playa, but again, very handy. We drove to Tulum and then to Akumal to swim with sea turtles. Both recommended, and we felt safe driving the whole day. We only ate at restaurants on site twice, although we had the pizza and panini sandwhiches from the deli a few times which were great and a better deal.

This not an all inclusive but a time share property and it was packed during high season. We are beach people and the palms trees and sand here are quite lovely until you get to the water's edge. We knew that the entrance to the water required beach/water shoes. It is very rocky with some seaweed and this attracts fish. So, its good for snorkeling but challenge to walk in an out of for a quick dip. If you don't know, it is a bit of a disappointment. The alternative was to walk 20 minutes north to the Valentin Resort for a beautiful sandy access. Footwear for the walk is recommended as well as the path can be rocky. While there were lots of beach chairs, palms trees, and palapes, We had to get up early to insure we got a palape. The pool is huge and they have beds around it. You can rent them for $30usd but if you spend that much at the pool side restaurant, the bed rental is free. There is a gym and Monday to Friday Yoga classes at 8:00 and Pilates at 9:30. They are $100 pesos. There are free stretching exercises on the beach and water aerobics in the pool. There is a deli near the pool if you want to buy food to make in your room. It had a great selection but was a bit pricey. The shuttle to Walmart in Playa del Carmen is 50 pesos so is something to consider. Bottled water at the deli was 40 pesos versus 14.50 for a 4 liter container at the larger grocery stores in the town. Restaurant meals at the resort were great;15% tip is added to the price. This happened in Playa del Carmen as well. Check in and check out were pretty smooth. There was a 25.50 peso charge for the room each day at check out that we were not expecting. Maybe owners know this but this was our first time as guests, it was a surprise. It wasn't a huge expense but I like to know how much things are going in. As we were four people we rented a car and felt that was more economical in terms of driving into PDC and to Tulum and to the Grand Cenote, Puerto Morelos and the ferry to Isla Mujeres. Driving can be a bit tense along the 307. The plan is to do a driving tour next year. This seems liked a good practice run. Our friends have had their time share for ten years and enjoy it. If you don't drink, it is probably a little cheaper or comparable per holiday than an all inclusive resort. We had wonderful weather everyday and saw lots of iguanas, noisy birds, fish, coatis and we felt safe. Would have given five stars but the rocky beach was an issue for me.

It was an amazing experience, this being our first ever to mexico!:) Before i left i read a lot of reviews on our hotel both good and bad, and honestly cannot believe that anyone could write a bad review! All i can think of is that anyone who wrote a bad review must be an Extremely rich spoiled person!!! -We stayed in building 12 which yes is technically a higher numbered building! But it was perfect! we were right beside the lobby so going out on adventures or going into town was super easy! The building was only a 5 min walk to the pool! through shade and gorgeous tree's. If you didn't feel like walking you could take the cute little golf bus things to the pool that was maybe a minute or 2 ride! And of course our drivers were so cute and friendly!:) - Our hotel room was stunning! we had marble counter tops and stainless steal appliances. big comfy couches and a table that we played cards at every night! there was plenty of getting ready space which was nice for my 3 sisters, aunt and mother!:) sure there wasn't any great view, minus the beautiful tree's, birds, animals, and of course sun!!! We had no problem leaving or cell phones and money just sitting around! The Maid never took anything, and she was super friendly. She couldn't speak any english but was always smiling and willing to go above and behind our expectations by fetching us ice, doing our dishes, and getting us a basket for our fruit, on top of cleaning up after 6 girls who like to strew our clothes all over everything and make up left all over the counter. - The resturaunts sure weren't as cheap as playa del carmens resturaunts where you could get a meal for 40 pesos. Well, actually if you go out to eat on 5th ave it is about the same as the hotel. anyways the resturaunts were cute and gave you lots of variety! If you didn't feel like mexican food thats ok! I spend about $10 a meal at the resort. Also can you say PINA COLODA!!!:) The Swim up pool bar makes the best pina colodas with fresh fruit mmmm soooo good! - The POOL is amazing!! I didn't even swim the whole thing while i was there, but man was in gorgeous! Perfect temperature and perfect depth! lots of tree's and shade, and ever more sun! there was always a spot for us to tan around the pool or at the beach! -The beach is great! tons of sand! yes the water does have a lot of rocks in it! But we still went in! we had a blast playing beach volleyball and going on walks along the beach! We even did the a Photo Shoot on the beach! The prices are a little high! But totally worth it!!! We did it with a group of 8 which was easy because we all just split the price!:) Also the photographers were great! super friendly and they posed us in positions that made each photo wonderful! Altogether the staff was amazing the rooms beach just everything was so amazing, yes they do offer timeshare presentations which you can refuse or not and they do let you know upfront that it is a sales presentation. we did go because we got a free breakfast! which in itself was amazing! We definitely will be returning to the Mayan Palace! Honestly i don't think there is any advice that i can give any of you thinking about going to the mayan palace! All i can tell you is that the mayan palace is definitely a choice that you will not regret!:)", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cStay Away Fro Mayan Palace\u201d", "Author": "ronmoss", "ReviewID": "UR125153192", "Content": "The Mayan Palace is no vacation.

As visiting Xel-Ha is an expensive proposition for a family of 5, we thought we would check it out. We were funneled cattle-like through parking, reception, meet and greet, as were a group of others, also under the impression that it was just a tour of the facilities. As we waited for our 'tour\" to begin, we watched young girls (front-line staff) tottering around on high heels and short tightskirts on cobblestones and wondered who this was supposed to impress. We filled in forms, answered questions and waited and were then asked for proof of registration in other local hotels. These were in our car, parked far enough away from the hotel to warrant shuttle service. We were told we could just 'run back and pick up the documents\" We offered the names of our hotels, but this not being enough, we were just waved away and told :Hasta luego by the manager with a disgusted look on his face that we had wasted his time. We were not the only ones that were told we should leave: at least 2 other couples who were expecting a tour and presentation about the hotel but who were not wanting a time-share presentation were also very upset. Be aware if you are staying at this hotel that there will be a parade of \"tourists\" being taken through for breakfast and lunch, on a daily basis to gawk at your meals, you around to pool or whatever you are doing to relax The guests I saw there (few) seemed depressed, a female guest I met in the bathroom warned me that \"this toilet doesn't flush either\" and seemed very disgruntled.

It's quite breathtaking in alot of ways with the buildings, pools and landscaping. They provide shuttles to get around the resort, and you need them or you get exhausted with the walking. They could use more of them, and be more frequent because as you know, a couple minutes in Mexico is 10 or 20. We stayed for two weeks, and never used their restaurants, or purchased drinks or meals at the resort. We rented a car and did our grocery shopping in Playa. There was a one liter bottle of water in the room for $2.50 US or you could get a 5 gallon bottle at the MEGA in town for $3, so you do the math. You could pay $6.50 for a White Russian at the resort or get a 1 liter bottle of Smirnoff Vodka for $11 and a bottle of Kaluha for about $10. That's a lot of White Russians for the price of 3 at the resort, dontcha think? You'll find that to be pretty much the case at the resort for anything you buy there, but it all depends what you want to go there for. We loved our room. It was large, clean and we appreciated the kitchen. So we viewed it as our home away from home. We enjoyed the beach, and if you want to swim take swim shoes with you so that you can walk in the water as it's got rock on the sea bed. Great water front for snorkeling, so bring your snorkel gear!!! The staff were very friendly and we appreciated their hard work, so always tipped our cleaning lady as know doubt know with all resorts in Mexico, it's only the managers that are making a good wage. Just a small tip. It is a Timeshare Resort. So if you don't want to get roped in to the Timeshare speel unplug your phone when you get into your room, or it will ring 3 or 4 times a day by them wanting to set up an appointment to meet with them and spend a valuable day doing something you don't want to do, for a very small credit to your account. As a side point, be prepared to be segrated in a small way. It is a number of resorts all in one, and you could find yourself getting kicked out of a pool area if you don't have the right colour wrist band on. I personally think that's a lousey way to make guests feel welcome. There's enough things in life that create class disctinctions, and going to a resort that wants to save money by putting more expensive ones on the same land as the less expensive ones seems a little cheesy to me. It kind of made you feel like you were standing at a zoo pavillion were you could look in at the rich people, but you're not good enough to go there. My thoughts on that are, if we can't all play together, them put them somewhere else. Again, we did enjoy ourselves thouroughly there, and it was extremely beautiful. If you want to use it to the full with it's poolside drinks and restaurants, all you have to do is line your pockets with gold and you'll be all set. We on the other hand didn't mind bringing our own drinks to the beach stealthily in our insulated beach bag, and didn't have to throw up at the check-out bill we would have gotten otherwise.

We were asked to sit and wait for our bell boy and then IT happened ; a concierge by the name of Eric approached us with a map of the resort(which you need as it is Massive) and asked us if we would like to come to a breakfast presentation. Now we have owned a timeshare for 10 years we thought we knew what was coming. No thank you we said, we are not interested in upgrade selling buying or trading our timeshare . Eric profusely promised that it was NOT a timeshare presentation it was an orientation from RCI to help its members trade more efficiently. Now we had many years ago attended a similar presentation that was simply that. Warily we asked No pressure no asking us to buy? It was only an hour long promise??? Yes Yes and again Yes five and half hours and 6 salepeople later we escaped. Shame on the Canadians and americans who do this job with their constant pressure and manipulation. After escaping we googled Mayan palace timeshare. OUCH many many people and complaints of less than ethical to down right wrong treatment so Be Careful.

We have always enjoyed Mexico for the courteous staff and willingness to get to know you . That was not the case here. Why hurry or smile or try to give excellent service when you are guaranteed 15%?

Last year we stayed at the grand mayan, same month. Like last years review I'll avoid the commonplace reviews of the timeshare snag, unswimmable beach, etc. I'll try to concentrate on the kids and the difference btwn the mayan palace and grand mayan. Our weather forecast was overcast and/or showers everyday. We had clouds, some rain, but sun everyday. Email the concierge the Friday before your arrival to request a room location. I was prepared to leave the resort if we did not get a room in buildings 1-8. We lucked out with building 5 this year. However, I made it clear at every opportunity I would leave if we did not receive a \"walking distance\" room because of the stroller. 2 kids = double stroller. Last year and this year we saw too many couples that wish they took this piece of advice. The non all inclusive is the draw for us at this resort since, our kids share meals and paying full or even partial fare for them is a rip off. The one thing that I'd suggest to change is an additional tip line on the bills. We had some good service, that just received the usual tip because we had no cash at that point in time. Last year I reviewed to bring 10 and 20 pesos coins/bills for additional tips, and we tried to keep some around at all times. I chose to use a private car service to the resort (and back). It made a huge difference in the start time of our vacation. Ours started the minute he found us outside the airport. Last year I gave a list of food that I went to the supermarket in Playa Del Carmen to get. This year I asked the car service to get it in advance (paid per hour plus bills). 1 word - AWESOME. Highly recommended. Send me a note and I'll be happy to give the service name I used. I sent a family photo which was a help because Rudy found me rather than vice versa. We took a $35 palapa (bed) at the pool every day. Reserved the day prior. And the $35 was taken off our bill as we used well over $35 in drinks/food services from bar/wait staff. We were adventurous and took the 15 minute hike north to a \"swimmable\" beach. Life-guarded. Huge waves. Had to carry our youngest home since the trip was so long. I tired and took a nap when we did get to the palapa! kids club this year denied our younger than 5 year old children participating in their activities. Note: Our 4.5 yr old looks and acts like a 6 year old. The \"secondary\" kids club and water activities at the mayan palace pool all seemed to be eliminated. Our boys swam ALL DAY, so it wasn't too much of an inconvenience, but it was a firm disappointment. They were face painted and attended a night movie. My wife and I both commented the service generally seemed less outgoing and less accommodating throughout the resort as compared to last year. Thankfully we needed them less this year. grand mayan pool was warmer this year! Last year it was outright chilly! We were told that we could access the GM pools by the front desk, just not to order drinks/services. We did take advantage of their beach pool twice which was a nice change. We were grateful not to have the on deck pool at the room; some real drowning concerns. However, the balconies were tiny at the MP. Deep enough for a sideways chair, and 12 or so feet long. Useless except for some morning air. Other than this I noted, we didn't get free coffee at MP. But otherwise I equate the properties. If we go a 3rd time, I would simply take whichever gave me a closer room to the pool. Again, we lucked out with building 5 this year. WARNING: internet speed was slow, too slow for some lego games when heavy utilization times occurred... they need an optimizer/cache in the network and N wireless (barely got G speed). I'm attaching a snapshot of the speedtest.net result. As this is one of two spots I felt the service I purchased was well below average.

You can go for long walks on the premises which we do each morning for about an hour a day. Lots of pool activities. snorkling, water vollyball and more.

Food was very good, pool excellent (it's huge - lots of chairs), golf course is surprisingly good (not worth $75 around though). It's an executive par 3 with holes ranging from 105 to 275yds. Our wives had a couple of spa sessions and liked it.. Beach is ok. You can't swim there.. full of rocks and coral.

Rooms were average at Mayan Palace.. we had to change rooms a few times when checking in.. mold smells, epox smell etc..Pillows are small and not very good.. and mattress very hard. One very negative issue we experienced was the time share presentation (14 different people met with us over 2.5 hours). They jump on you the minute you arrive... and they don't let up. It's worth it from the discount perspective, however the pressure tatics are relentless. They simply do not take no for an answer.. even if you are an owner already. From the 6 calls and 2 visits to our room the day before to ensure we were attending, to as mentioned the various people we spoke too. We simply had enough. Too bad because after spending a few days there, we may have been more likley to speak further. Just be forewarned. It can get intense. Some people we saw were there for 5+ hours... and no means bring in someone else.. be prepared.. Second issue.. checking out. A simple credit adjustment for golf (they overcharged us) took 40 minutes to resolve and once again 5 people had to be involved. It was as simple issue. Resort is very big - so be prepared for a lot of walking.. we had rain most days but it only lasted a short time.. Older crowd.. 40-50+..

We go an amazing deal through living social for a week and it came out to under $150 per person. FOR. THE. WEEK. Granted, its not an all inclusive, but I have almost no complaints about the place and for the price, It was an amazing time. SO first: Transportation You can book the airport shuttle, for free, from the airport to the resort by emailing the concierge a few days in advance. Some of our friends did have to wait a few hours at the airport b/c the first shuttle filled up, but they sell beers outside the airport so it wasn't a big deal. The hotel can also arrange transport BACK to the airport when you leave but that costs $15 and they just put it on your bill if you call concierge 24 hours in advance. Getting to Play del Carmen: They also have a shuttle that leaves every few hours and costs 50 pesos. You can also walk out to the highway and catch the bus there, which costs 20 pesos but it is a little bit of a trek out of the resort. Didn't take any cabs and didn't really need to. Pool: Awesome, unbelievable, so big and huge. Other reivewers complain a lot about the lack of a good beach but really, who cares, you can walk 20 minutes in either direction or find plenty of that in playa del carmen. FOOD: all of it was fine, expect to pay about California prices, not unreasonable, but good for what you get. THe nachos down at the pool were killer but we went into Playa and bought lots of grociers and cooked in the room. We also made lots of drinks and brought them around with us and nobody said anything. ROOMS: Were fine. Having a kitchen was awesome, they maybe smelled a little mildewy but it was very humid there. AC worked great, maids came in and cleaned everyday...tip them the first night and they'll do an extra great job! The beds were fine, a little hard and not plush but you should drink at least six drinks at the pool every day and you'll sleep like a baby. DOWNSIDES: Very few other 30's somethings there, mostly older folks and families, nightlife after 9pm was almost non-existent and what was there was very sparsly attended and ended at 12pm. Go into playa if you are looking for a raging club experience. THe higher number buildings were about a 10-15 minute walk to the pool, which was fine for us but for older people, might be a problem. Even though we emailed a few weeks in advance requesting that we be in bldgs 1-8, they weren't able to accommodate us, although we did get adjoining rooms with our other friends, which was more important. OVERALL: this is a great place and I would probably go back. Its a fairly sanitized Mexican experience, but staff are all very nice and helpful and you can basically do what you want there. We were able to do the whole trip for a week, including food and drinks for about 400-500$ per person and most of that was booze. The timeshare people were very easily fended off, they asked us once when we checked in and didn't press, and then only called our room once or twice to ask again. OH and to the person who was whining about how birds were walking on the table....Its called OUTSIDE. That happens there.

This resort falls into the same vein as the others. It is large and sprawling, well manicured, multiple restaurants, beautiful golf course. It is VERY difficult to get into the water as it is primarily exposed jagged rock at water's edge (if you have water shoes, take them along). Additionally this area does not have a protective reef off shore thus the water tends to be rough all the time - just not a good place to get into the water and play. That said, I believe the beach area is beautiful and well maintained, lounge chairs and palapas available every time we went. The pool is huge, it appeared more people were hanging out there than the beach and even then there were ample loungers available. I can't address the food well as we only ate 3 meals there. I would say the food was good, but nothing to get excited about. We did the Mexican Fiesta on Thursday night - fun, but wouldn't do it a second time. They had some live music at different restaurants throughout the week, we went to once, I wasn't overly impressed. What made this resort stand out to me was the staff. I know resort staff are suppose to be pleasant and helpful, but this staff did an exceptional job doing their job. I doubt that we will return there for a long period of time because there wasn't anything that jumped out as something I can't find somewhere else (except the staff).

Inquired 2 different times at concierge desk about nightly entertainment and was told that they only had the Mexican fiesta nite that week and you had to register for the buffet and show and the buffet was $60/plate even for children. The only other nite there was once Karaoke but since they couldn't find the cord for the first 30 minutes it would only last for 1 hour. The other issue that I was very upset with was that we had booked 2 tours prior to coming to the resort and was then told that the resort would not allow tour buses that had been booked prior to coming to the resort to pick us up at the main lobby since we did not book thru the hotel. We had to go out to the front gate on the highway. They were supposed to have a shuttle to take you there but shuttle never arrived after waiting for 45 minutes and the other time it was at 7am and shuttle only runs from 8a-11am. So both times we had to take a cab to the front. Also spoke to the front desk because it was supposed to be free shuttle to Walmart/Playa del Carmen but they said no and charged $10/trip and with 5 people!! When I complained I was basically told too bad. There was also shuttles buses to the pool area that were supposed to run every 15 minutes but they were very sporadic and after waiting 45 minutes one time I just opted to walk. This was ok for me but when you have children with you it can be quite a hike. There were also no chairs to sit out on the small veranda. Asked if we could get some chairs and we were told they don't have them. Pools were wonderful but we were told twice that we could not use the covered lounge beds unless we went to the buffet breakfast and got tickets and since we didn\u2019t have the necessary tickets or something we had to get off those beds . Buffet breakfast was $30 each which I thought was very expensive and since there were 5 in our party it was just too much. We wanted to take the bikes and take a bike ride but it was $10 per person to use the bikes for 1 hour and then it is only to go on a guided tour of the property led by one of their workers. Not worth paying for that!! The rooms are very spacious but the beds are extremely hard. So much in fact that we were fighting over who got to sleep on the couches. Kitchen is so small that cooking in it is almost impossible. Two small burners and a small fridge are all that is in the kitchen so it is very difficult to use. This was the first time that we have opted not to do the all inclusive and it was a big mistake. I found they nickle and dime you to death and I found the prices to be way to much. I also did not like the way they automatically add a 10% tip so that you have no control over whether you tip for good service or not. I definitely would not stay at this resort again.

I was pleased that the Resort made available to us NFL fans the watching of the two championship games. The pools at the resort like many others have said are fabulous. The resort workers are there to tend to your every need, (for a tip). The grounds are taken care of very well. You can not use the beach of course, but there is much to do without it. I especially liked the lounge seats made into the water that had a head rest. That was really nice. There were many of these in all the pools. They had loads of pool bars along with jacuzzis as well. Food at the resort was great. I do recommend everyone to explore Playa del Carmen and DO get a rent a car. We had no trouble with driving and it is no worse driving there as here in the states. Definitely go to 5th Ave. in Playa. There are at least 3 miles of restaurants, bars, silver stores, drug stores, and souvenirs. If you do a time share tour you should get the equivalent of $250.00 in exchange for viewing the resort. Don't settle for less. Remember.... Everything is negotiable in Mexico! Everything! Exchange rate at the present time is approximately $8.00 USD to $100 Pesos. Don't mess this us, because I did!! Gas is cheaper also. Approximately 1 US gal. is $2.50 US. They use Liters. It is approximately 3.77 liters to the gallon. Weather is great! They have you give a credit card at the beginning of your stay and you sign receipts the entire time at the resort and then either pay up at the end or charge it to your card. They like this because you will forget how much you've charged and wind up with a big bill. Be careful! Rooms are really nice. We had a suite with a master bedroom and another bedroom with two queens. Each had their on bath. Separate living, dining and kitchen quarters between the two bedrooms. Refrigerators are the small type. Not much freezer space. Bottled water is provided and we also drank from the kitchen faucet when I would make coffee in the morning. No ill effects at all. The water issue in Mexico has been better taken care of. They make beds daily and do a turn down in the evening which is nice. I did have a problem obtaining wash cloths for some reason. They don't leave them on a regular basis and I consistently had to keep asking for them. I guess I'm the only American that uses one.

The Mayan Palace is comprised of 21 buildings lined up with the lowest numbered nearest the pool and the highest numbered bordering the golf course. If you are in building 9 or higher you WILL have a long walk to the pool. We were in building 16 and found the walk to be agitating but not entirely awful. It was about a 15 minute walk to the beach and pool area. The resort is very secluded and will require you to take a shuttle or taxi to escape the confinement. This is a \"no cash\" resort and everything is charged to your room. The way this is set up can cause much confusion as to what you are actually spending. Do yourself a favor and familiarize yourself with the currency conversions before arriving as this can add to the confusion. The onsite grocery store is very expensive and due to the no cash policy can end up costing you a small fortune. After returning I have this advise: On your first or second day take the shuttle (50 Pesos or $5 per person one way) to Playa Del Carmen (15 minutes away) to visit the Wal-Mart or Mega store. Once there you can hire a taxi driver to take you to one of those stores and wait while you shop. Buy as much food and water as you will need for the duration of your trip. All of this will fit into the trunk of the tax and the driver can bring you right up to the lobby. A taxi ride should cost you no more than $20. Be sure to negotiate with the driver. The less you eat at the onsite resort restaurants the happier you'll be after your trip. The food is average at best and will cost you anywhere from $20 - $30 per entree. Be sure to give yourself at least an hour at the store since it can be confusing if you are not used to shopping in Mexico. Be sure to buy all of the alcohol you'll need as well. They tell you that you are not allowed to bring your own drinks to the pool or beach but no one will say anything to you if you do. Try to stay out of the resort grocery store. Most rooms have two burner stove tops, microwaves, toasters, and blenders. The beach is not suitable for swimming but you can can walk to the left and after 15 minutes will find yourself at a very nice swimming beach. If you want to book any excursions do your research and book in advance. Do not agree to any timeshare presentations unless you want to throw away 5 hours of your time. Be firm in saying that you are not interested and they will leave you alone. If you book any excursions the tour busses/vans/taxis are not allowed in to pick you up so you will have to walk to the front gate (about a 1/2 mile). It will cost you $3.00 to take a taxi up there. Vehicles are allowed to enter when bringing you back. Bring some snacks with you in your luggage as well as a bottle of water to tide you over until you can get out to buy some food. This is not a bad resort if you are looking to sit tight and not do much aside from sit by the pool or sea. If you are looking to do this on a budget do your homework and follow my advice. If you are looking for a lot to do and to be around younger people do not go here.

We made our reservations (two weeks with separate weekly reservation numbers) by exchanging our Vacations Internationale points through RCI at the beginning of October. We chose this resort because we wanted to stay in the Puerto Aventuras area between Cancun and Playa del Carmen and it was what was available on a 90 day lead. Checking in was efficent for the huge number of people that arrived Saturday between 5 and 6pm. The resort is enormous, so the busy times at the front desk are very busy, but they have a dozen or so stations, so fairly quick. As soon as you are away from the check in counter you are approached to get scheduled for a 90-minute sales presentation. If you sign up for this, know that it will take about three hours if you do not buy, possibly more if you do, so weigh the benefits promised against this time. Schedule first thing in the morning so you do not miss too much pool or beach time. Also know that the first glance price of $149,900 (dollars!, not pesos) we were quoted went to a couple grand over two plus hours and four sales people, so don't take the first offer. They don't want you to buy and come back, they want you to buy and rent them the unit back so they can rent it out as a hotel room and present to someone else next year. Evidently Mexican law does not allow them to rent the units until sold, because, as they will tell you, they are \"not a time share and not a hotel\", but I was unable to tell the difference between this and the several timeshares and hotels we have stayed in in Cancun. Know this and hold out if you are interested in buying. We have two other timeshares and future plans that do not include timeshare, so we did not buy, even though the final offers were reasonable. The best part of the resort for us non-golfers was the amazing pool: Three levels with endless edges that flow into each other. There were lots of areas in each of the levels for both small kids (shallow) and big kids like us (four feet deep or so). We spent most of our on-site days around and in the pools. The daily in-pool stretching and excercise class for all who want to participate from noon to 1pm is a spectacle not to be missed, whether you participate or just people watch. Usually 100 or more participated. With the enormous size, the pool was never crowded, but you would want to be in the pool by 8am if you wanted to swim laps in straight lines. Also, this is the only heated pool that I have swam in on the Mayan Riviera. Bathtub warm at the inlet, and then cooling as you move away through the pool. You could always find water that was comfortable, no matter what you like. The beach is sandy between the trees and the water, so if you like to walk or play in the sand, it is alright. As others have said, the beach lost its sand during Wilma and has not been rehabilitated as the Cancun beaches have in the last few years. The Mexican federal government is who is responsible for rehabbing the beaches, as they are all public access (like Hawaii) and not owned by the resort. This also means if you do not like the beach you are on, but find a nice one you can walk to, you can do this. We walked about a mile on the beach in Playa while we were there one day because it was so nice and sandy. We got down to the beach almost every day that we did not dive for the sunrise, which was awesome. The one downside to a large resort like this is that the late night partier always assume someone is cleaning up after them, so there was often drink cups and beer cans around the beach lounge chairs in the morning. The resort does clean them up beginning around sunrise, 6:20 in early January. The other thing we noticed was the huge amount of flotsam trash that lands on the beach every day. As this area gets more and more developed for tourism, the Mexican people are going to have to figure out how they are going to curb this. There seemed to be more of it here than I remember in Cancun. The wait staff around the pool was excellent. Gabriel, who worked the area we sat in most days introduced himself and shook our hand when he took our first poolside lunch order and remembered that our daquiries were virgin without having to be reminded day to day. Our day maid made up the room every day while we were out and it was always neat and clean when we came back around 5pm. She left our scuba gear where we left it (stewn about the living room to dry, since we only packed it about every three days for the next dive day). We tipped her well at the end of the first week and got even better care the second week. With the large size of the resort the restaurants are also large. We enjoyed the variety that was available at both the breakfast and dinner buffets a few times. Food quality was at or slightly above average for this style of buffet for the Mayan Riviera, and the variety exceeded what we had experienced in the places we have stayed in Cancun over the last five years. The buffets and the order-from-menu restaurants are a bit pricier than Cancun or Playa, but as there is no competition as there is in Cancun and Playa, we was not suprised. When you are at the resort, you are at the resort and isolated from anything else. We took the resort arranged transportation to and from Playa to spend a day on the beach there and buy groceries at the Mega, which is like a Wal-mart. There is also a Wal-Mart near the Mega if you are not adventurous enough for the Mega. At fifty pesos (a little less than four bucks) per person each way, this was a deal. If you hire your own taxi it will be twice that. My only real gripe with the Mayan Palace is that if you book an excursion with someone other than the companies that Mexican Travel, the in-resort travel and excusion agency, then they do not let the non-affiliated company in to pick you up at the lobby. We booked all our scuba diving with Scuba Cancun, who we have dove with on several past vacations to Cancun and who is not the dive shop affiliated with Mayan Palace. On the evening before our first dive, we spoke to a bellman who told us to be at the lobby 20 minutes ahead of when we needed to be at the front gate and we could get a ride in the trolleys they use to shuttle people to their rooms. When we showed up in the morning, they would not take us because we had \"luggage\", our dive bags. We tried to get the first taxi at the stand to give us a ride to the gate, but he would not take us either. We ended up having to hoof it to the gate from the lobby, which is the length of the golf course, and took us nearly fifteen minutes, to walk the better part of a mile to the gate. We were fairly energized with adrenalin after discussing this with the bell captain prior to walking out, so we made good time. Crazy as it seems, at the end of the day, the gate guard alway let the Scuba Cancun van into the resort to deliver us to the lobby so we did not have to walk back in. We were glad that the working people could figure out what was best for the guests, even though management could not set a decent guest-friendly policy. All in all, we had a great time and would gladly go back.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Washington", "Title": "\u201cDo not beleive all these positive reviews\u201d", "Author": "ben888-12", "ReviewID": "UR123446314", "Content": "We visited this resort in December 2011.

They do have a Walmart but it isn't the cleanest so I suggest going to the Chedraui they have great fresh food at very reasonable prices.

I'll try to go by category to keep things in nice neat little boxes. Beware, this is a bit long. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Mayan Palace. We traveled with family -- a total of 6 adults and 1 child. It was a great week and the perfect location for a family vacation. Easy to get to, and the resort had all the services we needed. Arrival at Airport We found our Mayan Palace transport right when we walked outside of the hotel. It was easy to set up transportation via email through the concierge at the hotel, and it was no charge from the airport to the resort. We had to wait a bit for our van to fill up. In Mexican time, this is \"10 minutes.\" In real time, this is 20-25 minutes. Don't fret, there are 2 bars where you can get a beer or a snack where you wait. This is vacation after all! Friendly van drivers, fluent in English. Arrival at Hotel We booked 3 suites total for 6 adults plus a child. One of the three rooms was ready when we arrived about 1pm. The other 2 rooms were not. Check in took us about 10-12 minutes because we wanted rooms close together in a low-numbered building. Even though the resort was busy, they accommodated us and we had 3 rooms in building 6. I liked building 6 because it was far enough away from the activity of the pool, but not too far of a walk to the lobby or the pool. It was also close to several of the restaurants by the pool and the Green Break restaurant on the Golf Course. When we got to our room, we tipped the maid who was working down the hall and asked her to clean our other 2 rooms ASAP so they'd be ready. We gave her $20 and she was more than happy to do so, she was so happy about the tip! We requested a crib for one room and they were unable to accommodate us with that even though we'd asked multiple times before arrival. Luckily my sister in law had brought the pack and play for her toddler. Rooms We got a deal on the 1 bedroom suite from Living Social. $499 for the week, not bad. I was happy with the rooms. The suites were very spacious. We were on the 2nd floor. The kitchen has the essentials - small fridge, coffee maker, blender, toaster, 2 burner stove. Plenty for the week if you are just making some small breakfasts and/or sandwiches... and plenty of room to keep your cervezas cold. The living area has 2 big couches and a flat screen TV. There are about 6-7 English channels including HBO and CNN. We had a king size bed which was firm but comfortable. The bathroom is spacious as well. There are 2 sinks and 2 closets. Linens were fine, but they do use those old style hotel bedspreads -- yuck. I wish those could be updated to duvets or something a little less skeevy. Maid service was friendly and thorough. We made a few small requests throughout our stay and they were always fast to help us. The walls are pretty thin and we could hear people in the hallways, or hear people moving furniture upstairs. If you don't want to hear that racket, get a room on the top floor. Food We mostly ate at the restaurants at the resort, but we did go into Playa del Carmen to stock up on some essentials. Shop at the MEGA grocery store -- their bakery is awesome! We got bread, turkey, cheese, beer, pb, coffee, chips & salsa, fruit, etc at the store. If you buy coffee, don't worry about buying filters for your coffeemaker as the resort will provide you with those. It is $225 pesos (about $17 USD) to take a cab to Playa. We bought our cabbie a Coke and asked him to wait for us so he could take us back and he was more than happy to do that. Imported food (ex: Sargento Swiss Cheese slices) is expensive at Mega, around $6. Try to stick with some of the more local Mexican stuff for better prices. The grocery store at the resort is expensive, but not bad if you want to get some big bottles of purified water, etc there. Those are about $4 each for a 6L bottle. We brought beers to the pool in a soft sided cooler, but went to the pool bars if we wanted a mixed or frozen drink. Restaurants Overall we were happy with the restaurants. It's true - the prices are vacation prices. You pay the price of convenience. It isn't crazy expensive, but it's not cheap, either. A tip of 12% is automatically included on each bill. Gong was my favorite restaurant - great tuna sashimi. I also really enjoyed the fish tacos at the pool bar. The creperie is located inside the main building where the grocery is, and that's a fun little spot for a snack. The deli made some really nice looking salads and sandwiches for around $8 each. We tried Tramonto, the Italian, and it wasn't my favorite. I had the sea bass and it was kind of meh. We had several breakfasts at the Green Break on the golf course... the green chilaquiles are to die for! They have a nice salsa bar with 6 salsas to choose from. The Del Lago buffet was average, it was about $26 per person, not including drinks. Saturday night they had a grill set up and you could have anything you wanted grilled to order - steaks, salmon, etc. Friday night was Carribean night and they had a gorgeous grilled whole grouper that was phenomenal. Some other family members ate at Havana Moon and said they had slow service. We wanted to try the gelateria and the cevicheria but ran out of time. Service at all of the restaurants was satisfactory. A bit slow, but this is Mexico. Entertainment The show in the Del Lago buffet is pretty good. The entertainment staff at the pool is very friendly and they had a great water aerobics class everyday at 12 noon that was so fun! Also stretching/yoga on the beach every morning at 9:30 was cool. Yoga under a palm tree? Love. We went parasailing - $75 pp. It was fun, but idk if I'd recommend it. We were up for about 10 minutes. Kind of a pricey 10 minutes, and we had to wait forever for the boat to arrive. Photographers We had family photos taken by the professional photographers that work at the resort. They were so nice! The session is free and then you pay for the hi -res files on a DVD. Each file is $30 but the price goes down the more you buy. We got some great shots on the beach and throughout the resort. Pool Fab. U. Lous. What else can I say? Huge, clean saltwater pool. Always a place to sit - never a struggle to find a chair. Attentive wait staff. 2 fun swim up bars. Lots of quiet little areas. Lots of party areas too, if you prefer that. If you love to go to the pool, come to this resort. The private pool at the Grand Mayan looked so nice too! We rented the palapa for $30 on 3 days. Got the credit back in food and bev. That's the way to go. Beach Rocky, but gorgeous blue water. It's fun to walk out on the pier. Take a 10 minute walk to the south (it's a bit of an adventure) and you'll find the perfect swimming beach. Timeshare crapola Annoying. We were approached in the lobby after check in, and then we were called 1-2x a day for 5 days. We refused over and over again, but after awhile it got old. Check out Save your receipts and request your folio the night before check out so you can make sure all charges are correct. Had to call the bell hop twice to come help us with bags. Saturday AM is nuts there because everyone is leaving. Check out procedure was fast. We got a private van to the airport and it was $800 pesos for our whole family, not including tip. It was a bit chaotic getting the cab, but we got to the airport in plenty of time, even in the pouring rain. I think we'd return to Mayan Palace, but we'd like to stay in the nicer rooms at the Grand Mayan. We added it up... after the room, flights, food and drinks for the week, we spent about the same as we would for 2 people at an all inclusive. But, we also drank and ate whatever we wanted. If you needed to do this vacation on more of a budget, it could certainly be done. I will say, overall the service at the resort was really good. It's a bit slow, as it can be in Mexico, but the people were SO nice and eager to please. It made our stay really pleasant.

It was very comparable, and even a little bit cheaper than eating and drinking out at home (in Canada). The food was fabulous! We ate at Frida's for dinners and also went to the Italian restaurant once. For breakfasts we loved going to the Greenbreak (on the golf course).

Most of the time, the shuttles came often but every once in a while, you would have to wait longer than expected. Neverthless, who's in a hurry on vacation? The room was relatively nice. It was definitely clean and housekeeping was fabulous. We loved our chambermaid. She was a pleasure every evening although she didn't have to do anything for us other than more towels and chocolates. We were able to find English-speaking channels. Not a whole lot but it didn't matter as we did not spend a lot of time in the room and when we did, we hooked the iPhone to the television and watched what we had on our phone (bring your own connector). We made a couple of trips to Walmart where we picked up food items. We cooked breakfast and lunch a couple of times. Room service was nice and I enjoyed the fajitas probably more than I should have. The convenience store on the property is WAYYY overpriced so do not think you'll be able to stock up on items unless you plan to spend a lot of money. Food generally was good but a bit pricey for Mexico standards. We've stayed at other resorts ( 4/5 stars) and did not spend as much. As everyone has mentioned, the pools are fantastic.

I felt I was at a boutique hotel even though it is more family oriented, the style is very art deco and we loved all the lighted different color pools in the evening.I absolutely recommend this property !", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Parker, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cThe real scoop...\u201d", "Author": "ebehrendsen", "ReviewID": "UR121610204", "Content": "Insist on an upper floor in buildings 1 thru 6.

We made our reservations 3 days prior to our trip and Isabel, the concierge, sent us all the needed instructions for the free shuttle. We arrived 20 minutes early, and the bus was already full when we got to the shuttle stop. They immediately called for an 11 passenger van that we shared with 5 more guests. It took about 30 minutes to get to the resort. Check-in: One of the most valuable tip we got from TripAdvisor was to contact the resort concierge to request for a unit close to the pool area and the lobby. My partner was celebrating his birthday the week we're in the resort, so I mentioned that on my email. Once again, Resort concierge Isabel, replied to my email right away and told me that she will add my request on our reservation record. When we were checking-in, the front desk clerk greeted my partner Happy Birthday and put us on building 6 which is just about a 5 minute walk to both the lobby and the pool area. Requesting for a closer unit paid off, thanks for the tip. After check-in, a property clerk asked us if we are interested in listening to their timeshare sales presentation. We were going to be in the resort for a week just to relax and maybe do some sites, so we said yes to the 90 minute pitch. From some of the reviews here, they mentioned that they take the guests to the sales presentation right away. We were asked which day and time was convenient for us, and we picked the next morning. It included the brunch buffet. We knew we were not purchasing another timeshare since we already own one, we just wanted to hear what they were going to say for comparison. Virginia, the timeshare salesperson was very nice and even gave us sightseeing tips. The whole sales pitch lasted about 2 1/2 hours. From it, we received two 50-minute Swedish massages and unlimited use of the spa facilities for the day, 40% off of our Tulum & Xel-Ha excursion, and, 10% off of our resort bill. Unit condition: The rooms/ suites are really nice. Since we got a unit at bldg. 6, we just stayed in our rooms to sleep, shower & change. With regards to some reviews that say there are only 4 English TV channels, we found 15 English networks out of the 45. The beds were also very comfortable if you like medium firm mattresses. Air conditioning was no problem as well. We did the living and bedroom settings at 67 degrees and we were fine all week. Swimming Pool: They were huge and built in 3 sections. The top most pool overflows to the next, and so forth. The best part of it is that the pools are open 24 hours. The water temp is very comfortable during the day when the sun is out, and a bit cool at night since we were there during Thanksgiving week. The winds from the the ocean were really strong at night, so it adds to the water being chilly. The pool at the Grand Mayan resort was exclusive to their guests, and we were given colored wristbands to distinguish the 2 resort guests. Beach It is deffinitely very rocky. I agree with most reviews that if you want a sandy beach, take the ferry to Playa del Carmen. Bugs Tons of them at night. We brought bug spray and anti-itch creams with us. But I was still a feast for the bugs. I get bitten by bugs at home in DC anyway. Resort Store They were a bit pricey compared to the Walmart and Mega Mart at Playa del Carmen. But if you are not planning on going downtown, they have almost everything you need, even souvenirs. Tulum/Xel-ha excursion Since we took the timeshare sales presentation, we recieved discounts for the Tulum/Xel-Ha excursion. Regular price is $139, we paid $88. It's really a great deal. Includes transportation, guided tour to Tulum ruins, spending the rest of the day at Xel-Ha park that includes snorkeling gear, tubing, lockers and all-inclusive food and drinks. Their buffet \u2013 either breakfast or lunch \u2013 is really good. Restaurants - Restaurant de Lago Buffet: We stayed for a week and had dinner there about 4 times. They have theme nights and entertainment at 8pm. Breakfast is about $20. Dinner is $30. WE skipped it for Thanksgiving night because it was $60 per person. - Tramonto (Italian): The entre prices were okay, but a bit high for Mexico. Had a terrific meal from appetizer to dessert. A must\u2026 - Frida\u2019s Grill (Mexican): When we skipped the buffet on Thanksgiving night, we went here. Had the Shrimp plate and it was delicious. The desert was okay. - Balchi Pool Bar: We used a lot of the pool bar for cocktails and lunch. Pizza, salads and sandwiches are good. - Green Break (by the Golf course): Tried this for breakfast and they were okay. We were not offered an all-inclusive package when we checked in, we didn't inquire about it either. Employee service All the resort employees were very cheerful and helpful. They\u2019re always smiling and willing to help a guest in every way they can. Most of them speak English and we tried some Spanish as well. We had the same experience downtown Playa del Carmen, they were all very friendly. We just figured it their culture. Shuttle to Playa del Carmen Very convenient service. To Playa, they run almost every 2 hours from 9am. At Playa back to the resort, it starts at 2 to 9pm. They charge 500 pesos or $5. Shuttle vs taxi to airport They charge $15 per person. However, their earliest starts at 5am, and since we had a 7am flight, we wanted to leave the resort by 4:30. The very helpful concierge advised us to take the taxi. The taxi charge is $37. Overall The trip was really very relaxing and we had an excellent experience staying at th4 Mayan Palace.

This was our first visit to Mayan Palace Riviera Maya. We traveled with my son, wife and granddaughter. Stayed in a two bedroom suite. First impressions? This place was designed for folks, especially Americans, worried about violence in Mexico. It is a gated resort, manned 24/7. There are actually a few manned vehicle barriers inside the resort, and you will often see security personnel, unarmed, in pith helmets, around the elevators and stairwells. Security is not oppressive, but it is evident. Unbanded visitors WILL be noticed. You can be sure all strangers are either staff or guests. It is also an all inclusive resort. There is no need to leave the property. Clothes, groceries, tourist mementos, restaurants, golf, swimming. Everything is there, inside the walls. So if you want to eat, drink and be merry -- safely, this is the place for you. If you want to brave the outside, there are a number of tours. Good buses, great guides, pricey. We took several and were generally pleased. That said, none of the above is our cup of tea. We rented a car in Cancun and often explored the interior of the Yucatan Peninsula on our own. We like the old towns and small villages. We like nosing around and meeting new folk. And we like shopping where the local shop. I even got a haircut at a school for hair dressers while my granddaughter had her hair braided in corn rows. Four students hovering around her chattering and the teacher, like a mother hen, watching over all. 'Twas great fun -- and free. We tipped as both 'dos' were excellent. Mayan Palace Riviera Maya pros: Most everything runs from good to absolutely terrific. Read the reviews. Yes, it is spread out, but the shuttles run often and more than once the driver took us off route because we grabbed the wrong shuttle. Waiting for a shuttle is a great time to look around, chat with guests, or just relax. You're on vacation, enjoy it. Don't waste your time griping. :-) The daily maid service is terrific. Beds made, beds turned down, washrooms cleaned and towels replaced. They even wash the dishes if you're in a hurry or forget. We left daily tips and it was worth every peso!! Mayan Palace Riviera Maya Cons: Check in always seems to be a hassle at the Vida resorts. It just plain takes too long. And if there are a lot of folks checking in, the time is ridiculous. If this is standard procedure, and it appears to be, check in needs to include tables and food service -- free. Nor am I crazy about having everything charged to your rooms. I would much rather pay for each item as I purchased it. But my single greatest gripe is that none of the very fine restaurants inside the resort carry non-alcoholic wines. Heck, cruise ships carry these, why cannot an upscale resort? Mayan Palace Riviera Maya summary: We enjoyed the time and have no serious complaints about the resort; but its location is really inconvenient for the things we like to do in Mexico. While we can recommend it, we are more likely to return to the west coast of Mexico and continue our explorations there. Post Script: If you are a Red Cross blood donor in the US, and you take a tour off the resort, you will NOT be able to donate blood for at least one year.

One of us had the RCI timeshare. We split costs 3 ways so a 2 bedroom suite was well worth the cost. Pros- Very pretty resort and I've been to my share. Room was on the first floor in the building 3. I use a cane so this was a good thing. I could actually walk to the pools, beach and restaurants. The pools were awesome and the fitness program with George was the best. Pina Coladas are doubled at happy hour 11-1 and 4-6. Clean and well kept resort everywhere. Staff was amazing and super friendly. Ocean was beautiful to look at. Restaurants were all satisfactory. Loved Balachi and liked Havana moon. Best Guac I've ever had. 5 dollars for a ride to Playa del Carmen where we loved Wicky's at the beach. Did 2 days there since you really can't swim at our beach. Went to Walmart and stocked up on fruit, eggs, milk, cheese, crackers, peanut butter and coffee. Hurricane Rina was on her way. They kept us well informed and made all of us feel snug as a bug during the storm. No RCI presentation pushed on us. We refused. It was that easy. Cons- Room smelled like musty mildew and if you put on air conditioner, it was worse. Bugs were everywhere...the biting kind so bring bug spray. The water in your room on arrival is not given to you to be nice. If you drink those bottles they will appear on your bill. The beach was such a disappointment. Rocks, rocks, and more rocks. Paying for a resort you want the beach and the blue green water to swim in. Felt trapped in the resort since there is nothing you can walk to. I have stayed up the road at Dreams in Cancun. It was an all inclusive and was way better. Felt the food was costly at the restaurants in the Mayan Palace and ate the same thing every night. The TV is a joke only maybe 4 stations in English.

But it\u2019s not quite as nice as some of the folks say. But again, this is just my review, your mileage may vary. And because every circumstance is different, I\u2019ll lay out the facts. My wife and I visted October 16-21 (low season). We were on the 3rd floor of building five (a nice short walk to the beach, pool, restaurants, etc). You can read a longer review and see detailed pictures on my blog at: http://p90noir.blogspot.com/2011/11/straight-truth-on-mayan-palace-beach.html We arrived at 2:00 on a rainy (deluge) Sunday and the lobby was pretty empty. Check-in was slow for the amount of folks in there. I would hate to arrive when a lot of folks are checking in at once. We had e-mailed in advance to ask for a closer building and a room on the third floor. The person checking us in noted \u201cYes, I see you are here to celebrate your 10th anniversary.\u201d The Rooms When we first checked in to our room it smelled a little damp and musty. Once we turned the ac up a little and turned on the fans the smell dissipated. It may have just been because it was so damp outside. When we came back to our room after dinner on the first night, we didn\u2019t notice the *smell at all. The rooms at the Mayan are nice. They aren\u2019t amazing, but they are pretty good. The beds are super comfortable as long as you like a firm mattress. The linens are middle of the road. They are not luxurious but they are much better than what you get in a typical Hilton or Marriot level hotel. It\u2019s nice the have the kitchenette although we didn\u2019t do much cooking in our room. We did boil water frequently for use as drinking water. I have a pretty bad water habit and I feel guilty going through multiple water bottles per day. The bathroom at the Mayan Palace is just ok. There aren\u2019t any soaking tubs or Jacuzzis and there is just a single sink. You can\u2019t win them all\u2026 And yes, this resort is SPREAD OUT! The last time we stayed here we were in building 9 or 10 and it was a drag to be so far away from the beach and restaurants. I don\u2019t doubt that my review would be less sunny if I was writing it after having been in one of the \u201cway far away\u201d buildings. The Beach The beach is beautiful but it is rocky. If a perfect white soft sandy beach is a requirement for you, you need to scratch Mayan Palace off your list immediately. If you can handle rocks and coral with your crystalline blue water then you should be fine. But be warned, aside from a few small sections, you\u2019ll need water shoes for venturing into the ocean. It\u2019s predominantly rock and corral and there are numerous holes where you can easily trip. That said, once you swim out a little ways, there are lots of fish and other ocean life hanging out in these little holes. And if you venture out to the man-made reef (a long row of hollow concrete spheres) you can see even more fish. The ocean was pretty rough on this trip so we had pretty bad visibility but we still saw a lot of parrotfish and other pretty fish. The pier is also really cool. It\u2019s a great spot for watching fish from above. Sadly, they close it in the evening. I can only imagine how fun it would be to watch in the evening as sharks and other predators come out to hunt on the reef. Oh well. It\u2019s available to rent for a private \u201cdinner romantic\u201d but I figured my wife wouldn\u2019t appreciate me spending a romantic dinner looking for sharks. The Pools The pools are great. There is plenty of room to spread out, the temperature is great. From around 12:00-3:00 at the main pool they play dreadful music. Seriously, who wants to listen to bad techno and dance music in a tropical paradise. I. Just. Don\u2019t. Get. It. During this time, I stay on the beach, plug in the ear buds and listen to Jack Johnson, Iron & Wine, Calexico, and so on. The pools at the Grand Mayan are also great. We had no trouble using the Grand Mayan facilities with our \u201clowly Mayan Palace wrist bands.\u201d Maybe because it was the low-season. I don\u2019t know \u2013 maybe because it was the low-season? Either way, there are lots of nice, quiet, secluded spots to relax and take it easy. The Restaurants The restaurants and wait staff at Mayan Palace are great. Gong - Gong is Asian Fusion and has a good mix of Japanese noodle dishes, sushi, and other \u201cAsian\u201d food. We ate a light dinner there on our first night and it was delicious. We had steamed edamame and some various maki rolls. The Tabasco roll is simply amazing. I would never have thought to wrap a roll in grilled plantain, but it was nothing short of amazing. There is a sommelier who serves both Gong and Tramonto and he did an outstanding job of recommending a red wine that would overpower the sushi (I wasn\u2019t in the mood for sake and didn\u2019t want to splurge for champagne on our first night). We ended the meal with a dessert of grilled bananas and gingered dark chocolate. YUM. Creperia \u2013 Inside the market/gift shop, downstairs from Gong and Tramonto is a creperia. Most of the crepes are good. The Mexicana (salsa verde, roasted poblano peppers, pumpkin blossoms, etc) and the banana y nutella are out of this world! Don\u2019t miss them. Balche and Frida\u2019s Mexican Grill \u2013 The outdoor caf\u00e9 by the pool is called Balche by day and Frida\u2019s Mexican Grill by night. Our beach waiter served us everyday and the food is fine. It\u2019s not amazing, but it\u2019s not bad. The grilled fish sandwich is great. At night, when it turns into Fridas, that\u2019s another story. At that point, they begin serving some of the best Mexican food you have ever had (and yes, I have had great authentic Mexican in Mexico and the US, including going to all of the Rick Bayless restaurants). The Cochinita pibil is out of this world. It\u2019s basically little chunks of pork shoulder, seasoned with achiote, wrapped in banana leaves, and roasted until it almost melts. The green chile sauce at Fridas is some of the best I have ever had as is the mole. My wife and I joked that the chef should offer a cooking class just to teach those two sauces. Other items not to miss are the tamale appetizer (four different types of tamales) and the tacos al pastor. If you get the The Cochinita pibi, consider pairing it with a Mexican red wine. We had a nebbiolo from the Guadalupe Valley that was really good. Fridas is closed on Thursday \u2013 I\u2019m guessing to encourage people to do the \u201cMexican Feast\u201d at Del Lago. Tramonto \u2013 The Italian restaurant is also great. It was our favorite last time, and we saved it for our last night. Our biggest complaint of our trip is that we couldn\u2019t go to every restaurant twice. We saved Tramonto for our actual anniversary and we had a great meal. Everything on the menu sounds amazing and it\u2019s hard to narrow things down. The bruschetta is great. One thing we noticed all week long is that any time we had peppers (red, green, poblano, fresh, roasted, whatever) they had so much more flavor than the peppers we get at home (even more so than the fancy Whole Foods peppers). I don\u2019t think words can really describe the meal we had. Our server was amazing, our wine (a Mexican Merlot) was amazing. Everything was perfect. Havana Moon \u2013 They call Havana Moon a Cuban restaurant, but there isn\u2019t a whole lot of Cuban food on the menu. We felt that Havana Moon was the weakest of the restaurants. My wife ordered the pad thai and it was just ok. I ordered the coconut curry shrimp and they were amazing \u2013 coconut fried shrimp with a great curry dipping sauce and an asian slaw on the side. Our dessert that night was also a let down. It was called the Coco Cubico (Coconut Cube). You\u2019d think with a name like that you couldn\u2019t lose, but it was bland and boring. Also, the tables and chair at Havana Moon are not very comfortable, the tables are low and the supports cut into your legs forcing you to sit at odd angles. However, the show was amazing \u2013 mostly just because it was crazy and we didn\u2019t know there would be a show. Without much warning, a group of dancers busted in doing what could best be described as a seen from Eyes Wide Shut \u2013 scantily clad dancers with animal head costumes. Surreal! Something Fish \u2013 The name of this one is escaping me, but tucked in the pool area in the Grand Mayan is a little cevicheria. We ate lunch there one day and had the fish tacos and the smoked marlin burrito. The fish tacos were pretty good. The marlin burrito would have been good if it didn\u2019t have cheese. Then again, we might have blown our appetites on pina coladas and chips\u2026 The Burger Custom Made \u2013 hidden in Luxe is a \u201chip burger joint\u201d that\u2019s all L.A. and South Beach inspired. We never ate there, but some of the burgers sounded pretty good. Next time\u2026 None of the restaurants are \u201cMexico cheap.\u201d The maki rolls at Gong are in the $8-15 range and entrees are probably $15-40. Crepes are $8-10 (but 3 for the price of 2 from 3:00-9:00). At Tramonto, Fridas, and Havana Moon entrees are $12-50. But that $50 at Tramonto will get you a chateau briand. I threatened all week to get it. But something about eating a pound of beef didn\u2019t seem like what I wanted to do on my ten year wedding anniversary. I settled for a lighter dinner, the first cognac of my life, and a great evening. So all of these things are great, but what really holds it altogether is the staff. The staff at Mayan Palace is friendly and professional. You couldn\u2019t ask for better folks. From the housekeeping staff, to the bartenders, to the beach waiters, to the waiters in the restaurant everyone was friendly and welcoming. Oh, about the time share folks. Just say you are not interested and they will leave you alone. If you\u2019re stupid enough to do a time share pitch (anywhere) you get what you deserve. My wife and I fell for one on our honeymoon in Puerta Vallarta. That\u2019s 3-4 hours we\u2019ll never get back. But the economy was better back then and the sales tactics were probably a little lower pressure. Seriously, just say no. You\u2019re on vacation. Don\u2019t waste your precious time for some discounts and a \u201cfree breakfast.\u201d If I had any complaints, it would be about the quality of tequila and margaritas. I\u2019m in Mexico \u2013 I expect access to an insane selection of top shelf tequilas and mescals and to margaritas made with fresh juice rather than mix. The basic margaritas are made with mixto tequila and sour mix and they are not that good. I\u2019m sure we could have tracked down a better margarita but that would have required work. They really should have a tequila list and things drinks like the Paloma. But I understand that in a place that big, making drinks by hand from fresh fruit is a little difficult. Luckily I stocked up at the duty-free store and brought home a lovely selection of tequila and mescal and I can make my own drinks.

A plus for us was a $300 food and beverage credit from RCI at certain restaurants. That certainly helped the bottom line. The food at very restaurant was wonderful. Even food service was a great experience. As many had mentioned, the pools and pool service were fabulous. The shuttle into Playa del Carmen at 50 pesos each way was a great deal. We shopped at the Walmart there in preparation for the hurricane. We were in building 8, right next to the main lobby. We found this building very convenient to walk to the pool or take the shuttle to the pool/restaurants if we wanted this option. The only negative was the hard beds and pillows.

Service is super; the pool (like everyone says) is great. As far as the Time Share Push, that will always be at all the resorts. If you are not use to it get used to it. We even get it in Wal-Mart. However, we have been to three Mayan Palaces, and this was the least pushy of all, we just said no on check-in (you have to talk to them before you can go to your room), but they give you a lot of info on the hotel when you are checking in with them. They called on Monday and Tuesday but we were already gone, so they left a message. They called on Wednesday, and I said we were not interested, they did not call back. We were there when Hurricane Rina was to hit. They were very prepared, and I never felt safer. We stayed and it was not as bad as predicted. They kept us informed and all was well. We stayed the day in the room, and since we prepared with extra food, we just cooked that day (although some of the resort restaurants were open for each meal, they did close the bar early on the evening it hit). If you have 3 or more in your group use the Taxis, not the Shuttle from the Hotel. It is cheaper (the City bus is a lot cheaper). This also includes returning to the Airport. You will spend $15 a person using the hotel transportation (so you are on their schedule) and only $37 for a Taxi and you are on your schedule. With the shuttle down town if you have 2 or less people it is great, but for a couple of more dollars you can get a taxi, and do not have to worry about schedules and location, you can get one at any store in town. We went down town the first night and they had us go to the tourist area, we ate there and while the food was great, it was costly for just some tacos. Walked to the Store (Mega Mart) to get supplies for the week, and two local taco places right across the street from Mega Mart for 25% of what we paid down town. Go to mega mart or walmart and get your supplies there, cook your own breakfast, saves a ton. Make sure you do your own dishes. Restaurants we very good, we ate mainly at the Mexican Grill by the pool. And we shared 2 entrees for the 3 of us, there was plenty of food. Prices while expensive on the local side they were fine to American cost. If we wanted to go down town to eat it would cost us more for the taxi then we would save by eating off resort. For tours, book your own, do not use the Tour agency, read what people have liked on the internet, and e-mail them before you get to Mexico. The reason I say that, is if you go through the timeshare presentation, you get a lot off of many of them. In all actuality it appears they just raise the prices for those who do not attend. They also push you towards some of the ones they get more money at, but might not be the best. The problems with booking your own is you have to catch them at the front gate (and in the afternoon it is hard to get a ride to the front gate), the tour can bring you back to your lobby, but not pick you up there. Also I was thinking the guards at the front were trying to get me to go on a different tour when they wanted all my tour information, and wanted me to stay in the resort until they verified who was picking us up. They are really helping you, because others will lie to you and tell you they are your tour (then take you to some other resort for a time share presentation). So give your name and the tour operators name and your room number. They will have you wait in the resort area and get you. It does work. We used the following two tour groups for trips to the Mayan Ruins, they are both very good. They are related to each other, and give both LDS and Non-LDS tours. We went with Lemuel (www.ldstour.com) to both CHICHEN ITZA - CENOTE - EK BALAM Tour one day and a Special tour that we worked out with him to Dolphinaris (Swimming with the Dolphins, http://www.dolphinaris.com/locations/riviera%20maya.aspx ), Grand Cenote and Yal Ku (AKUMAL) Color Fish-Reef and Swimming with Giant Sea Turtles. Both trips were great and we had my 14 year old daughter with us, Lemuel, because he does have kids that age, really brought her into every conversation. While I do not think she really loves history, he got her talking about the Mayan History. The reef and Cenote (sink hole, underground rivers) swimming was breathe taking. Both trips we went to a great places to eat. I told him I wanted to go to where locals ate on the second day; he took us to this place that serves great Seafood Ceviche. It is in Tulum, looks like a dive (in US standards) but I would eat there every week if I could. The other trip we took was with www.lds-tours.com and Carlos was our guide. He took us to Tulum and Coba ruins. We loved it and he had a ton of great history information for us. His knowledge of Archeology is also very good. We loved the trip. We did this as a semi-Private trip with another couple, and did save us some money and had a great time. Another great thing is Carlos took us to a small town and we visited two different Mayan Families, it was very neat, and we enjoyed it very much. One family played us music and did a Blessing on the group. Really cool. The items that are not so good with the hotel (need I say Bad): Beds are very hard, I mean very hard. Location is a Taxi ride to get anywhere. The Mayan Palaces in Puerto Vallarta and Nuevo Vallarta have things that are very close, so you can walk and go out to eat. I would suggest that the owners of all the hotels on that strip get some locals to build a few Restaurants closer so people do not feel trapped. If you do get stuck in the room for a day like we did, the TV choice if you do not speak Spanish is limited. Overall GO THERE!!! It is great, get out of the Hotel and see the Mayan Culture.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice resort, no ocean views\u201d", "Author": "luv2travel_1313", "ReviewID": "UR119957946", "Content": "We styed in building 4 in a two bedroom.

My first encounter with this resort was as my family members and I left the airport baggage claim area of Cancun airport. We entered a wide space in the airport where a swarm of young men and women in crisp blue shirts and some of them with tan jackets appeared to be awaiting tourists. One of them represented Mayan Palace. He was actually very nice and personable, and gave us a host of information about Cancun and surrounding areas, even had the exact weather for the next two days handy in his head. He made us rather attractive offers for tours of important sites, at very reasonable prices. The \u201ccatch\u201d was that we would be invited for a free luxurious buffet breakfast at Mayan Palace, complete with paid-for taxi ride from and to our own hotel to his for the breakfast. He is doing all this, he said, to introduce us to Mayan Palace so that on our next visit we would consider staying there, and furthermore so that we would pass on our good impressions about the hotel by word of mouth to friends and family. This all sounded very sensible to us. In fact, we were surprised that they would be giving us such a good deal at their loss, with the only cost to us being the bit of time that they would walk us around their hotel and show us their rooms. Little did we know who is the one to lose out here! The next morning we proceeded to Mayan Palace. When we arrived, we pulled up into a luxurious, sprawling compound with glistening swimming pools, expansive golf course, and unselfconsciously extravagant main building. The gentleman who welcomed us and walked us through the area. He showed us a model of their various resorts, then walked us to a big hall with many roundtables, at which groups of 3 to 5 were discussing with sheets of paper spread out on the table. We sat at one of these with him. He pulled out a survey and started asking us various questions about our travelling habits: How much do we spend per year, where do we tend to go, etc. etc. By this point in time, it was already past 11am and we were all extremely hungry, so our patience was somewhat short, but we tried to remain polite and respond to the survey questions. Then he brought his \u201cboss\u201d, a rather commanding woman. After more and lengthy discussions about the resort\u2014we eventually learned this is in fact not a hotel\u2014we finally took off to the breakfast area, by now close to lunch time. Little did we know that the end of the breakfast was far from the end of the whole thing. All told, by the time Mayan Palace was through with us, we spent a total of 5 hours of the hardest hardsell any of us had received in our lives, going through a total of\u2014we later counted carefully\u2014no less than 12 agents in sequence! Each of the 12 would meet us with fresh energy after the prior one was tired him- or herself, in the meantime we were being more and more exhausted with each discussion. They were, essentially, trying to get us to sign up, there and then on the spot, for a \u201cvacation ownership\u201d, which costs anywhere from US$53,000 to 6,000, depending on the agent and the deal, as a one time cost, after which we would pay per week stayed at one of their resorts or affiliated accomodations in different parts of the world. A combination of different reasons made us stick around rather than just get up and walk out on them. In the first hour, we said to ourselves, why don\u2019t we just hear what they have to offer, even if we don\u2019t end up signing up, after all it could be interesting to learn about vacation ownership arrangements. Secondly, there was an element of socialised politeness in us. Third, the taxi to return to our hotel (which was far away) was going to be paid by them, but they had not yet given us the coupon for that, so we couldn't just walk away. Fourth, we had already paid for a sightseeing tour through them at the airport, and we had not yet received the paperwork for the tour that we had already paid for. And fifth, they really wore us out and down, and we had very little energy left for a real confrontation. After all was said and done, we did get our taxi and our tour coupon, but not before having paid for it with blood, sweat and tears, metaphorically speaking! From the time distance (i.e. in hindsight), it may seem ridiculous and irrational that one wouldn\u2019t cut out after a maximum of a half an hour of this nonsense. But all I say is: in that moment, their psycho-games are hard to beat if one did not anticipate this coming (and had not had a chance to benefit from a warning like the one this review constitutes)! Needless to say, we all had flagrantly ignored the well known universal principle: If a deal sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because with all likelihood it is. There is much more to say about the lousy tactics Mayan Palace used on us (and on other unsuspecting tourists, as I found out when chatting with some outside of he resort), but suffice it to say: Steer absolutely clear from this outfit, I would never trust it with my money or time again.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful pools and excellent service.\u201d", "Author": "Angiealford", "ReviewID": "UR119686942", "Content": "This place has many huge and beautiful pools with plenty of chairs.

That did not sit well. We asked for a room with an Ocean view and were told that none of the rooms faced the Ocean. We had been led to believe otherwise. We told the front desk that and indicated that we would like to contact RCI. The problem was this was a Sunday. The RCI rep was not there. After much discussion, we decided to stay the night and work on relocation in the morning. We retrieved our car and were taken to a room back in what they refer to as the \"Jungle\". We were a good 1/3 to 1/2 mile from anything with a ground floor room and a great view of the chain link fence running along the property line. We were told that we could not park our car at the unit. There is a central parking lot. You take a shuttle to retrieve your car and then after parking it again, you take a shuttle-the right shuttle as there are three different areas with three different color shuttles-back to your room. We were hungry and wanted a drink. We waited for the shuttle-every 15 minutes!!!!- and finally decided to walk. We found our way and were told the only bar open was the swim up pool bar. The other option was a restaurant. We viewed the Beach and the reviews are right-it is rocky. You will probably not swim there. Very large pool and the Restaurants or cafes are around it. It is tough to find your way around. The next day, we tried to contact the RCI rep and after some stalling were able to do so. Her name was Sonia and she was great. We coordinated with Veronica in Mexico City and were relocated. We had no regrets. Kudos to both of them. The rooms are large. The kitchen was modern, but part of our 2 bedroom unit was a handicapped unit that of course, we didn't need. We like smaller resorts on the beach. We like to able to open the doors and windows and hear the waves breaking. We like restaurants closeby. We like to be able to get a drink without having to sit at a restaurant table to do so.

As it was only up the road of our actual resort we thought why not? What a mistake! The rep (Juliette) completely mis-represented what was expected of us - she simply told us that we had to visit and see the resort so that 'when recommending places to stay you'll mention this one'. She even went as far as to say, 'you just show up, get the money and leave. You can't lose'. What we discovered upon arrival was that we were expected to endure a 90 minute 'presentation' which had the sole purpose of selling you a newly fashioned time share deal.

On leaving we saw our initial rep (Vicky) who completely blanked us and really showed their true colours. They even refused to take us back to the car park. Yes we got our $100 but was it worth the time wasted? No. Was the breakfast any good? Definitely not, the fruit wasn't even fresh and other options were not enticing.

The food was good, but pricey. We had the best meals at Havanna Moon (fish) and Gong (sushi). (We never made it to the Italian restaurant or the buffet, but heard the Italian place was fantastice.) The Balche restaurant had some decent mexican food, though not the best I've had, and was really better to get snacks/light lunch by the pool. There were 2 swim up bars, which were nice, but after a couple days we realized that we could save a good bit of money by buying beer/alcohol at their convenient store, and even more by buying it in Playa del Carmen. Overall, the resort was so nice that we were content just laying around the pool all week. And I have never seen such committment from resort staff to keep things clean. They even swept the side walks and washed (scrubbed with soapy water) the chairs by the pool. And all the staff were super friendly!! The beach area is gorgous to lay by, and to walk along, but definately too rocky to swim. My fiance and I aren't big on swimming in the ocean, so it was fine for us. I highly recommend going into Playa Del Carmen, at least 1 day. (Note: We ate lunch at \"100% Natural,\" along 5th, for lunch, and believe that this was the source of a food-born illness that my fiance got the last 2 days. He works for the Health Department, so is pretty familiar with the different types and sources of such illness). The shuttle is $5 (if you pay with pesos it's a little less), from the resort. And there are gorgous beaches there, for swimming. My main word of caution, it that Riveria Maya is a time-share resort. We decided to \"hear\" the talk, since they offered us 1000 peso credit and %10 off our room charges. Overall, I believe we got about $100 credit. They told us it would take 90 min, but it was over 3 hrs. The sales person goes to breakfast with you (a free breakfast buffet, also given as an incentive), in order to befriend you, then afterwards, you they use 1 manipulate sales technique after another. The first price was $53,000, ($2,400 deposit/closing cost, and $600 monthly payments),for a 2-bedroom time-share, with lots of options to \"turn in\" weeks for credits. They act like they are fine with you saying \"no,\" but keep coming back with lower offers. The last offer was for $9,900, $179 monthly payments,to \"take over\" a 1-bedroom, from another couple that reportedly could no longer afford thier payments (they even had a paper with the names on it). Seriously?! When we said no to that, they actually got mad, but still sent us on to one \"manager\" after another, to keep trying. I have never seen so many \"managers.\" It wasn't until we got mad, that they let us leave. My fiance was furious, and even though I was happy to get the room credit, I will never do that again. Oh, they also offered us discounted prices on tours (eg., Xaceret, Explore, ruins, etc.), at 40-50% off, but if you go to Playa del Carmen, and tell the tours salesman along 5th, they will match it or go below that price.

It's first rate, with terrific amenities and a spectacular pool. It's in the middle of a long strip of other great resorts, but you are away from Cancun and big city life. However, Cancun to the north or Playa Del Carmen and Cozumel to the south are only a short trip, making this a great base of operations for a trip. The only downside is that, like many of the resorts along the coast, they are laid out in very long tracts of land that extend from the ocean toward the entrance. At this resort, you could have to walk past 10 buildings to get to the beach. We don't mind the walk, since it's along a paved, winding tropical trail. It's especially pretty at night. But if you're at the pool or beach and need to go the room for things, it's a hike. If you're spending most of your time at the resort, ask for a unit closer to the pool/beach. If you'll be heading out for adventures most days, ask for one closer to the front/lobby so you will be closer to your car. We've asked to have our room changed, and they always accommodated us.

Yes you will get approached to \"Attend a presentation\" but you are not required too. You will be offered discounts, drinks, etc.. Just kindly decline and continue on to enjoy your first class stay. Don't do the presentation, it will waste your day and the discounts are not worth losing a day here. They will call you once a day, just don't answer the phone. Now our room was fantastic. Very roomy and very clean. The couches are very comfortable and you could easily have someone sleep on one. They do not pull out. You will have 2 sinks and 2 closets. The kitchen will have a small refrigerator, sink, dishes, silverware, small microwave, and a 2 burner stove with pots and pans. The maid service is impeccable. The employees are all about you so be ready to get spoiled. If you fly into Cancun you can arrange to have a shuttle pick you up. I highly recommend this. Also they take US dollars and Peso's here but I would go ahead and convert you US money to Peso's right at the airport at the money exchange, it is free. This will save you money. Now for the Hotel. You will have several restaurants to choose from. They are all quiet good and the service it top notch. I recommend the Green Break for breakfast for sure. Tramonto is a fabulous place to eat and you must eat here at least once during your stay. There are trams that run all over the property so you can get around without walking too much. The Pool! It is huge! absolutely huge! You will have plenty of space to relax. You can spend to whole day here. Plenty of food and drinks available. There are cabanas you can use for free during the off season, Sept through Nov. after that they run about $30 per day. These are the way to have a full pool day. The beach is full of palm trees so you can get sun and shade also. The breach is a little rocky but pretty. No real swimming in the gulf here. If want some beach swimming you can take the shuttle to Playa Del Carmen just down the road and you will find a very pretty beach to swim in. But with the size of the pool, you won't need the gulf to swim in. They do offer water sports, jet-skis etc. Since the rooms are equipped with small kitchens, on your first day take the shuttle to Playa Del Carmen to get some basic groceries. This will save you some money on snacks and drinks so you don't have to eat out everyday.I recommend Mega Mart over Wal-Mart. It is MUCH nicer and easier to shop in. If however you don't want to go downtown then you can shop in the Hotel at the small grocery they have on site. It is more expensive however. The shuttle picks up every 2 hrs and you can walk to Mega mart from the drop off. It is not that far. The shuttle cost is $5 per person each way or 50 pesos which is actually less than $5 US so you can see how converting to Pesos will save you money. If you want to explore more you can rent a car and go further south to Tulum and see some Mayan Ruins.

I went with a group of 7 family members, which they had booked this hotel, so I couldn't get out of it. It wasn't bad at all. Since it's a time share check in was time consuming. These grounds are HUGE! Our building was the closest to the lobby, and the furthest from the beach/pool; but it worked for us because everyday we were out of the resort at an excursion. I only had time to get in the pool once before the rain came at the end of the week and the end of my vacation. A tram will drive you to the pool and wait isn't long. They come around every 10 mins. Worth the wait cuz the walk is long. The beach is rocky and not pleasant for good swimming. Take a cab to Playa Del Carmen for a great beach. Just like you see it in a magazine. Service at the poolside was friendly and the wait for my snacks was only 15 mins. The drinks were well served, not watered down. The adult pool with the bar should not have any kids around, but brats always manage to get in and the staff doesn't remove them. I wanted to relax without the yelling of these little people who annoy me, but it was unavoidable. I wasn't pestered by sales calls. My requests were promptly serviced. Every personal item in the room was not moved, nor went missing. The maids were very polite and friendly. The suite was well equipped with a kitchen and dishes. No comp coffee, it is a time share after all. Buy your own groceries. The maids clean your room in the day and return in the evening to prepare your beds. So when we'd return from our long day out our beds were made so we can just get in. Chocolate kisses on the pillows too. Of course you may request to have this helpful gesture skipped if you'll be in your room every evening and you want to do it yourself.

We really enjoyed our stay - the pool complex is incredible and there were always plenty of beds available. Definitely on our list for possible return. As soon as we finished check-in we were nabbed by a guy offering a breakfast etc to attend a timeshare presentation. The only things that made us accept were the other inducements - 500 pesos to our account and 10% of everything we spent while we were there. So off we went (4 adults) to a very good breakfast, after which son and girlfriend headed off to the pool while we did our \"duty\". We weren't interested in their offer which started out at $150,000 USD for a 1 week share in a 2 bed apartment (we are very happy in our own membership of Club La Costa), and by the time we finished (with rep number 5!) we were being offered 5 weeks over 5 years for $700 USD, which might have been tempting but rep No 2 (manager!?) had put us off with his attitude. Not to worry, we went off and had a great time. We asked for a print out at the end of the first week to see how are spending was doing and noticed a couple of errors (I'm an auditor and wife's an accountant so not much gets past us!!) for example 2 bottles of water charged to our room when only 1 was used. This was pointed out and corrected but the credit for use of a palapas (comfy bed by pool - charge $30USD but refunded if you spent that much in pool bar or restaurant) would be sorted out at check out. Same with the 10% discount. Friday night I trundled along with pesos and credit card and asked for the bill. Version 1 had no discount, no 500 pesos credit and no credit for the palapas. Queries were resolved and credits raised to the account. Version 2 still no discount. Queried this and a different print out was produced showing individual charges and discount applied. First thing noticed was discount was on meal/drink prices before 15% tip added - fair enough. Next thing was no discount on water sports. Discounted prices applied they said, even though the water sports guys had told us that discount would be applied at the check out. I asked about the 500 pesos credit that wasn't there and was told I had to see the reps in the morning. As it was nearly midnight I refused to sign this form and pay up (discount being offered was approx 2,100 pesos, I had calculated at approx 2,600 pesos up to Thursday night) Back at the aprtment I checked the prices for the water sports activities - we had been charged the standard rate. In the morning I returned to reception and found the rep guy, who agreed that he had promised the 500 pesos credit, so that was applied. After much chatting away between themselves we also got he 10% discount on the water sports. The edn result was a total credit of over 3,500 pesos (about \u00a3200) to our account which wouldn't have been applied if we took the first offer to settle our bill. A bad finish to an otherwise greta holiday. Another thing to watch out for is that activities are piced in US$ but charged to the account in pesos.

I would like to shed some light on all the rumors about this place and clarify what is true and what is not. The Mayan Palace mainly rents rooms to timeshare onwers/buyers. More than likely you will be asked to attend a presentation if you don't already own a timeshare at the resort. My opinon is that this is perfectly fine. You can always say no. We agreed at check in to attend a presentation the next day. At about 8:30 in the morning we met in the lobby and where taken to the Del Lago breakfast buffet. Normally the buffett cast $25 a person but we got it comp'd because we were taking the presentation. Our sales rep (Alena i believe her name was) was kind and curteous the entire time. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time eating breakfast with her , and enjoyed her guided tour of the resort grounds. When the presentaton was over and the time came for the \"hard sell\" she made it clear to us that there was no pressure to buy, and indeed we never felt like we HAD to purchase anything. For attending the presentation which took a total of 3 hours (comp'd breakfast included) we were given 10% off our room charges, up to 50% all the tour and exscursion packages offered through the resort (Chichen Itza, Tulum, Scuba, Xcaret), and finally we were given a bottle of tequilla. To be honest if your going to be there for a week or so its worth it to take the presentation. You get a guided tour of the grounds and all the swag at the end. Our rooms were always neat and orderly. Our maid did enter the room once while we were sleeping, but this wasn;t her fault. We didn't hear her knocking and we didn't put the \"do not disturb \" sign on the door. Upon seeing us alseep she quitely and curteously excused herself from our room. One thing to note is that if you have a full kitchen in your room it costs about $12 a day for the maids to wash dishes for you. You might wanna buy a scrubber because it about the only thing missing from the kitchen. The pools were all enjoyable. If you have kids then swimming during the day is goingto be a blast. If you don't have kids and want to avoid them I would suggest swimming early before 11am or 12pm or swimming late in the evening after 8pm or 9pm. The pool water is not very cold though. Its actually quite warm even at night. I personally didn't mind this, but if your looking for a cold dip you should consider another resort. The bars and resturaunts leave much to be desired. The food is so-so. Nothing to write home about in my opinion. The drinks are quite poor. The problem is that the bartenders don't use real juice for any of the mix drinks opting instead for the pre-mix bottles. Some people like not being able to taste the alchohol, and for everything to taste like expired candy. To each their own I guess. The staff were always eager to help, and I made sure to tip them accordingly. You have to keep in mind that not all of them speak fluent english. S oif your asking for help and aren't clear and cordial you probably won't get the best service out of the staff. Overall our stay was an enjoyable experience.

We were told that we booked a standard room and these things are only included in a suite, even though it was listed under the amenities for our room. We asked why it was listed under the amenities on our room confirmation, the only answer we got was \"sorry don't know what to tell you.\" They were very rude and not helpful at all. Like I said above the hotel is spaced out so far that it is a significant walk if you want to go from your room to the hotel lobby or pool. The hotel offers shuttles from all of these places. This wouldn't be so bad if the shuttles were running constantly, however, it is usually a minimum of a 15 minute wait to get a shuttle, if not longer.

It was always under construction, no good beach, mud, lots of mosquitos, very expensive. This year, I thought I give it another try and was pleasantly surprised how much it had grown and improved! From the beginning: At the airport, I was able to easily find the Shuttle (Millenium) that takes you to the Resort. Once we got there, the check-in took quite a while and it was 11pm with minimal people in line! They did give us a small bottle of water while we were waiting...When we finally got our room... we found out that it was in building 14... there are at least 21 buildings! The higher the number, the farther you are from the pool/beach area. I took my Mom who is in a wheel chair and transporting her was going to be very difficult. They had a shuttle to get around but it's hard to get the wheel chair up and down... the driver took me back to the Lobby and they \"finally\" changed us to a closer building. They said they had nothing but were able to find something better.... thank Goodness! The room was clean and plain... I seemed to remember a little more decorations but this time all it had were some lamps, nice flat screen TVs and some pictures on the walls. The kitchen was adequate with enough plates, pots, silverware. I never heard any noise from the other rooms... so this is a plus (good insulation is always welcomed!) There is a balcony but only to stand on... it faces a \"jungle\"... none of the bldgs face the ocean... they are sideways to protect them from bad weather. I had a one bedroom and was glad I had 2 airconditioners... one for the living room and one for the bedroom. We must have gone to bed around 2am... at 7am I received a call from \"Sales\" about a package they had for us (of course they didn't identified themselves as Sales)... I told them if they saw what time they were calling... she didn't get it... I said we were sleeping. At 8am, the phone rings again... the same girl... I disconnected the phone. The next day, the phone rings at 8am... I pick it up with a \"sleepy\" voice since I was still sleeping and they hung up... not nice... I don't have anyone else that would be calling so it must have been Sales again! When I woke up, I called them and asked not to call me. Well, the next day... again it happened so I kept the phone off the hook. Sales is terrible. Now for the better part... the pool is outstanding... I should say \"pools\" because it winds around 4 times... it has an infinity side, stepping platforms, shallow area, fountain, little waterfall, etc, etc... There were about 2,000 people there and I always had privacy in the pools. I didn't feel I was with everyone else and the kids were in another area and they could scream as much as they wanted and I didn't hear them... this is a family resort so the kids come in all sizes but they are all in control! There are 2 pool bars and happy hour (2for1) is 11am-1pm... a little expensive and the drinks are just okay. I never felt crowded at the pool bar, I could always find a seat. There are cabanas you can reserve and there is no charge if you consume $28 a day... no problem if you order a meal. The cabanas have a nice size bed with pillows and there is service available if you need to change the sheets, pillows, etc. To get to the beach, you can walk over the pool through the stepping stones which is very nice. There are lots of lounge chairs at the shore and good service... they also have canopy beds close to the shore but not in front of the water. I am a beach person so not having a smooth entrance to the ocean bothers me but if you wear shoes, you can walk over the tide pools and get out to the ocean. The kids and some adults loved the tide pools because there is some sea life (not dangerous) and little fish. Maroma Beach is 10 minutes away, however, and it's the nicest public beach in the area (IMO)... you pay a minimal fee ($5 ?) and you can have a lounge chair, etc. I didn't go there but did watch the waves while sitting under palm trees. They also had a small pier with a gazebo lookout at the end that was very nice and romantic. I ordered food several times while at the cabana and went to the restaurant by the pool and the food was very good (IMO)... close to $10-$15 range for quesadillas, sandwiches, salads. From 5:30pm-6:30pm I went to the Wine Bar for their happy hour and the wine was okay but I loved the surroundings! Very nicely decorated in the middle of an Asian and an Italian restaurant... the view to the pool area was lovely. Did not try the Asian or Italian restaurants. Did go to the Lago Restaurant and the Havana Moon... food was also good but the mosquitos had the best meal. It was very uncomfortable and I didn't bring repellant. At the Havana Moon, the waiter did spray me but it was too late. The Havana Moon restaurant had a wonderful sunset view so I did try to enjoy appetizers while the mosquitoes ate. They also had live music and dancing. I had a kitchen so I did have breakfast and other light meals in the room... they will take you to Playa del Carmen for $5 each and you can go the the grocery stores (Walmart, Chedraui, Mega) to buy food, etc. On Thursday, they have a Mexican Fiesta which was very entertaining and all you can eat buffet... I think it was worth the $70... there must have been at least 10 costume changes and they kept bringing out the drinks. The showers were fine, I had enough shampoo and not those little bottles... the maid service was nice... they decorated the beds and had turn down with chocolates. TV reception was also good with several international channels (CNN, FOX, CineMax, HBO, TVE from Spain, another one from Italy, etc). There is wifi in your room but at $7 an hour, $99 a week... I was surprised at how much it had grown... the Grand Mayan and the Mayan Lux... more restaurants, a deli with latte, sandwiches, desserts, gelato, etc. The palm trees are beautiful and the \"jungle\" outside the bldg is tamed... There is a walkway to the pool/beach area in front of the bldgs that is full of plants (I call it the jungle), it is pretty thick and it is sprayed every day so the mosquitos are under control... last few times I went i was more of a swamp. This time it was much better. In the morning, you can hear the birds that live in the trees and some come to the balcony and we loved watching them (they were colorful with yellow, red, brown feathers) Beforeleaving, I requested a meeting with the \"Sales\" supervisor and of course that person was on vacation, etc... I said I would stay until they came back and that I wasn't leaving without speaking to them... I am not going to go into detail but you can imagine how the conversation went and it wasn't very nice. Somehow, the person in charge called me on the last day and I told them how annoyed I was with \"Sales\" She apologized which is something I couldn't get out of the other people that had called. Overall, I would say that it was good and I would return... just to see if Sales has changed... if I go and get the same treatment... I will not return, it is not worth it... I do not enjoy their hard core sales practice... I've attended 2 of their presentations to get the \"free stuff\" and it was not worth the $100. I did get to relax, sleep in because the curtains are good/dark and the walls are thick, watched a couple of good movies, enjoyed the water and soaked up some sun!", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cLove the pool area\u201d", "Author": "pshaffer", "ReviewID": "UR115874973", "Content": "As you've read in the other reviews, the resorts in the Riviera Maya area are spread out and secluded from each other, so it's best to rent a car.

There are always open chaise lounges and you have your choice of about 7 different pools. There are swim-up bars, wait service, and a poolside restaurant with take-out service, so you're never at a loss for food and drink. During the evenings the pool area transforms into a low-key entertainment zone with live music, artisans, a few vendors, and a film for the kids. I usually don't hang out at hotels during my vacations, but I found myself spending three to four days enjoying the pool area. It is a large resort, so prepare to walk a lot. Our unit was quite a walk from the pool area. This is irritating when you forget something in your room! But the walk was pleasant. We were usually surprised by the local iguanas, who enjoyed sunning on the sidewalk. The big surprise for me was the fitness club--it was far better than I expected.

That being said, we never looked into other hotel options, and I am approaching this review from a usage standpoint as opposed to a cost-for-value view. We also did not participate in the time-share pitch, but we saw many un-smiling people working with salespeople while we were there. PROS: Nice pool! Rooms were spacious, well maintained and had most of what we needed for the week's stay. Room service was tasty, but kind of expensive. The beach is great for snorkeling (my boyfriend spent several hours near the pier's artificial reef- he said it was the most diverse snorkeling of the trip). Meal at the restaurant was very good. Staff was very friendly. Free shuttle from the airport. CONS: Can be a long walk from the hotel room to the pool/beach. Most things seemed very expensive; the grocery shop was obviously stocked in such a way as to encourage people to eat at the restaurants. The beach is not for swimming- it is rocky and killer on bare feet. The walk to the main gate is kind of late and the golf carts don't run often enough. No free shuttle back to the airport (Taxi cost: $37 usd) TIPS: Use the Colectovo busses (local public transport from Cancun to Playa)! The hotel may discourage this, but we used it nearly every day and saved TONS! Example: the hotel shuttle to Play for two people, round trip will cost you $20usd. Using the colectivo, the same trip cost $7usd, and we didn't have to be on anyone's schedule but our own. This WILL require you to go to the main gate (a bummer golf cart system or walk- we timed the walk at 15 minutes) and CROSS THE HIGHWAY. This could be dangerous, and if we had kids, or difficulty walking, or lots of gear/bags, I would NOT feel comfortable crossing this road. But for people not in these kinds of situations, its totally worth it. TIP 2: The tap water is not safe for drinking, but the ice is just fine. Bottled water is heavy, expensive and makes plastic waste. Melting ice is easy and free! We simply filled the provided pitcher, let it melt and saved it in our hard water bottles. Easy! Cheap! TIP 3: A nice beach for swimming can be found about 30 minutes of walking to the north (towards Cancun). We walked one day and it was nice to actually get to really get in the sea and play in the waves.

We absolutely loved ths place, from the check in to the room, from the ocean to the pool, everything was top notch. Listen I've read hundreds of these reviews trying to decide wheater or not to go some where. The only thing that really matters is if you liked it and we certainly did. I'm going to try and break down a few things for you and hope it helps out. The Beach, Okay it ain't the greatest if you are looking to do body surfing, but it is beautiful to look at. As you will read in other reviews a mile up or down either way and you can swim to your hearts delight. The Pool, GRADE A+ one of the nicest I have ever seen. Plenty of chairs and never had problems getting towels (read that a lot). There was some early chair saving, but we always found a place to land. If you want one of the fancy beds by the pool with a cover its best to reserve it the night before. There is a $30 charge but you get that back in food and drink credits at the pool. Speaking of food and drinks, the pricing is mid range, we averaged about $65 to $85 a night at diner. The drinks can get quite expensive but nothing you want find in any other private resort. The Havana Moon Restarant is a must. Shuttle, yes, they have a shuttle that will take to you to Playa every other hour for about $5 bucks each and pick you up as late as 9:00 pm. A taxi is going to run you about $40 round trip to playa. Take the shuttle, meet some new folks and have fun. You want to try out a place called Karen's on 5th Ave. Great luch specail and food. Last thing and its the only negative thing. If you book an excursion outside the resort they will make you go to the front gate to be picked up ( and that is one heck of a walk first thing n the morning) They do have a free shuttle that will take you on the hour after 8:00 am or you can pay $5 for a cab to take you.

It rained for the first few days of the week. We enjoyed the stay and have a few tips for future travellers to the resort. One, expect the unexpected and you would have a good time. You may be given conflicting information by different people about products and services available at the resort. So cool your frustration and let it go. It's a day to day thing in Mexico and there's nothing you can do about it. This time they didn't have any phone cards \"available\" for purchase to call the US. It sucks b/c it would cost you 7-8 dollars/min to call the US! The internet service was down for a couple of days and you may feel like you were on location in the movie Castwaway. LOL. Two, when it rains, it pours. But it doesn't last long and keeps the temperature cooler than normal. Since we couldn't spend time at the beach, we went on a tour to Chitchen Iza with EasyTours. (We were approached by Jorge at Commercial Mexicana in downtown Playa. They have a guerilla operation with a bunch of small tour vans that pick you up at the resorts with less time wasted - compared to a big tour bus where it would take a lot of time for them to fill up b/c they have to go to every single resort!!!!) Anyway, we paid $59.00/pp for the tour. It was a whole day tour. Third, the beach as other reviewers have said is nothing to write about. But if you walk north (turn left facing the ocean) for about 10-15 min, you will get to a really nice beach from another resort (Valentin Imperial Maya). Very nice and isolated from vendors and not crowded. The only thing negative is that you can't use their beach chairs...But hey it's a lot better than having to travel to other places just for the beach. Fourth, the Brio spa is nice for relaxation. It costs $100 pesos/pp to enjoy the outdoor jacuzzi and indoor saunas. We thought it was nice and offered great service.. Fourth, the bed pillows were very hard, so bring your own if possible. We had to improvise using the blanklets... Hope this helps.

Unlike many big resorts, which are built in a horseshoe shape around the pool, Mayan Palace is built in one straight line with the pools at one end.

The grounds were connected to some sister resorts and were well maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had a suite in building 13 and the room was large enough but was a little plain. The kitchenette was adequetely stocked, but I've seen better. The view from our 2nd floor room was of a wall of jungle, but we spent little time in the room. Getting down to the beach and pool was not as bad as some of the other guests made it sound. It was a good 5 minute walk from our room, but the grounds were so nice that it was not a big deal to us. Also, you could wait at the lobby for a few minutes to take the provided shuttle, which we did when it rained once. The food was a bit pricey but about what one would expect at a more secluded resort. I felt the drinks were expensive but I bought them anyway. Also I brought a small softsided cooler down to the pool with my own drinks. There were some no Cooler signs around but nobody made a fuss about it. The pool itself was pretty awesome! It was the largest pool I've ever seen, and it was clean and warm. The beach area was well maintained and had adequate shade areas. The beach itself was rocky and not good for swimming. We when into Playa Del Carmen to swim at the beach and shop one day. I attempted to snorkel at the resort but the surf was too high and I didnt want to risk getting cut up on the rocks. To get to Playa we took the controlled taxi from the Mayan Palace lobby. This costs 50 pesos per person and in my opinion is well worth the little bit extra than taking the colectivo at the entrance. Return trip Is the same price. But this service is on a schedule every 2 hours and some planning is necessary. You can take a taxi to or from town at negotiable rates between $11 and $3 US dollars per person per trip. Haggle your taxi fare! It seems to be expected. The cheapest we got was $6 US for the two of us to town and 40 pesos for both from Playa to entrance of the Mayan Palace on a colectivo. The Mayan was a nice trip all around and I would recommend it to those who have a little more money to spend on a trip than I had, but still a beautiful resort, with friendly staff.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laredo, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "TheBlueRey", "ReviewID": "UR113564645", "Content": "We stay on a 2 bedroom, it a very good room.

My wife and I went with two friends who were very sceptical about Mexico, preferring Barbados as their main holiday but we persuaded them as I had the offer of a Grand Suite on a timeshare owned by a friend of mine who wasn't using it this year. I had my doubts I'll be honest as their website did not inspire me and the pictures looked very poor, but what a surprise when we arrived ! The place is just a delight, from the moment we booked inthe staff and facilities were excellent and all very helpful. I had done my home work and requested a room near to the main complex and pools, which I have to say is essential but you must ask! Going in Early May you miss the big crowds of Americans/Canadians as they holiday earlier. This to us was a bonus as we were never rushed or crowded at any stage and service was always excellent. There are numerous restaurants catering for all tastes some a little pricey, Tramonto springs to mind, but the food is always good quality and Wine can be a little pricey. The staff help make this place, they are just a delight, nothing is too much trouble. The facilities are excellent, do not be put off by some of the other comments, the Gym/Leisure/treatments building is as good as anywhere we have staye, spotless and fantastic to use. Pool is just a delight and huge but you have to get up to get beds especially the big ones under cover. this sdespite the rules which forbid \"towel booking\" One word of warning, if you like quiet do not get too close to the Pool bars at lunchtime onwards as the drinkers, usually American 20-30 somethings get loud and legless until closing time, we saw several being carried out worse for wear! My only other criticism is that the resort tackily puts on a drinking competition in the pool once a week, this to us, and we are not non-drinkers at all, is not a good idea and sets the wrokng example to follow for the many young people in the pool area. Played Golf too on what must be one of the toughest Par 3 courses ever, a real test but afterwards cool beers and great food in the Green Break, a tip have breakfast here, you get served your food at the table! I agree the resort is someway out of town but you can get to Playa del Carmen in 20 minutes by cab and Cancun about the same the other way.

As you can tell I was very satisfied. Before you travel, make sure to reserve the complimentary shuttle service from the airport to the hotel. The shuttle is just outside the terminal doors, past the herd of taxi drivers with hotel signs. Do not stop at the \"information\" booths at the airport. They are all timeshare employees. The check in was prompt. We were placed on building 13. The rooms are excellent. Tile floors make all the difference. No need to worry about soggy, stained carpets you often encounter in US hotels. Room service will clean, wash dishes, and make your bed daily. The one bedroom suite is literally bigger than my 2 bedroom condo. The pool is huge, and there are several activities (stretching, beach voleyball, water exercise, dance lessons, etc) during the day. Don't forget to sign up for the bike tour to get a feel of the property. The week we were there (April 30-May 7) palapas were free. Otherwise you need to reserve one for about $30 dollars/day. The price is credited towards food and beverages at the pool. The pool is family friendly. Down side is that there is no nightlife at the resort. The service throughout the resort is excellent. All purchases are billed to the room and a 13-15% tip included. The hotel does not give a good exchange rate. The dollar to peso rate was $1 - 10.35 pesos versus $1 - 11 pesos at playa del carmen. The shuttle service to playa del carmen runs throughout the day and it costs 40 pesos/person each way. The hotel has a minimart were you can purchase bulky items like water jugs and bread. For other purchases go to playa del carmen. Food at the hotel is tasty and affordable. Sandwiches/burgers cost about $10-12, pizza $13-15, and dishes $16-25. The make your own taco at the poolside restaurant was big enough for 2 people. Fried calamari and the pizzas were my favorites. At your checkout the bill will be in pesos. We kept track of our spending and exchanged money in playa del carmen before check out. If your flight home leaves late into the day and you want to sneak in another day at the beach, remember to ask the concierge for a complimentary room where you can take a quick shower and change clothes. They usually have such free rooms on the main desk building.

We were pleased with the experience and look forward to returning. Overall the locals were friendly and appreciative. Our stay at the Mayan Palace was not different. It is a large complex. We had a one bedroom with partial kitchen. The room was nice and it was cleaned daily. The air conditioner worked well and the bed was fine. We tried to get a room in building 1-8, but no luck. We ended up in building 11. This building was a bit of a walk to the pool and beach. I have an office job and sit at a computer all day, so the walk was fine with me. The pool and cabanas were awesome! Take advantage of the cabana and enjoy the excellent food and beverage service. In general the staff was very friendly and helpful. You pay to use the cabana, but the amount you pay goes toward food and beverages while using the cabana. The cabana reservations fill up quickly. You can only make reservations the day of, or the day before. We spent a day at the pool, then the following day off the property. This made it difficult for us to make reservations. We lucked out a couple times. The drinks were expensive, but not small as expected. The food was good, especially the club sandwich. While at the pool we met a many friendly travelers from all over the world. We spent a bit of our time with a wonderful family from Belgium and have already connected with them since returning home. We highly recommend taking the time to enjoy those around you. Like many other reviews state, the beach is very rocky. We read the reviews prior to going and were prepared to spend our time at the pool. We did enjoy walking and visiting the beach. I like the contrast of the rocks, the water and sky, it makes for great pictures. There were palapas, chairs and volleyball at the beach. A couple nights the staff set up romantic dinners for couples at the end of the pier. We took the taxi to town (about $22 one way). The resort does offer a shuttle service for less, but it leaves at specific times. We spent the day shopping, enjoying tacos and Coronas. We stopped at the Mega to get groceries and took a taxi back to the resort. Store workers were very aggressive, but we appreciated their enthusiasm to work. We booked a couple tours from a travel agent in town. We saved a little money using this agent. The Mayan Palace doesn\u2019t allow outside travel groups to pick you up at the lobby, so we had to walk to the outside gate to be picked up. We decided next time we would just work with the resort agents. We spent a day traveling about 2-3 hours one way to Chichen Itza. It was a nice, but long and hot day. We recommend everyone go there once. Dress for the hot weather and wear a hat and sunscreen. They do sell hats for about $5, so buy them there. On the way back we stopped for dinner and at a cenote. After spending several hours in the heat, swimming in the cenote was a perfect finish to our day. We also spent a day at Xel Ha National Park. The scenery was beautiful. We tubed down the river. They call it a lazy river, but there was nothing lazy about it. We also snorkeled. The tour was all inclusive and included all the food and drinks you want. Overall we enjoyed both trips. If you stay at the Mayan Palace, consider booking your trips through the resort. The travel service we used did not provide a lot of guidance. Throughout our entire trip we only ran into one local that was not friendly or helpful. Unfortunately, that person was the driver of one of our tour vans. He did not appear to like tourists. There was even a sticker in his van saying not to disturb the driver. No one welcomed us or introduced themselves to the passengers. While on the tours we had to ask where we were going and how long we would be at each stop. The majority of the time the driver was the only worker with us. It was a little confusing. Overall it was a great trip! We would definitely go back to the Mayan Palace. The only thing to make it better would have been a couple more days.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paramus, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on Earth!\u201d", "Author": "TracyZ3165", "ReviewID": "UR105659685", "Content": "Please don't believe any of the negative reviews you may have read.

The only reason I was staying here was because I had gone through the timeshare presentation the year before (yes, they nabbed me at the airport) and, at the end, I bought a $2,000 vacation membership package with HSI (which I so regretted) which allowed me one 1-week stay at the Mayan Palace for $300. I went in with a bad attitude and was prepared to be ripped off at every turn. I made sure that I had all my ducks in a row and all the paperwork they required so that nothing could go wrong, especially since I was traveling alone, arriving late at night, and was warned by many people not to go to Mexico because it was so dangerous these days. FROM THE AIRPORT: When I arrived at the airport, they were right there waiting for me, calling my name. It was such a pleasant surprise that someone in Mexico knew my name! Prior, I had made the reservation for the free shuttle service to the hotel and had my documentation with me. I had to wait about 30 minutes while they waited for someone else, but they never showed, so I was shuttled to the resort by myself. The ride to the resort seemed short, only about 25 minutes. CHECKING IN: I arrived at the resort at around midnight and had to wait about 20 minutes for them to wait on me at the front desk. When they did, I asked if I could have a room close to the resort since I was alone - and I was prepared to \"grease the wheels\" a little for it. Two different girls kept checking the computer then finally told me that there weren't any rooms available at the Mayan Palace - so they were putting me in the Grand Mayan! The said that it was much nicer. They actually put me in the Grand Mayan Jungle, Building 9, which was far away but was all they had so I had no choice. They shuttled me over and got me to my room and it was AMAZING! I just loved it! Big, clean, nice bed, nice bathroom with lots of nice products, jacuzzi, nice deck overlooking the golf course. I was very HAPPY! FIRST DAY: I woke up in PARADISE! I was so happy that I had gotten there safe and sound, and had been lucky enough to get such an amazing room. I went out to explore and walked to the beach which, as everyone says,wasn't nice. You could lie on the beach but could not go in the water because it was so rocky. So I walked the 20 minutes north to find the \"nice\" beach. It was nice enough, but was a bit of a walk and you had to go through a rocky area on the beach to get there. THE GROUNDS: The grounds were spectacular! I felt like I was living in the Garden of Eden! 2 acres, I think. I would get up early in the morning and walk for an hour or two, just exploring. Even though they had shuttle service to the main areas, I often chose to walk it just for the exercise and the beauty. I had no problem with having my building so far away. If I wanted a shuttle, they would be one within minutes. THE POOL: Of course the pool was spectacular too! So big and nice and clean! I only went in it once though. I'm a beach person, not a pool person. But the pool area was packed without a chair to be found. THE BEACH: Nice for lying on. Couldn't go in. THE RESTAURANTS: Were all good, and decently priced. There were enough options that you could choose to spend a lot of money or not. You could make it work for you. I loved the breakfast buffet and the GreenBreak which was only about $12 but they did away with it on the last day of my trip. Said that they weren't making enough money. THE SERVICE AND THE PEOPLE: Everyone was friendly and nice. There was a nice mix of people, very family oriented. No one was annoying even though it was Spring Break time. NIGHTLIFE: Pretty much non-existent. Everything closes at 11 PM. There is nothing to do after that but go to bed! THE DREADED TIMESHARE PRESENTATION: I decided to go through it again for kicks and to get the free stuff! I thought, \"I can beat them at their own game!\" I got $100 off my room charge plus 10% off all my purchases (food, drinks, etc.), plus the big buffet breakfast, plus the tour discounts. My 90 minute presentation turned into 5 HOURS but it was a game to me and I had the time. I have to say, they made a pretty convincing case, although I found out later that they neglected to tell me a lot of things. Surprise, surprise! In the end, I told them that I can't make a major decision like that without going off and doing my research and consulting with my financial advisor. He turned on me then and said that I'm not welcome there anymore! When he went off to get his manager, I folded up all the paperwork and had it in my hands. When he game back with the manager, he SNATCHED IT out of my hands! Too funny. The first guy tried to sell me on the resort; the second guy tried to sell me on investing in Mexico. I didn't buy any of it and told them to sign me out. In the end, my total bill for a 7 day stay there was $114.00!!! I was so happy with myself!! :-) SHUTTLE TO PLAYA DEL CARMEN: On my next to the last day, I was getting a little bored so I decided to take the $4 shuttle to Playa del Carmen. What a nice service they offer for this. It goes and returns every 2 hours or so up until 9 PM (returning) and you can't beat it for $4. When I stepped out onto the beach, THEN I felt like I arrived in Mexico! WOW, now THAT was a beach! I immediately went into the water; so perfect with its soft rolling waves and all I could say was \"Oh my God\" for the first hour! I LOVED it there! The beach, restaurants, the nightlife, single, cool people! It's the place to be! I spent my entire last 2 days there. A MUST DO: You MUST do this. It was one of the best experiences of my trip. Go to Playa, go on the beach, walk south for a block to two, find \"Club Massage\" right on the beach, and get a massage from ENRIQUE! OH...MY...GOD!!! It was the best massage of my life and get this - it's only $20 for 50 minutes!!! I went back the next day and did it the second time. He is so amazing! Tell him Carol from New Jersey sent you! OVERALL: I really loved my week at the Mayan. I recommend staying there and using it as a base. It's really cheap since it's not all-inclusive. Then get out and do the tours and Playa and all the real Mexican things on your own.

You do need to take a shuttle to everything, unlike Vallarta which has ocean views and you can walk. The shuttles are quick and readily available from whereever you are however.

Way more choices at vallarta. The buffet is costly as well. We ate at the greenbreak for alot of our breakfasts, they are ala carte and cheaper. For lunch we always got food from the pool waiters.

In Vallarta they had water polo everyday and all kinds of other activites. The Grand Luxxe pool is pretty but it is an older crowd and not really kid friendly.

Beautiful path system to walk so we enjoyed the extra exercise but would've preferred a room closer to the pool. Also, no room has an ocean view. Apparently the buildings have to be quite a distance from the ocean so the buildings go back quite far. We never took the shuttle but saw people waiting for it all the time. It only came every 20 minutes which I thought was crazy long to wait when you could be there in 10 minutes. I wouldn't have been happy about the wait if I needed a ride everytime.

We booked all day trips before arrival and got better pricing anyway. Everytime you leave this resort they keep track of your room # and comings and goings.

YES, there are 21 buildings and some are far away from the pool/beach. We were in building 15, and found that the walk to the lobby and pool was good exercise, and beautiful scenery. The pool experience is second to none. An unbelievably LARGE pool. The shuttles did run every 10 minutes or so if we didn't feel like the walk. We bought groceries at walmart and saved quite a bit on breakfasts and lunch. Drinks and dinner are failry expensive, but you do have a choice. We ranged from $30 to $150 for meals at the resort. In short, it is a great facility. Rooms were adequate, and service was excellent. Playa Del Carmen is 12 miles or so away, and we did take taxi's twice ($20 cost), but most of the time we caught the bus out at the entrance at a 2-3$ COST/person.

Honestly after experiencing the resort myself I think quite a few of the really bad reviews are from people who love to complain and approach their day with their cup half empty. Upon check in they tried to put us in Building 20, but having done my homework I simply told them it wasn't acceptable and got moved to Building 12, which was a very enjoyable and beautiful 5 minute walk to the pools and ocean. I didn't have to get angry or put up a fuss, they changed it without any problem. Not once in 13 days was anyone in our group approached to attend a time share presentation so I'm not sure how they go about selecting who to ask. We were two families, 4 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 children and shared a 2 bedroom unit. It was very clean, spacious and had everything we needed. The housekeeping staff were excellent. We both rented cars and ventured out to explore and found amazing local places including Akumal (great for snorkeling with sea turtles), Coba (ruins you can still climb), and also Dos Ojos (a cenote also great for snorkeling). We went to Mega in Playa del Carmen to stock up on breakfast and snack items and also found it great for soft drinks, beer and cocktail supplies (there is a blender in the room!). The staff at Mayan Palace didn't mind if you brought down a soft sided cooler to the pool, which we did everyday. We still took advantage of happy hour but always had drinks of our own too. The food is not overpriced for a resort, the pizza and sandwiches were really reasonable for the kids. An all exclusive resort is a better option for people who want to have a buffet everyday, we ate at other restaurants in Playa del Carmen and didn't feel we had to limit ourselves to only eating at the resort. I read one review where someone talked about a $10 hot dog, they have those things on the menu for North American tourists who don't want to eat traditional food from the country they are visiting. Tromonto has great food and fantastic service. Del Lago had a great buffet with a show which was also very good, and Haven had beautiful views along with great food. All of the staff we spoke to were polite and very attentive, we didn't encounter one person who was rude or didn't accomodate a request. The beach is too rocky to swim in but you can still lay by the beach and swim in the pool when you get hot, they are both right beside each other. We also walked about 15 minutes down the beach to an area where you can swim in the water, because we travelled around a fair bit I didn't think this was an issue at all. We swam in the ocean at Akumal, I guess it depends on what your focus is. We've been to many other RCI resorts as owners and this is by no means the worst, as what some reviews would have you believe.

Nearby you can snorkel at Puerto Morelos on the reef with a guide and boat, or head to Akumal and hang out on the beach and snorkel and swim in the quieter bay (still see turtles, fish, rays etc.--just less coral and less fish). If you can endure the 3-4 hour ordeal the timeshare presentation is worth it if you plan on eating meals at the Mayan and going on a tour or two because you will get 10% off all room charges (and you charge all your food and drink to your room) and 50% off all your tours and 500 pesos. The food at the Mayan is great, but predictably expensive, especially the wine. I think the cheapest bottle is $35 and it's not even that good. Would definitely recommend getting out to the nearby towns (Playa del Carmen, Puerto Morelos etc. etc.). There are shuttles from the Palace but you can also go to the main road and flag a \"Collectivo\", basically a van or minivan that acts like the cross between a bus and a taxi. They pretty much follow certain routes, but will stop and pick you up or drop you off along the way for a couple bucks. Playa del Carmen has a Mega store where you can purchase food (and wine!) for your room. Would also recommend the restaurant El Fogon across the street. The main strip 5th Ave in Playa is too touristy but there are some bars that you can check out. We spent a lot of time at the pool at the Mayan and took the tour of Chichen Itza, which is touristy but interesting if you go with a tour guide. Finally, we got our photos taken with DreamArt which is a professional photo thing near the pool. They will take you out on a photo shoot for free and you are not obligated to buy anything. We had been warned and were thinking we might buy 1 or 2 but they were so beautiful and amazing that we had to buy more (we had to fight for it, but we got 10% off the photos as well as they were charged to our room).

The hotel knows that it will cost you more to go and eat in town once you ad the transportation so they have you and your wallet captive. The biggest negative experience we received is when we arrived early in the evening to the Kong restaurant that was open, staffed and almost empty. We were turned away because our party of 4 did not have a reservation. How arrogant and foolish can you be? The pricing was very high like the other restaurants. Our first bad experience occurred within 5 minutes of our check in. A woman came up to us and referred to herself as our \"personal concierge\". So after a few exchanges of information, you guessed it, we determined what she really was was one of those time shar sales persons. Her deceitfulness set the tone for the rest of our stay. To say the least, there is no way I would buy a timeshare at this place or even stay here again. Most of the staff was polite and helpful. The place was clean. But it was clear to me that the obviously large layer of management that the Mayan Palace employed were focused on grabbing every dollar they could from you before you decided to spend more money on taxis and escape the place.

We were in Building 12 and it was a very long walk to the pool. The shuttle did run from the lobby to the pool every 15 minutes, though. The prices in the deli and the restaurants were very overpriced. There was only one happy hour between 11am and 1 pm when you could get drinks 2 for 1. As others have stated forget about swimming in the ocean. There is a reef in front of the resort and you have to walk about 15 minutes north to reach a place where you can get into the water. The pool is large and there are plenty of seats. We were not told about the shuttle that goes to Playa Del Carmen which is $4 a person, so we took a taxi that cost $20 each way. If you go into Playa Del Carmen, the Mega store is very large and very reasonable-things cost half of what they charge at the resort deli. The ice machines located near the elevators in each building have ice that is safe to drink, so we filled our pitcher and let the ice cubes melt rather than buying bottles of drinking water at the deli.

There were two couples in our group and we had a 2 bedroom unit. The rooms were very nice, yes they did smell a bit musty but I believe it is from the humidity and not the building itself. There are ceiling fans which help quite a bit. We were in building 18 but it was nowhere near as long of a walk as some people complain about. It was an easy 5 minutes to the lobby and another 5 to the pool area. However, the resort did not seem at all full so I don't know why we were stuck all the way in building 18. Getting picked up at the airport was a little hectic as the moment you step out of the airport, there are people coming from every direction trying to give you a ride. Just make sure to find the Mayan Palace stand. The pool area was nothing short of AMAZING. I don't think you would ever have enough time to swim in them all. The pools were extremely clean and the water was always the right temperature. The drink/food service was also second to none. I highly recommend renting the palapa and then you are reimbursed for the charge if you buy a certain amount of food/drink during the day. Which during happy hour is very easy to do! Especially on the hot days, it is wonderful to have the comfy bed to nap on. Take part in the pool activities....volleyball, water aerobics, bar tending \"lessons\"...there is something for everyone. The restaurants were very good and were reasonably priced. There were certainly entrees which were quite expensive but there was also a nice selection of reasonably priced meals as well. Tramanto and Gong are certainly a must try. Green Break had good food over lunch but not so great over dinner. This is a no-cash resort. I highly recommend keeping all of your receipts and looking over them every day to keep a tab on what you are buying so it is not a big shock at the end of the trip. You also need to review your bill carefully to make sure you get any discounts you were promised. Also a must - check the conversion rate when you pay at checkout. We first paid by cash (USD) and then realized they charged us an arm and a leg. My husband went back to the front desk, got our cash back and paid with our credit card, who was much more reasonable. There is a photographer at the resort - Dream Art Photography. You schedule a session with them and have the opportunity to purchase a photo CD that you can take home and print your own pictures. Yes, they are absolutely amazing. Yes, you will want to buy almost all your pictures. Yes, the pictures are expensive. However, don't be afraid to reason with them a bit. It is a souvenir that will last a lifetime. If you do this, they recommend scheduling it early on in your trip so that you can reschedule if the weather is bad. Bring bright colored clothing. We did sit through the timeshare presentation and it was not bad at all. It was actually the least pressured pitch we have heard. We own a timeshare in Las Vegas and weren't looking to buy but were interested in seeing how the private residence club was different. We got great discounts for going through the presentation! The shuttle to Playa is nice, although it was quite crowded. It drops you off and picks you up at certain scheduled hours. Be sure to have close to the correct amount of dollars/pesos as the drivers often didn't have change. Bottles water is VERY expensive at the resort. Head into Playa and stock up at Mega. We brought our own water to the pool area and nothing was ever said. A bottle in your room is around 2.50 and a bottle at dinner is 5.00. Pop is over 3.00 a can so plan to get some in town or go without. Xel-ha was amazing, beautiful, relaxing. For a reasonable price you have a full day of activities, food and drink. There are also wonderful places where you can find a lounge chair in the shade and relax with the iguanas. Certainly plan to spend the whole day here and do not tack on Tulum. I think you would regret it. Every staff person we encountered was extremely friendly and the majority of them spoke english, except the housekeepers. Even walking on the resort, every employee said olah. It was very nice. I would most certainly return to this resort. Yes the beach is rocky but if you are willing to walk 10 minutes there is a nice swimming beach. The pools more than make up for the beach anyway. Personally I would rather swim in a beautiful pool than in the ocean with sea critters anyway. You have to be careful when reading the negative reviews - some of the complaints are ridiculous. Would it be nice to be a bit closer to Playa? I guess it depends on how much time you want to spend there. Would it be nice to have a better beach? Depends on how much time you will spend in the ocean. Do the rooms smell a bit musty? Yes but I believe it is from the climate and nothing to do with the resort. Are the walls thin?

Awesome buffet at del lagos but 500 pecos a plate. Older crowd at the resort. Brought my own beer to pool, but forgot to buy beer in cans. Went to time share. Enjoyed the personal interaction. got quite a kick out of the greasy salesmen. they are very slick , born salesman. I would do it again. Remember whatever you say about not being interested, they still have to go through the sales pitch. We were out in 2.5 hrs. Not interested one bit in it but went for the breakfast and the 10% off and 1000 peco off bill. At the start you get you receipt getting the 10 % and 1000 pecos so 2.5 hrs into it I just got up and walked out. Went to playa 3 times took the colectivo, very easy, and cheap, 20 pecos per person each way. Only problem,have to walk outside resort front gate to get the colectivo Never thought of taking a taxi to front gate if the resort shuttle times don't work out. Concierge very helpful. Bought xcaret tickets from carlos at megamart, carlos (charlie)is a crook. Got stood up 3 times by him, an experience but not worth the stress. Went snorkeling at poerto Morelos, Brought own snorkel stuff, probably didn't need to, as you walk down the beach, scorkel tours go from $25 to $ 15. Although with your own snorkel stuff it is on your schedule. Go out to white bouys, it is inside the swimming area and not very far from where the tours snorkel. Had a wonderful meal 1 street off beach. Had wonderful time with the experience. No food problems at all. Went to excaret, very disapointed. Show was good and buffet meal was excellant. Would not go for $140, buy through resort for $90 if at all. Heard xell-ha was better. Went scuba off cozumel. Highlight of trip, once I got over anxiety attack. It was awesome. Took my 11, 14 and 16 yr old. Well worth doing 2 tank dive. What you learn in your first dive you can apply to second dive and enjoy it more. Remember to exhale. Went with \"diving with cristina\" (has website)lewie her husband was very passionate about diving and did a good job with the kids. $110 for 2 tanks. Only problem is that ferry costs about $20 a person return. Just heard the diving off cozumel was better. Overall, with kids, and not being there for the drinking with other couples, it was a pretty cheap holiday, that and we missed some -38 celcius weather at home.

(Hey, if we keep going back it means something!) Mayan members get free transportation to resort, but pay $15 for return trip. This is a great family resort. If laughing children get you peeved, go elsewhere. BEDS: Huge, platform beds, firm but comfy ROOMS: Large, spacious LR (sleeps 4 kids/teens), lousy furniture.

Our group consisted of three couples, all in our early 30's. Location: The location of the resort is not great if you want to go anywhere off the resort grounds - it's nearly an hour from Cancun and at least 25 minutes from Play del Carmen. Based on this knowledge, we decided to rent cars (each couple rented a tiny Aveo, which was a better deal than renting one or two larger cars to share) and we were very happy with our decision to do so. It gave us plenty of freedom to go where we pleased and stay in complete control of our own schedules. Doing the math on what other transportation would have cost, I think we were much better off. The parking situation was less than desireable since the small lot that was nice and close to our room was closed the week we were there. Rooms: As many of the other reviews have stated, the layout of the resort is kind of ridiculous, with 21 buildings laid out in one long line, building #1 closest to the pool, building #9-ish being closest to the lobby and building #21 being closest to nothing. While we requested rooms in buildings 1-8, we were put into building 19. It wasn't a great situation since the pool was nearly always our destination, but after a day or so we learned to deal with it and work the shuttle system. Despite our complaints about the building location, our rooms were nice enough, however nothing fancy or indicative of the Mexican culture we were in - very utilitarian with no views of anything, but comfortable and clean. We shared a two-bedroom suite (a one-bedroom suite with a King bed and the second bedroom is a lockout with two double beds) with one of the other couples, and the third couple was in a one bedroom suite next door. My husband and I were in the lockout, but we shoved the two beds together to make one giant bed and our travel companions were actually jealous they didn't have our room! In addition, our lockout was at the end of the hall, so we didn't share a wall with anyone or have any trouble with noise that I've heard others complain about. I was also under the impression there was no one in the room above us for most of the week (we were on the 2nd floor), so we may have gotten lucky in terms of peace and quiet. I loved that each couple had their bathroom. The rooms were very clean had twice daily maid service that I was happy to tip each maid for at the end of the week - they even managed to handle our \"giant bed\" with no problem! We also put our tiny kitchenette to much use with breakfast and lunch foods (we ate all dinners out), as well as beer and wine for drinking in the room (and sneaking down to the pool). We stocked up on supplies at the Wal-Mart in Playa which is cheap, cheap, cheap. You can't cook much on the tiny stove and I wish they'd had larger than a dorm-size fridge, but it got the job done. Activities: The pool is AWESOME. It's huge and beautiful and we spent much of the week lying next to and in it. During the week we were there they kept draining various parts of the pool to do maintenance on it - I have no idea if this is a constant thing, or if our timing was off, but ultimately it didn't affect us in the slightest because it's so large there's always another part of the pool to explore. We did belly up to the pool bar several times in the beginning of the week, but the areas next to each pool bar tended to be in high-demand and, as would be expected, is often where you'd find the loud, drunken hillbillies and frat boys. We eventually found that our favorite spots were farther from the bars and we preferred to use the poolside waitstaff - they worked their butts off and treated us right (and were not oblivious to our sneaking our own beer down to the pool, and yet still chose to look the other way). They also had two happy hours every day, one in the late morning/early afternoon (11 - 1, I think) and another in the late afternoon (4 - 6?) - they consisted of buy-one-get-one drink-of-the-day and beers, so we usually took advantage of that. Because of the coral and rocks at the shoreline, the beach sucked, pure and simple. It's BEAUTIFUL, but I'm a beach girl and I like swimming in the ocean (not to mention, it gets very hot laying in the sun, and you need to be able to cool off) and the water was completely inaccessible. I couldn't believe that people were actually risking losing skin by snorkeling off the beach, but there were a few out there. I walked out to the beach once or twice, but mostly resigned myself to staying by the pool. Four of us in our group got spa treatments and we all thought they did a great job - the prices were fairly typical of a spa back home and I didn't think they were too bad. It also allowed access to the jacuzzi, sauna and steam room before/after your treatment, so that was a nice bonus. It costs extra to go to the gym, which I think is kind of ridiculous. However, I say that as someone who doesn't go on vacation to work out! Timeshare Pitch: We chose not to do the timeshare presentation (which saves you something like 10% of your entire bill and gets you a free breakfast), as we deemed it completely unworthy of spending three or four hours of our day suffering through (I know from experience they're high pressure and not fun). They asked us to the presentation once at check-in and once called our room to ask us to come - we declined both times and they left us alone after that. Restaurants: We did try most of the restaurants on the resort at least once and there were none I was truly disappointed in, though some were better than others. As is to be expected, they were all a bit on the pricey side, but nothing too terrible. I think my favorite was the Italian restaurant. The biggest problem I think we found was that none of them are easy or quick to get into at dinner time. Most of them require reservations at least a day ahead of time if you want to wait less than an hour or two. We also drove into Playa for dinner at least three times, which was my preference, but it's a long enough drive where we couldn't get up the energy to do it more than that. The poolside restaurant was really good - our first day we actually ate lunch there and enjoyed it, and several times throughout the week we ordered snacks or light lunches through the poolside waitstaff and it was delivered to us without our even having to get out of the pool! The pizza was awesome - highly recommend. Overall it's a nice resort, but I wouldn't stay here again. And while I had no problem with our rooms, I prefer something a little more culturally immersive than a room that looks like I could be staying in a chain hotel in the middle of Cincinnati - if I go to Playa again, I'll pay a little more for a vacation rental or boutique hotel in the heart of the city. And the location was a turnoff, because even with access to our own cars leaving the resort was often time consuming and stressful (I think it would have been worse trying to use shuttles and public transportation - my husband was very good at navigating the traffic....there was just a lot of it!). If you're just looking for a resort with a bar and a pool, though, this is your place.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat place if you want to just lay around and eat!\u201d", "Author": "Laura_Fan-Of-Mexico", "ReviewID": "UR94517089", "Content": "I traded my RCI points for a 7 day girl's trip in a 2 Bedroom Suite @ Mayan Palace. The resort is beautiful, room was immaculate and the grounds kept perfectly manicured. The front desk allowed each of us four girls to put down our own credit card so that everything didn't go on my bill. This was perfect since this is a non cash resort. All food and beverage bills include a 15% gratuity, so you never need to carry cash. With a couple of nights worth of dinners, 2-3 lunches, a little food and clothing shopping and mostly drinks, my tab came out to about $500. That was about what each of us ended up spending. The Water- We bought water for the room in Playa Del Carmen. I talked to several people that had been staying there for a week. They said they'd been drinking the water and were fine. I still drank the bottled water. Never had any problems with the food either. Security- We felt very secure on the resort. Even when we left and came back, the guard gate recorded what cab you were in, the time you left and your room number. I found this very comforting, especially when in a foreign country. I walked the grounds at night with no fears whatsoever. All the paths and areas were well lit. Security did walkbys on the beach at night too. Rooms- I'd read tons of trip advisor reviews about the resort before I left which were extremely helpful. Particularly when it came to what building we were to be staying in. Upon check-in, I \"greased the wheel\" at the front desk for a room in Building 1-5 and on the top floor. Our room was in the perfect location in building 3 on the top floor on the end. We didn't hear any outside noise, ever. The unit was more than adequate for our needs. With the adjoining bedroom and main bedroom door s closed, you could hardly hear anything going on in the kitchen/living room area. This was perfect for our early risers and late sleepers. The beds were a bit harder than we have at home yet comfortable, but none of us had any trouble sleeping. The maid came every day, once to clean and once for turn down service. We left a $5 bill on the table with a \"thank you\" each day. Kitchen- The kitchen was fine for our needs. We cooked a few times and had all the dishes, pots and utensils that we needed. It had a mini fridge that was big enough for food, juice and beers! Food & Alcohol- I highly recommend a trip to the Mega Mart in Playa Del Carmen at the beginning of your stay to purchase alcohol, water, coffee and other foods to snack or cook with. It has everything you'll need. The market in the resort is well stocked, but very expensive. You'll pay 2-3 times the price, maybe more if you purchase there. Beers were 50 pesos at the resort and about 250 pesos by the 6 pack in the store. At Mega Mart we paid 61 pesos for a 6-pack. It's true what I read about the upselling of drinks. We went a little crazy with white russians and amaretto floaters. Each of those drinks came out to about $12-$16 each. Thanks goodness the bar closed at 11pm! Ha! Stick to the beer and an occasional tequila shot. It's a quicker and cheaper buzz! Pool- The pool is awesome and the biggest I've ever seen at a resort. The waiters were very attentive. I brought a soft sided collapsible cooler from home and brought beers from my room down to the pool. We saved a lot of money doing this. The pizza is a great value and cheaper to feed 3-4 people. The nachos weren't bad except that they used that liquid cheese instead of the real thing. But they still did the trick. We reserved the same pool palapa at the end of each day for $35. If you buy at least $35 worth of food and drink at the pool, they'll take it off of your bill when you check out. But you need to check your bill carefully to make sure they take the charges off. We loved the palapa with the large bed and surrounding lounge chairs in and out of the sun. It was perfect! If you want peace and quiet at the pool, make sure not to get a palapa near the water aerobics/trivia area of the pool. The music and speakers were pretty loud near our palapa #51. Other than that, we had perfect sun exposure all day in that spot. The beach in front of the resort was nice. but you can't swim there. Our bartender said it was a 30 minute walk to a safe swimming area. You're better off driving 20 minutes in a cab and spending the day on a beach in Playa Del Carmen. Restaurants- The Gong Snack Bar and Cevicheria was my favorite. The \"Asian\" Peruvian Salmon Ceviche was outstanding. The portion size was surprisingly huge too. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The downfall is that it's only open from 11am-5pm. You can order food to go and take it to the pool, like I did. The Sushi Restaurant was really, really good too. A bit pricey, but worth it cuz we were craving sushi. Get the thick cut sashimi platter. You'll have a hard time finishing it. The lobster roll rocked too! Happy Hours at the resort- Happy hour (2 for 1) at the pool goes from 11am-1pm. *We asked our waiter to remind us before happy hour ended. Then we ordered a couple of buckets of beer that last for hours. The service at the pool was very good. Happy our at the Golf Course snack bar is from 3:30p-5p. Premium call brands are not 2 for 1. Happy Hour at the Wine Bar is from 5:30-6:30p. We ordered the appetizer sampler platter to hold us over until dinner. It was pretty good. The Resort has a daily special 2 for 1 drink until 5pm at the pool. Check it out at the concierge's tent near the pool area. Shopping- Shop in Playa Del Carmen. Everything at the resort is ridiculously overpriced. I bought the same ash tray in Playa for $3 that the pool kiosk wanted $25 for. Same with sunglasses, t-shirts, blankets, and especially jewelry. Bring your sunscreen from home. Transportation- I saw a tip on trip advisor to ask for Alex, cab #211. Trust me, you don't want anyone else! He's the best and totally reliable!!!! He works primarily with the resort. This tip made our entire trip! I asked about Alex upon check-in and that evening, he called my room to give me his cell if we needed him. He only needed 30-45 minutes notice to be available. Sometimes he was already at the hotel and we just walked down to meet him. It only cost $20 for a 15-20 minute ride to Playa Del Carmen, whether it's one or 4 passengers. He drove us around town showing us good and not so good places to eat, where not to hang out, etc. I'd called him about 30-45 minutes before we were ready to go back to the hotel. Alex took us to Mega Mart after our day in Playa and waited while we shopped at no extra charge. As a matter of fact, he stopped at several places for us before we went to the beach. He totally took care of us! And his tunes in the car were great. We sang to the top of our lungs the whole way home every time we rode with him. It was truly a great experience. My only regret was that we didn't have enough time to spend with him. Nightlife- At the resort, there is only one true belly up type of bar at the Havana Moon. Jeiro was a great bartender! Technically, you can't eat t the bar. But if you go to the restaurant's maitre'd, you can order anything to go and eat it at the bar. There was a time they actually served us food at the bar. It's hit and miss if they'll let you order from the bar. The restaurant and bar close at 11pm, unfortunately. We were just getting wound up when it was time to leave. The Rock n Roll cover band was amazingly great. If you're looking for a Resort to party all night, this isn't it. Have Alex take you to Playa Del Carmen instead, but be careful where you go at night. Mexico isn't the same as it was 10 years ago. It's still relatively safe, but you need to be aware of what's going on around you. Golf- I was the only person in our group that golfs. I went to the \"club house\" and waited for a single golfer to come by. I didn't have to wait long before I found a partner. The course is a very challenging par 3. Bring your own golf balls or they're $1 each. Tees are provided. The club rentals were pretty decent too. It was $75 for the cart, greens fees and club rental. I heard there was a 2 for 1 deal on Friday's and Saturday's for $55, but was there on a Thursday. Overall review- One thing we were happy about was the lack of young children at the resort. Not sure if it was because we were there in January. But that was a definite plus for us. While this resort was beautiful, to get the true taste of Mexico, I'd rather stay either in Playa Del Carmen or more likely Isla Mujere. You get to wander around town and feel the local flavor of Mexico. I usually stay in Isla Mujeres where it's cheaper and they have lots of beaches. I'd reccomend Mayan Palace for an older crowd that doesn't want to leave the resort much, but not to a younger crowd that wants to have fun. If you want to wander around without needing a cab, go to Playa or Isla. If our time share was available in Isla Mujeres that week, we would've stayed there instead. But overall we knew what Mayan Palace had to offer and were fine with that.

We are a family of 5 with 3 teenagers and have been to Mexico several times. There are so many different reviews, opinions and thoughts on this resort \u2013 some good, some bad and some indifferent. I will share our experience with you and hopefully you will find it helpful. We arrived on Dec 26th into Cancun, went thru immigration, grabbed bags and went thru customs (in some order) and went looking for our shuttle. If you did not rent a car and had arranged transportation with the MP ahead of time, they will tell you to look for their driver that will have a tan polo shirt and navy slacks on. There are SO many people outside trying to get you to come with them, that it makes it difficult to find your driver. Walk all the way OUTSIDE, cross a very small driveway/crosswalk and walk to the BLUE station Number 28. It is the 2nd blue station straight ahead. Anyone going to the Grand Mayan or the Mayan Palace will need to check in here. They will direct you to the next shuttle that\u2019s available \u2013 this took about 15 minutes and we were on our way. The drive to MP took us exactly 30 minutes from the airport and the sights along the way were not pretty. There were many abandoned buildings and not a whole lot to look at - but I think that is how it is outside all resorts. Once we got to the MP we went into the lobby to check-in and of course, was approached by the timeshare people. I told them I would stop by after I checked us in. Check-in was easy but a little slow. I think we had a new person behind the desk helping us. They have trays of cold bottled water sitting on the counter that you can help yourself to. I had sent a request in prior to arrival asking for a room in building 1-8 but we didn\u2019t get it. Oh well, we were in building 13 instead on the ground floor. When I asked if they had any other rooms on another floor I was told no. Ok, let\u2019s just go with it! We got our keys, towel cards and MP bands that everyone had to wear and were on our way. The bands are different colors each week and the GM bands are different than the MP bands. (Stopped and signed up for the timeshare tour but we\u2019ll talk about that later). Like I mentioned, we were in building 13 \u2013 which was about a 3 minute walk from the lobby. No big deal. We booked a 2 bedroom unit thru RCI (HGVC members) and we were not disappointed. The unit was comprised of a king bedroom with a separate toilet and separate shower/sink. There was an additional sink outside of the bathroom next to the kitchen - almost like a half-bath minus the toilet! Then we had the living room that had 2 full couches that adults could sleep on, dining room table with 4 chairs and the kitchen. 2 top burners, microwave, sink, small fridge and plenty of dishes, silverware and 4 pots/pans. On the other side of the kitchen/living room you had the second bedroom with 2 queen beds and another full bathroom. Showers were good size and you didn\u2019t feel cramped in there. Marble sinks and full size shampoo and body lotions each day. There were plenty of towels, good water pressure in the shower and twice daily maid service. With regards to the beds, yes they were indeed firm but everyone slept very well. We would rather have a firm bed than a mushy one where our backs start hurting 2 days into our trip. Our backs never hurt during the entire trip. Even our 16 year old enjoyed sleeping on the couch and said it was VERY comfortable. TV\u2019s in each room but limited English speaking channels. Literally, there were maybe 7 or 8 of them. No worries \u2013 we brought Wii with us and hooked it up to the living room TV to play at night! People complained of the smell of the rooms on the ground floor \u2013 was there an odor, yes, was it terrible no. We had our doors open so much that the smell didn\u2019t bother us. Quite honestly, I think it\u2019s the water. Every time you had someone take a shower or you washed a couple dishes you seemed to notice the smell more. It really wasn\u2019t THAT bad as some have made it out to be. Plus having the doors open and fresh air in the condo is what we prefer. No bugs either!! House keeping came in the morning and then came again in the evening for turn down service. On the nights we didn\u2019t take the turn down service, they gave us a handful of Hershey Kisses. We left them a tip and a note each morning and had plenty of towels, lotions and soap. They even refilled our dish soap bottle so we could wash a few dishes each day. Each building is comprised of 3 separate buildings that are connected by a hallway. So, building 11, 12 and 13 were all connected and then it opened up to building 14, 15 and 16 at which point it opened up again. Building 13 was about a 3 minute walk (if that) to the hotel lobby but it was a 15 minute walk to the pool. We walked it so many times that we decided to time it so we could let you know. It\u2019s a nice stroll and the kids did it themselves many times even at night. Not a big deal plus you get some exercise in and walk off your food and booze! Laundry machines are between buildings 5 and 6 as well as buildings 16 and 17 and are located off the service path/driveway behind the buildings. It is kinda hidden but if you look closely for it you will find it. There were 3 washers and 3 dryers in there and I the dryer I had wouldn\u2019t work. Called maint and they came and fixed it right away. If you are going to wash any laundry you have to go to the Concierge to get the tokens and soap. You won\u2019t guess how much it is for 1 load of laundry - $8.00 USD for 1 token to wash, 1 token to dry and a little pouch of soap! Hope you don\u2019t do a lot of laundry! If you purchase the tokens and don\u2019t use them, return them to the Concierge and they will credit your room. I did it! As so many people have said before, the pools were incredible. You never felt crowded because they were so big and people were so spread out. When you walk up to the pool you can go either left or right - if you go to the left you will find the pool towel stand, hair braiding, tattoos, jewelry, face-painting and a restaurant called Balche. We ate at Balche several times during our stay and thought it was great pool food and reasonably priced. Club sandwiches, BLT\u2019s, hamburgers, Chix Quesidilla\u2019s , Grouper sandwiches etc. Also on the left side you will find a board that shows the resort activities each day and the times. There is also a stand that you make all dinner reservations at in this area and I believe the ladies name was Ava. As you go around the pool you will see Havana Moon, which is located on the beach as well as the health club. There are 2 places to enter the beach from the pool deck and between the 2 places you will find an ice cream stand \u2013 big hit with the kids but expensive. We bought 3 double scoop servings and it was $24.00 USD. Do you know how many gallons of Breyers I could have bought!!?? LOL I\u2019ve also seen people say that you cannot bring food to the pool \u2013 that was not the case for us. We brought food down ourselves and left it right out on the beds or tables and NOBODY said anything to us. We saw people with coolers too! I guess some people may have had a bad experience with this but we didn\u2019t have any problems at all. As everyone mentions, there are Palapas with beds to rent around the pool each day. There are a total of 55 beds around the pool and they rent for $35.00 a day but if you order that much in food/beverages then the beds are free. Why would you not do this \u2013 they are so comfortable and it\u2019s nice to get out of the sun sometimes. Alongside each bedside they have a small table and a chaise lounge chair so you have the bed, 2 tables and 2 lounge chairs for each palapas. Plenty of room for everyone! If you prefer not to pay anything, then the palapas that have only chairs under them are free \u2013 first come, first serve. The beach has a ton of green chaise chairs and palapas for you to sit under. There is even a wooden playground set for the younger kids if they get tired of digging in the sand! The sand is very soft and rock-free until you get down to the water. Yes, it is full of rocks and next to impossible to get into the water to swim but it was so nice to lay there in the sun and listen to the waves come crashing in! RELAXATION! We did not go exploring down either way on the beach so I can\u2019t help you there. Del Lago is a restaurant onsite that has an awesome breakfast buffet. Almost everything you could want is there. Something we found out was that if want bacon for breakfast you have to ask for it \u2013 they do not leave it out on the buffet. Orange juice is delivered to your table on request. The freshly made donuts were the most incredible donuts I\u2019ve ever had. I don\u2019t eat donuts for breakfast but since they made them right there I had to try them. They were AMAZING!! All kinds of fresh fruit, eggs, bagels, hot cocoa \u2013 great breakfast and a must try. Tramonto was the Italian Steakhouse located on the 2nd floor above the Jade store and caf\u00e9. We went for dinner one night and had Angel as our server. He was EXCELLENT!!! He asked everyone our names, told us about the menu, great selections, entertained the kids with jokes and made paper napkins into roses for the ladies. We enjoyed the food and his company so much we went back another night and requested his section. Believe it or not, he remembered everyone\u2019s name and stayed and chatted with us. Great Prime Rib, Filet Mignon, Chix Parm, Pasta, Salmon, Ribeyes, Cr\u00e8me Brulee and Cheesecake. The food was awesome and we left very happy and full. Green Break Caf\u00e9 is by the golf course and my husband went there every morning for his coffee. Nice, quiet and relaxing place to have coffee or breakfast in the morning. Jade is the boutique within the resort and they have everything that you could need while on vacation. Also in this area you will find the \u201cmarket\u201d that has fresh fruits, eggs, breads, dried goods, toiletries, chips, milk, all kinds of drinks from waters, Gatorades, sodas etc. It\u2019s a mini grocery store that has everything. They also have a deli that sells pizza\u2019s, lunch meats, hot dogs, cheese etc. We purchased a couple trays of fresh cut fruit each morning, blueberry muffins, apple turnovers and were good. It isn\u2019t terribly expensive but it\u2019s more than what we\u2019d pay in Chicago and you\u2019re on vacation so why not?!! We signed up for the Xel-ha and Tulum tour thru the resort and had a WONDERFUL time. We picked up our bus by the Green Break Caf\u00e9 for the departure and it took us about 1 hour to get to Xel-ha. Xel-ha is almost like a giant Disney waterpark/theme park but with a huge area for snorkeling, swimming, zip lines, tubing and beach chairs. They had an all you can eat buffet there which we all thought was excellent \u2013 including the soft serve ice cream. We spent 5 hours there and then hopped back on the bus to go to Tulum which was about 15 minutes from Xel-ha. Tulum has beautiful Mayan Ruins and it was incredible to see them. The beach down below was breath-takingly beautiful with crystal clear water and white powdery sand. There is a path from atop of the hill down to the beach if you choose to go down there. We definitely recommend this adventure. It does take the entire day if you are looking for something to do. Now for the timeshare part . . . we knew exactly what we were getting into going to a presentation \u2013 no surprise there. We are current owners at HGVC, after the tour we sat down and talked numbers. They asked us to sign a piece of paper that allowed them to find out the value of our current timeshare \u2013 we signed it because we were curious as well. At the end, my husband asked for a copy of the document we signed and they were shocked \u2013 in fact the guy was stuttering. I guess nobody asks for a copy of this. Since it\u2019s a legal document, we felt we were entitled to a copy. He said let me check on that for you. 2 people later, we were told that it would cost us $200 to get a copy of that document (because that\u2019s what it cost them to run the check). Our final stance on the timeshare was NO and since they knew we were done they wanted us to sign the \u201cfinal exit\u201d paper so we could leave. We refused to sign. They walked us to the door area so we could collect our promised perks. We sat down with the owners\u2019 rep for an exit interview. We told her about the document, the $200 price tag that went with it and she flipped. She made me tell her who it was so she could suspend him for 3 days and send him back to training. They are NOT supposed to ask for any money. Since we didn\u2019t sign the \u201cfinal exit\u201d paper that prevents us from dealing directly with the owners and being contacted by them within the next 5 years \u2013 she was able to offer us the same 2 bedroom property as they did inside for 50% less. No lie! It was incredible!! So, if you are really interested in purchasing here, follow the same steps we just told you and you\u2019ll get it for half price. The only reason we did the presentation was to save some money and we did - $500.00. That was good enough for us. Would we go back to this resort \u2013 yes as we had a really good time. If you have any questions, I\u2019m happy to answer them. If you go to this resort \u2013 enjoy your trip!", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lethbridge", "Title": "\u201cCaught Someones Engagement\u201d", "Author": "scuba4fun", "ReviewID": "UR93633914", "Content": "We stayed here December 18th through Jan 1. Got up to take pictures of the sunrise and witnessed a couple getting engaged. If you know who they are, have them get in touch with me, I would love to forward the pics to them. The Review. ROOMS- Clean, well layed out, beds were in typical Mexican style- hard as a sheet of plywood. The maid service was great, with a turn-down every night. RESORT - The property is beautiful, nicely set out, with the exception of the beach. There is no sandy access to the water, but we knew this going in. We never ran into an unfriendly staff member and had great service from anyone we had contact with. POOL - one of the only ones we were able to find in Mexico that was heated. It is massive and warm, open 24 hours and for my wife, the highlight of the resort. We actually spent more time in it after dark, comfortably - at least until the chilly dash back to the room. Food & Alcohol - priced on the heavy side, you will learn when Happy Hour is and where quickly ( at least after you sign your first tab). It isn't difficult to hit the 200.00 mark having a meal. We rented a jeep and spent most of our time off property. Hopped across to Cozumel for six nights, walked Fifth ave a ton, and having been to the area eight times before were quite comfortable doing it. As a base of operation the Mayan was okay, a little further from town than would be perfect, but other than the costs to eat and drink there we had no complaints. The cost of a round trip to Playa Del Carmen was the same as the rental jeep for a day, so it was an easy choice, and it made it easy to come and go as we pleased. I would recommend this resort to a friend if they came forewarned. If you know the costs going in it's easier to enjoy yourself without stressing. This was our first experience with a non-all inclusive and we found a way to make it work for us, but if you are going to stay on site you could most likely stay at one of the all inclusive properties in the area for the same money.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, Not the greatest service\u201d", "Author": "sunshine5287", "ReviewID": "UR93569652", "Content": "This was my first time travelling somewhere that wasn't all-inclusive.

There are now two new levels of ownership above the Mayan Palace and The Grand Mayan and I felt like an ugly stepsister. Of course, the marketers wanted me to upgrade to another level, what's new? My feeling from this visit and my November visit to The Mayan Palace in Puerta Vallarta is that they need to spend their money repairing the Mayan Palaces and bring them back to their original state.

Overall the resort is huge, with only a few units located close to the pool area, so if you have forgotten something in your room you are looking at a 15 - 30 minute walk to retrieve it. The pool area is magnificent, and spending a day at the pool is fantastic, though it is particularly expensive and you are not allowed to bring any food or drink, so although accommodation may be cheap due to your being a member of the resort or an RCI affiliate, etc....you land up bearing significant costs just to live and be on holiday. We were really disappointed with a few aspects, which are highlighted below: 1) Internet charges are ridiculous, and internet is really slow. While other places charge 10 pesos per hour, Mayan Palace charges 70, and unlike other places, this is for 1 hour from when you start rather than 60 minutes of use. 2) Taxi service is ridiculously prices also. 200 pesos to take you the 15 min drive into town is an absolute ripoff compared with taxi charges outside a resort 3) We stayed in a self catering unit, but they refused to supply us with a kettle to make hot tea (though we could get coffee tasting, lukewarm water from the coffee machine) 4) The curtains in our bedroom could not close properly, and the crack in the middle let light into the room at 5am. Not a major issue - though you would expect the basics like this to be sorted out in a '5 star' resort where you get the feeling they trying to work out how to charge you for the air you breathe 5) a constant dripping in the air duct above our bed had us awake for hours. Upon inspection from the maintenance guy, the hotel management told us this is how it is supposed to be. In general, the staff are very friendly and it is a magnificent resort - but now having seen what else is available in this area of Mexico I would not recommend Mayan Palace for others.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nanaimo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "all_I_want_is_sun", "ReviewID": "UR92188769", "Content": "This resort is beautiful and immaculately clean like you can expect from the Mayan Group of hotels as with most of the Mayans this hotel is far out from town. Check-in was quick and easy and we requested a room in building 1-8 and got building 8. These buildings are the closest to the pool which is only about a nice 7 minute walk, there is a shuttle that runs as well but the majority of the time we missed it. We were asked to do a time share but declined so she just gave us an open invitation when we were ready no pressure at all included 10% off our bill and 1000 pesos. We ended up doing it the second week we were there and no pressure just said we were not ready to buy sure they try and sell you with another guy but we just kept declining and they got the hint quickly. The bell boy was efficent and took us to our room and explained the room and things in it. Room: No ocean view rooms which was disappointing reason being they don't have these because of there storm season and to protect the hotel. We had a two bedroom the first week which is a lock off hotel room adjoining the main 1 bedroom suite. Then we went to a one bedroom the second week. The 2nd bedroom had 2 queen size beds with a bathroom. The one bedroom had a king size bedroom with adjoing bathroom. The kitchen was equipped with coffee maker, blender, toaster, pots/pans and utensils and dishes. If you needed anything we just called housekeeping and they brought it to us with in minutes ie: cheese grater. The beds and pillows are so hard! You can request a foam pad helped a little but not much. The maids come once in the morning and again at night to make the beds up which was nice to have because we needed them made up every night for our kids once we were in the one bedroom unit. We had issues with our fridge and just called housekeeping and they brought us a new fridge within 15 minutes. The fridge is not a full size it is only a small bar size which wasn't really big enough for us but we made it work. Pool: It is beautiful and huge! There was always plenty of chairs. Happy hour 2x1 drinks is from 11-1 everyday and the servers are very attentative. You are allowed to bring floaties in the pool for the kids. We brought our own drinks down to the pool and the waiters did not have a problem with that. There is a kids club that has daily activities all day by the pool. Maria is awesome with the kids ours were there everyday and became friends with her. Beach: The beach was nice but not swimable but if you walk 10-15 minutes to your left you will come to a beautiful swimming beach which is near the Valentin Resort. Cabs: Cabs are expensive and so is there shuttle. It cost $20 from the resort into Playa for a cab. They have a shuttle that takes you from the resort into Playa del Carmen which cost $4 each way which quickly adds up fast. I recommed taking the bus which is so effiienct and way cheaper! We would just walk out of the resort and stand on the side of the road once we see a white van coming he would flash his lights and we would wave and he would stop. For our family of four it would cost us $1.50 each. He takes you right into Playa del Carmen into there little spot of buses which is only a 10 minute walk to the main shopping area on 5th Street. This was so convenient we used the bus all the time. Restaurants: The restaurants are expensive at the resort go into Playa which is much more affordable and way more selection. Groceries: We went to Mega and stocked up on everything because we cooked alot in our room. We also went to Walmart as well, we preferred Mega as it has way more selection and fresher produce. Puerto Morelos: This is only a 15 minute bus ride away. This is a quaint little town with an amazing beach. We hung out there for the day. The snorkling is amazing we recommend going on a tour for $25 for 2 hours you can see some beautiful fish and coral. We also went to Xel-Xa can't say enough good things about this place. You do need a full day there! All inclusive buy your tickets online and save $$$. We also did Tulum on a separate trip which only takes about 3 hours to go through. Also took the ferry and went to Cozumel for a few days what fun place and great snorkling!

We are a family of 4 with two boys ages 7 and 10. We traveled Christmas week 2010. We would definitely choose this resort again because of the expansive pool complex, the large suites where we can make simple meals, the family friendly atmosphere and all the amenities. We have avoided all inclusive resorts for fear of too many drunk vacationers. DO: When you check in, ask for a room on the SECOND or THIRD floor in buildings 1-8. First floor rooms smell musty (it's humid in Mexico!). Buildings 1-8 are closest to the pool and beach. If you can't get a 2nd or 3rd floor room in these buildings, opt for a farther out building. I would choose walking (or riding the shuttles) any time over a musty smelling room. The resort is built to withstand hurricanes - meaning that the buildings are perpendicular to the beach so all rooms have a jungle view. DO: Eat at Green Break restaurant on the golf course. Great food and it's the most affordable on the premises. DO: Go to the \"good\" beach. The beach and the Mayan is great - beautiful sand, lots of chairs, great service, lively activities (always a volleyball or soccer game going on) but you can't swim because of all the rocks. This isn't unique just to the Mayan beach. Many resorts on Riviera Maya have rocky beaches. There is a GREAT beach just north of the resort. Go to the Mayan beach and turn left (north). Walk a solid 15 minutes to the SECOND life guard stand. You've arrived. No rocks on the beach or in the ocean. We played for two days at this beach and had a blast. Take everything with you for the day including towels, snacks, lunch, beach toys, etc. The beaches in Mexico are public so you can put your stuff anywhere. You just can't use the beach chairs of another resort. We bought two boogie boards at Mega when we first arrived and had a blast playing in the waves. If you have kids, the trek up the beach is worth your while. We liked this beach so much better than the ones in downtown Playa because this beach is much less crowded. DO: Take the shuttle into Playa and go to Mega for groceries. Not Wal Mart. Mega is like Target and even carries the Cherokee brand. DO: Explore outside of the resort. Snorkel a cenote (sink hole), zipline through the forest, see Tulum. We went through Edventures.com and had a wonderful time. That and the \"good beach\" were our most memorable days. (we booked our trip before we left for Mexico through Edventures website which I found on Trip Advisor - I think booking ahead of time for most places including Xcaret is cheaper if you do it ahead of time than working through the hotel once you're there). DON'T: Take \"Guest Services\" up on their offer for a resort credit or a free upgrade on condition that you go to the breakfast...unless you plan to come home owning a time share in Mexico.

My parents booked this resort by trading our time share for the week. We had stayed in the Mayan Palace in PV and Cabo before so we knew about the chain but knew nothing about this specific resort. Then I see all these negative reviews and I was scared we'd end up in some dirty, dingy, overpriced shack. Looks like a bunch of TripAdvisor reviewers just have EXTREMELY unrealistic ideals of a resort. First of all, the grounds are beautiful and like everyone said, the service is impeccable. Every single person that works here always stops to say hi and will do anything to make your stay more pleasant. They are also incredibly professional. We accidentally left our safe open when we went to the pool one day (filled with money, jewelry and our passports) and when the maid discovered it, she called security, locked down our room and deactivated our keys to protect us. The rooms were perfectly fine, although the A/C was freeeeezing. I agree that the grounds are massive and getting a room that is not in buildings 1-5 makes things a bit more difficult. We were in building 2, which was great. We had a 1 min walk to the pool, store and resturants. Had we been further, we would have had to take a shuttle service. Annoying, yes. But its very efficient and well planned if you end up requiring it. The spa prices were high, but nothing higher than any other resort I've been to in my life (and we go to many). The restaurants were also incredibly reasonable. And I don't know why people are complaining about the price in the grocery store - some things were randomly pricey (like soft batch cookies for $7) but others were the same as my local grocery store (80 cents for yogurt). But anyone who has been to a resort before knows that the prices are inflated and it wasn't enough to surprise me. I mean, have you ever bought a muffin in Vegas? The last time I was at the Wynn it was $6! This was nothing. Also, the palapa deals by the pool are awesome but not necessary. This is seriously the BIGGEST pool I've ever seen in my life and there is tons of seating, both in the sun and the shade. We still rented a palapa every day, which was fine for us because we ate by the pool and had the 350 pesos credited back to our account. (Though we did have to look over the bill to make sure that it came back. MAKE SURE YOU DO THAT UPON CHECKOUT!) It was nice to have a bed and some chairs and a place we knew was ours. We definitely took advantage and stayed out there from 10am to 4 pm every day. And the happy hour from 11-1 was fantastic. Great deals and perfect for a nap in the sun :) Anyone who reads those negative reviews and questions staying here should not. The only thing I would say is that this is not a party resort. It doesn't have much of a nightlife (which was fine for us because we literally just wanted to relax, sleep and read) and is quite a hike from Cancun and Playa, where the more hoppin' bars are at. But the place is gorgeous, the food is great (especially the buffet for dinner which changes nightly) and the pool is unreal. Oh and even if you can't swim at the beach, tehy have a gorgeous set up out there. As for the timeshare sales thing (or as we lovingly referred to it, \"lambs walking to slaughter\"), if you want a free breakfast or 10% off your food all week, do it. We didnt, we told them no and they never bothered us again. If you agree to do it, well, you deserve whatever you get. Which is a MAJOR sales pitch and half of your day gone. Personally, not worth it to me - no matter what they offer - but it's up to you.

We checked in on Friday early around10am normal check in is 5pm, the check in people, was able to accommodate us immediately, without any problems, We were promptly taken to our 2 bedroom suite in building 7 ground floor, close to the main lobby, our luggage was taken by a bellboy. Upon inspecting our room I came and requested for a room change immediately, but was told it would not be possible till the next day as all the available rooms had already been assigned. The ground floor room had a pungent odor and felt stuffy to me. There was a complimentary breakfast and 10% discount offered for a presentation of 90min. We did go to the presentation and breakfast, we did not purchase anything in spite of the fact we were approached by 5 sets of sales people and the presentation was more like 3 hours. However it was very informative about the resort itself. The resort is in middle of expansion and there is construction going on but it did not affect our enjoyment of the resort. The pool is amazing and we spent a lot of time in it. There are plenty of lounge chairs and cabanas available for use there is 2 swim up bars plus walk by service for food and drinks. There is a store that has most everything you may need during your stay at the resort including a deli market and vid arcade and cyber cafe. Upstairs is the beautiful wine bar and, which is very elegant, and the Italian and Japanese restaurant. We dined at both restaurants and had drinks at the wine bar. It was very romantic and enjoyable with friends as well. There is a terrace which overlooks the lighted pool and the ocean at night. We also used the bar at Havana Moon which is ocean side with outdoor service and live music in the evening. All in all the grounds and the pool are lush and beautiful, I recommend the second and third floor rooms for better ventilation and more privacy in the terrace which is minimal. The beach is very pretty but the water is rocky, one can swim if the water is not rough, there are lots of fish and marine life for your pleasure. His resort has a beautiful golf course as well and clubs and cart is available for rental.

The staff were extremely friendly and accomodated nearly any request we had. The restaurants were wonderful. Good, local food along with a steakhouse and asian places. We ate at all but the asian restaurant and didn't have a single complaint. The ocean view was beyond words. We took advantage of the spa facilities for massages. They even allow you to use the jacuzzi, hottub, and steam room after your massage. We sat through the sales presentation. It took longer than we were told and was pretty high pressure.

Its the climate there.. It has nothing to do with the resort. Our room was great.. It had all the things we needed. The fridge was small, sure. But no big deal. We bought mostly dry goods, and were just fine. For shopping, I do recommend the mega mart in Playa Del Carmen. The prices were reasonable, and shopping was a pleasant experience. The bed, albeit a bit firm, wasn't THAT bad ( and I am a soft bed kinda girl) The pillows are firm.. But I looked around, and the extra pillows stashed beneath the TV were a bit softer. I did Just fine. The housekeeping staff was amazing. The turn down service was very nice. We had a couple of maintenance issues ( we locked our self out on the balcony, 2nd floor lol) they were handled right away. The air conditioning was a godsend, and almost worked too well.. we left it on during the day, and turned it off at night.. the room was so cool I needed extra blankets. The pool. Oh my goodness. Biggest, and prettiest I have ever seen. 2 pool bars, with happy hours. We were in building 7.. 10 minutes to walk maybe.. However, It was an enjoyable walk, and we didn't mind one bit. Yes they do close down a bit early, so, either plan to go out at night, or get some brew at the mega mart and watch movies. We brought a portable dvd player, and it hooked right up to the tv.. no problem. The Mayan palace is pretty far from Cancun. about 30-40 mins, unless you have a pokey driver. . However, In all honesty, here in the states a cab ride that long would cost WAY more that 20 bucks.. seriously.. It wasn't that big of a deal. ( Little tip.. we took one of the snorkeling trips that met in Playa Del Carmen to catch the boat.. we brought a change of clothes, and when our excursion was over in the afternoon, we just stayed... and caught a cab back later that night) They have a great security system at the resort, and I felt very safe. The food was expensive, But nothing I wouldn't have expected at a resort. I did not consider it out of the ballpark at all. We actually ate at the Italian restaurant ( I got pretty sick of Mexican food) and totally enjoyed it.. The lasagna was great! The beach.. Yes, It is rocky.. and I wouldn't call it swim able.. However, exploring the tide pools was very cool.. we also rented wave runners, and went to a beach not far off that was just perfect. We paid for a half hour of internet..( throughout the entire week) just to check on the kids and face book, and make sure there weren't any emergencies. Other that that, heck! Im on vacation!! who cares about internet anyway! If something happened, someone would call. I had a wonderful time ( i did not attend the presentation. I was asked twice, politely said no, and was not bothered again) and I would TOTALLY go back.. Folks, the point here, is if you look for something negative, you will surely find it.

For example, you can swim at the pools at the Grand Mayan. Its not as big, but very nice and has a completely different feel. The mexican restaurant right next to the Pool is AWESOME!

Wish we had gone two more blocks to Megamart. If you do not enjoy spending money on food, I would suggest you stock up on snacks, sandwich items, and essentials. We also bought a cooler. This is my pro tip we learned at the beginning. The resort has a huge water plant on site. The resort water is drinkable but taste strange. However, all ice machines have a special filter. Fill your cooler with ice at night, melt, and fill your water bottles with the water. Taste great and is free. No one came back sick. Water bottles are $5.00. We did purchase some meals at the pool side restaurant. If you rent a Papalos ($35.00) the amount is applied back to your food bill. We rented the Papalos two days, and bought pizzas and drinks at Happy Hour (2for1) . We also had a buffet breakfast down by the lagoon restaurant - Wonderful! The resort is a large complex. It has a pro golf course, 2 resorts(Grand Mayan & Mayan Palace, and residential complexes. Building 1-8 are within walking distance to the pool. Anything else, you are going to take the shuttle, We were in building 7 near the office. It was a pleasant walk in a nature preservation area. We got to see animals everyday. Might be to long for elderly who have trouble walking. While the coastline was rocky, it was also beautiful. We enjoyed walking down the pier everyday to view the fish, which were quite numerous. There were several people snorkeling over cement barrels that have been put down to build a coral reef. My kids enjoyed exploring the tidal pools. They have an amazing photographer for portraits sessions. Dreamart..com. I would suggest you review and consider taking clothes for a possible portrait session. If you walk down the beach, about 10 to 15 minutes on the left side of the pier , you can swim in the ocean with sand. You will still need swim shoes for the first couple of yards. Once in the water, it is clear and sandy. We had a large school of medium size fish swim all around us. The kids loved it. The pool is the largest in Mexico. While very beautiful, the water temp was warm and only 4 ft. The water games and areobics were fun. They were opening a waterpark on site within two weeks. This will be much more enjoyable for teenagers. We had a suite and were able to cook some meals in the kitchen. The beds are al ittle firm, but not uncomfortable. Our maid service was exceptional. We gave a great tip to the morning maid. Did not use the evening made as often. No problems with noise from any of our rooms.

American Airlines actually cancelled our flight on the 14th and we arrived on the 15th instead - I emailed the concierege and she totally took care of our shuttle change and just as promised the shuttle was waiting for us outside of baggae claim. The check in process was smooth - Andy took care of us and even got us a room in building 4 on the 3rd floor as requested. Yes the time share reps were ready and waiting for us but we declined and never heard from them again. Unlike most others we did not have a suite - we simply had the \"lock off\" portion of the suite with 2 double beds and no kitchen. The maid even pushed the 2 double beds together and made it a huge king (they even have sheets and bedspreads to fit it). Our room was clean and more than adequate for our vacation needs. No kitchen - no problem - it was my 40th birthday - who wants to cook? We found the prices to be reasonable at all the restaurants. I think the problem with most complaints about the cost is people expect since they are in Mexico they should be getting things for dirt cheap......we spent a week in Paris last year - trust me this was cheap by comparison. We ate all the restaurants except for Del Lago ( we just never made it there) We went to Tramonte twice because enjoyed it sooo much and waiter was a gem. We loved the pools - never had a problem finding a palapa with chairs under it (free) we didn't rent the palapas with the beds. The pool service was great - our waiter was constantly checking on us and reminding us of last call for happy hour. While happy hour is early we double ordered and our waiting graciously brought us ice to replenish our bucket of beer even after happy hour was over - so our drinks stayed cool. We were concerned about being in Mexico with all the drug violence you hear about these days. We felt very secure at the Mayan palace. We jokingly call my husband Mr Safety because he is always so concerned about his surroundings and he even commented on how he was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable he felt at the Mayan Palace and in Playa del Carmen. We used the room safe religiously - we left the maid a tip each day and on the first day we came back to find the tip still there! The next day I left a note explaining it was for the maid service and was at the room when the maid came in. She said she didn't want to assume that we left it for her and didn't want to be accused of stealing. So each day I left a little note saying Thank you for your service. Check out was just as easy - we had an EARLY flight so we left the hotel at 5am. The front desk checked us out quickly and the bellman had a taxi ready and waiting for us. (Note if you fly out on the 7am flight out of Cancun - get to the airport early - we were there by 5:20am and had just enough time to walk up to the gate and board - because ticketing and security took that long) Overall, we Loved this place and can't wait to go back!! We booked through the Armed Forces Vacation Club and they have a stipulation that you can't return to the same place but once every 5 years (through their booking anyway) because you are paying so little to basically stay in a space available option. We paid $350 for the week and feel like we hit the jackpot in the place. So 4 years and 360 days and counting...... The weather was perfect. It did rain every day but only for about 20 minutes at a time and then the sun came right back out.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to relax NOT TO PARTY!!\u201d", "Author": "MGA23", "ReviewID": "UR74625870", "Content": "The service was great ALL the staff were very helpful and polite the room are very spacious and clean wirh great views , If you want to party this is not the right hotel for you but if you want to relax this is a great place to do so.

This resort was a pleasant surprise! Check in was smooth and bottles of cold water were given upon arrival. Our room was a two bedroom, two bathroom with living room and small kitchen. It was very big and very clean with maid service in the am and pm. We stayed in bldg 13 after requesting bldgs 1-7. The walk to the pool and restaurants were no problem as the paths are jungle like with beautiful flowers and many lizards and birds. My sons also saw a monkey. The hotel has locations where you can hop on a golf cart which will take you to the pools if you choose not to walk. I enjoyed walking to see the flamingos and alligators. The pool area was amazing. The pool itself is huge and never felt crowded. You always were able to get lounge chairs or palapas. There are many activities here. I participated in the water arobics and the bar tending classes which was a lot of fun! We also went to the beach party and took black jack lessons. Paco, the recreational facilitator, was amazing! He was funny and full of energy! The entire staff of this hotel was friendly with a warm smile on their faces and always available to help. I loved the beach but it is bit of a tease since it is too rocky to go swimming. My kids did go jet skiing and had a good time.The rocky beach is the ONLY drawback to this hotel and not a big deal since it is lovely to sit on the beach and look at the scenery. My family ate at Tramonto's which was excellent and we went to the Mexican Fiesta at Del Lagos which was a lot of laughs and the buffet had a great selection of tasty Mexican food . The show was very enjoyable. We also ate at Havana Moon and Frida's. All of these restaurants have live bands or entertainment. For lunch we ate at Balaches Pool Side. The food was very reasonably priced. in all the restaurants. My only problem is with the price difference in the excursions. When you go to book these trips in the hotel lobby, there are two prices. One price if you do the timeshare presentation and the other price if you do not do the presentation. There was such a big difference in pricing that we did the presentation to save money since we are a family of 5. I am an RCI member and should get a discount without any presentation. I would recommend going to purchase the excursion tickets at Walwart. They have discounted tickets. I found this out too late. I would recommend doing the Xel-Ha Excursion and Tulum. We also spent the day on Cozumel and went to San Francisco Beach which was not worth the taxi fare or the ferry fare.This was not a pretty beach. They did have these big blow up things in the water and for $12 a person you could use them. Although the beaches are public and free, the restaurants will charge you for the chairs but if you eat their food, then there is no charge. We also went into Playa Del Carmen for shopping, breakfasts and dinner and to go to the beach. The beach here was very nice and relaxing. So if you are looking to stay at a nice, very big, elegant, relaxing resort, with plenty of options for meals, entertainment and activities and shopping this is the place for you. My family loved it and are a little sorry we did not take the timeshare presentation seriously since we already have one. The timeshare representatives were not pushy but were very nice. We told him up front we had no inclination to buy and that was okay. However, the deal they offered us was pretty darn good. Something which looks too good to be true probably is! Anyway, do not let the bad reviews stop you from staying here. Do your research on line and go to the Mayan Palace! We will be back one day in the future!", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place to go.

The kids were 10-almost 16. I called ahead of time and requested rooms close to the pool but they said rooms were assigned at check -in. We were lucky and got the last room in Building 4 and first room in building 5. We all had a great time and the food was really good. We loved the Mexican Rest., and the one by the beach. We brought food like oatmeal, cereal, pop tarts, chips, cans of chicken to make chicken salad, micro. meals, popcorn, etc. We also brought tea bags and coffee. The food prices are reasonable and the portions are huge. The hamburger is an 8 oz. which we shared several times. Water was $5 at one Rest. and $3 at another. We went to Mega and bought food and drinks. We took a cooler daily to the pool and they asked us just to cover it. The drinks at happy hour were 2 for 1 of the exact drink. The kids ordered virgin drinks during happy hour and loved it. We also took snacks daily to the pool as the kids get hungry alot. Pizza was very reasonable and very good. They also had daily food specials and a featured drink of the day 2 for 1 until 5. The rooms and resort were super clean and they give you new towels and beach towels daily. We did the jet ski tour and had a blast. The snorkel tour was not that great. The guides were good but it was a little pricey and is half that if you go into Playa and book. We did the Xplor tour (zip lines, cenote swimming, rafting, and ATV) and it was fantastic!!! It was $100 and worth every penny! Just the lunch spread was worth $50!!! There is water volleyball and sand volleyball and the nets are great. Plenty of shade or sun. The cabana's can be reserved for $35 a day but if you spend that on food or drinks it is reversed at the end of the week....make sure you ask for it!!!! When we checked in they asked us to do a timeshare presentation. We declined but they said if you do it, you will get 10% off all your food and huge discounts for the tour plus we will give your whole party a $25 /pp breakfast for free. So, my husband and I decided to take one for the team and the whole group got all the discounts on tours and food. We did the tour (The rest of our group ate breakfast and left) and it was like 3 hours total and high pressure. Breakfast was fantastic and the Xplor tour was discounted by $25/pp so that saved $300 just there. People were getting in the water at the resort but it is very rocky. IF you walk to the left about 15 min. there are no rocks. It is a but whippen of a walk but we did it twice. The waves were great! The sand is wonderful and the beach is beautiful. The resort has a nice pier to go out too and you can see fish. It is nice at night too. We all loved it and would go back. This is one of the nicest RCI exchanges we have ever done! Oh yeah, on Friday, I fell (talking to my friend and not paying attention....I tore ligaments in my ankle....the medics were there in less than 2 minutes! It was my high heel flip flops fault but the resort was wonderful in helping me!

I had read very negative remarks before my departure and this did upset us. However I read someones open minded view and that made me cheer up. The checkin and checkout was straight forward and simple. Be sure to try and request buildings 1-7 as the rest of the buildings are quite a way away from the lovely big pool (the biggest pool we have seen in any resort). As soon as you check in you do get hounded by the timeshare sales people. They do not tell you about the presentation immediately, but be warned. We did not attend as we had made that mistake before. I heard from most of the people that attended that it was very aggressive. They offer you all sorts to attend. Ranging from money (maximum we were offered was 1000 pesos, and 10% of all our meals and drinks on the resort. It is very tempting if you have 4hrs to waste and if you do not then simply keep saying NO. The rooms were lovely and spacious. We had a 2bed apartment in building 3-4. The only dissappointment I had, as I like to cook is that the kitchen is tiny. You also have only two rings tucked on the corner to prepare meals. If you like tea then I suggest you take a kettle and your own tea bags. The tea bags you get at the resort are very expensive. They have no kettle so we had to boil water in a pan, very hard indeed. The shop is called Jade botique and the supermarket in there is almost three times as much as the supermarket in Playa del carmen, Walmart and Mega. You do have a shuttle that runs for the main pergola every hour back and forth for 40 pesos each way. You can book excursions through these shuttle drivers. It is safe and cheaper than the hotel excursions. There is a fantastic lady at the reception of Concierge (information). Her name is Dulce she will really push the boat out for you to help you with information. If she does not know something she will make sure that she finds out and relays everything to you as promised. Visit her she is a must. The maid service comes twice a day one in the am and one in the pm. They are superb. Infact we loved mexico and the people in resort and on island. You will have a great time for sure. Ignore the comments about the beds. We found them very comfortable.There is a safe deposit box in your apartments be sure to use them. Lastly, you do not need to give them your credit card details if you are worried about card cloning. The way we did it was to open an account in cash and kept all our receipts to tally up each week.

It never felt crowded and we always got good shade and sun. The food and service at the pool was very good. In fact every meal we ate at the resort was very good and I did not find it too expensive as some of stated. Our room was a one room bedroom suite and was bigger then the pictures made it appear. The kitchen was enough since we were on vacation and didn't plan on cooking. Housekeeping service was outstanding, they came in twice a day so you always had plenty of fresh towels. In fact all service personal was very helpful and always smiling. For those that rate this place low because of the timeshare presentations...you shouldn't complain if you went since everyone knows how awful these can be and it is never worth the small discount offered. We were asked once and we said no thank you and was never asked again. I would never give up vacation time for a little discount. We as many others went into Playa and what a great town, reminds me of Cabo. I did not like Cancun, it was like going to Miami. We also went into Cozumel and that was a very nice day trip. Just do your research to know what to expect...if you want great service, food, pool, grounds, etc, you will love this place. If you want crowded, late night craziness, over priced stores...stay in Cancun.

Their was countless resturants such as Delago which was a buffet resturant, also Gong which was a Thai resturant, then there was Tramonto my favourite of all which was a Steak house/Italian. All the staff at the hotel where amazing with you, they will offer to do everything for you especially the waiters. The rooms were amazing we stayed in room 1199 in the Mayan Palace and we couldnt find one thing wrong with the room whatsoever. I will be booking a holiday here once I've got some time off work. Would recommend this holiday to a family or group of friends as the pool is huge and has two pool bars and the beach is right off the pool area where you can do a vast amount of watersports. There is also a little arcade that was situated in the boutique along with a small internet cafe also that was 40 pesos for 30 mins or 70 pesos for 1 hour. There was also a lovely wine bar with an external balcony which was beautiful at night to sit with the sea breeze yet still be red hot. Would recommend going to this hotel for your next holiday.

Another resort that gets way too many negative reviews. Again, we were hesitant to stay here due to some of the reviews, but the Mayan Palace worked out great for my family. We have been to Cancun area many times and this is our favorite place so far. Here is my 2 cents worth with a few tips: We were there from 6/13 -6/21 and were in building 6. We had the king suite/kitchen along with the 2 queen lockout side. So we had 2 bathrooms total. We booked it through RCI and my wife got a great last minute rate. We also shopped at WalMart and Mega (as did one of the previous posters stated) and felt that WalMart was way too crowded and dirty. We loved Mega, We spent about $200 for the 8 days on groceries, beer, vodka andrum.We cooked all breakfasts in the room. Try the chorizo sausage hanging in the deli at Mega. We made chorizo and mushroom omelets wrapped in tortillas, many fish tacos for lunch or dinner and also bought cereal, milk, lunchmeat, fresh vegetables, juice, etc. Nobody got sick at all, We ate at he resort only twice and that was at the smaller pool restaurant. Drinks were too expensive for us at the pool but we also took adantage of the 2 for 1 specials. We bought 2 styrofoam coolers for $5 each and kept them cold with ice from the ice machines at the building. I carried a cooler to the pool every day filled with beer, and other beverages. We did get caght by security at the pool and he was really cool and told us to keep the cooler covered up with a towel. So I did that all the time and never had an issue. We would still order a few drinks here and there and also tried the pizza at poolside. All the food and drinks were very good. We rented the cabanas at the pool. It cost $350 pesos (about $26 or so) but if you spend that much at the bar or on food, you get the money refunded. (*Check your bill on departure, they did not credit us for the cabanas until we noticed that it was on the final invoice) I would definately try to get in buildings 1 through 8 if I were to check in again. We had buiding 6, and is was as far as I wanted to carry the cooler down to the pool. They do have organized games and events near the pool. Also my teenaged girls loved the water arobics and sand volleyball. We all played a lot of water or pool volleyball. The pool is awesome like everyone says and the beach is really scenic, but rocky. I noticed some people were snorkeling right off the resort beach. We wanted to try it but never seemed to have time, or maybe we were just too relaxed at the pool! There is a real nice store/boutique on site as well. It is more expensive then the town stores, but it was nice to have it there for eggs, sweet rolls and even coffee. They sell clothing, jewelry, suntan lotion etc. Also there is a game room and internet available there. The internet available in the rooms is wireless and too expensive, in my opinion. It cost $15/24 hours or $95/week. (Get free wireless at Tequilla Barrel and some other bars in Playa). We never needed the laundry service but they do have it available. The rooms were really nice and large, maids awesome as reported here many times. The staff was great too. I brought about $75 in singles for tip money. We may save money buy eating in or booking our own tours, but we always tip. The workers depend on it as part of their income. One thing I don't agree with when reading some of the other reviews: We always rent a car. I have never had any problems driving around Cancun or Playa or anywhere else in Mexico. We pretty much drive the same speed that everyone else drives on the highway. Playa is kind of crowded downtown, but you just have to keep your eyes peeled and watch for many one way streets. Also, pedestians don't seem to mind if they get run over. So just watch all the pedestrian crossings. Downtown Cancun has really changed since the last time we were there. It was very crowded and I did not enjoy driving down therre at all! I would stay out of that area, but everywhere else was no problem at all. We paid $300 for a small 4 door Nissan. I made the mistake of not booking it online at carrentals.com (my favorite car rental site) and booked the car at the Alamo dealer at the Mayan Palace. I was told when we returned the car back to the airport, that it is much cheaper to rent right from the airport dealer than from the resort. Live and learn, but I was happy with the cost we paid and the car as well. We rove into Playa or Cancun several times just to eat, shop or site see. We hung out at the beach at Playa Del Carmen one day and we loved it there. Shopped and ate/drank of 5th ave. Bet on a couple baseball games at the sports book at Tequila Barrel on 5th ave. Drove ourselves to Xel-Ha, the aquatic eco park. If you go there you can buy tickets online and save about 10 bucks a person. You need to buy them a few days before you go. We paid $70/person and got the all inclusive. We spent all dat there and went early so we even had breakfast there. We have been to XCaret before but not on this trip. It is another awesome eco park. It was more money so we opted for Xel Ha. Next time we will try snorkeling in Acumal. Nice little town. Too bad I found out about it too late on the trip. Another really cool thin we did was did the \"Jungle tour\" from Cancun. You rent these small 2 seater runabout boats. They have 30 horse outboards on them. The guide takes you around the lagoon, then out to sea a bit. You join up with others and snorkel on a reef. It is our second time of trying this tour and everyone loved it.We went to the booth at Captains Cove restaurant. They wanted about $70/person, but I had 5 people and talked him down to $55/person. You can fit 3 people in the boat, if you have smaller kids. Acouple other tips I recommend would be to bring your own sunblock. It is about $20 minimum any where you try to buy it. Bring singles for tips. We even brought our own small salt/pepper shaker, spices, creamer, bug spray etc. We left our snorkle gear at home and used the rental at Xel Ha. It came with the all inclusive price. Bring a football or other ball for catch on the beach. Also a frisbee. Watch your suitcases if you take a cab or shuttle from the airport. Mine disappearred when we took the van shuttle a few years back. It was out on the sidewalk when we were loaded on the shuttle. But it never made it on the van so the driver or someone ran off with it. What a pain that was. There is this cool animal lurking in the jungle area off the path to the pool at the Grand Mayan. We think it is somekind of lemur. It is like a cross between a racoon and an ant eater. We only saw it twice but managed to get a video of it. Check out the Grand Mayan next door. You can walk through the store to get there. It looks like another awesome place to stay. Hope this review helps!

We were absolutely delighted with the resort. After some of the reviews I read, I definitely had some concerns, but now that we have been there ourselves, I\u2019d like to share our experience with other travelers. My goal is to write an honest review that will be helpful to anyone who is getting nervous over some of the negative comments about Mayan Palace. I apologize in advance if this review gives more details than you are looking for. My perspective may be different than some people's, because I have both traveled and lived overseas, and have seen the gamut of hotels available outside the U.S. I've experienced the good and the bad of traveling in Mexico, but I've found that a positive attitude is the #1 factor for having a good vacation. So my advice to any traveler is - do your research, plan wisely, and keep your expectations reasonable. We arrived in Cancun on Friday afternoon around 4:30pm. We had called the resort earlier in the week to request their airport shuttle, and they were right there to meet us, as scheduled. No problems, no hassles, and no charge. However, if you do choose to take the shuttle back to the airport for your return flight, there will be a charge of $15 per person. (We actually took a taxi for the return trip to the airport, because our plane left too early in the day for us to catch the shuttle, and the taxi ended up being cheaper for four people \u2013 around $40 total.) Once we arrived at the resort, our check-in was fast and easy. I read an earlier review which stated that the bellboys had stolen cameras/electronics from someone\u2019s luggage as they checked in. I\u2019m not sure how that could have happened, since the staff specifically told us to remove any cameras and electronics from our bags before we left them in the bellboys\u2019 care. In any case, you should not travel with ANY expensive or irreplaceable items in your suitcase. These items should always stay in your carry-on bags where no one else has access to them. That\u2019s just common sense, folks. We were approached by the time-share salesperson immediately after check-in. She was polite and didn\u2019t pressure us when we told her we were not interested in the time-share presentation. She did call our room twice during the course of our stay, to ask if we had changed our minds. All you have to do is say no, and they will leave you alone. The rooms at Mayan Palace are absolutely beautiful. We had a one-bedroom suite, with our sons sleeping on the couches in the living room. The beds were firm but very comfy. We did not have any trouble sleeping at night, and neither did our sons. I had to smile at reviewers who thought the beds were hard. Compared to hotel beds in Europe, these are extremely comfortable. We didn\u2019t have any trouble with noisy neighbors, either. The maid service is excellent at Mayan Palace. As others have reported, they came twice every day and provided superior service all week. They also stopped to chat in the evenings and were very kind and pleasant. We left good tips for them every day, because we really felt they earned them. It\u2019s true that you\u2019ll do quite a bit of walking from your room to the lobby. The walkways are beautiful, and golf carts are available for guests who prefer to ride - very convenient if you don\u2019t mind waiting for them. I enjoyed walking, but if you are in poor health or not willing to walk, you might want to choose a resort where everything is closer to your door. The pools are everything you\u2019ve heard or dreamed about, and more. They\u2019re the best part of the Mayan Palace. The water was pleasantly warm, which we found delightful (though I know my British friends prefer their pools a little colder). Plenty of lounge chairs and palapas, and we loved the fact that the pools were open 24 hours a day. We enjoyed swimming late every night. The resort provides towel service when you present your plastic towel cards. (Don\u2019t lose these cards or you will have to pay 300 pesos, per card, at checkout.) I\u2019ve read several comments about the rocky beach at this resort. It\u2019s true; the beach is very pretty but too rocky to swim in. We followed the advice of others on this forum and walked 10-15 minutes to the left of the beach. There we found the most beautiful beach to swim in \u2013 no rocks, plenty of lounge chairs, and sparkling aqua-colored water. Be sure to find this beach; you won\u2019t be sorry. We ate a few meals at the resort \u2013 one dinner at Havana Moon (on the beach), and one lunch and one dinner at Balche (next to the pool). We also ordered room service one evening. For us, the prices were high enough that we didn\u2019t feel we could afford to eat every meal at the resort. But the quality and quantity of the food was very good, and the service was excellent. I guess it boils down to how many people there are in your party, and how much money you are accustomed to paying in restaurants. Making our own meals was a better option for us. It\u2019s true that the kitchen is small and not extravagantly equipped, but we managed to cook most of our meals in the room, and this saved us quite a bit of time and money. There are two small burners which worked fine for cooking. There is also a blender, a toaster, a microwave, and a coffeemaker. The refrigerator is small, but was fine for our groceries. We found a large dish drainer tray under the sink, as well as a sponge and dishwashing soap. The kitchen came with a few pots, a small cutting board, a corkscrew, a garlic press, a manual can opener, one spatula and cooking spoon, one large glass serving bowl, one large carving knife, and enough eating utensils, plates, cups, bowls and glasses for six people. There were also six wineglasses and a plastic pitcher. We had to purchase small kitchen knives, paper towels and napkins, extra trash bags, and a cheese grater. There was an empty salt shaker, but of course you will have to buy the salt and pepper. We also bought a couple of plastic containers to store our leftovers. We did our shopping at the Mega Market in Playa del Carmen. (There is also a Wal-Mart in Playa, but we found it to be much dirtier and more crowded than we were comfortable with.) The Mega is huge, clean, reasonably priced, and beautiful \u2013 so pleasant that we actually took photos in there! Both the Mega Market and the Wal-Mart accept American dollars or major credit cards, so you won\u2019t need pesos to shop at either place. Both stores carry many familiar American brands. As others have noted, it costs 40 pesos per person to take the resort shuttle into Playa, and 40 more pesos for the return trip. For four people, that was around $24 for the round trip. It was worth that price for the convenience and the certainty of where and when we could always find a ride. I do not recommend that you rent a car during your stay. I realize that many people do this with no problems whatsoever, but there are risks involved, and you must ask yourself if these risks are worth the convenience of having your own wheels. We heard some horror stories of Americans staying at Mayan Palace who were stopped and essentially robbed by local police demanding large sums of money for non-existent traffic violations. I speak fluent Spanish, but even with that advantage, I would not want to deal with the local police in this kind of situation. And if you do NOT speak Spanish, it would be very tough indeed. So if you\u2019re comfortable taking the risk of renting a car, make sure you know enough Spanish to get yourself out of any scrapes with the police. The cashless system at Mayan Palace works very well. You simply charge everything to your room and pay your bill at the end of your stay. I liked the fact that we didn\u2019t have to carry money around with us, but be careful \u2013 as with credit cards, you can end up spending way more than you planned, if you don\u2019t keep track of your daily charges. I wrote down every single charge and compared it with the bill when we checked out, to make sure we hadn\u2019t been billed incorrectly. All their charges agreed with ours \u2013 in fact, they did not charge us the 100 pesos per visit which they said was the cost of using the gym. My husband used the gym several times but was never charged for those visits. The Jade Boutique has pretty much everything you may need in the way of gifts, clothing, toiletries, and snacks. Prices are much higher than the Mega Market, but if you get in a bind, it\u2019s nice to have a store there at the resort. They stay open till 11:00pm, which is very convenient. This boutique also has internet access on resort-provided computers. The price is 40 pesos per half hour. We appreciated being able to check our e-mail and send messages back home. The on-site laundromats worked very well for us. You can buy tokens (at the concierge desk in the lobby) for the washing machines and dryers. 80 pesos gets you one wash and one dry, plus a small packet of detergent. We had to buy two tokens for the dryer, however, to get our clothes dry enough. The laundry rooms were clean and air-conditioned, which I thought was a nice touch. We used the resort\u2019s travel service to take two excursions \u2013 to Xel-Ha and Chichen Itza. The prices were reasonable and our trips were excellent. The advantage to booking inside the resort is that you meet your bus right near the lobby, and you won\u2019t have to stop at seventeen other resorts on the way to your site. We felt that the tours arranged by Mayan Palace were much better organized than tours we\u2019ve taken from other companies in Cancun. The service was better, too. Many people have commented on how friendly and helpful the staff at the Mayan Palace is, and that is completely true. They go out of their way to make the guests feel comfortable and at home. I believe this is the friendliest staff I\u2019ve encountered in all my travels. To be honest, it helps if you speak their language. As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019m blessed to be fluent in Spanish, and it was a joy to communicate with all the nice folks at Mayan Palace. But even if you can only say a few words, they will encourage you and appreciate your efforts. So it\u2019s a wise investment of your time for you to buy a dictionary and learn a few Spanish words and phrases. Your life will be richer for that, and so will your time in Mexico. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy the Mayan Palace as much as we did. We had an incredible vacation, and we\u2019re all so glad we didn\u2019t let a few negative comments spoil our trip.

As you can see, this property gets mixed reviews and I was afraid that we were going to get a lousy room located in a lousy location at the resort. I called a couple of days prior to our arrival per the Global instructions to set up transportation and request a room fairly close to the pool. They sent an e-mail confirming our transportation with specific instructions which must be followed or you risk getting dragged into a time-share presentation from hell. Lots of people at the airport will tell you they are the ride you are looking for but you must find the person from the Mayan Palace/ Grand Mayan! Once finding the right person, we were quickly on our way. Check in at the hotel was quick and they honored our room request. We weren't super close but less than a five minute walk to the wonderful pool area. This is a timeshare property so you will get asked to see their presentation. Lots of people are turned off by this but it is what it is. They gave us a free buffet breakfast for all five of us (about a $100 value I think), a 1000 peso credit on our bill, 10% off of our resort bill (food, drink, ...) and special tour package pricing (which we didn't use). For us, the three hours overall (one hour of pain) was worth it, but if the hard sales pitch turns you off, then just skip it. For the rest of the review, I'll give you our bullet points: - The staff is super friendly - the best part of the resort. My kids and I practiced the little bit of Spanish that we know and they were very helpful and always friendly. - We felt very secure there. They keep track of you every time you leave and enter the property and there are plenty of security personnel walking around the grounds at all times. - The rooms could use a little updating (TV's and beds mostly) but they are super clean and the maid/turndown service are excellent. - Resort pricing for food/beverage aren't nearly as bad as I was expecting based on other reviews. Compared to other resorts I've been to it was less than average prices. The food was good, not great but the drinks were excellent. 2 for 1 drinks at the pool everyday from 1100-1300 make it a better value. - The staff were great in helping us plan some activitites (mostly beaches and snorkeling). We saved about 1/2 by planning our own trips and using cabs/rental car instead of buying the resort packages. For two or three you might be just as well off to buy the package but with five of us it was more economical to plan it ourselves. - Alamo Rental Car is right in the lobby which is very convienient. The prices were descent and driving there is a piece of cake. - As you've probably read, the pool area is awesome. The beach area itself is very nice. You need water shoes to goof around in the water at the beach which we didn't have but we snorkled right off the beach there and had a good time (they are trying to get a reef going about 50 meters off the beach - not a lot of coral yet but good fish). Lastly, I'll tell you a little about our day trips: - We spent one afternoon at Playa de Carmen. Nice town but a little touristy. It had a very nice beach and Wal Mart is there so you can stock up your fridge for the week. - We rented a car and went to Xel-Ha (pronounced Shell Ha) for a day. It's a natural water park and we all had a great time. We bought the all inclusive day which included most of the park attracions (Dolphin/Manatee swim are extra) plus food and drinks. If I were to do it again, I would get there when it opens so you can have breakfast included, too. We bought our tickets on-line and saved $$$. It was a lot of fun. - We spent a day a Puerto Morales which is a state park reef about 10km N. of the resort. We walked down the beach to the north of where the cab drops you off and payed to rent an umbrella for the day and for a 2 hour snorkel trip with a guide. Lots of locals there. It was a great family day. - We went to Akumal for a day and it was the highlight of the trip. It was described as what Playa de Carmen was 10 years ago and I believe it. It's a very small town with an absolutely beautiful beach and great snorkeling right from the beach. There is supposedly another snorkeling area on the north side of the town but we were having such a great time at the beach, we never made it there. We saw stingrays, a spotted eagle rays and lots of giant turtles. The kids loved swimming with the turtles! Anyway, we had a very nice time and certainly return without hesitation.

very big place. we were greeted by bell boys who took our luggage while we went to check-in. there were timeshare reps hanging about but they didn't bother me and my two friends. check-in was a breeze, you need to give them a credit or debit card to open up a tab with the hotel and to ensure you don't wreck the room or steal anything etc. this is a cashless resort, you sign for absolutely everything but nothing gets charged to your card until you sign out. you can even use a different card, several cards if travelling in different groups or just cash when you sign out. they give me a credit limit of 6000 pesos when I checked-in and when you exceed this they put a letter in your room asking you to go to reception to extend it - i found this was a useful method of keeping track of what we where spending. we stayed in building 7 which is pretty much beside the lobby but about a brisk 5 minute walk to the pool/bars/restaurants/shop. we didn't mind the walk but for those of you who do there is a small shuttle that drives up the back of the hotel and takes you to and from the pool. really impressed with the grounds of the hotel, really well maintained. the staff are also super friendly. in the 5 minute walk from our room to the pool we would walk past about 10 maids / handy men / gardeners and every one of them would smile and say hello. the room itself was spacious and clean, we stayed in a 2 bedroom unit which was really two rooms (3085 and 3086) joined together. one bedroom has a massive kingsize/queensize bed and ensuite bathroom. the other bedroom has two beds with an ensuite bathroom. both rooms were connected to an open living area with sofas, tv and partial kitchen (had fridge, oven hobs only, microwave, sink). the beds were quite hard so I found using the pillows from the sofas ontop of the bed worked quite well. the 2 bedroom unit supposedly sleeps up to 8 people but i'd say this would be a squeese. 6 would be fine though. the pool is massive, not very deep (say around 5 feet in the deep parts) though. there are two bars in the pool that you can swim up to and order drinks. the beach is right beside the pool, plenty of sun loungers to relax in but access to the sea was somewhat limited by the rocks. you could still walk on the rocks (carefully) but i didn't see anyone swimming while i was there. the bar food during the day was great, you could get anything from pizzas, burgers, sandwiches to mexican food like burrittos or tachos. food and drink in the bars and restaurants was a bit steep. a meal for one would cost about 220 pesos / 18 usd / 13 gbp. drinks weren't cheap either, a 330 ml can of corona was 50 pesos / 4 usd / 3 gbp. ish. happy hour at the pool was early - around 11am to 12pm. two for one drinks during this hour. there was a second happy hour between 11pm and 12am in a different bar but we never went. every bar and restaurant bill has an extra 15% added onto it as a tip, so you do not need to carry cash to tip the waiters. we did leave tips for the maids who come in twice a day, once to clean the room and make the beds and the second time in the evening to turn down the beds and leave chocolates on the pillow. we left a couple of dollars each day on the table. we opted most nights to go into Playa del Carmen, a shuttle bus runs every couple of hours up to 6pm into Playa Del Carmen. it costs 40 pesos / 3 usd / 2.30 gbp each for a single journey. they also do shuttles from Playa Del Carmen back to the hotel for the same price, the last shuttle back was at 9pm however. we haggled a taxi from Playa to the hotel down to 180 pesos but gave him 200 pesos (includding tip). if there are a couple of you then this is the best way to get back to the hotel after 9pm. the shop or \"boutique\" in the hotel was pretty expensive as well. we decided to get the shuttle into Playa Del Carmen and walk to Wall-Mart one of the days to stock up on water and other things. its a bit of a walk so we didn't get much. other stuff internet costs 40 pesos for 30 minutes laundry costs 80 pesos for two tokens and a pouch of detergent (1 wash and 1 dry token) I wouldn't recommend using the phone in the rooms, I called the UK for a total of 15 minutes and the bill came to about 70 gbp. room service was cheaper than eating in the restaurant, we did this two nights.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose", "Title": "\u201cSuccessful and Fun All Girls Trip!\u201d", "Author": "Daru", "ReviewID": "UR65520115", "Content": "Just did a week long bachelorette party at the Mayan Palace. Most of the reviews on this place are pretty accurate. Most of our group actually stayed at the Mayan Palace in Nuevo Vallarta a few years ago so we kind of knew what to expect. Rooms: 1 room w/King & full bath, shares bath with living rm/kitchen with two couches that convert to beds and an additional room with 2 double beds and full bath. Beds are hard and if you are sensative to it not even the extra egg crates will help. Sleeping on the couch beds actually did the trick for those needing a softer sleeping area. Rooms were all clean and great working condition. Kitchen is weak, but it was fine. Pools/Beach: Pools beautiful...sometimes could use some extra cleaning. Pool bars were fine. Make sure if you drink, they do have \"house\" brands (cheapest)....but after a few days we realized when they were asking us if we wanted this brand or that brand....they were \"upgrading\" our drinks without us knowing it. If you plan on food/drink service during the day....make sure you order something if the server comes around the first time. If you don't it becomes difficult to flag them down. Beach is beautiful, but rocky. I would recommend going into Playa and spending a few dollars on a beach chair at one of the resturant/beach clubs like Fusion or Blue Parrot for the day so you can get the full \"walk into the aqua water\" thing going on. Restaurants: Frida was okay. Havana Moon, strange and really didn't enjoy it.....though the bar area by the beach was lovely. Ordering food poolside was fine, but we really liked the deli and crepe place in the \"general store\" area. A few of us are vegetarians and they had some great selections of crepes and sandwiches that everyone enjoyed. On site entertainment: Though they don't have any info about this online, the gym offers classes all day long. Yoga, Pilates, Spinning, Zumba, etc....great selection and the gym over looks the ocean! Nice! We only utilized the spa services to get massages poolside, but heard nice things about it. There always seemed to be a ton of people in the water for volleyball and aerobics. We did do Karaoke night, but their song selection is WEAK! and they also had a Casino night, but we didn't attend it. Other then that, we really wished there was more onsite for evening entertainment. At the Mayan in Nuevo Vallarta resort they had a great bar with pool tables and dancing, etc. We never had to go anywhere! Transportation: The shuttle from airport to hotel was great. We had several women showing up from all different airports and all different days and times. Coordinating everything was made very easy by the hotel. For those that come in during very busy times, it can be difficult to find the staff. What I would say is to look for the \"staff\" member. There are tons of shuttles and buses, don't be distracted by them, look for a \"person\" with the Mayan Palace logo on their shirt. The hotel will give you specific instructions when you set up for the pick up. DON'T pay a taxi $80 to take you to the hotel. Coming back from hotel is only $30 to airport, so keep that in mind if you want to negotiate a cab. My last recommendation is to find and hire ALEX in taxi #726. He is based out of the Mayan and the guys at the front of the hotel know him (email me and I'll send you his phone number if you want to talk to him directly...or hire him for the day). ALEX was awesome and made our little group of ladies feel safe and cared for. Not only would he drive us to where we wanted to go, he would take the extra time to show us where everything we were looking for was, land marks to look for, areas not to go into and was ALWAYS there to pick us up as promised. Our late nights into Playa del Carmen always felt safer as he would stay in the area and was never more then 10 mins away to pick us up! He would always tell us if we had ANY problems just to call him for anything.

This resort is very clean. The rooms are a nice size. We had a 1 bedroom/1 bath with kitchen. The kitchen is really small. I am not too sure how you could cook dinner on their 2 burner stove you have in the room. But I am sure you could make it work if you needed too. The maids were very nice. I never had any problems with things coming up missing. We stayed in building 15, which was about a 5 minute walk to the front desk and about 15 walk to the pool. Sometimes we walked around the resort and sometimes we took their little tram to the pool, restaurants, and room. Things I was unhappy about:1) I asked to have a room up by the pool when I made the reservations. I even called the day before checking-in just to make sure everything was fine. However, when we got there they had us in building 15. We tried to be moved and was told we could the following day when a room became avalible, but it never happened. 2)The Fiesta night was way over priced. For two people it was $150. The food was just ok and the show was nothing special. The other restaurnts they have are also just ok. They do not have authentic food. Also, you need to make reservations to go and you can only do that with one person. It took me 4 days to finally make the reservations. I wish I had never done that. 3) If you reserve a tour outside from the hotel be awear. Not all tour buses can come into the resort. We had to walk about 15 minutes from the lobby to get outside of the gates to get on our tour. 4) This was also our honeymoon so I had ordered strawberries and a fruit basket for our room. It never came. I called and talked to the front desk and they said that the order was placed. However, they could not explain why it was never delievered.

We were fortunate in being able to enjoy a suite with two bedrooms plus sleeping accommodation in the lounge area so the suite can accommodate at least 6 adults with ease. Visitors should note that there two main resorts on the site - the other one (The Grande Mayan) is newer and offers slightly higher grade rooms and is also being expanded with some luxury rooms as well. Both resorts share facilities like restaurants and some of the swimming pools and golf courses. Overall, the standard of accommodation and facilities is very high and we were very impressed and pleased. Some points to note:- 1. Our rooms were out overlooking the golf course and thus a few minutes walk from Reception and about 5-10 minutes from the main pool area which has most restaurants and the shop. If you don't feel up to the walk, the hotel offers a fairly frequent shuttle service operated by electric carts. 2. Check your bill - we had two items on our bill which belonged to others. Reception soon remedied the errors but their cash-less system is not fool-proof! 3. Don\u2019t use the credit card phones in the room. We had to ring our bank and was landed with a GBP60 bill for a 15 minute call back to the UK. If your bank does not accept return charges \u2013 use your mobile, its much cheaper! 4. The sales pitch for the new resort units is stated to be \"about an hour\" and currently includes a free breakfast and a cash rebate on you bill as inducement to attend. The benefits were worth the time but our session easily went to 3 hours before we called a halt. 5. The resort is about 15minutes north of Playa del Carmen and there is a mini-bus service linking the two. We used this several times to visit the Wal-Mart and local supermarket as well as Playa itself - its just much easier than trying to find parking and is reasonably priced. 6. We hired a car for a few days from the on-site car rental (Alamo) which worked well and allowed us to self-drive to Chichen Itza and take two days. We stayed locally to the site which allowed us to walk in to the ruins first thing in the morning when it is both cooler and far less crowded. Highly recommended.

The pool is huge and most people seem to congregate around it. the beach was good with ample chairs and tents. but, if you do not have rubber sandals (not flip flops, sandals that have multiple straps) you will not be able to go in the ocean. there are rocks on rocks. the water was warm and clear so it was worth the effort. There are four restaurants that are not considered High end. People are dressed in business casual and swim suits. Dinner for 2 averaged $100. this included one drink apeice and an appetizer. The guacomole is to die for. There are two other nicer restaurnats which we did not try and did not hear of anyone that had eaten in them. The menus are not child friendly but ok for adults. The food was well prepared but started to taste the same. The Mayan is 25 to 60 minutes from Playa del Carmen, depending on traffic. There are shuttle buses (40 pesos/person) that run fairly regularly from the lobby to Playa. There are cabs galore, 200 pesos for the trip, 4 people max. After paying $9 for a bag of pretzles at the Mayan \"grocery\", we found a trip to Wal Mart, in playa in order. There is a fridge and microwave in the room so we found that eating breakfast and lunch in the room worked better than eating all the restaurant food. In playa, there is eating and shopping galore. The restaurants are varied in menu and price. Prices are what you would expect in a tourist trap town. There are cigar stores galore with over priced Cubans, but good prices on Mexican cigars, which are very good. There are numerous outings offered by the Mayan. we did not try any because most were 10 -12 hours in length and we did not want to spend that much time. Most excursions were in the neighborhood of $100/person but deals can be found, especially if you want to sit thru another time share offering. Mexican night at the Del Largo was very uneven. the Mariachi band was good. the Main show was like amateur hour. The buffet was excellant and varied. Would not go again but was worth the one show. the grounds are beautiful. the golf course looked interesting but never saw it being used. The beds are hard as a rock, pillows the same. the couchs act as abed and are harder than the beds if possible. the sitting is uncomfortable, not a comfortable chair in the place. the couchs are so deep that you must use pillows to get comfortable.

We were in building 12, which was a pleasant 10 minute walk through a garden path to the beach. Pool was beautiful and there was a dive shop on site. Friendly, helpful staff. Because of some walking, this may not be a good choice for a frail or handicapped traveler, but you don't have to be an Olympic athlete to enjoy this resort. I would not want to remain at the resort all day, but it is a great place to return to after enjoying the many sights and activities in the area. We had a car, and enjoyed driving to tour Chitzen Itza (2 hours) & Tulum (1 hour), and ate dinner and strolled in Avenida Cinco in Playa del Carmen (30 minutes) every night (parking was no problem at the end of Constitucion Ave). Cozumel is a ferry ride away, but is very touristy compared to charming Playa del Carmen. Every restaurant in Playa was excellent, and there is a Mega supermarket nearby. We did not eat at the resort. Numerous Eco parks with zip lines and snorkeling are within a 30 minute drive. We dove the Cenotes (recommend Hidden Worlds eco park for diving, snorkeling zip lines, etc) and lunched in Playa Aventura, which has great little restaurants and is built around dolphin pools. On two mornings, a Coatimundi (see photo) visited us on our first floor balcony. This was one of the best vacations we have ever taken. The only down side was a slighly musty odor in the room, and a $7 a day, per person charge for the gym.

At the front desk, they did say that you would be charged, however, no one ever approached me for my name or room number, so I was never charged extra. There are about 5 or 6 restaurants at the hotel, so we had tried something different each night. The Del Lago restaurant had the MOST AMAZING breakfast buffet. Try the mexican hot chocolate!! The best! It's pricey, but the food is so good and authentic. The rooms are ok, nothing fancy, but comfortable. Many had suggested not going to the sales pitch. We went through it and ended up not buying anything, however by going through the presentation, we still did get great discounts on different tourist activities that we booked through the front desk, transportation included. So I personally felt that going through the 5 hour sales pitch was worth it. My husband used the golf course, it's a par 3, but very beautiful. All in all, I loved my stay at the resort.

The Grand Mayan next door on same property is definitely a Gold Crown. The only issue I had was the rooms. The beds were the hardest beds I have ever slept on. We asked for 6 additional blankets and slept on them to make the bed more comfortable. The maids saw this and added a foam pad. Both helped a little. The pillows where the worst, very hard and had a sore neck every morning. The rooms were very out dated. We also stayed at the Westin Lagunamar where we were able to get a good night sleep in the heavenly beds. I would rate the Westin a 9 out of 10 and Mayan Palace 6.5. Big difference since they are both Gold Crowns. Aside from the rooms we had a wonderful time. The pool is amazing and one of the best I have seen. The layout enables enough chairs for everyone pool side. There was never a problem finding a chair next to the pool, not always the case at a resort during spring break. The palapas were great when you wanted some shade. If you wanted a palapa with a bed they were $35 per day or free if you spent $35 on food and drink. Not hard to do. We used one with a table which was free. I would have gotten one with the bed but it was harder than the bed in the room. The pool is spread out so it does seem crowded. Also the shallow parts in the middle of the pool were great for the kids or lay on to get some sun while in the pool. The beach was nice to lay out or play volley ball. Not much for swimming. We walked 15 minutes north to a great beach. I wish we found it earlier in the week. The kids loved it! We did see a sting ray off the peer. The beds on the beach were free and were much more comfortable. The waiters also served on the beach as well as the pool. The service was excellent. The check in and out was very quick. Concierge service was excellent. We had a problem with the toaster and a new one was brought down immediately. The location really depends on what you want to do. I found it more convenient than cancun for some activities. We went to some conetos, zip lining and Tulum which are closer than from Cancun. It's also only 15 minutes to Playa Del Carma which is a great Mexican Town. Much better than Cancun. The only issue with the specific location is the beach since isn't a swimming beach. We also played the par 3 golf course was is very well maintained. The only issue with the golf course is why Jack Nicklaus put a sand trap in the middle of a green. Jack I shouldn't be penalized for hitting the ball 10' from the pin.:) The restaurants food and service were good.

One week at the Sunset Lagoon, Cancun. Two weeks at the Mayan Palace, Mayan Riviera. One week at the Weston Regina Raintree Vacation Club, Cancun. All of these resorts were worth staying at; however none were perfect for the vacations my wife and I really love. If you\u2019re the least bit familiar with how Cancun is laid out, you\u2019ll know it is shaped like the number seven (7) with the vertical line running north and south and the horizontal east to west. The top and the right side of the seven are the Caribbean Sea and the left interior of the seven are a large lagoon. Sunset Lagoon resort was obviously on the lagoon side of Cancun. The resort was very clean and the staff was attentive. We stayed with Cousins this first week in a two bedroom suite that was extremely spacious. We had elevator access to the second floor entrance to the suite which opened up to a nicely appointed first floor living area, eating area and kitchenette. There was even a full bath in this area. A door on the left after entering led to a very large bedroom with its own bathroom. Two king sized beds and a hot tub / Jacuzzi right in the bedroom. Both bathrooms had beautiful marble tiled showers with plenty of hot and forceful water pressure. Our only complaint with the lower part of this unit was there was no balcony to sit outside. Just inside the entrance of the unit was the stairs to the second floor bedroom. Just saying this room was large doesn\u2019t do it justice. The king sized bed was dwarfed in this room which also included its own hot tub / Jacuzzi, plus chaise and sitting area along with its beautiful marble tiled bathroom. What the downstairs lacked in balconies the upstairs made up for it. The space was huge with table and chairs and lounges. Although we prefer staying on the ocean side of Cancun the resort does have beachside sunbathing on the lagoon. Two large pools one with the prerequisite swim up bar were clean and large enough not to get very crowded. The resort also has a light and airy restaurant and a separate bar and lounge with live music. Being long time Cancun visitors we have our favorite restaurants. Almost directly across the roadway from Sunset is our favorite Italian restaurant. Down a winding driveway next to the Casa Maya resort is a small eatery that sits on the beach called Dolce Mente Pompeii. It\u2019s owned and operated by a family from Italy and must be the quaintness Italian restaurant ever. Their menu is mostly homemade pasta\u2019s, pizza and fish. In all the many times we have visited it, never have we been disappointed. If you go by bus, just ask the driver to let you off at Casa Maya. When you get off the bus don\u2019t forget to turn around to see the most magnificent flag you may have ever seen. It is without a doubt the largest flag I have ever seen. I\u2019m told that there are three flags in the country the size of this one. One in Mexico City and I think the other is in Acapulco. I\u2019ve been in Cancun when the flag had been changed and it takes a company of soldiers to raise and lower it. Quite a sight. One other restaurant worth mentioning is La Palapa Belga. Probably the most charming restaurant in Cancun, it\u2019s a little hard to find. Especially if you take the busses as we like to. For your first visit it\u2019s better to take a taxi. The restaurant is located on the lagoon side aptly named the lagoona section. It\u2019s on another winding road to the lagoon past many condos. Once there, you\u2019ll be seated on a wooden deck right on the water or if you prefer under the giant palapa away from the elements. The restaurant is lit with somewhat ambient lighting and music from Sinatra, Buble\u2019 and the like softly permeate throughout. Then there is the food !!!!! Seared roasted duck breast with black cherry sauce, rack of lamb, prime meats and seafood. This place is not only romantic but a gastronomical paradise. Possibly the best chef in Cancun. No matter how many weeks vacation we stay we eat here at least once a week. If I were only going to be in Cancun for one week I would eat there three times, it\u2019s that good. Of course there are many good restaurants in Cancun; Ruth Chris steak house is always the best for beef. Our second and third weeks were at The Mayan Palace in the Mayan Riviera. If the Sunset Lagoon was a true three star resort in their accommodations the Mayan Palace would have to be two and a half stars. The resort was very clean and as with the Sunset Lagoon, housekeeping came every day. Rooms were odor free, non-smoking and comfortable. The Mayan Palace is a huge place. So expansive if you\u2019re in one of the far from the pool or beach area units there are shuttles to take you to your destination. In any case be prepared to walk. It\u2019s hard to tell exactly how many pools there are, at least seven very large pools that spill one into the other. Being in the Riviera between Cancun and Playa Del Carman you become locked into your resort. As such restaurants and entertainment become an important part of the resort and the Mayan Palace does not disappoint. There are five or six restaurants plus snack bars to satisfy your hunger. The second floor restaurants over the large boutique and sundry store were very good. Besides all the walking our only complaint was the beach or lack of rock free entry to the water. Lots of sand for sun bathing but very rocky at the edge of the water. There was not even a dock for the tour boats to embark people. They had to back the boats into the beach and customers would have to negotiate the rocky bottom then be physically lifted into the boats between the two outboard motors. The resort also has a very nice 18 hole par 3 golf course. This is not a chip and put course. With the exception of your driver you\u2019ll need all your clubs. This is a Nicklaus designed course that\u2019s in very good condition and challenging even for better golfers. If you are looking for a true four star resort the Grand Mayan Resort is for you. Different from but located on the same property as the Mayan Palace and shares some of the amenities, i.e. Restaurants, pools, beach. The Grand Mayan is an adventure in luxury. With its own pool area and separate amenities and flora it is absolutely gorgeous. Our fourth week was spent at the Weston Regina, Raintree Vacation Club in the very southern part of Cancun. The room we stayed in was lovely. It was a fifth floor ocean front with a very nice balcony that included a hottub/jaccuzi and hammock with wonderful sliding doors and wooden shutters that completely opened the bedroom up to the beach and ocean, just beautiful. It was a lockout. The hotel itself was very clean but resort amenities were lacking. Only one restaurant on the premises and it was not very good. It never ceases to amaze me how at the breakfast buffet they can cut up hot dogs and call them sausages. There was a snack bar at the pool and beach area but nothing was cooked there. When you ordered something the staff would have to run back to the restaurant place the order and wait for it, then run back to the snack bar to deliver it, very inefficient. The help congregated in the pool area and either danced to the music at the makeshift DJ table or played kickball by the pool. Once a day a waiter would come to the beach lounges to see if you wanted a cocktail. Speaking of the beach. Past storms had decimated the beach area to the point of having two different beach levels separated by a four foot cliff. All in all, even though we liked our apartment I don\u2019t think we would stay there again. One more word of advise. Don\u2019t be talked into purchasing anything. If you\u2019re there already why would you. There are better and much cheaper time shares if so inclined.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cUpsetting experience at the Mayan Palace.\u201d", "Author": "Chelsea014", "ReviewID": "UR59972907", "Content": "We stayed at the Mayan Palace during March Break and left very unhappy. It was our first time in that part of Mexico and we were very excited to go to the Palancar Reef in Cozumel. We read that the hotel offered a snorkeling excursion to two reefs in Cozumel so we called the travel desk to ask if Palancar was one of the reefs. If so, we said we would definitely do the excursion through the hotel. We were assured that the tour did, indeed, go to Palancar Reef. The next morning my husband went and spoke personally to the manager of the travel desk and repeated our condition that we would only book the excursion if it went to that particular reef. If not, we would simply get there on our own as we had done that week with Xcaret, Xel-ha and Explor. My husband explained that we had been told by many friends that Palancar is the most beautiful reef, teeming with exotic fish and coral that has holes that one can even swim through. We researched it on the Internet and were very excited to go there. It was to be the highlight of our trip. The manager confirmed that we would definitely be going to the Palacar Reef. We payed $400 for the four of us (transportation and lunch were included) and booked it for our last day. On the Saturday morning we left for Cozumel and you can probably guess where this is going. When we finally got on the snorkel boat and were on our way to the reefs, we were informed of the names of the two reefs we would be visiting. NEITHER WAS THE PALANCAR REEF! I was so angry that they used their mobile to call the people who organized the trip from the boat. The man I talked to flatly denied that the snorkel boat was ever supposed to go to that reef. They agreed that Palancar is the best reef but they said they didn't go to that one. In an effort not to ruin it for the others, I tried to make the best of the day. However, my family all agreed that the reefs we were taken to were horrible. There was hardly any coral or fish to see. And this was Cozumel, which is supposed to be rated second best next to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia!! My family had done better snorkeling and scuba diving in the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos and St. Thomas! Needless to say, when we got back to the hotel that evening, we went to the front desk to complain and ask for at least half of our money back. The manager of the travel desk wasn't there but his employee called him on the phone and let us speak to him. To our disgust, the manager lied and said they he never said that the tour would go to that particular reef. My husband then took the phone and told him that he had indeed promised that we would be taken to Palancar Reef. He reminded him of specific part of their conversation but the man continued to lie through his teeth. We then went and asked for the manager of the Mayan Palace. His assistant promised to sort things out for us. Unfortunately this consisted of him calling the manager of the travel desk and going through the same process that we had just done! He hung up the phone and informed us that the travel manager denied what we were saying! It was all so ridiculous and ended with them completely refusing to refund us any money. We felt completely cheated and could not believe the absolute lack of honesty and fairness. The manager of the travel should be fired and the hotel should have done the right thing, which was to refund half if not all of our money for our wasted and devastatingly disappointing last day. All this and I'm only now getting to the fact that the beds at the hotel were as hard as boards and the beach is so rocky that you cannot even swim in it.

I have been to Mexico several times, once in a Mayan Palace on the Pacific coast. This resort chain likes immense grounds and layout. Our daily walk to the beach/pool/restaurant/shop was about 3/4 mile, which we enjoyed, but can be tiring if done several times a day. A sporatic golfcart shuttle is available. However, the distance from activities meant a quiet night - the only noise from late revelers in the stone lined hallways, which amplified sound. This place is immaculate with beautiful landscaping and pools. The staff are pleasant, speak English and helpful. The accommodations roomy with a sitting room/kitchenette, firm king bed with good reading lights and 2 bathroom sinks. Plenty of storage with 2 closets and large dresser and plenty of chairs. Food in restaurants was good, fresh, mainly Mexican, but not your Taco Bell stuff. Plenty to choose from at the buffet. The BIG minus here was the cost of everything at the resort. Nothing was free, and as you were captive, twice the price if you had gone into town. You paid to use the internet, the gym, the spa. Shuttles into Playa are run by a taxi company and not by the hotel and therefore not free. A cheap town bus service runs along the highway, but it is a long walk to the stop. There is a daily fee tacked to your bill for servicing the room (whatever that is). Breakfast buffet was 200 pesos. If you only wanted coffee, an 8 oz ceramic cup for 2 was 70 pesos. The other big minus was one could not swim in the ocean as the beach is covered with large rocks - hence no water sports on site. The pools must cover several acres and are crystal clear with swim up bars. As we were guests of friends and do not know what the actual cost of the Mayan Palace was, adding that to what we spent there would have made this our most expensive holiday to date.

Got this resort through a timeshare I own with RCI points Found Cancun airport absolutely crazy, took around 2 hours just to clear customs and get to our ground transport. Ran a gauntlet of \" helpful people\" who were all timeshare salespeople. Generally found this are much more crowded than the West Coast, did a lot of standing in line for everything. Mayan Grand Palace is HUGE. We stayed in Building 11 our of 20, Each building is the size of the average Comfort Inn. Buildings over 10 are very far away from pool and beach, OK if you like to walk a lot. If you cant or dont want to there is a shuttle but it is fairly infrequent. We had a good 10 minute walk to get to the pool The beach is nice but you cant swim in the ocean because of rocks. You have to walk 15 minutes to the next beach then you can swim in the ocean. The huge amount of swimming pools makes up for this. If you just want to lie on the beach it's great. The resort is also isolated. It is a 200 peso cab ride into Playa del Carmen but there is a shuttle 5 times per day. The resort is 18 km north of Playa del Carmen. Public buses probably arent going to work for you. I would recommend you go to Wal Mart in Playa del Carmen ( an interesting cultural experience by itself) ( open 7 am to 1 am) and get all your groceries. There is a small store and deli on the resort but they \" see ya coming\". Prices are almost twice what they are here in Canada. Condos are clean, roomy, and modern. Cleaning staff is excellent. Grounds are very nice as well, you walk through kind of a jungle. Restaurants are good with good service but poor value for the money. I dont call 75 pesos ( 7.50 canadian) for a mai tai good value. Again you are captive to the resort. The worst thing was at the beginning. We were told there was a mandatory orientation to the property ( actually a good thing considering the size_). We met a man who did briefly orient us but then didnt let us leave the lobby until we agreed to a \"welcoming breakfast\"which turned out to be a timeshare presentation. We wasted a good part of the only sunny day we had on the resort getting out of this. There was a lot to do, Playa del Carmen was beautiful and I took the ferry to Cozumel for a day ( take an antinauseant) Not a bad vacation. The hotel is perfect if you are content to sit by the pool, sun and drink, surrounded by fat Americans who do the same. It's not great value and the weather was cool and cloudy the whole time. For my money I am going back to Ixtapa next year, I like the Pacific Side much more!!!!!", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cNice place, but not impressed\u201d", "Author": "Ponchoman", "ReviewID": "UR58142913", "Content": "Our family travelled to the Cancun area and stayed at the Mayan Palace after booking our trip through HSI. We had three rooms in total. Check in was very painfull, due to the size of our group. Credit has to be arranged in advance to allow charging to the room and even though we specifically requested that only my wife and I be allowed to charge, other members of the group were allowed to charge as well. Our second shock came when we finally managed to find our building. We were out in building 19, which is referred to as the Mayan Palace Golf. It is about as far from anything as you can get. A very long walk to get to the pool area. The room was clean and nice, although the color and decor was hideous. The fridge was very tiny and wouldn'y keep anything cold, the stove was a very small two burner that was difficult to cook on. The bottles of water in the room cost $2.00 each even though it wasn't recommended that you use the tap water...even for brushing your teeth. Everything was very expensive. The only way a person could afford to drink by the pool side is to do so during happy hour. They let us pay for the pool side drinks with cash, but I'm sure that some of the tabs were also charged to our room, even without a signature. On our last day, when I payed all the charges, I questioned a few of the charges to the room and was told that it would take at least 24 hours for them to be able to provide me with the signed slips. How convienient to have that happed as I am checking out. Night life is virtually non existent. The place pretty much closes down after 10pm or so. The beach is horrible. Nothing but rock and I don't even know how a person could swim there. The best thing about the beach was the hut where we bought a snorkelling trip. The trip was awsome. As a final note, let me say the Grand Mayan is far more beautiful, but that also comes with a much higher price. The Mayan Palace was nice, but I really don't care if I ever go back. Too expensive for what you get in return, especially when there are so many nicer places within a few minutes drive.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cIt's an OK place to stay if you get it for a cheap price!\u201d", "Author": "labtechs1", "ReviewID": "UR57976510", "Content": "We stayed at this resort with some friends who had obtained a week via a transfer from other friends of theirs, who couldn't use the timeshare this year. Therefore, we got it to stay for an extremely reasonable price, so please keep that in mind. (I wouldn't want to pay $200 per night for it, that's for sure!) The great things of this resort were that the grounds were beautiful, the rooms were very clean, with maid service twice a day. The shuttles were greatly used, the staff overall was extremely friendly and polite. The guys even went golfing, just had to buy the golf balls, but a cart for 2 and 18 holes with club rental was $69 per person, a good deal. Now, the \"so so\" parts: the poolside food, the sandwiches from the deli, and the drinks were all just \"ok\"....We also utilized the laundry facilities on site, the cost was 200 pesos for each token purchased for use of the washer/dryer tokens. We had our own detergent along with us, I am not sure if they would have charged for that too? There were 4 washers, 4 dryers total. It depended on which dryer you used if your clothes actually would get dry or not. 2 of the dryers were in use when I began our 2 loads of laundry, and they ran the entire length of our washer's time, as well as the other 2 dryers' time that I used. They never had to add more tokens! However, the dryers we used, we used 2 tokens for each dryer and some jeans were still not dry after that time! So, if you use them, try to use the middle 2 dryers, the other 2 are nothing but token guzzlers! The first day we left our breakfast dishes in the sink with tips (dollars) surrounding them, and we re'd a phone call later that day that the maids do not do dishes, if we wanted to have them do it, there would be a daily charge (I believe it was right around 360 pesos). After that we did them ourselves! We left tips each morning on or beside our beds. We used the in room safe and had no issues with anything missing, and we had hundreds of US dollars in the safe, and Ipods, cameras, etc. at times. We felt the beds were OK, no queen size, only full if you have 2 beds in your suite, and they were \"firm\". Not the hardest beds we have slept on in Mexico, but definitely they were firm!! The other reviews are true, you can hear everything your neighbors are doing and those that come back to their room after you have fallen asleep in yours, will most likely wake you up unless you are a totally sound sleeper! We used the water from the tap to brush our teeth, had no issues. We did prefer to buy our groceries at the Mega Market vs. Wal-Mart, the prices were a tad bit cheaper. (5 gal of water for under 2 USD!!) ....although Wal-Mart had a nice selection of liquor available compared to Mega. We would make our own breakfast, and then go out for dinner in Playa for the most part. We tended to take the shuttle into town (note they use an exchange rate of 10:1 for peso to dollars) for $4 per person, and then would hire a cab to take us back. There were 5 of us total, and most of the taxi's are for 4 people only, so it would cost $35 to use the taxi service to Playa for us, but the last shuttle was at 9 pm and we usually were not ready to head back that early. We did order pizza from the resort, and also ate some sandwiches from the deli in the spa building. The sandwhiches (paninni's) could easily feed 2 people if you had chips or fruit with the sandwhich, they were pretty big! The beach was nice to lay and watch the water, but its not a beach to swim in. . .if we wanted to swim we used the pool. The pool was refreshing, very clean, not over-chloinated and gorgeous as well as spacious. We did get a palapas for one day, its free if you have $35 USD charged to your bill, so a few drinks of the day (all day were half price) took care of that! Since there were 5 of us, we had a shared living space (living room with 2 sofas that turned into day beds for night, and kitchen area with 2 burners and sink and college sized fridge) and one side had a king size bed with bathroom, and the other side had 2 full size beds and the bathroom. Each bedroom had its own TV, as did the living room area. We had a total of 3 sliders (one each area) that would open to allow breezes to blow in). We stayed in building 19 so away from the majority of areas, some times we would walk other times we waited for the shuttle. Half of our group did a timeshare chat (from the airport, we lined it up with them) and the other half did not. I was in the group that did go, we were guests for a day at Moon Palace, which was gorgeous, phenomenal food, etc. as part of the timeshare \"speil\". The talk of course was longer than the promised 90 minutes, they want you to stay there as guests for the rest of the day, and offer 2 free massages (or other spa services such as pedicure, manicure, facial, etc) and so by the time you are free, its about noon, making it 'very difficult' to obtain your use of the spa services but being very persistant, we did manage to use them. We stayed until 530, we were tired and ready to call it a day. But, we did get our free passes as promised, to 2 ruins sites, Zip Line and Wet N Wild. We could have our pick of anywhere we wanted to visit in the area, basically for free...just had to endure the timeshare speil. We had a great, relaxing vacation. We usually prefer an AI site, but we saved so much money by buying our own liquor and soda and bringing it down to drink in our insulated cups that we would do this again if the opportunity arose for a \"cheap getaway\". Do I prefer AI? Sure do! But if you get an oppportunity to have a weeks' time transferred to you for a low price, this can be a great budget friendly getaway! We walked through the Grand Maya grounds, which is even more beautiful than Myan palace. But, no bugs, no mold, no dirty bathrooms, friendly people, really what more can you ask for while on vacation? The weather while we were there was very cool for this area, but we just didn't have to worry of dehyrdation! =-)", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cResort was nice but the rooms are disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Natalily79", "ReviewID": "UR57679838", "Content": "My small family stayed here for an entire week since we're owners (it was our first time staying at a Mayan Resort). We were disappointed from the beginning, at check-in we were assigned a room in building #14 which is very far from the pool area, a major reason why we even go on vacation, especially with a little one. We were told that not a closer room was available which is hard to believe considering how HUGE this resort is (I think there are 20 buildings!) Once we got into the room we saw there was nothing to accomodate a week long stay with a baby! No fridge, coffee maker, microwave, not even a 2nd trashcan (only one in the bathroom). If they sell you on a timeshare, they should AT LEAST provide a mini fridge....don't you think?!! My fault for assuming, instead of asking! I don't believe anyone an ocean view so that's another extreme disappointment. Just as everyone else mentioned, the walls are thin, so yes, we heard the lovely neighbors next door making meals and could even hear their conversations. Although they provide shuttles, you still have to wait at least 15 minutes so we ended up trekking it most of the time. The resort itself was nice, the pool and food staff were extremely friendly and courteous. The food was great, could eat there all day if I had all the money in the world to spend.

Had a one bedroom for two anyone else sleeps on the drop couches in the living room-kitch area. Call it room for 5 but wouldn't want to try it. The property is very well kept and the staff is very efficient and polite. We were not approached by time share people and would not have gone under any circumstance. Vacation is vacation. The water at the resort is purified but they recommend using only bottled water, go figure. They leave one 1.5 qt bottle in your room for $2.00 US. After that you can purchase in their little store for $3.00. They have a shuttle (van taxi) that they use to take people to Walmart and other stores in Playa del Carmen. The shuttle runs every 2 hours which is not enough time to hoof it to Walmart, pick up water which is difficult to carry and any other thing you could carry, like wine and beer which is four times the $$ at the Mayan Palace. Their wine list at the Green break near the golf course was not clear at all and we ended up paying $79.00 for a $15 bottle of wine. Make sure you ask questions. You need to make reservations at any worthwhile restaurant on the property. I asked the women at the pool desk if I needed reservations to the Asian restaurant and she told me no just for the Mexican Festia. Well guess what, they don't want to hear it and will offer you a table at 9:30 pm. Nice resort-don't expect to swim in the ocean - rocks everywhere. Just remember when you go-either resign yourself to buying on property or pay $4 each way shuttle to lug back supplies. Have happy hour at the pool from 1-3pm and 3-5pm at the Greenbreak. Drinks usually go for $7-$9 US each so half price is really not a great deal. They do nickel and dime you. Went to Cancun for the next five days \"all inclusive\" and had a much better time. Expect to see everyone with their hand out and watch out for cab drivers asking too much. Make sure you know what it will cost you before you get in, prices change real fast when you walk away.

They have so many hidden costs when you get there, it's ridiculous! Now, before you read on here is a disclaimer. I am not a cheap tight wad, that would be impossible with my wife ;-). I know that you spend money when you go on vacation. I just think it's criminal when they try and bleed every last drop of it out of you. Food: Overpriced, and no refridgerators in your room for leftovers. The cheapest cab fare anywhere is 20 bucks minimum (and 80 bucks from the airport to the hotel). So you're pretty much stuck there for meals....the hotel charges you 20 bucks each time you exchange currency. Internet costs money.....Gym costs money.....every little amenity that we usually enjoy for free here in the States costs a fortune down there at the Mayan Palace. The hotel claims that for \"Security Reasons\" they don't take cash or cards....they just bill the room. However, I think the reason is so that people don't pay any attention to how much their spending. On top of all that, they hit you with the high pressure sales pitch to buy their time share. I mean....who goes on vacation and is fully prepared to get locked into an 89,000 dollar commitment! (That's right folks 89 Grand).

We had a standard room - two double beds, bathroom. THE SHORT LIST: Beautiful resort, great service, but rooms were not comfortable and no night life. POSITIVES: Beautiful, huge resort. We stayed in building #11, which is just past the main lobby -- 10 minute walk to the pool/restaurants. Gorgeous walk to the pool through the gardens. Did not mind it at all. Pool is fabulous. Excellent service throughout the resort. Balche's poolside bar and restaurant was our favorite. Definitely try the corn cake dessert. So worth it. Havana Moon was excellent also. Del Lago (buffet restaurant) good but the birds were a nuisance in my opinion. Did not eat at Tremontos; advance reservations recommended (day or so ahead of time at least) and strict dress code we heard - collared shirts/pants for guys, no flipflops). Food prices were not outragious in our opinion. We spent about $850 for the week on food and drinks for my husband and myself. Take advantage of shuttle service at resort. Went went into Playa Del Carmen for about $3 each way per person. Do bother exchanging your US currency to pesos. The resort is a cashless system, and US currency is widely accepted. In fact, you often will get a better exchange rating paying with US dollars as opposed to pesos in Playa Del Carmen ($14 as compared to $11.50-$12). If you do exchange, I recommend doing it at the resort (12:1) and if you have any left, you can just have it put on your account before you close out your stay. No safety issues whatsoever. Safe was electronic and spacious. We used it and had no issues. Even stored our video and regular camera in it. NEGATIVES (and deal breakers in our opinion): Rock hard beds. EXTREMELY noisy rooms - could hear everything in hall, neighboring rooms, and above. No joke here: could even hear people using the bathrooms. We would not go back for this reason alone. No coffee pots in standard room. No nightlife after 11 p.m. Havana Moon has music at night, but more like restaurant entertainment than night club entertainment. They do have karaoke if you like that kind of thing, but really no play list to speak of. Really very few activities by the pool also.

Where to start, the staff and employees were the best! Friendly, helpful and always a big smile. The resort itself was large, well maintained and beautiful. We stayed in building #4 which was close to all the action. I had read the reviews so I knew we wanted to be in a building between 1 and 8. Building #1 is closest to the pools and resturants and building #8 is closest to parking. Their are 21 buildings all together! Even if you were assigned a higher number building the resort had a shuttle service that runs all day. In February the wheather is super so we found the walking very enjoyable. Food/Service-We found it to be top notch! We eat the Breakfast Buffet at Balches and found it to be fabulous! Super selection, fresh and reasonably priced.We highly recommened it! We ordered pizza with room service one nite, it was OK. We saved our money and went to the Wal-mart and Mega mart and stocked up on food and eat most of our meals in the room. Wal-mart had the better selection and prices! The rooms have an adequate kitchen for light meals. Transportation-We rented a car and found it very rewarding. We had no problems with the Police or the Rental Car Company. We rented from American Car Rental because they offered all the Insurance coverages with the price. They did try to stick us with a older car at first. But all we had to do was ask for another and they agreed without any problems. Keep in mind this resort is off the beaten path and my wife and I like to come and go as we please. Activities-As you will read the pool at this resort is to die for. We had never seen anything like this one. If your a all day pool person this resort is for you! They have scheduled activities all day and a 2 for 1 happy hour from 11 to 1. They also have a drink of the day special all day. The pool has several swim up bars as well as someone willing to wait on you all day.

They have a 2 for 1 drinks special during happy hour (11am-2pm). A couple free activities I enjoyed were the noon water exercise with a trained instructor, 3pm dancing lessons, and the 4pm beach voleyball tournament (about 20 people will show up). They also have some karaoke and other similar activities by the pool during evening hours. Make sure to rent a palapa (straw huts with confy queen beds) if you are going to spend the whole day by the pool. They charged 350 pesos ($29 dollars) for the day but the amount will be refunded at check out as long as you spend the equivalent in food/drinks that same day. They serve some fantastic Daiquiris (60 peso/$5) by the pool. All purchases at the hotel are charged to the room with a 15% tip added on. All you need to remember is the room number and sign the receipt. The beach was rocky and not very good for swimming but beautiful nevertheless. Unless you are certified in water sports the water sports kiosk by the beach is very expensive. The cheapest offer is the boat ride and snorkeling in the nearby reef. A 3 hour tour which you shouldn't pay more than $40/person. Don't be shy to name your own price when buying tours. The tours offered by the hotel are very pricey. We purchased two tours to Chichen Itza ($50) and Isla Mujeres ($58) through a travel agency in Playa del Carmen. The travel agency is called Odyssey and is located on the touristy 5th avenue in Playa del Carmen between 2nd and 3rd street (Caida). They ask that you pay $10/person downpayment and the rest when they pick you up by the hotel's main gate, Mayan Palace offers shuttles to Playa del Carmen for 40 pesos ($3.5)/person each way. The beach at Playa del Carmen is where you want to go for beautiful and easy to swim beaches. On your Playa del Carmen trips make sure to load up in esentials at Walmart (couple blocks from shuttle stop). Walmart housed a travel agency at their checkout but it doesn't look any safer than the agency we employed. Don't miss the boat trip to Isla Mujeres if you are into snorkeling. The island itself wasn't worth the time. Mayan Palace is nicely situated about 20 minutes from Playa del Carmen and about 35 minutes from Cancun. Oh and before I forget the average guest at the hotel were couples in their 40's-50's. Not the place to be if you are chasing young tail. :) Overall the whole stay was really enjoyable. We are definitely going back there soon!

It is virtually not accessable from there. Coral, Rocks and high waves make it almost impossible to get into the water. Water shoes are an absolute must even to wade in the water.

So there were eight of us and we ALL LOVED the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya Resort. We had two, two bedroom units on the third floor of building eight. This is a huge resort and the buildings are numbered 1-21, with one being closest to the beach and pool, eight being by the main lobby, and 21 being a long way from everything. The grounds are immaculately kept. The service at the front desk is very professional. The rooms are well cleaned each day, with a second visit from housekeeping in the evening to tidy up and turn down the beds. The pool is the largest I\u2019ve ever seen and the swim-up bar is manned by very friendly bartenders. Happy hour is from 11-1 each day with 2 for 1 drinks, and \u201cthe drink of the day\u201d is 2 for 1 all day. It\u2019s a \u201cno cash\u201d resort, so keep your receipts to check your bill at check-out\u2014we had no problems with it at all. There are plenty of lounge chairs around the pool with shade for those who prefer not to be in the sun. The palapas can be rented, but if you spend a certain amount on food and/drinks at the pool, the amount of the rental will be deducted from your bill. The beautiful white sand beach is picturesque, but rocky due to past hurricanes washing the beach away. If you have water shoes it is fine for swimming, otherwise you need to walk five minutes north to find a gorgeous sandy beach\u2014we did that once or twice. There are plenty of lounge chairs on the beach, as well as some shade huts, a volleyball net, and food and drink service. The restaurants onsite are very good\u2014and not outrageously priced as mentioned by other reviewers\u2014of course that would be relative to where you live, and coming from NY, we did not find them ridiculous. Havana Moon is located on the beach and has good food for lunch and dinner with ocean views; they have live music and dancing in the evenings as well. Tramonto, the Italian restaurant, has a more upscale atmosphere without the upscale prices and their food is good. Balche is the restaurant at the pool which has a great breakfast buffet and lunch\u2014we enjoyed that most days. Del Lago is a buffet restaurant that has a different theme each night (Mexican, land and sea, Asian, etc.) with a show. Room service is available. The deli is convenient, and there are other places to get food onsite too that I can\u2019t think of off the top of my head! The on-site activities are great, ranging from a golf, tennis, a game room, internet for $5.50 USD per hour, a fitness center, full service spa and salon, on-site grocery store and deli with many prepared foods for carryout, kids club, babysitting, live bands, shows, water sports (snorkeling, scuba, fishing, jet skis), beach volleyball and water aerobics. One day there was even a bar tending class at the pool with fun taste-testing. In the evenings there are different activities posted such as karaoke and a beach party. Some of the best attractions nearby (30 - 60 minutes) include theme parks (eco, adventure and water) Xcaret and Xel-ha; ancient Mayan ruins (Tulum, Coba, and Chichen Itxa\u2014which is much further). Playa del Carmen, a small, quaint beachfront town, is only about a 15 minute ride and it has a great nightlife\u2014Senior Frogs, Carlos & Charlies, and Coco Bongo\u2014a pay one price club with a \u201cCirque Du Soleil\u201d-type show going on\u2014quite the tourist attraction, but fun. We had a rented car, but the resort provides a shuttle into Playa del Carmen\u2014but the last one for the day leaves early if you\u2019re going out at night, unless you go in for dinner before going to the clubs, and then you can get a cab back. In Playa Del Carmen you can also get the ferry to the island of Cozumel, where there's fantastic scuba diving. Also, Cancun is about a 30 minute drive away to the north.

The resort is made up of multi floor buildings spread out over a large area and each building has an elevator. Going from the buildings to the main lobby you need to take the shuttle ( passing every 15-20 minutes ) or you can walk ( 10-15 minutes ). From the main lobby you have to take another shuttle to the beach and the swimming pool or another 15-20 minutes walk. The beach is rocky and water shoes are a definite must. Bring snorkeling gear to take advantage of the fish and some existing reefs. If you want a sandy beach with big waves you will have to walk east on the beach for about 15 minutes. The swimming pool is very big with temperature zones ( warmer, cold ). The drinks at the beach and at the pool are $8.00 plus 15% tip but they have a Happy Hour from 11:00AM -1PM. Even though the hotel has at least one wheel chair that is adapted for the beach, people with walking problems or dissabilities should stay away from this resort. The grocery is poorly stocked and prices are 40-100% over the Walmart prices in Playa Del Carmen. If you plan on taking a cab to Playa del Carmen, the resort has a shuttle( at specific hours ) to Walmart for $4.00USD per person ( one way ). A cab will set you back $20.00USD one way. For visitors that are not planning to eat all their meals at the resort's restaurants or those in Playa del Carmen Walmart is the place to go for groceries. The resort is nice and clean but we were dissapointed with the rocky beach and the exagerated prices of the grocery, drinks and restaurants. No wi-fi or free internet. Charge by the hotel for internet: $4/half hour. In PLaya del Carmen that pays for 1 hour of internet. The resort is an hour and from XEL-HA a natural coral reef and cave park ( all inclusive ) and an hour and a half from Tulum's famous ruins. You can also take the ferry to Cozumel.

The gym was very nice and had spin classes ever morning during the week. The food actually surprised us and was good at most places. Gong the Asian restaurant was by far the best - and most expensive. The problem with the food is that this is Mexico and one of the reasons people go to Mexico is that it is supposed to be cheap...it isn't. Going into town to eat is the best option. However, you have to pay US $4 dollars each way to take the resort taxi or you can walk out in front of the resort and take a bus for about US $1. The food in Playa is equally as good and 1/4 of the price. You have to go to El Fogon. The place is great if you like Mexican food. The beach is ok but you can't really get in the water right in front of the hotel as it is rocky. If you walk about 30 minutes to the left if you are looking from the resort to the water you can find a sandy beach. The pools are pretty nice although the service is spotty.

We just returned from our best ever family vacation at the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya located near Cancun, Mexico. What a spectacular resort this is, 5 star in every respect, super clean, super service, super facilities. We have travelled around the world but this was our first trip to Mexico and we heard a lot of stories about it not being very safe, having to tip people every step of your way else nothing works/moves etc. We found out that this was completely untrue, at least at this resort. Cancun is a very safe place, the staff were extremely courteous and helpful and never ever waited or expected a tip, it is out of our own happiness/discretion that we offered tips to the staff, which we would do in any place. The resort is huge, lots of long walks. Free shuttle service within the resort is available which was quite frequent and convenient. But we enjoyed walking through the tropical bush watching the birds and iguanas. Kids loved the variety of beautiful colorful wild birds, did not see any dangerous reptile or spiders. Did bump into a few Racoons in the bush. Rooms are spacious and very well maintained, very clean. Some people in the past reviews whine about the hard beds, but we found it comfortable. The airconditioner is central and works great, importantly very quiet. The kitchen and fridge is very small, for a family operation, that was our only qualm. English works in the resort with some difficulty but outside the resort it is quite hard to converse and make sense. We simply loved the sandy beach in the resort although it gets very rocky in the water, rock shoes are essential. Absolutely adored the stunningly beautiful and huge swimming pool, biggest we have ever seen, my 8 year old had to be dragged out off the pool every day. Sea was enjoyably warm, spent hours snorkelling, plenty of colorful fish and most amount of corals I have ever seen, beautiful brilliantly purple corals! Did not see any turtles. Everyday was hot and mostly sunny, It rained just one day. We rented a car for the entire stay and managed to see a few places of interest on our own. The resort travel desk organized trips are costly and frankly not worth it. In fact I put in big complaint on the poor quality of trip to Cozumel island. So we booked Chichenitza trip at the Wal Mart in Playa del Carmen at less than half price and it was superbly done. Travel vendors will literally hound you at Palay Del Carmen, we were not sure about the quality so we decided to buy inside the Wal Mart and I would highly recommend this. One thing is for sure one has to haggle/bargain every thing including organized trips that is bought outside the resort. We struck great deals for half the quoted price on several articles including leather bags but quality is always suspect so you will have to closely look and judge what ever you buy. Roads are very nice to drive but watch out for speedsters and lane cutters, especially the cabs! What I found most annoying is the frequent changes to speed limits for no apparent reason even on the major highways and cops are every where, so one has to watch out. I did not get pulled over but have heard horror stories of having to bribe the cops $100 if caught. Looks like the cops have specially designed the speed limit zones for this purpose! Food is great at the resort and at Playa, the resort is expensive in comparison. But honestly the food is highly overpriced as it costs almost as much as in US/Canada which I think is highly over priced for Mexico, but tourists have little choice and all the restaurants fully exploit the situation. We shopped at the Wal Mart and Mega stores for groceries and made a few meals in the suite. Even the groceries are definitely priced up because it is a tourist town. I am sure Mexicans from other cities will find this very pricey. One could look for small lower level restaurants but food quality and cleanliness becomes qustionable, don't want to fall sick on a pleasure trip! Highly recommend the food at Al Hambra (right on the beach) and Yaxche, both along 9th St. The 5th ave shopping street is great, quite safe but just be on guard like any other tourist place as it was very crowded (highest season), we had several very enjoyable trips. Lots of bars and restaurants to indulge in, most of them are good.The beach in Playa town right down 9th St. is the best beach in the area, very nice sand and no rocks but quite crowded especially in the high season that we were. All other beaches are a combination of sand and rocks so one has to be careful. Maroma beach (very close to the resort) in certain parts into the wilderness is nice and pristinely sandy but getting there could be a challenge, we got there by boat. But the adventurous can discover some very quiet streches of spectacular beach in the Maroma area after long walks through bushes. The bushes are full of mosquitoes, take bug spray with out fail. Visited Coba (pyramid), Chichenitza (pyramid) and Tulum (ancient port town) all very worth seeing. We climbed the Coba pyramid, it was quite an experience to go up to 150 ft on topsy turvy rocks with no handrails or any support and wind blowing you off your feet. Tulum has a nice little beach to hike down in between the big rocky hills, the water every where is pristine, blue with a great feeling of freshness, absolutey loved that. Will go back just for that again and again. Lastly about the Mayans: there is so much we hear and see on the web about them and their \"mysterious disaapearence\" etc, and the world is nearing its end as per their prediction etc. its all just [--], stark lies piled up by press and people seeking cheap attention by stirring up commotion and panic (like the green house gas theory). Mayans have not disappeared or anything they are all still there living as normal Mexican citizens and they still speak their own language which is not Spanish. The locals are Mayans, all very nice and peace loving people. It is ironical that they do not think that the world is coming to an end on Dec 17, 2012, but world does believe that it's going to happen!!! We hired a Mayan tour guide and he explained that the Mayan caledar ends every 5000 years and a new one starts thereafter and the current caledar ends on Dec 17, 2012 and there is nothing more to it than that!!! So not to worry there is lot of fun to had at this resort and in Cancun area for many many more years to come and I am going to use it as many times as possible for sure.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "gbmountaingirl", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, pool and food--we loved it!\u201d", "Author": "gbmountaingirl", "ReviewID": "UR53769267", "Content": "My husband and I have traveled all over Mexico and we both agreed--Playa del Carmen takes the cake!

Beach a bit poor but we swam in the sea with water shoes on...just had to be careful of rocks that's all. Most people just camped out by the pool where you could find a quiet corner in the shallow parts (we liked those) or endure the gringo parade with loud music daring the brave to do stupid things (we don't like that) if you preferred. Renting a padded lounger for $35 a day seemed a bit cruel on today's budget-conscious travellers but we got one for a day and the girls/ kiddies loved it. Roving bartenders tempt you to drink excessively but our willpower held for most of the week. I think we stayed in building 3 (quite close to the lobby) so it was a pleasant walk of 3 mins or so through lush vegetation paths to the beachfront. I was amazed by how many people couldn't face such a short walk...it helps keep the weight-gain down.A small ,over-subscribed train will take you if you prefer. Breakfasts in the big palapa restaurant overlooking the lake were really great though it did resemble shopping the January Sales at times. Golf course looked great but not much used. Freeing up the tracks to walkers would allow non-golfers to explore the beautiful grounds better. We rented a car throughout which we found really convenient through Easyway who will bring the car to the hotel if you prefer. Very reliable people and great rates (Fernando at the airport branch was great). Car park space available at no extra charge if you avoid the valet parking. So all in all a good experience especially for me who avoids regimentalised holidays usually. If you have a family trip I think its great but if the kids are older then basing yourselves closer to Playa del Carmen would be advised. Only downers were long queues at the lobby desks most of the day, timeshare people calling your room inviting you to a life-changing breakfast presentation (you could always unplug the phone!)and .....well nothing really.

My wife and daughter and I very much enjoyed the resort as service was excellent in all regards. We left the complex one day to go to Playa del Carmen by shuttle/taxi which cost $120 Mex each person, each way. It is pretty unnerving on Federal Highway 307 when the military stops all traffic and stand there with their M-16s. In Playa del Carmen, all the police carried Uzi weapons. We stayed mainly on 5th Ave which is the tourist area and we felt pretty safe. As another reviewer commented. coming back to the resort took a long time due to the military checkpoint. One of the best things we did was to take the bicycle tour of the Mayan Palace resort. The pool is outstanding so we spent most of our time relaxing by the pool drinking Coronas and some drink of the day things. If I was to go again, I would never leave the resort but that is me. If you do go into town just bring USD$. I brought a bunch of $1 and $5 bills for the trip which came in handy.

Other family members met us at the same resort a couple of days after us and they stayed in regular rooms, not suites, they had no complaints. At one point we needed some service to our bathroom area, and they sent someone up right away, and followed up with a phone call to make sure everything had been taken care of. We did some excursions on our own. It seems to be cheaper if you can book them on your own instead of going through the hotel. Went to Xel Ha & Tulum on a package deal. If you like the water (snorkeling, etc. ) you might want to spend the whole day at Xel Ha instead of the 4 hours with the package deal. Tulum was also very interesting, but I think we missed out on a lot at Xel Ha because we were limited on time. Took the advise and went to Walmart in Playa to stock up on some stuff. Not sure if it is worth it or not. The things at the Hotel are more expensive, but by the time you factor in taking a cab, etc. It might be better just to shop at the store in the resort.

When we called about the smell, the maintenance staff was there within 5 minutes and they worked on the system.

The beds are not the most comfortable and they had already added the eggcrate foam to the bed. The curtains at the windows needed some TLC, hems that were missing and some stains from the tracks on the sliding glass doors. Bedspread had fingernail polish and all of the decorative pillows had snags in the fabric. The ladies that cleaned the room were unbelieveable and my husband loved the Hershey Kisses that they brought each night when they turned the bed down. If we needed anything (my husband broke the coffee pot) they were at the room within 5 minutes and then called to make sure that we were satisfied with the service. The food was good at almost every place that we ate. The Italian restaurant was very good (we hated to eat italian in MX but it was still good food!) and the service was good everywhere. (We are not demanding customers so we do not expect instantaneous service when we are traveling in foreign countries. Therefore, service that we receive is part of the vacation experience!)

The Health Club and Spa was awesome. They have all the amenities that you would expect in a great spa. The couples massage was the best. The service at the Grand Mayan was the best, tours picked you up at the resort, and the staff always provided us with the best service. We could not have asked for more when it comes to service. The resort has 7 restaurants that were all very nice with great food. We ate at the resort at least twice a day for 7 days and every meal was great. The beach looked great and it is large, you can eat on the beach and could get massages on the beach. Only one issue with the beach is the last hurricane brought lots of rocks in to the beach area under the water line. I did not swim at the beach. The pools more than make up for the swimming at the beach. This is a large resort but the way it is set up you feel that you have privacy when you want it on the grounds. The entire resort it was extremely clean and well manicured. We had another small issue, the resort has 13 building for the rooms. Of the 13 building were 7 very close to lobby, pools, restaurants and the beach other 6 were in an area they call the Jungle. When you stay in Jungle you need to take transportation to the lobby. The good thing is that the transports come about every 10 to 15 minutes. It was a slight inconvenience. With that said we stayed in the two bedrooms suite and it was enough room for two couples with at least four kids. The rooms were great.

We read that the beach wasn't so great and it was pretty windy so we were happy to stay at the pool- 2 for 1 drinks! We only ate at 2 of the restaurants: Balache, we loved their Mexican food, and Havana Moon, which was not so great and expensive. wide mix of foods, big portions, but the appetizers were better than our entrees. we weren't so hot on eating at an italian or asian restaurant at a mexican resort. The fitness center was big and well equipped, but we were charged 100 pesos the second time we went since we were RCI members, which we weren't warned about. We didn't go to the time share breakfast, but before we knew it, we were paying a 100p deposit to hold our reservation. We didn't have much trouble getting our deposit back after we \"missed\" our breakfast. we went on a day-long multi-stop tour led by Edventure Tours (www.edventuretours.com.mx) which i recommend. the concierge would not help us contact or book any tours they are not affiliated with and which were quite expensive. No cash is accepted throughout the resort, everything is charged to your room. It was annoying that internet use at the cafe (no wifi) was 40p per 1/2 hour, laundry was 80p for 1 wash and dry (no machines in the units. the dryer broke and we ended up spending all morning waiting for someone to come by the laundry room), drinks at the pool were 85p plus tip, and i wouldn't buy anything from the market since it's so expensive. I didn't realize how far away Playa del Carmen and Cancun were from the resort. We didn't take the resort shuttle since their schedule was limited.

We went into town to go to Walmart (highly recommended), and to eat a few times. La Cueva del Chango (Monkey's cave) had an awesome breakfast (38th calle off 5th ave). Dinner at Yaxche was also an awesome Mayan restaurant (5th and 8th). Playa is like any cruise ship port town. We went out to the Blue Parrot bar one nite for some fun--cute swings at the bar, fire dance show, pole dance performance to broadway songs.

I quite enjoyed the long walks but hubby was relieved to learn about the shuttle after a few days! 4. There is a market at the resort but prices are still much higher than at the Mega Store in Playa Del Carmen. 5. We should have brought salt and pepper with us-we couldn\u2019t find a small set in PDC. 6. We found a few eggs in each dozen that were bad- best to crack each one into a glass before adding them to a bowl and spoiling an entire omelet! 7. We brought masks and snorkels but should have brought fins as well, since renting was expensive. We didn\u2019t wear half the clothes we brought, just lived in swimsuits, so we could easily have made room. Review: The rooms were wonderful. Our mattress already had foam over it, so it was fine for sleeping. The kitchen had a toaster, blender (important for guacamole and margaritas) and a coffee maker. The Mexican coffee is really strong; so don\u2019t overload the coffee maker. We were not expecting much of a balcony (thanks Tripadvisor!) and so were not surprised to find that there isn\u2019t really even room for a chair. The grounds were gorgeous and well maintained and the pool was the best I\u2019ve ever seen. The week we were there, the palapas had no strings attached. At 8:30am there was still a decent selection of the deluxe ones with mattresses and pillows. It was off season (last week of Oct) and there was very little entertainment. Our days were busy though and we were asleep most nights by 9. Our best day was when we hired a taxi and driver (Alex, Taxi # 726) for a day. He knew the best place for us to snorkel-Akumel lagoons- where the water was clear and there were no waves, but thousands of beautiful fish. At the harbour there, we swam out following the buoyed rope to see turtles. At first we saw none and came in, but someone told us that if you hang out long enough you will see turtles even when there are big waves. Sure enough, when I went back out, I saw three of them and swam with them as they munched seaweed . Our amazing meal of the trip was not at an advertised restaurant. Alex took us to the caf\u00e9 of his friend Alfredo Dominguez, who is a former chef from one of the resorts. There were two long tables in a very run-down area. Alex had phoned ahead and when we arrived Alfredo put out steaming platters of lobster tails, one of king crab, one of jumbo shrimp along with Mexican rice, vegetables and a big basket of fresh bread. We didn\u2019t think we could possibly eat it all, but we sure came close! Most cab drivers can drop you there (10 ave and 59 av) since they eat there. There is no name, just ask where Dominguez\u2019s seafood is. The timeshare salespeople are sneaky \u2013 they make it sound like it is mandatory or make your presentation sound like it\u2019s something else \u2013a free tour for instance. We went to the presentation at MP which got us a nice breakfast and $100 off our bill. Was it worth it? Pretty much. We knew what to expect and had our arguments ready. They were hugely aggressive, but we were just as stubborn! We spent about $250 total at the resort, which included some happy hours. Our shopping the first day was about perfect given how little we had left on the last day. At the back of the Mega store is a takeout counter and we bought a whole roast chicken, a large tub of fried rice and some vacuum packed fresh fish which looked safer than the exposed fish. The tinned salsa was amazing and we should have bought more than one. We added a tin of black beans to the rice which stretched it into three meals. For fresh produce we bought onions, green pepper, shredded and mushrooms for omelets . 5 avocados, limes and a head of garlic for fresh guacamole every night. We\u2019re careful about food so we bought frozen brocolli and stir fry veggies. The produce looked fine, but it wasn\u2019t worth the chance. The Chilean red wines are amazing and only about $7.50 a bottle!

Wonderful! Our driver even stopped at an OXXO (like a 7-11 in the US) and let us pick up some beer, ice, drinks & snacks for our room. He wasn\u2019t supposed to, but we talked him into it. I definitely recommend them. Mayan Palace \u2013 Beautiful Resort. When we checked in, they tried to put us in bldg 8, I asked if they could get us closer to the pool, so they put us in bldg 5. When we arrived, the room was very hot and humid, but the A/C was on and running full blast! We called maintenance and the guy came and \u201cfixed\u201d it. He told us to wait about 20 minutes before we would notice a change. It started to actually get hotter! So, we called the front desk and explained. Maintenance came out again and said nothing was wrong. At this point I\u2019m getting pissed, so I called the manager and he said that his guy told him everything was fine, so everything must be fine! WHAT???!!! So I\u2019m a liar?? Now I\u2019m really angry. Our friend that we were with decided to call the manager, and maybe because he\u2019s male, the manager agreed to move us to bldg 2, a new room w/ glorious wonderful A/C. There is no way we could have lived in that room for a week like that. I would have died in the humidity, we all would have. OK, enough of that. When we finally settled in, we hit the pool area for dinner at Balche. An outdoor restaurant overlooking the ginormous pool. Food was awesome, but the service was a little slow. My theory is that since the tips are already included in EVERYTHING that you buy on the resort property, the servers/waiters don\u2019t have any incentive to work for a tip. As a former waitress/bartender, that kind of bothered me, but we were on vacation so I guess I just needed to relax and not be in such a hurry. Pool \u2013 Way too warm! Not refreshing at all. I don\u2019t think that they actually heated the pool, it\u2019s just that hot in Mexico. Beach area sucked, couldn\u2019t swim. My husband forbid me to try and navigate the coral to go out further because he was drinking and didn\u2019t want to have to try and rescue me drunk. I didn\u2019t blame him, it looked like only the crazy teenagers were doing that far. The pool bar by Balche was awesome, the bartenders were great and since my husband spoke Spanish, I think we got a lot of drinks on the house because he made friends with the bartenders. They loved him. My hubby and friends are \u201chappy\u201d drunks and are always the life of the party. We kept the pool area from getting too boring by doing shots, dancing, bringing down our iPod dock so that we could listen to good party music and so on. The employees really appreciated us being the life of the party. We played water volleyball in the pool and at the beach. We did the water aerobics too, whew, what a workout! Playa Del Carmen \u2013 Typical tourist trap area. It\u2019s cool if you want to shop for cheesy souvenirs and eat expensive meals. If you go off the beaten path, you\u2019ll find those $1 tacos that are soooo good! But you really have to look for them, we had a hard time finding taco venders. Instead of pre-booking your excursions through a website ahead of time, go into Playa and book through there. We went through \u201cManny Chavez\u201d and the Cigar shop on 5th Ave. We saved about $80 per person on our Chichen Itza tour (only paid $40 pp) and saved about $35 pp on a snorkeling tour to Cozumel. I think he gave us a pretty good deal. We always felt safe in Playa and there were no problems. Chichen Itza \u2013 Considering this is one of the 7 Wonders of the World, if you are in the Yucatan, you MUST go and see these ruins. Absolutely amazing! It was hot, but there were no bugs or mosquito\u2019s even though we were warned that there may be some. Beautiful site and very nice people. Cozumel \u2013 Just like Playa, tourist trap. Nothing too interesting on the island. We went snorkeling and saw tons of fish and even saw a barracuda, that was scary & we kind of panicked. But all went well. Very relaxing vacation and wonderful staff (except the maintenance A/C guy). I wouldn\u2019t go back to this resort because it wasn\u2019t all inclusive. We\u2019ve gone to Jamaica and stayed at an all inclusive and it was much less stressful. At this resort, you had to wait for receipts to sign and sometimes they would have to chase you down in the pool if you got a drink and then swam away. Oops. If you can\u2019t afford all inclusive, then you would like staying here. There were lots of kids however & we usually travel to get away from kids, but they weren\u2019t too bad.

This was my first time in Mexico and though I have been to different countries, my first time staying in a resort. My boyfriend had been to Mexico before and has traveled a ton - staying in resorts; thus, he had a great stay also. We didn't have all-inclusive amenities, so were on somewhat of a budget. First, the overall experience of this resort is a pleasant one. The resort is modern and room was nice and clean. We didn't have a balcony or a view, but this was okay. Unfortunately, the bed mattress was uncomfortable after several nights. However, it was great to feel the breeze of the air-conditioning after being out and about in the nice hot sun. From where our building was located it was quite a trek to the main area; however, this lead to us taking in some good walking exercise. They have golf cart trolleys that come around throughout the resort which was a neat experience; however, waiting around for them wasn't too fun. I preferred to walk many times, but it would be difficult for older / disabled folks to have the choice. The gardens and landscaping were beautifully manicured. The location of the resort isn't that great, because a cab has to be taken out of the area. To take a regular bus, it is quite aways to the front entrance of the resort and it is located along the highway which doesn't feel safe. However, their tour buses come right near the check-in entrance. The pool area is large and very nice. They held pool side activities for kids and teens during the day. It was relaxing and fun to lay on a sun chair and watch the games unfold. At night, the pool looked enticing and romantic to use. Unfortunately, we didn't use it 'cause I don't think it was heated. The beach is alright, but I've experienced better. The hammocks were relaxing and a nice addition. We didn't eat at the resort much, due to price. The food we ordered pool side, for room service, and dinner in the Havana Room were decent. The latter having the best strawberry fruit drink I've had in my life called a 'Frescada'. The service was excellent and many staff were friendly, especially the front desk check-in staff. The free bottled water they provide at the desk was great, and they even saw us 'sneak' extras without retribution. We managed to avoid the timeshare presentation, simply 'cause of timing - they didn't have any presenters left available. This made us happy 'cause we could see the presentations dragged on for other guests. The free breakfast provided, due to us having agreed to attend the presentation, was phenomenal. The packaged tours we booked through the hotel 'cause I believe we got a further discount for having agreed to the timeshare presentation was money and time well-spent. The pay-for-use Internet Cafe was a real life-saver in that I was able to save my memory card photos on disc from the blank CD I bought there. I also had a project due for school that I was able to complete 'cause there wasn't a time limit on the computer - unless it is really busy. Also, if you didn't use up all your computer minutes, you could save them for another day. It was convenient that the Cafe was open late at night. There isn't much night-life at the resort, 'cause it seems tailored to older guests. We aren't much for partying either, but a little more spice with music and dancing would have been a nice addition. I'm displeased at how they keep crocodiles on site as this isn't very humane. Supposedly, they take them from nearby waters. To top it all off - we had one night left, but checked out early to catch a flight. However, we had passport problems and had to stay in Mexico longer. The resort had no problem taking us back for that 1-night extra we gave up - no questions asked. It was great to not feel like a hassle by inconveniencing them.

Both times our units were far from the pool area, but unlike all the whining you hear from the lazy, we found the walk absolutely lovely!! The grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained. And with all the eating that is done on a vacation, I welcomed the easy 1/4 mile stroll. But for those not fit enough or with disabilities, there is a wonder transport trolley system all around the resort which runs constantly. While the beach is not swimmable, it offers nice wading. Bring a pair of water shoes and you\u2019ll enjoy it. And even if unswimmable it is breathtakingly beautiful! Lovely for sunset strolls. We spent our days sitting at the beach taking in the view, with the fabulous pool only a couple of steps behind us when we wanted to take a swim. I, for one, had no issue with this great combination. As for the restaurants at the resort\u2026. Pricy? Absolutely. And as you will read from other review the values and offerings in downtown Playa are way better. Just do yourself a favor and rent a car!! There are so many great attractions nearby that it is well worth it! Want a fabulous day at the beach? Puerto Morales about 10 minutes north of the resort is amazing! Gorgeous soft sand beaches for miles in either direction! Great local food and atmosphere. And there are local guides who take groups out for what will be the best snorkeling of your life, only about 300 yards off shore! So to sum it up\u2026 the Mayan Palace is a great place to stay. It has a lot to offer especially that it is located near so many wonderful attractions (go to Tulum!) But take this advice\u2026. Sit on the beach, enjoy the view, bring your cooler full of your own beer, beverages and snacks!. Rent a car!! Eat away from the resort.

If you want \"cozy\" go elsewhere for this is almost a city in itself but spread out-- no skyscrapers. Actually, it can be regarded as two resorts: The Mayan Palace and the Grand Mayan. Grand Mayan, the newer section, has an additional pool and some other faciities of its own but the main pool compex, restaurants, gym, stores, spa etc. are shared. When we were there in early 2007, they were building a special reception/ lobby/indoor pool for Grand Mayan--which we watched burn down! I hope it has been rebuilt by now and been properly fire proofed! Perhaps the most impressive feature of Grand Mayan is the private dipping pool on each patio/balcony. The decore is bright and clean in a modern style. Mayan Palace units do not have the granite kitchen counters etc. but are also quite nice. The basic design for units is to combine a Master Room (with no kitchen) with a one bedroom unit with kitchen and living room to create a two bedroom unit or to be used separately. (We stayed in the 1BR for one week and the hotel style Master Room the other.) Mexican resorts in general do not seem to think vacationers should plan to cook in their rooms much and, consequently, have no dishwasher and less than full- sized appliances. However, there is a small grocery/general store on the property and a shuttle runs to Playa del Carmen for more extensive shopping. Unlike most US timeshares, Mayan Palace has daily maid service. (Typical in Mexico) Also typical are the tile floors which ignore dripping swim suits and don't get musty in hot humid weather. Because hurricanes are a real possibiity in the area, most of the residential buildings are built at right angles to the shore and set well back from the ocean. You can walk to the Lobby or pools along one side of the string of buildings or wait on the other side for a shuttle. If it is raining, this arrangement lets you walk for a long way inside the buildings. The round white buildings scattered here and there are storage or laundrys. You can do your own washing there (clean and modern equipment) or pay the attendant to do it. Riviera Maya where this resort is located in west of Cancun proper but uses that airport. Playa del Carmen is actually closer to Mayan and a resort shuttle bus will take you there. This can get a bit tricky since they usually cannot park where they let you off. ASK where you will find them for the return trip. We took a guided tour to Tulum and highly recommend it. Quite different from Chichen Itza. Prettier actually and with a small but lovely beach. It is quite true that the ocean beach at Mayan is not great. There are many lounge chairs on the beach but swimming is done mainly in the huge compex of connecting pools (with swim-up snack bars). Ocean fans will want to dine at the Havana Moon near the shore which had to be completely rebuilt after the previous hurricane. Del Lago, on the lake of course, serves buffet style and is quite good. The Asian restaurant someone on here mentioned must be new. There are three or four or five other places to eat, mostly in the pool area. I rather missed the many eager salesmen that were common on Mexican beaches, but some had more regulated jewery and gift booths by the pools. They did not approach you unbidden. The resort sales personnel, on the other hand, were it bit pushier. If you might actually want to buy into Mayan, listen carefully and ask questions but be prepared to spend hours before you can break away (or conclude the contract). Mexican beach properties can only be leased, not bought by non-citizens so contracts are for \"right to use\". Look into the possibiity of buying a resale before you go and then compare benefits.

So I knew before hand the resort was beautiful,the pool is huge,the beach stinks and the restaraunts are expensive. That being said I think I got this resort beat. My biggest recommendation is rent a car! With a car you are out of the resorts grip on your vacation. you are free to buy food and beverages at walmart in playa, you are free to go to any restaraunt you choose and you are free to pick out your own excursions. I know your probably worried about the policia, and your face showing up on the next edition of,\"Locked Up Abroad\". I not going to say dont worry about them because they are all over the place. I'm telling you that I went thru every check point in a big white van with 15 gringo's in it. I stuck out like a sore thumb! Because I was conscience of the speed limit and took my time there was no problem. Also be careful of the tope(speed bumbs) they are every where just keep your eyes on the signs. Make sure you stock up in walmart for food,snacks and beverages. The resort doesnt allow any coolers by the pool, but I was able to get around this by bringing down a collapsable cooler in my luggae. We also went out to eat one night in puerto morales, playa del carmen and downtown cancun. My favorite by far was the town of akumal and a restaraunt called La Buena Vida. The beach we all know is not swimmable. The sand and beach area is beautiful, but I am a water person so what do we do? You can put on snorkel gear and walk out about 100feet and snorkel. Also if you dont mind walking; go up the coast about 15minutes(not 5minutes) and you will find a great spot to swim, just walk towards puerto morales you will go past a couple of resorts and you will know when you get there.No Rocks! The best part of the resort by far is the pool. It is big! The pool bars are great so look for happy hour specials (11am-5pm).my biggest complaint is that the water had to be around 95 degrees.Although it was cooler in the morning, they must add water early.Also rent a cabanna for the day (@$35). You will get this money back if you spend $35 on food and beverages at the cabanna and you will easily spend that. It cost be @$60 each day for lunch for 2 adults and 3 small kids without alcohol. The rooms- First thing is make sure you get put into building 1-7. Second if you have the ability to upgrade to the grand mayan do it. The rooms in the mayan are nice but not as good as the grand mayan.Possitives; the rooms are spacious,daily room service, and the A.C. works great. Negatives; a little damp,no view and balconies stink. What to do- I have been to Xcaret and xelha before, i liked them ,but they are touristy and expensive. If you want to do something different I would recommend calling or emailing the guys down at aquatech vila de rosa (in akumal) We stayed there for a couple of days right after we left the mayan. The condo sits on one of the nicest beaches you will ever see, and the people there are great they will get you all the inside info on any excursion you want. They specialize in scuba and snorkeling the cenotes wich is one of the coolest things you can do in mexico. You can drive down to akumal go on a snorkeling tour through there own private cenote then swim with turtles. After your done drive into the town of akumal to eat. Another thing we did was go down to Tulum. Beware it was Hot!!! but we came prepared to jump into there own private beach. In my opinion the most beautiful beach I have ever been too well worth the price of admission, which was cheap. SUMMARY- I had a great time, the resort is beautiful and big. I wished it was a little bit cooler out I would have loved to play the golf course which is in great shape.The mexican people are fantastic (great service), the pool is great. I especially loved the pool in the grand mayan side overlooking the lagoon. No one got sick (swine or dissentary) No one got shot (drug gangs). We felt very safe in this part of Mexico. I dont know If I would go back to this resort. There are soo many other beautiful resorts in this area its tough to choose. The Mayan has to lower prices it seems to be a hugh buisness mistake for them to keep charging high prices for food. I told them when I was leaving that if I thought the prices were fair I would have no problem spending the money in the resort; instead I went out to eat every night, and not for nothing the resort is only around 30% full.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex UK", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced, inconvenient, but great staff\u201d", "Author": "Jimmythegymie", "ReviewID": "UR39311474", "Content": "Don't accept a room on the bottom floor.

The kitchen consisted of a two burner stove, microwave, toaster, blender, and small refrigerator (which fit our needs). The restaurants (we ate at the Havana Moon, Tramonto, and another restaurant for a breakfast buffet) were well priced, portions outrageously large, and delicious. There are two major drawbacks to this site; (1) the beach is extremely rocky - you MUST bring water shoes if you intend to go in the water. I felt very bad for those that did not have the proper footwear because it was very dangerous to go in the water without shoes. The water was beautiful, however, about 80 degrees and there were NO jelly fish or stingrays.; (2) This resort is huge. You have to rely on a tram to get you from your room to the pool/beach. The trams were not very reliable and we typically found that it was quicker to walk to the lobby and catch the central tram, than to wait at our room. Another drawback (if you plan on going there in the summer) is the mosquitos. Although we sprayed ourselves every night, these mosquitos were persistant and we got bit up every night. This, of course, is not the resort's fault, it is just Mexico in the summer. I can't say enough nice things about the staff. They were wonderful and very accommodating.

The hotel is designed to be a large self-contained resort that prevents guests from leaving. The rooms are actually nice, if anything they are more like apartments. They are generously sized and we enjoyed the privacy of the 2 bedroom suite and the large common area. The beds, however, are literally like rocks. I am not exaggerating. It is like a rock slab. While the rooms are great, getting anywhere from the rooms to anywhere else in the resort is a total pain in the @$$. The rooms are so far from everything else. Yes there are shuttles, but they run infrequently and are often so crowded that you can't get on them. Walking from our room in building 20 to the pool took about 20 minutes. 20 minutes!!! The extensive network of pools and the palapas are nice (and they don't tell you this, but if you grab one of the bed palapas and spend $35 on drinks or food, it's free) but this seems about average for every other place in the Cancun / Playa Del Carmen area. The pool system is big, but the hotel is also enormous, so it's not like you're swimming alone, even if it is huge. And the beach is awful. In a place of beautiful beaches, this one is rocky and not usable. what the fudge? The restaurants are meh. The Asian one is awful, don't eat there. Worst of all the hotel runs a \"shuttle\" to the Playa Del Carmen Walmart, so that you can buy stuff at Walmart I guess, but it's also a good way to get into town. Every single time we tried to take the shuttle, there would not be enough room and then you'd end up waiting 30 minutes while they called more vans. Every single time! Like they don't realize that one van is not going to be enough? Come on. They also only allow ONE tour provider onto the resort, which means you're stuck with that provider's outrageous prices. For example, the Tulum tour would be like $160 for 2 people and instead we took the shuttle to Playa Del Carmen and then a bus to Tulum and back and a cab back to the hotel, all for about $50. Every one of these tours is a rip. I don't know who this resort is designed for. It's not fun for younger people, because the activities and bars are lame and not open at night really. It's not really great for families because, well imagine hauling your children down to the pool on a 20 minute walk. And then, what if you forgot something and had to walk 20 minutes back with all the kids in tow?? Oh and not internet in the rooms. Read again: I am not saying there is not free internet in the rooms. There is NO Internet. Instead, they have 6 computers that you have to pay to use that are located a 20 minute walk from your room. You can imagine how difficult it is to get onto a computer when there are only 6 at a resort with hundreds of people. What hotel doesn't have internet?

The service is excellent we just had one or two problems with the staff people, they are actually really nice and polite. The hotel food is expensive, but i highly recommend the pool nachos, they're the best i've ever tried. The bad thing is that the hotel is SO huge that everything seems to be miles away so you have to wait for the golf car to go to the pool, lobby, parking lot or whatever.. Dont count on the beach, it's full of rocks and it's almost impossible to walk on them since they feel like slim or something, you can find good beaches in playa del carmen (about 15 minutes away). Another critic would be the lack of ilumination in the nights, i felt scared everytime i had to walk from the parking lot to the golf car stop. The hotel is 40 minutes away from cancun so if you're planning to go to the clubs then rent a car and try not to drink if you're driving beacause it's REALLY far away.

They had a dive shop there and we dove on a reef which was not great but then did the wreck dive with them which was one of the best dives we have ever been on. Chichen Itza was a must see. We also did a tour to XPLOR which was new. They have zip lines and other activities mostly underground in caves. If you have never been in caves, it is great, but we have had lots of cave tours and so it was a little pricey we thought. We thought the meals and drinks were a little pricey but compared to an all inclusive it is a bargain unless you plan to drink a lot. Since it was July and hot , it would have been nice to have more restaurants with A/C. Only 2 restaurants which were very pricey had A/C.

I stayed there with my rci exchange so i got a big room with a separate open floor plan living room, kitchen.& dining area. The decor is very modern contemporary!!!! OK now i will start with the bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thank God i read trip advisor before going there because this place is more expensive than the Bellagio in Las Vegas. One drink is 9.00 dlls. or more. The Mexican fiesta buffet was 60.00dlls per person, kids were half off. When i got there they ask for a credit card and charged it with 800.00dlls. so it could be used to at the end of the week to pay my tab since the resort is a no cash place. I ask one of the waiters why this place was so expensive and he responded that the prices were European prices!!!!!!!!WHAT I SAID!!! Were in Mexico!!! He just laughed and walk away. So if you are willing to spend some money like 9.00 dollar chicken fingers then be very prepared.!!!!The food was so-so-so. IF you also want to save 10% of your tab and get a 1,000 pesos then you should attended the timeshare presentation you will be held capitive there like i was with my family for almost 6HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!! The price of the timeshare went from 145,000 dlls. to 6,700 dlls. after 5 hours. My kids were going crazy in there. we were given a free breakfast buffet and then after 3 hrs only water. I even told my kids that i would give them hints when to start acting fussy so that the timeshare koo-koos would let us go. It didn't work..WHEN the 5th person tried to selll us again i told him i was nauseas and ready to throw up!!!!!!!!!! They finally let us go!!!!!So if you are bored at this resort then go ahead and take the presentation or if you are thinking of buying from them then wait 5 hour or more and you will probbably get your timeshare almost for FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok bring mosquito repellent or they will eat you alive!!!!!!!!!! Bring water shoes...The beach is beautiful and has a coral reef on shore . there you can walk around the rocks and explore. my children loved it because everyday they found fish, star fish and crabs. There are beautiful places on the beach where you can actually relax in natural rock form jacuzzi size pools filled with warm ocean water and beautiful fish!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is also a part of the beach where you can catch some waves too!!!!!! i did not see any broken rocks or sea shells that other people have talked about!!!!! NOW with the good~~~~~~~~~~~ 1.The beach 2.the pool is so big i was told its the biggest one in latin america 3.palapa/cabanas(only 35.00dlls. for the entire day-or free if you spend 35.00 on drinks and food around the pool!! 4. i loved this hotel its so elegant and beautiful. very well kept with staff cleaning 24hrs a day. 5.The housekeepers were so nice and respectful. oNE EVEN FOUND MY daughters earing and placed it on the kitchen table. The night housekeeper would come at night and prepare our beds to go to sleep with a couple of chocolates...Please tip them too!!! 6.This place was surround by its natural jungle landscaping so every day we would see huge butterflies, iguanas and diffrent types of birds....

Myself and three friends stayed in a 1 bedroom suite in the Grand Mayan... and loved it! We are planning on going back next year! The service was extraordinary and the pools, grounds, and rooms were gorgeous! PROS: Service: AMAZING. From the front desk to the concierge, bar tenders, waiters, housekeeping staff, bell boys, and pool staff everyone was great! All were nice, attentive, and fun! The staff is by far the Mayan Palace's best feature. Pools: Biggest and nicest pools I've ever seen! There are three to choose from, each with it's own charms. The main pool is HUGE, warm, and has great features for in-water tanning. All drinks are 2 for 1 from 11:00 to 1:00 every day, and a select drink is 2 for 1 from 1:00 to 5:00. The bartenders were extremely friendly and provided excellent service (and entertainment). One of the other pools is lined with shaded cabanas and other relaxing features. Food: The food was excellent and (for the most part) reasonably priced. The resort has a number of restaraunts that offer all sorts of cuisine - Mexican, Asian, American, etc. While there are definitely some pricier restaraunts ($15+ appetizers and entrees), there were also a number of moderately priced places to eat on the grounds ($7+). To save on food costs, we took the $3 shuttle to the Playa del Carmen Walmart on the first night and stocked up on breakfast and lunch foods for the week (the on-site grocery store is very expensive). When we arrived, the receptionist told us that some restaraunts had been closed due to low occupancy during the swine flu scare, but that they were opening up again slowly week by week as guests started coming back - we ate at 6 different restaurants while we were there. Location: The resort is roughly 30 to 40 minutes from both Cancun and Playa del Carmen. For some people this might be a con, but for us it was a pro. We loved the secluded feeling and didn't really need anything that the quick Walmart trip and resort grounds didn't offer. Through talking with other guests we learned that taxis to Cancun and Playa were somewhat expensive, but were readily available from the resort lobby if you needed one. If you're looking for an amazing nightlife, the Mayan Palace has a few things to offer, but might not be the place for you. Rooms: We stayed in a 1 bedroom Grand Mayan suite (with kitchen)... it was GORGEOUS, spacious, clean, very well decorated, and had a mini private balcony pool! The housekeeping staff was great - our remote control battery died and they brought us a new one within the half hour! Also, our fridge wasn't working properly initially, and someone came within minutes to fix it and we were problem-free for the rest of the trip. Other: Some of the rooms were located pretty far from the pool and other amenities, but the resort had a great shuttle service that ran about every 15 minutes from location to location. The lobbies were gorgeous, as were the rest of the grounds (very green and well kept). I'll complain a little bit about the excursion we booked through the concierge below, but there was a great snorkeling trip available right on the Mayan Palace beach. It was about $45 per person for about 4 hours of boating, snorkeling, and tanning on a secluded beach. The guides were great (they took you from area to area of the reef showing you certain fish and coral, including sting rays, sea turtles, and lobsters) and the reef had tons of fish. The secluded beach was kind of small (and home to a fisherman's hut), but pretty nonetheless. We didn't travel with kids, but there was a Kid Zone that looked like it had a ton of fun activities and was filled with kids each day. CONS: Beach: The beach was kind of small and very rocky.... you have to wear water shoes/flip flops if you want to swim. Though we initially went to Mexico for serious beach time and were initially very dissapointed when we saw Mayan Palace's beach, we were quickly in better moods when we saw the pools! There was parasailing (about $50 per person for a 20 minute ride) and jet skiing (not sure of the price) available at the beach. Excursions: We booked the Xel-Ha/Tulum excersion (I think it was roughly $100 per person with food, transportation, and drinks all included for the day, 9:00-6:00). Our tour guides were TERRIBLE, and neither Xel-Ha or Tulum were very exciting. Also, the snorkeling at Xel-Ha wasn't very good. We heard other people rave about Xcaret and other dolphin activities, however. Also, we heard people say that booking excursions from Playa del Carmen was a good idea. Timeshare Presentation: We were offered a free brunch, $50 off of our bill, and 10% off all purchases made at the resort for attending the \"90 minute\" timeshare presentation. The breakfast and tour were fine, but the saleswoman was kind of pushy and generally annoying. The 90 minutes was more like 3 hours. In the end we did get the free brunch, $50 credit, and 10% off... but I'm not sure it was totally worth it. We also got discounts on excursions offered through the hotel. While are timeshare experience was bad, I've heard others say that their's here were horrible. Other: We were dissapointed in the Mexican fiesta dinner that cost $55 per person. While the buffet was good and drinks were included the entertainment was seriously lacking. There were a few contests for guests (a pinata for the kids) and a half-hearted mariachi band. The party was supposed to last from 6:00-12:00, but we left by 9:00.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "swan94577", "ReviewID": "UR32775569", "Content": "We stayed at the Mayan palace for 7 nights.

My mother needed a wheelchair to get around and the let her use it not just on the grounds but off the grounds as well.

The beds were a little harder than we were used to but we asked for a foam mattress and they gave it without any problems.

Getting through the persistent touts at the airport is a pain and confusing. Once we found our representative we were speedily shown to the minibus. The staff are all charming and courteous, our room was clean and although not completely finished and overlooking a building site was cool and clean. We were quite a way from the pool and found directions to the various restaurants a little sparse. The pool was beautiful and again staff were friendly and the food was resonably priced. We went into Playa del Carmen to shop and look at the white sands and blue seas also had lunch at the beach cafe (loos questionable). We got details of buses to Tulum which we planned to visit. We took a taxi into Puerto Juarez (300pesos return, our driver came back for us later that day) and caught the ferry to Isla Mujeres. If you want to see the ruins YOU MUST GET A GOLF CART OR BIKE we tried to walk but turned back after stopping at a cafe for a drink. Take your drivers license or no golf cart. (2 hrs=350pesos). Then we had lunch at a restaurant on the beach. If you buy hammocks or trinkets ask the pedlars on the beach side first, we didn't and paid more at the shop, managed to haggle to half the price though. We attended the Mexican buffet evening on Thursday night at Del Lago which was okay but early next morning were violently ill. Even though we drank and ate little. Unfortunately this continued for the rest of the holiday and we were confined to our apartment therefore did not get to see anymore of Mexico. On return home we are still suffering the effects of this night out (5 days later). We did mention this to the desk but were told we probably weren't used to the food............So be very careful of buffet food. We do not know if this was caused by water-borne or food-borne micro organisms but they certainly don't muck about, have never felt so ill.

We should have prepared a little more for the lack of tourists, but frankly none of us expected the area to be as \"dead\" as it was. There were four adults in our party ages 27-31. We stayed in a 2-bedroom unit. The resort itself is very beautiful. I could go on and on about the pool, it's just gorgeous. If you're a beach person, you'll be disappointed with the beach on this resort, as it's very rocky. You can go out into the water, just be prepared with water shoes. Otherwise, you'll be stuck on the sand! We went May 17-24 and the resort was operating at 13% occupancy. While this sounds great in theory, its presented a couple of annoyances. First, we were excited to try Havanna Moon after reading great reviews on their food. It was closed. We were excited to try the wine bar. Closed. We had heard there were shows every night. Cancelled. There was only one show on Thursday, but we didn't attend. Others said it was mediocre. I'll try and break this down, without being too wordy! Food - Average at best. The best food you'll get is either from the pool bars (Average prices $8-$12) or the breakfast buffet at Del Lago ($38 for two). The food at the Italian place was OK at best. Don't order the chicken parmesan!! Don't expect the \"normal\" Italian food like you'd get in the States. We went to the Wal-Mart in Playa Del Carmen and got groceries for the week. They sell little styrofoam coolers near the alcohol isle and you'll need one, because even in the two-bedroom unites the fridge is a mini one. You can bring food/drinks into the pool area, just no glass. There's also a happy hour every day (2 for 1) on frozen drinks. Good drinks for the most part! Prices - I felt like the prices were very fair. Golf was only $50 for 18 holes (we brought clubs, but I think it was only about $20 extra to rent). Our entire bill for four people was $1,200. That included several days worth of happy hours, 3 dinners onsite, a one day excursion, the golf for two, shuttle costs back to airport and participation in the casino night. I mean, for $600 per couple, it was a great deal. The other expenses we had were just trinkets, meals offsite, groceries, etc. If you're willing to eat simple for lunch by picking up some groceries, you'll save a lot of $$. Activities - the activities staff was very energetic. They are trying their best to make sure people have a good time, despite the fact that there are hardly any tourists. They have water aerobics every day and other afternoon \"silly\" activities that happen poolside (drink mixing classes, \"soccer\", etc.). Misc. - We had all intended to use the gym while we went, but didn't because it was $10 per person, per day. I think that's pretty ridiculous. Internet, $7 per hour. Taxi's are $5 per person each way to Playa. It's the closest town to the resort. Plenty of bars & restaurants. We took the ferry over to Cozumel ($22 per person r/t), but it was also dead. There are just no tourists! We heard that the major travel companies and cruise ships were lifting travel restrictions as of 5/23/09, so that may help. I would recommend doing the Xel-Ha/Tulum excursion. It was fun, a good deal and lasted an entire day. It's basically an outdoor, natural water park followed by a tour of the ruins. We rode in an air-conditioned bus, so it was comfortable as well. It's very clean and I wouldn't hesitate to go back... just bring your hand sanitizer and you'll be fine. Overall, we had a good time. I would just adjust your expectations accordingly so you aren't disappointed.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cI want to go back !!!\u201d", "Author": "jdaniels23", "ReviewID": "UR30420190", "Content": "when we first arrived in mexico they had free AIRCONDIDTIONED shuttle service to the resort. we had a very early flght and arrived at the resort at about 1:30-2:00pm. We had to wait FOREVER for our room to get done... They first told me 1 time and the time changed maybe two other times. Aroung 5:00 they finally allowed us to check in. ROOM: the room was very nice and has lots of space. there was afull size living room with all the furniture, they do have a mini kitchen in the unit which was very well equipted with 2 stove burners, sinks, dishes and a mini refridge (dont expect to fit much inside besides drinks. the bed had a huge king size bed with dressers, lamps, balconys, ect and the bathroom was pretty big as well... the toliet area was separted by a door which was also nice. POOL: depending on where you are located in the resort, the pool and/ or beach area could be kinda of far. I was in building 3 which is pretty close we could probably walk to the pool in 3 minutes (which was ok its not like it was cold outside) The pool area was HUGE! From one end of the pool you couldnt see to the other side of the pool thats how big it was. At the pool area they had pool bar which are located within the pool where they make you GREAT drinks. they have happy hour everyday from like 12pm-3pm when they have the drinks 2 for 1. they had a diffrent activity in the pool all time time. They have a bartending class inside the pool which is fun where they give you free drinks and teach you how to make the drinks as well, so if you can get up that early you should really try it! They always had a contest in the pool weather it be a volleyball contest, a triva contest or a sexy man contest (my boyfriend was in that one). ENTERTAINMENT: Another thing i can say i LOVED. the second night we were they they had a beach party. they had a DJ outside( i was expecting them to play more spanish music since we were in mexico, but they played alot of techo which i didnt like), a stage and lots of place to sit. not to mention a waiter that would come and take your order outside so you never had to stop what you were doing. the second night they had casino night when it was $10 a person and that got you in a free drink and $100 in mayan money. It last like 3 hours and at the end of the night with your mayan money you get to buy coupons to get discounts at resturants throughout the resort. So everynight they had some kind of theme type party. RESTURANTS: Just like home the more expensive resturants are the best. we were being lazy and didnt realize how many resturants they really have. they have a pool bar that opens pretty early and does and buffet style breakfast and they they have a menu lunch and/ or dinner. I mean the food was ok ( the other resturant, havana moon seemed to have all the same things maybe just made alittle diffrent). We went up to both the Gong resturant (japanese) and the tremonto (sp?) which is the italian one. those two are expensive but i can honestly say its worth it! STAFF: WOW!!! Is all i can say. by the second day at the resort the staff at the pool and in the pool bar resturant knew us by name. I would go and get us towels for the pool and the lady is like \" hi jasmine you need 2 towels for you and rafael?\" One day i was sick and my boyfriend said the staff keep asking \" where's jazmin...\" But like i said very nice, friendly, energetic staff that seemed like they enjoyed their jobs. Made me kinda want to work there. they also had waiters EVERYWHERE at the resort. when your at the pool in all honestly, you dont have to stop what your doing for anything. they have waiters at the pool area, and beach that took orders for drinks as well as food. they also cleaned your room 2 times a day EVERY day ROOM SERVICE: Now room service i'll say was just OK... i seemed like it didnt matter what you ordered, its would take atleast 30-45 minutes. the last night i order 3 sodas and 1 cheese cake, it still took that 30 minutes. I also didnt like how they had a select menu after a certain time. they were good about calling your room to make sure you enjoyed everything. KID ACTIVITIES: i didnt bring any kids with me, but the kids area was right in the front of the pool and next to the pool bar. They have staff that does organized activities with the kids, watch movies. they also had 2 ladies in the back braiding hair for the girls. TOURS: you can get tours to place but they are expensive. SECURITY: They have really good security. when you come in they want to know the name of the driver, where your going and your room number and when you come back they want to know the same thing and they want to make sure everyone in the car or taxi has on a mayan braclet. OUTSIDE THE RESORT: we didnt do the walmart thing or the tours we were just there to have fun! we did go out to playa del carmen to the night clubs. It was like a huge strip with resturants, hotels, clubs. we ended up catching a taxi fo $20 per car each way and ended up at the club called CoCo maya. it was free for everyone to get in, ladies drank free until midnight (make sure you dont try and get a last LAST minute drink because since its free only 1 person is serving drinks while everyone else just looks around while the line get more and more packed and at 12:00 no matter if u were in line or not your drink is no longer free. but the club itself was great!! the DJ was great, the people, even the layout of the club was nice. not to mention its right infront of anothrt beach! If your interested in another clubs you are right within a 1-2 minute walk to all the hot clubs. PEOPLE AT THE RESORT: The people there at the resort were great! everybody was so nice and friendly. its like you can just start a conversation whith anybody. we meung out and hung out with people from everywhere. i know i may have left out alot of details, but i LOVED the resort and the next chance i get im going back!!", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston, ma", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely amazing\u201d", "Author": "beachgirlinbos", "ReviewID": "UR29417462", "Content": "Just got back from an amazing stay at the grand mayan/mayan palace with a friend.

Even staying during a week where everyone was scared of the swine flu, this resort is a big reason why we still had such an amazing time. We ate at every restaurant except tramonto - and were impressed with everything except havana moon. But to their credit, we went very late at night and were probably their last table. The resort had more then enough to do during the day including the \"amazing and outstanding\" water aerobics class. Everything was super clean and the grounds were immaculate. The buildings can be a bit far from the pool but the shuttles come very often and make for a fun ride over. You must get the coco loco at the pool, it will make for an interesting afternoon. The only thing I would suggest against if you are young is staying around the resort at night. We are in our 20's and were dissapointed that the place cleared out around midnight. But that can be quickly remedied with a cab ride to playa del carmen where the night life will keep you dancing until the sun comes up. And the prices? We were shocked at checkout. And by shocked I mean pleasantly shocked it was so cheap. Granted we are from a major US city, but still. If you take advantage of the happy hour 2x1 deals, you will save a bundle.

The threat of Swine Flu didn't hamper our stay here at all. Our friends and families back home were more concerned than we were.

The refrigerator is very small, so we used it mainly for beverages. We knew from reading prior reviews that the beach was rocky, but the pool was MAGNIFICENT, and we enjoyed spending almost all of our time there! We enjoyed happy hour at the pool every day from 11am-1pm, with specialty drinks 2 for 1. There was also a drink of the day at 2 for 1 until 5pm. We shared lunches at Balche's pool bar, and loved every menu item that we tried.....especially the nachos! We also tried the crepes at the Creperie, and they were also very tasty. We had pizza at Havanna Moon, shrimp and pasta at Tramonto (the Italian restaurant), and teriyaki chicken at Gong (the Asian restaurant), and we enjoyed every meal. Prices were in line with restaurants of similar caliber in Ohio. We did not dine at Del Lago, but we did see the show there, which featured some lovely costumes. One evening we ventured out to Puerto Morelos in search of John Grey's restaurant which was featured in USA Today. It is called La Suegra, and is right on the beach. We all tried the Carribbean chicken special, and it was fabulous! and very reasonably priced. Our only disappointment was Carlos & Charlie's in Playa del Carmen.

Location sucks. Maybe there isn't much they can do since Cancun is lined up the way it is but nonetheless, this was a huge inconvenience. The Mayan hotels are far enough from Cancun (25-30 min drive) that it made me want to avoid eating out and enjoying other activities outside of the resort if possible. (Playa del carmen is also about 25-30 mins from the resort, the opposite direction from Cancun). Look at a map, this will help you understand. Room Service was okay, time was okay, price was outrageous (maybe im just not familiar). Especially the 24 hour food service, wow. Pool is nice. Relaxing. Beach is within walking distance but at last at the Mayan Palace is not very nice. Water looks okay but there are many rocks/moss. Not what people expect when they go to Cancun. We didn't. Service in general was okay. Note: EVERYONE WANTS YOUR MONEY. This is something you will just realize the second you land in Mexico if you have never been. They will not even let you pump your own gas for Joe's sake! and they will expect a tip for this as well. Believe you me. Food was okay. (sounds like everything was just okay right) No real complaints on cleanliness. Once the housekeeping did a terrible job of cleaning but i complained and they sent someone in right away.

No problem, we were allowed to change our clothes in the rest room and it the beach. We finally got into our room at around 5:30 PM only to get a smoking room with 2 slightly larger than twin beds, not big enough for my wife and I to sleep together.

The grounds at this facility are impeccable, the food is great, and the service from the staff is excellent. There are only three types of people who will not enjoy this hotel 1) people who don't enjoy anything because they enjoy complaining more 2) people who are on a tight budget 3) those who do the timeshare presentation---don't do it! I'll share with you some facts and some of my opinion: 1. Food here is moderately priced. A breakfast buffet, inclusive of coffee/juice, will run you about 470 pesos for two including tip, which roughly translates into $36 USD. Dinner can be anywhere from 500-800 pesos including tip for two depending on what you eat, which is roughly $40-$60 USD. A large pizza to your room is about 200 pesos---about $15 bucks. 2. The pool is 4 feet deep and large. There is a bar in the pool, which probably explains why the pool is not that deep. No slides for children. (Personal opinion: pool looks classy and IMO a slide would be tacky) 3. The beds are hard - ask for a mattress pad free of charge. 4. The resort welcomes children, but keep in mind it is not Disneyland. They do have activities like crafts, a nightly movie, and an arcade for kids. 5. There are honest people that work here and they are very friendly. Be nice to them and they will be nice to you. Quite a few people went out of their way to help us. 6. The buildings where the rooms are have no double doors and there is an elevator in each building. Most restaurants have open doors when you walk in. Sometimes you will need to hold the door open yourself---if you have a stroller, then have one person hold the door and then walk through. No problem. 7. Room do not have coffee machines, but DO HAVE irons, ironing board, safe, toiletries, and a hair dryer. Coffee Machine is the one thing missing, but we didn't miss it much because you can get better coffee via room service, green break, or most restaurants. 8. Walk to the pool and restaurants is not that far if you are able bodied with no children. With very small kids (under 5), it may be a hassle to walk 10-15 minutes. Depends on how your family is and whether you enjoy walking. 9. Hotel has a little mini super market where you can buy almost anything. You don't need a vending machine and in my experience, vending machines are not that cheap either. 10. The balconies are small and the view isn't that spectacular. Better to spend your time on the beach, on a tour, or swimming. Don't sit in your room all day---enjoy Mexico! 11. You can save money by taking the 40 peso ($3) shuttle to the Wal-Mart at Playa Del Carmen where you can buy snacks, water, and even food for cheap. Try the panederia----delicious pan dulce! Bring it back to the hotel if you don't like the mini super prices. 12. Don't go to the timeshare presentation---don't do it..no matter what they offer you. 13. Hotel has a no cash policy, you charge it all to your room and it eliminates any fear of having cash stolen, etc. Lastly, IMO traveling to MX is not advisable with small babies or toddlers. We have kids and we love them, but from my recollection traveling with a baby/toddler was no fun---no matter what the destination. My advice---wait til they are a little older, out of diapers, and a bit more self entertaining----both you and the kids will enjoy the trip more!

Yes, the resort is large and most buildings are away from the pool but as long as you are aware of that when you plan your vacation there should not be any complaints. The walk to the pool is beautiful and good exercise ! I would reccommend staying no furter than building 12-13. Our freinds stayed in building 1 and were very happy. We were in 12 and the main lobby is right outside so we had a small walk to the tram or a five minute walk to the pool. No big deal! The only downfall is the beach. If this place had a swimable beach it would be perfection! We are beach people and love to swim in the ocean but we knew this going in so I cannot complain. It is lovely to walk down to but it is full of coral, you cannot swim. Yet, when you see the pool you will forget about a beach. Besides, our kids said they would rather hang out at the pool there any day, they were very happy,the pool was truly spectacular! Due to there being no beach to swim in we planned a 10 day total vacation and after our week at the Mayan we headed south to Akumal and stayed at the Grand Bahia Principe, which has an amazing beach, so we had both..(I will write a review of the Grand Bahia later...good resort, beautiful beach!) If you can , I would definatly reccomend doing both~! You get the best of both worlds! There were two other families with us, a total of 13 who all had an amazing time and both plan on returning next year as well. The rooms are spacious and clean and big suprise, I slept better than I do at home in the bed! I guess I need a firmer mattress! We ate at most of the restaurants and the prices were not too bad. I reccommend spending the 40 pesos and take a ride to Playa Del Carmen to wal-mart. Hated missing pool time to do it but needed to get done and besides it was a fun adventure! We ate breakfast in our rooms and packed snacks and sandwiches to take to the pool. I reccommend bringing a cooler that looks like a beach bag, that way you can take water,beer and sandwiches to the pool secretly! Do go into town and eat in Playa Del Carmen, that was fantastic! Darling town, we ate at La Parillia which was delicious and not spendy at all. We also felt safe, at no time were we uncomfortable. Tulum was a great day trip, we hired our own taxi/van for our whole group of 13 the driver spent the whole day with us. He took us to Tulum and made sure we rode the tram to the ruins...good call beacuse it was hot and would have been a long walk. The driver took us to Akumal Bay to snorkle....not too good, it was to rough but we still swam there. I would definatly reccommend Tulum. To finish, I would reccommend this resort in a heartbeat! Great for families especilly big groups travelling together. The negative reviews I can see where they come from but I do not get.....If you study where you are going you will know what to expect you should not be suprised! The Mayan Palace is a beautiful resort, Grand Mayan even better! Go and have fun! You should not be dissapointed! I wish I was back at the pool right now! (By the way, do the timeshare deal..We did the early tour..Set your watch timer for 90 minutes so the alarm goes off, get a delicious breakfast and just be firm at no.... My husband upfront said we are not going to buy, we listened and were there a total of 2 hours from tour of Grand Mayan to breakast to finish. Not too bad, for 2 hours work we got $200.00 removed from our bill at checkout ! Just be strong and leave, I cannot see how people get stuck there for 4 hours!)", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cStay away fromTimeshare presentation!

The Mayan Palace represents some of the best that Grupo Mayan has to offer. An amazing hotel with amazing amenities in an amazing place. Don't let detractors get in your way...this is an awesome place. People who don't like their experience get caught up on trivial things....you have to know how to deal with the sales people, you have to not be afraid to spend some money at the pool, and you have to enjoy yourself! So, here's a breakdown. Please feel free to contact me for ideas, suggestions, or anything else. THE ROOMS: typical grupo mayan Mayan Palace room. Wonderfully spacious 2-bedroom suite with full kitchen, two bathrooms. If you own a Mayan Palace room like I do, it is typical, but lovely. Wall-art depicts Mayan tradition, and the colors are rich and inviting. Tiled floors, high ceilings...it's worth it. Realize that there are NO oceanfront rooms at this hotel...and it's cool. The Mayan Jungle theme is amped up, and Mayan Palace rooms have either a golf course view, or a Jungle View. There is a LOT of walking involved with this hotel, which I love. I'm on vacation, I love to be outside, walking, and enjoying the fresh air. However, this may help...the resort is in a large \"U\" shape, with the bottom of the \"U\" being the pool and beach. The left side of the U is the Grand Mayan, and the right side is the Mayan Palace. Inbetween, is the golfcourse. If you are concerned about excessive walking, ask for buildings 1-8 at check-in. The Lobby is located behind building 8 and thus, buildings 8-1 (in reverse order) make the way from the lobby to the pool. However, these rooms could be a bit noisier (although not much at all) because of the heavier foot traffic going to the pool. If you want quieter, but some more walking, go to buildings 8-21 (or 22...i forget). There is no internet access in rooms, so access is limited to the CiberCafe, in the Jade Boutique. SERVICE: Amazing...these people are there to serve. We didn't go more than two minutes without seeing someone sweeping up, squigeeing the floors by the pool, clipping flowers, etc. The place is immaculate, and the people friendly. I know that it's their job to say \"HOLA,\" but it feels good. They smile, they joke, they are wonderful people who do their job, and make you feel welcome while doing it. Again, don't be afraid to say NO to the sales people, or to the travel agent, etc...it's the culture to pitch a hard sale...and it's ok, because usually, it works! If you don't want something, walk away! The maid-staff was pleasant and very helpful. Any issues with the room were quickly resolved. POOL(S): I cannot underestimate the size of the pool. It is massive. No, I'm not just talking big...I'm talking massive...interconnected....amazing pools. More than enough seating for all. The pool wait-staff is amazing as well, very attentive, but not overbearing. Happy hour is 11-1, so take advantage!!! Don't forget the two bars in the pools!!! Mayan Palace members have unlimited 24-hour access to this behemoth of a pool, clearly that size from the Napoleonic conflict based on the bareness of the beach area (see below).. Grand Mayan members have a private pool area which is nice (i snuck in to see!), but nothing great. It serves the purpose of reducing traffic at the combined pool, so the effect is effectual! BEACH AREA: Well, the beach is a downer. Whatever, did I mention the pool?!?!?! The beach is rocky, so in reality, the water is not really navigable. There is, however, water sports, balloons, etc on the beach, and it can be credited to the hotel room. Once you get out into the sea, it is beautiful. There is a TON of seating and palapas on the beach, with some groovy chair/couch seating on the beach. Again, beach wait staff is great. There is a grand pier that goes out onto a palapa in the middle of the sea...beautiful pictures! From there, you can see the artificial coral reef they are attempting to build. It will take a number of years, but it will be beautful for snorkeling...mark my words! Don't let the beach thing get ya down....see below for other ways to get that fix. RESTAURANTS ON SITE: The Mayan Palace offers a great mix of restaurants. Here they are... Del Lago: AMAZING BUFFETT...breakfast every AM, and a themed Dinner every PM. Great food, customizable at cooking stations, great variety, great service. The dinner show (7:30 PM) is better than most private Mexican Fiesta's...it's traditional Mayan Dance and music, but it is authentic, and worth it! Balche/Frida's Grill: Poolside restaurant...is good for traditional Mexican food for a quick and easy dinner. For breakfast...a beautiful setting as the sun rises over the pool. Green Break: Middle of the golf-course, as the name suggests...limited selection, but perfect for the quick meal any time of the day. Great bar staff...very personable. Could be a little hotter than the other restaurants because it is inland from most of the resort, being on the green of the golf course. Also, be wary of \"spraying time\" for the mosquitos....they seem to forget it's an outdoor restaurant! Tramonto: Great Italian American Steak House. I didn't personally go to this restaurant, so I wont attest to the food quality, but the atmosphere is great. Nice menu...a little pricier, but don't forget, you're on the resort, and it's an indoor sit-down dinner. This is good for one night where you wanna get all dressed up, but not leave the resoirt. A good compliment is.... Tramonto Wine Bar: Located between Tramonto and Gong on the upper level of the Jade Boutique/Deli is the wine bar. Some nice Mexican/South American, as well as worldly wines. Moreover, it's the scenery. The large beds, and chairs outside on the deck, overlooking the pool, with a glimpse of the sea in the distance. WOW. Perfect for nightime, before and after that aforementioned dinner. There is space inside as well...but, you don't go to the Yucatan Peninsula to stay inside, right?! Gong: Japanese food in grand style! We had sushi, and it was amazing. Again, a little pricey, but totally worth it. Tramonto and Gong recommend reservations, and you shouldn't be in your bathing suit...so, get dressed up a little bit. Mix it in with the wine bar, and you got a GREAT evening. Great service at all of these restaurants as well! Havana Moon: Beach front dining in an open-air mix between a local restaurant and high-class establishment. The menu is DIVERSE, and thus perfect for one of the last couple of nights at the resort. The scenery is beautiful, with the moon rising at night and the sun rising in the AM. Pricing is excellent for innovative food on an incredibly varied menu. 3 different types of Ceviche and Duck Quesadillas on the same menu as Pasta Bolognese and Lo Mein...and everything inbetween. The scenery is beautiful with large flowing curtains and open-air shutters that bring the beach air in. Live music after 9 PM and an excitingly simple, yet risky dessert (Postres) menu rounds it all out! Jade Boutique/Deli/Creperie/Dulcheria: This is your typical boutique shop, with a deli appended onto the side for that emergency purchase. As I will mention, go to Walmart or Mega for the initial purchase for your villa, but the Deli offers a great chance to get that thing you forgot, or milk for coffee in the AM! The Deli offers great individual desserts and sandwiches as well as cold-cuts, etc. The Creperie is exciting!! It offers a full line of Savory and Sweet Crepes for that meal in-between. Additionally, there Creperie has Gelato's. Within the Jade shop there is also an arcade, where there are 4 large TV's with gaming systems hooked up into them, allowing individual play on X-BOX, Playstation, etc. Lastly, there is a small cyber cafe there, where you can access the internet for a rate. ACTIVITIES, ETC: The concierge is very helpful, and within the lobby there is a Alamo Rental Car counter, and a Travel Agency which has some great tours. However, the tours are expensive, and usually you end up on a bus for a long time, picking up other resort guests.That being said, it is totally worth it if you know nothing about where you are, what to do, or what they're saying. We used the tour to go to Chichen-Itza...completely worth it. However, we would much rather be masters of our own destiny, so one day we rented a car. If you're scared of driving, or scared of Mexico, or something, I don't recommend doing it, and certainly, the resort wants you to stay on property as much as possible so you drop some pesos at the pool bar. But, if you're adventurous, and want to do some safe exploration, I recommend the following: 1) Shuttle to Playa del Carmen: On Day one, take the shuttle to playa del Carmen, a town about 20 miles south. They will drop you off at a Wal-mart....go shopping, stock up the villa. They take you back on a schedule as well. Cost is 40 pesos per trip (@ $4.00). Don't go venturing off near there though...however, there is a Mega supermarket up the road, if you're scared of Wal-Mart. 2) Playa Del Carmen: If you rent a car, go down 307 (main road) into Playa del Carmen. Hang a left on Juarez Blvd and take it all the way down to 10th Ave. Park somewhere. Walk yourself to 5th Avenue, and you will be in another world. Amazing nightlife, bars, restaurants, shops, EVERYTHING. Safe, beautiful (not so much traditional, but...), and a great vibe. Go there at night for a safe night out on the town in a party-like atmosphere. Don't get me wrong...this is NOT a college-hang-out, etc...you can bring the family, it is FUN. Mariachi bands, etc. They close 5th avenue off, so it's on;y foot-traffic....and a lot of people are there. This is worth it for 2 or 3 nights out on the town! Just be careful driving back to the hotel!! You can taxi it, as well. 3)Tulum: Take your car (during the day) about a half an hour farther south to Tulum and you will be in a traditional Mexican town. Tulum pueblo (the town of Tulum, not the ruins) is a small little town with some great charm. Ease in and out of the sidewalk shops and haggle with the local business people. Have fun with it! BUT, the real charm is if you make a left at the first sign you see in Tulum for \"acceso publicidad de playa.\" Drive and Drive towards Sian-Ka'an. Keep going...don't get nervous and lose your gut now! You will find a paradise of small, little, boutique hotels and restaurants/bars right on the ocean...i mean literally on the ocean. Pull into any one of them...have a drink, order some appetizers and go to the beach through that estabishment. This is the beach you were looking for. White sandy beaches with crystal clear blue water. This is the postcard you've been waiting for. The people are laid back...the beach is all public (as is all beaches in mexico), and you can chill out in paradise! 4) Cancun: Located to the north of the Mayan Palace is the actual town of Cancun. If you haven't figured it out yet, the Mayan Palace is inbetween the town of Cancun and Playa Del Carmen. It is on a busy strip of 307 that houses every major resort known to mankind. I didn't find a need to go to Cancun, except on a tour from the resort. It is beautfiul, and amazing beaches are there...tremendous nightlife, daylife. It's all there...but it is very built up, and is easily overwhelming!!! I would rather explore the aforementioned locations than be overwhelmed by the Cancun Hotel Zone. Having said that...it is beautiful...and there is a TON to do! 5) You are very close to a number of other attractions...Puerto Morelos, Cozymel, Isla Mujeres, etc. For me, this will be when I return! HEALTH CLUB: Brio is the health spa on the grounds. Gym use is complimentary, and spa services can be purchased. There is yoga and stretching in a room overlooking the sea, which is beautiful. The gym is a bit undersized for the resorts size. There is not enough equipment, and it is missing some basic weight training equiptment that all gyms whould have. It gets crowded by 9AM, but dies down by 11-12. Thus, I went everyday at around 7-730 and was able to do everything I needed/wanted, without any interruption. I find the morning walk to Brio, the fresh air, and the morning workout cleared my head and got me ready for the relaxation of the day ahead. The gym/health spa staff is attentive and very nice. Occasionally, they will come around with ice-water for you, etc...very nice touch! Brio is a beautiful setting that just needs to be expanded and updated to meet the size requirements of the resort. CONCLUSION: Thus, the Mayan Palace really offers everything you are looking for. Their no cash policy makes everything exceedingly simple at the hotel. Quite honestly, you COULD stay on grounds the entire time, and relax, enjoy, etc. But, for two-three days of a week, getting out and exploring, either with a guide on a tour bus, or in a car is exciting. You should go see the ruins, but I recommend that to be with a guide. However, exploring the towns...do that on your own. Be your own guide, and make your own trip. I highly recommend going to the bakery in Tulum....great selection of breads that you may not even know what they are, but buy them...spend $7 USD....go out on a limb. You won't be dissapointed. The resort is beautiful, immaculate, and everything you want on a week away. People pay a lot for these resorts, units....so, even if you're trading into the Mayan Palace...you understand. Without a doubt, this resort lives up to the standard, and the Riviera Maya is a great place!! Again, I hope that if you do have any questions or comments that you can contact me!

We were pressured at the Thrifty car rental at the airport and finally caved in, thinking what the hell it is only 90 minutes and a free breakfast. Don't believe it is 90 minutes as we were there for 3+hours and they would have kept us for many more hours if they could! I did come with an open mind to see what the costs for their program was, which they call an investment program and it still smells like any time share program does. I just wanted to know the bottom line numbers and our salesman George just kept telling me to play along and we'll get you your gift and get you on with your vacation. The problem was it took forever and we told them this wasn't our cup of tea. We thought the resort was way too big and we are more comfortable in a private place where we can open the slider and the ocean is 20 yards away. They never took us to the beach during the tour cause it really isn't a beach you can swim at or snorkel. Even if you could play in the waves that would be ok ,but not here as it would probably be dangerous. After telling them were weren't interested and we wanted to leave, they brought over a manager and he had a better deal and started drawing circles and figures again on the board till I started getting angry and told him he had taken up twice the amount of time they had said they would. George thought it was funny to explain that it was 90 minutes per person in the group times the 4 in our group was the deal. I was not impressed. After the manager, they sent us to another table and there they started with an even better deal... I stopped that right away and then they said \"ok go with this lady and she'll take care of of the gifts you were promised \". Of course she took us to another table and the deal got even better, by this time I told her that unless she was giving it away for free we weren't interested and just wanted to leave. She takes us to another table and said someone would be with us in a minute with the gifts....we waited and finally I got another lady's attention and very rudely made it clear we we done and wanted out of here now. She was nice and told us to go downstairs and go to the counter and they would take care of us. We went and they took care of us immediately and paid us in American cash for the $20 deposit and the deal for the rental car they had promised. I can't tell you how much you want to avoid this! The only thing that was positive was the breakfast! It was excellent!

The weather was terrific. My husband and I have travelled to this area 8 times and enjoy ourselves everytime. The resort is immaculate, they even wash the cement walkway paths. The pool area is beautiful. The property layout is not centered around the pool and beach due to government regulations when construction began. The beach area has sand, palapas and a voleyball net b ut is not swimmable without water shoes due to the rocks and coral. They provide maid service both morning and night but do not wash dirty dishes. The mattresses are firm but with the toppers are comfortable. We had a 2 bedroom unit in building 16. It was a 15 minute walk from our room to the pool area or we could catch a shuttle which came by every 10 - 15 minutes. Happy hour at the pool is 11 - 1 daily with drinks being 2 for 1 (approx $ 7 US). We ate at several restaurants on site including Balche, tramanto and Del Lago. We all enjoyed the meals very much. The prices seemed expensive at first glance but when converted from pesos to US dollars were reasonable. You can rent the sheeted beds at the pool for $ 30 per day and as long as you spend $ 30 at the pool bar and restuarant you will not pay for the bed. It was very convenient as we could come and go as we pleased. We always rent a car unless we are staying in the hotel zone. They have shuttles from the resort to PLaya del Carmen which we did not use. The fridge in the unit although small was able to hold all our purchases for the week. We had a lemur and another critter visit our balcony every day for treats. We ate at a few restaurants off the resort as follows: 1) Alux - Playa Del Carmen - cave restuarant and bar - unusual with good food and great ambiance. They will take you on a tour of the caves for a donation. 2) Italianni's - Plaza LaIsla - Hotel Zone Cancun - good food and reasonable prices. They were also very accomodating. 3) Thai - Plaza LaIsla - Hotel Zone Cancun - private, good ambiance (treehouse ) food okay but I was bitten by several mosquitos. There are several activities at the resort but we all enjoyed Casino Night at the Grand Mayan with a $ 10 covercharge which included a drink. Lastly the timeshare presentation. In the very near future there will no longer be timehsare representatives at the airport or on the street as the government is shutting down this practice. In the meantime, if you attend, it will last longer than 1 1/2 hours. Every person that attends receives incentives to do so ranging from $ 70 - $ 200 depending on where you accept the invitation from. If you do not feel this is for you decline the invitation as everyone has the ability to choose. If you attend expect to be aggresively marketed but if you are not interested remain firm.

The grounds are large and alot of walking was done from our # 17 condo, we didn't really mind as we didn't feel as guilty at all of the wonderful food that we consumed. The pool size is unbeleivable. I was told that there are more pool & beach lounge chairs then beds at this place. Never had a problem finding free ones. Very good airport shuttle, directly to & from, no time wasted stopping at all the resorts between the airport and the Mayan Palace. We went on the Chitzen Itza tour, our tour guide was Rex, very knowledgable. Great day spent learning the history and culture of the Mayans and met some new friends. The \"no money\" policy is so convienent. Everywhere you go they ask your room #, and it is billed directly to your room. So at the pool or beach no need to worry about having cash with you.

It 's very clean and well maintained. Being a 5 star resort - the prices to me are what one should expect staying at a resort like this. The beach is rocky but the pools are great. Each day we found that one of the pools were cooler in temperature than others, which we prefered. We took down our own beer and drinks in our thermos (which is much cheaper than buying from the bars). All the food we ate there was delicious. I had a shrimp entree one night and it worked out to be $30 Canadian for 6 jumbo shrimp and some rice which to me was expensive for what I got. Not much happening for the teenagers at this resort but my sons made new friends. I would recommend staying in building 17-20 especially if you are driving. The shuttles pick up at building 20 and often were full by the time they got to the lobby to pick up people from buildings closer to the lobby wanting to go to the pool. There never was a long wait and the shuttles were a time to meet new people. CAR RENTAL - We rented a car at National and when I made the reservations I was NOT told that there was a mandatory insurance fee of approx. $10/day on top of the reservation. Even though I had coverage through Mastercard, they still insisted that we pay this. POLICE - we pulled onto the highway and within 15 seconds we got pulled over by the police. It was either a ticket or $20 cash. Reason for ticket - my husband was not wearing his seat belt! They let people sit in the back of flat bed trucks, have oodles of kids jammed into the back of trucks - that's okay - guess cause their Mexicans. We paid the $20, the policeman nodded to his boss and we were on our way. Apparently it's a new law and also talking on your cell phone is prohibited. Only wish National would have told us this. All week we drove from the Mayan to Playa Del Carmen and never had any other problems. PUERTO MORELOS - this was our favorite place to go. It is like the old Mexico with local restaurants and shops. The food was great and we really enjoyed the beach which is on a National Park. We got scubba equipment from the local dive shop (Dive in Puerto Morelos) and we snorkled from the beach. We saw huge turtles and lots of fish. Even though the locals use this beach, it still was very quiet. We didn't get bothered by any of the locals at all while in Puerto Morelos. We would definitely consider going back there for a week! DIVING - My son got certified in Puerto Morelos at \"Dive in Puerto Morelos\". They were great and he highly recommends this dive shop. Brett the owner was very friendly and helpful. Our son went out on a Ship Wreck dive just before we left and had a great time with Shannon. SWIMMING WITH THE DOLPHINS - we took our younger son to Dolphin Discovery in Puerto Adventuras (which is just on the other side of Playa Del Carmen). I booked it online at the hotel and it was $99 USD for the \"Swim Adventure\". It was an hour in the water with the dolphins. He got a belly-ride, hand shake, kiss, underwater fun and a boogie board ride. Well worth it for our 12 year old son. PLAYA DEL CARMEN - We had dinner there two nights. Once at Carlos and Charlies which we wanted our boys to experience. It's a fun place - but expensive for what you get. We had another dinner there at a restaurant on 5th avenue and it wasn't that great. The whole street is SOOO AMERICAN and pricey - we really didn't like it.

Some buildings were pretty far from where everything was, if you mind the walk then there are golf carts that pick guests up and bring them to their buildings. There are shuttles that bring you into town, Playa del Carmen. It's worth the trip into town to pick up food/liquor for the week and to walk down 5th Ave for shopping. The food was excellent and very afforadable at the resort. Take advantage of the \"happy hour\" two for one drinks! Guacamole was delicious! The only thing I did not like was we had two accounts on file to charge everything to and sometimes they did not charge the right account and they said that they could not move over the charges. We wanted to buy dinner one night for my boyfriends parents and it ended up going on his parents account!

Purposely wanted to experience one of the Mayans to see if I would enjoy the size and amenities. I told myself before going, we could spend this week relaxing without the desire to even leave the grounds and explore the surrounding community. The Good: \u2022 Beautiful grounds and landscaping. Enormous pool and surrounding area (take you ten min. to walk around the pool). \u2022 Daughter had a lot of fun at the kids club. \u2022 Good food and ambiance at the Asian restaurant upstairs in main building. \u2022 Lots to see on the property from animals to plant life. \u2022 Rooms were large and clean. \u2022 Staff was VERY nice. The Bad: \u2022 Rooms are not on the beach or near the pool\u2026you\u2019d never know you were in Mexico We were in building 15 (yes, we should have asked for a closer bldg, but once you get there and unload your stuff\u2026). So, you pack up (for the day) and go to the pool. If you forgot anything, it\u2019s a 20 minute trip (running) back to the room and back. And, of course that\u2019s Dad\u2019s job. Yes, there is a shuttle, but who wants to sit and wait, unless it pulls up right then. Oh, back to your room at night\u2026forgot bottled water of daughter wants a snack. Back to the shops\u2026see you in a half-hour. \u2022 Besides the Asian restaurant reference above, the rest of the food and restaurants were Terrible! And, way too expensive. \u2022 Go to Wal-Mart! Example of the prices at the supermarket on-site - $17us for a 6-pack of canned beer. Unfortunately, the mini-fridge in room won\u2019t hold much. Pack up your beer to take to the pool; conceal it \u2018cause you\u2019re not supposed to bring your own. \u2022 Happy hour at the pool \u2013 4 margaritas for the price of 2\u2026.$21 not including tip. A salad (not good), chicken strips (almost burned), and calamari (good) from the pool bar\u2026$45\u2026.priceless!!! \u2022 Pools were too cold and too shallow. The Ugly: \u2022 After initially making an appointment for the free (breakfast\u2026wink, wink), I later cancelled and then avoided all their attempts to resign me up for the time-share presentation. \u2022 Not a swimming beach, but actually fun to explore the tide pools. \u2022 Way too secluded. Since you are so far from town, and there are only a few shuttles per day, they can afford to charge the prices they do. We spent a couple full days in Playa Del Carmen\u2026and loved every minute (great beach and\u2026good restaurants). Other families we spoke to Loved the Mayan Palace, so my review is personal preference. I decided that I (we) enjoy opening the patio door first thing in the morning and stepping onto the beach. If your idea of fun is making an event out of doing pretty much anything\u2026then you will love it here. We still had a blast!...we were in Mexico! Just overall it wasn\u2019t my cup of tea...hated it. I like being able to see the pool bar from my room or at least being able to hear the sounds of the ocean.

I highly recommend the resort so I'll explain the \"average\" rating by telling you a little bit about us and you can judge from there whether or not this resort is for you. We are in our early thirty's, no children and not \"partiers\" but do like to be out and about during the day and return to a few cold beers. The bars at the resort were really not conducive to this type of - come back and talk with other travelers about your day over a few beers at a good bar - thing that we like to do. The resort is in between Playa and Cancun so there is NOTHING within walking distance. While that certainly lends to security, it makes it inconvenient if you want to explore. We had a car but that meant coming back to the resort before having more than one or two beers to unwind (see paragraph above). There was a shuttle to Playa but we spent a lot of time there during the day as we took the ferry to Cozumel to dive. (That's a whole other review, but if you're a diver, I don't need to tell you anything!) Speaking of the sea, we didn't go to Puerto Morelo until our last day. Big mistake! It is a gorgeous fishing town with a beautiful public beach and great snorkeling. The shore at the resort was too rough when we were there but it may have good snorkeling too. Any who, back to the resort. We stayed in a hotel style room and it was your typical hotel sized room with typical hotel comforts. Clean, well-maintained but nothing fancy. Good clothing space and average beds. (We did opt out of the many offers to upgrade and receive discounts for attending the \"special brunch\" offered.) We did sneak a peak into the studio apartment and it looked really nice. There was the musty odor in the room as I had read in a review before we left but I have found this in most resorts and hotels in this climate. All rooms have a patio/balcony, none overlooking the ocean as far as I could tell. The resort itself is beautiful with lots to do but we would have been just as happy in a little no-name a little closer to off-resort activities. The pool was impressive in size to say the least. Shallow (less than 4 ft), no waterslides or \"laze rivers\" but huge! If you are a couple, family or group that wants to hang out at a great pool this is the place for you! Staff was attentive and helpful throughout and prices at the resort were fair and the store is well stocked for your needs. There were also many tour options at fair prices. The food and service was very good and we tried every place. The sushi restaurant was phenomenal! So, overall, if you want to spend most of your time at a beautiful resort utilizing the many activities and amenities offered, I highly recommend this resort. If we were traveling with family or children this would have been perfect. But if you are more of a see how the day goes wanderer, I recommend staying in Puerto Morelos or Playa del Carmen.

The prices were comperable to what you would find at any US resort. The rooms and the grounds were well maintained and every employee was very gracious and helpful.

Honestly I wasn't paying for much as relatives own a time share and we were vacationing with them. The service was very good. Room service was good. The rooms were absolutely amazingly beautiful, my 3 yr old son slept on a little trundle bed and he LOVED it. There were little reflection pools on the decks, which were also a huge hit with our son. TVs worked fine, ample storage room in the kitchen and bathrooms for items we brought. We didn't mind the walking, it's so nice to get outside in warm weather and sun in February when you live in Northern New England. The pools were wonderful, although there was sometimes a strong smell of chlorine. There was some construction happening in the resort but it wasn't really near our building. It was fun to walk around and check out the different pools. The beach area was fabulous. There is a nice quality swing set/play gym for kids on the beach, not far from the pools. We would get up early, around 7 a.m., go and reserve a bunch of seats by a palapa, then lounge most of the day. We didn't go in the beach water as the shore was rocky and the pools were just much nicer and easier for us with our little guy. At lunch we enjoyed service on the beach and ate a couple times at the poolside restaurants. Beer and guac and chips on the beach feels so decadent. A few things to note. We were not aware of the complimentary shuffle from the airport until AFTER we arrived to the resort. Our relatives did some complaining and we made sure to not make that mistake on the way back to the airport. It's SO worth it to take a taxi to Playa del Carmen, go parasailing, and hit the Mega grocery store there. Much cheaper than eating at on-site restaurants the whole time. But we were on vacation, we were prepared to have a restaurant budget and really just enjoyed the conveniences. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more local flavor happening but this was a big resort. We had a really fun time in Playa del Carmen. Too bad this resort wasn't in PdC. It was nice to get some inexpensive souvenirs at the shops there, good vanilla and great deals on tequila. We know what to look for this year. Haggling with the local vendors can be fun, don't take it too seriously. These people don't make much money and really, a couple dollars here or there isn't a big deal. If you're spending $$$ to go there for vacation, shell out a buck or two extra and make the locals happy. We did not know the beach at PdC gave topless as an option. I didn't mind although it was kind of funny explaining it to my 3 yr old. haha! No biggie. There were luchador masks and really cool recycled snack wrap purses as well as beautifully hand painted (lead -free!) clay bowls in the markets there. I also got some candy for my son to take home and it was just neat trying out the different foods. One day my husband and I had the luxury of taking an excursion to Xel-Ha. It was amazing. We purchased the all-inclusive package, and brought our own snorkels and masks which we've owned for years. We really enjoyed the food, drinks, swimming, tubing, snorkeling, etc. It was SO fun, and really quite peaceful and quiet walking through the paths. We purchased our tickets from a vendor on the streets of PdC, and they arranged with their hotel/resort to send a limo/van to pick us up. It was about $10 for the limo, and probably around $60 per person otherwise for the tickets. They do take your sunblock at the front gate, though, in exchange for environmentally safe sunblock. Yours is returned at the end of the day. One thing that I liked on the resort was a child area where you could pick out ceramic statues and paint them. At first I thought $10 was pricey for a little ceramic statue, but actually it's one of my favorite souvenirs. My son chose a dolphin, painted it blue, and we left it for 24 hours. I thought it was just to dry. The staff there actually hand paints accents onto your piece, giving it some beautiful details, and puts some shellac on it so it stays pretty. It's just for decoration, not for using with food. We wrote on the back my son's name and the date, and Cancun, and it's one of the best souvenirs I've ever gotten. I really can't complain too much about the resort. I'm sure it's pricey. We were prepared for that and the convenience was worth it. We were lazy and had a tough year so we really didn't go off site much but those 2 days, and it was fine. It is just wonderful to be in a beautiful place, relaxing, enjoying the great weather. I took a yoga class one morning and it was really good, quite challenging. We had a little bit of trouble with our room keys, but service was helpful. Check in was a bit long, but OK otherwise. Had we not been guests of owners, I bet it would have been not as smooth, however. One restaurant by the water was nice, but got quite loud later in the evening. We were not close by so we weren't kept awake by it, but with a sleepy toddler leaving the restaurant it was a little unsettling. The chairs were a bit loose and I wound up cutting my hand when scooting my chair in, and had to go wash it and put a compress on it. The staff was very helpful although I am sure there were other chairs that had this gap in the legs which could have caused more pinched/cut hands when you're trying to scoot yourself in. My family was upset but I was just intent on having a good evening and really didn't care too much. My family kept saying that this resort really didn't offer much for younger children, and honestly, I didn't really notice. My son thoroughly enjoyed himself due to the shallow children's pools, he felt so free and independent, even with us right there with him. It was wonderful. He also loved his \"pirate ship\" -- the swing set/play gym on the beach. I don't think we'll go back, but only because my family that owns thought it was less than the resorts in Nuevo Vallarta and Acapulco. We are going to the Grand Mayan in Nuevo Vallarta this year.

We had a master suite, plus a studio. Our place was so nice, spacious, great kitchen, with everything we needed. Three flat screen TV'S, two bathrooms, beautiful towels and sheets, it was meticulously clean, 3 individual balconies - yes, they were small, but I put two chairs out there, and totally enjoyed my private balcony, backed onto the jungle. I honestly NEVER saw one mosquito - not one insect. The grounds were so well manicured, so beautiful. Staff always very friendly. Even the birds continually wolf whistled at me .. what a great sound first thing in the morning!! Anytime. Never waited any longer than 5 mins at the most for a shuttle. Often prefered to walk part ways home behind the building, adjacent to the jungle. The sights and smells on that walk were intoxicating, especially at night. Wish I could have bottled that smell and brought it home. They sprayed every night at 11 p.m. so you wouldn't want to be taking a backyard walk then. The pool was amazing, miles of it - we probably never saw half of it. It was heated, and I loved to go for a long swim every night until 10 p.m. If you get a massage, you have free access to the most beautiful spa.. which costs about $20/day to access. Massages are cheaper on the beach, but mine would be at the Spa. I so much enjoyed the steam room, and the hydrotherapy jaquzzies, the Swiss shower, and all the exotic smells of lotions, sprays, etc that were all available for our use, We made breakfast in our suite, packed lunch and of course brought canned pop/beer, & zip lock bags of rum. The many bars were all too happy to give us glassess with ice. We went to Playa del Carmen, intending to take the ferry to Cozumel, which we didn't because it was so windy. We went to Mega Mart and got groceries. In hindsight, when brousing at the convenience store at the Palace, I wouldn't spend my time or energy at Mega or Walmart. Groceries were comparable enough in price, so to use that time soaking in the sun at one of the most beautiful places I have ever been makes a lot more sense. I thought the price of meals were high, but considering how much I pay for a 5* inclusive, it was okay. The beach was gorgeous with more than enough loungers, palapas, etc. The beach edge was stony, and continued a few feet out. Many went past the rocky area and enjoyed swimming in the sea. I went to a timeshare presentation, and yes, it took a lot longer than 3 hours. I have figured it out - don't ask ANY questions (You guessed it - I did). I got two passes to Chichen Itza, and a free buffet. The buffets are fabulous!!. The passes were worth $99 U.S. each so to me the time spent there was worth it. Re Chichen Itza, we had a gorgeous Mayan guide, Rex with a degree in Mayan history who helped make the trip double interesting. The HIGHLIGHT was swimming in the cenote, one of the most beautiful, exquisite places I have ever seen. Don't miss out - do it. Chichen Itza was a long drive (in a luxury bus with breakfast and all you could drink) however I would suggest to find a cenote swim closer, with less travelling time. I then went on to a 5* All inclusive a short distance from the Mayan Palace. The food at both places was totally excellent, both beaches were rocky, both grounds absolutely beautiful, the pool at the Mayan Palace was the best. The best value for my dollar was the Mayan Palace, hands down.

It has the largest pool in all of Latin America - more than 8,000 square meters of surface on 3 levels, which are connected by waterfalls guests can hop over. The heated pool is nothing short of magnificent; it has islands, built in semi-submerged loungers, multiple fountains and bridges, a volley ball net and a swim up bar. BEACH: The beach is extensive; well maintained powder white fine sand, sprinkled with palm trees and supplied with ample loungers and palupas. Staff come to serve you as you relax on the beach or at the poolside. ROOMS: We had two adjoining lock-out rooms, which had a kitchen/living room between them. Each room has a balcony and the square footage was very generous. The d\u00e9cor was beautiful; with plenty of marble in the rooms and the kitchen had lots of dishes and pots/pans, two burners, a sink, toaster, coffeemaker microwave and a blender. LANDSCAPING: The landscaping is amazing!!! Staff are in constant attendance of the acres upon acres of perfectly manicured jungle, which is complemented by conservatory. It is a virtual Mecca of wildlife & nature. You will see native plants, birds and lizards galore! There are three crocodile lagoons/pens - these are contained of course. There is a huge island where they keep a large flamingo population. The paths are all well maintained and constantly washed and swept to keep them to the high standards of the entire establishment. MAIDS: Pampering is the standard here. Maid service is twice daily; the day maids do an amazing job of cleaning washing the floors daily, changing towels & cleaning everything meticulously. The evening maids do sheet turn down and replace towels as needed. FOOD: There are 14 restaurants on the property, so you can choose from casual to elegant or visit the buffet with live entertainment: the food is fantastic where ever you go! Prices are a bit steep in the more exclusive restaurants on sight, but are still worth a visit for a special dinner. RESORT SIZE: The massive size of this resort is both a plus and a down side, depending on your taste. Our building was located close to the middle and we could walk just about anywhere in about 10 minutes - except the front gate, which was 15 minutes. If you prefer, you may wait for the shuttles, which ran every 10 minutes and went to all of the resort. The food was so good we felt the stroll through the breathtaking jungle was best. for us We are in our mid 40's and fit but not athletic; our children are active but only 9 & 12 & they managed all the walking well unless it was past the youngest's bed time, in which case we opted for the shuttle. HANDICAP ACCESS: There is wheelchairs/scooters/strollers access throughout the resort; there are handicapped washroom stalls in all restrooms as well. All of the pathways through the jungle were ideal for scooters; the tallest building was 3 floors and all had elevators. STAFF: There was literally a small army of staff employed at the resort and they were so hard working, friendly and definitely there to make your stay everything you hoped for! The English skills of staff who interacted with guests were at least adequate, with more fluent staff always available. Maintenance, landscaping, kitchen and housekeeping staff had very limited English but were quick to find you a translator if you required it. WIRELESS INTERNET: The wireless internet was reliable but there was a charge for it, which I felt was gouging. I complained to the manager about it, stating other resorts do not customarily charge guests who bring their own laptop for this service. Another guest told me they had complained about this & had been told the fee would be reversed upon checkout, so I told the manager I knew others had the fee waived and requested the same. She agreed & I wracked up quite a bill, as they charge by the hour, but they honoured their promise & reversed the charge when I checked out. I can\u2019t guarantee it will work for you but I would recommend you do not take no for an answer on this\u2026..and get it in writing like I did. AMMENITIES: There is a large store in the resort with groceries, pharmacy items, toiletries, jewellery, clothing etc. There is a spa, a gym and activities galore and daily high calibre entertainment. You could easily spend two weeks here & not get bored. A select few local crafts people are rotated through the resort but they do not \u201cchase you\u201d; you must approach their displays if you are interested.

I was told that it is the largest pool in South America and it is truly beautiful and well maintained. The food at the resort was just OKAY...I can't remember anything spectacular I ate. There is really no where else close to eat besides a little shack 10 min down the beach. Do NOT drink the water or the economy anyway. I took a sip by accident and let\u2019s just say I had a rough night. The beach right behind the resort was nice and clean but as we walked further down the beach it started to get very rocky so bring water shoes! I did not like that you had to charge everything to the room and pay once you checkout. I would have rather paid cash or by card. The staff seemed very pleasant but there were so many of them and they really don't have time to chit chat...they just smile and keep on cleaning or working. Taxis in Mexico are very expensive. We got hip and rented a car to go into town (Playa del Carmen and Cancun). The bottom line: I recommend this resort to people who don\u2019t like to do a lot of outside resort activities as it is rather far from nightlife and restaurants in Cancun. I do not recommend this resort for people seeking a delightful honeymoon or romance nor do I recommend this resort to elderly or disabled people. While you are here check out Tulum and Xel-ha! I'm glad I did while I had a chance because I will not be returning to Mexico anytime soon as I perfer the Carribean.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201c5 bucks a beer?

Friends 'traded in' to this resort, which is how we ended up here. Any other time I've been to the Mayan Riviera we stayed at Bahia Principe, which outdoes this place hands down and may have spoiled us for amenities and services. However, all is not bad. Had no trouble at check-in or check-out. Forget about getting a room close to the beach; you'll get what they give you, period. It's clean. We had a suite with a 'kitchen'; bar fridge, sink, microwave, cupboards full of glasses/dishes and a two-burner hot plate. The kitchen was relatively well stocked with what we needed; toaster, coffee maker, plates, utensils, etc. The maid does not clean your dishes or your hot plate, and they don't supply scrubbing utensils so don't let anything sit that got baked on; soak it right away to be able to get it off easily. The beds are surprisingly comfortable. Different range of pillow firmness, which was really nice. The balcony is a bit of a joke; it's not deep enough to sit on in a chair, which is a tad frustrating but must be why there are no patio chairs. There are no screens on the patio doors to the balcony. So either you deal with A/C or you risk insect bites. Screens would be nice and I bet would cut down hugely on the hotel's energy costs. Forget an ocean view; there isn't one. Either look over the resort or over the adjoining jungle/next hotel development. The suite was huge. Furniture comfy. Nice ceiling fans. Bathrooms well-equipped with the WC behind a closed door, which is definitely a plus for anyone sharing a bathroom with someone who is suffering from \"travellers' trouble\", though it would be nice if it were equipped with an exhaust fan! Abundant hot water; only had tepid water once the whole week. The row of buildings is a pain in the neck, but if you've got a rental car having a far-away building puts you closer to the parking, so that's a nice trade-off. The pool is phenomenal. Massive, warm, interesting. Lots of chairs and cabanas. We rented one with a bed and spent our entire day on lounge chairs outside/surrounding it. Though it would be great for a family with kids or oldsters that want to stay out of the sun. Burgers are yummy, guac + chips quite good. The beach area is very pretty, sand is nice, lots of chairs, pretty good drink service. Can't walk into the water, though; too rocky. Hubby tried to snorkel and was unsuccessful; everything's too churned up to be able to see much. Drinks at pool and beach are expensive. Bring your own cooler, be discreet, save yourself a fortune. Happy hour and drink of the day are 2 for one, so you pay 10 bucks for two drinks rather than one. :-s Same price for beer, as far as we could tell. Too bad; we would have spent more time there if the drinks weren't so expensive. We packed up and went to Puerto Morelos instead. :-) DO NOT GO DIVING with their on-site dive company. These people guarantee they don't cancel dives; they make you wait an hour and a half in the morning sun before letting you know there's \"no dive today\". Their dive sites suck; there's pretty bland coral and nothing much else to see. They promise lunch on a 2-tank dive and don't deliver it, they should stop for a decompression stop on the 2nd dive and don't. I repeat: they should stop for a decompression stop on the 2nd dive and don't. And their equipment is kept in very sketchy condition; check it very carefully if you're going to risk your neck and go out with them anyway. Instead, drive 10 minutes into Puerto Morelos and dive there, safely and enjoyably. We refused to attend the time share presentation and enjoyed our stay. Others weren't as lucky. I guess it's all in how you value your time; there's NO WAY you would find us cooped up inside listening to a sales pitch on a holiday. Others think they get value out of being handed passes to attractions. Whatever floats your boat. Minimum time reported we heard was 4 hours. The grounds are nicely kept. The buildings are in relatively good repair. The golf cart trolleys are pretty regular. The gift shop was pretty well-equipped and I bought a nice beach cover-up for my daughter there at a pretty good price. Bring our own: cream/sugar for coffee, condiments, SOS pads. I always buy a stick of laundry soap but be prepared you may not dry clothing on the balcony. If you try to, they will move your laundry. Shop at MegaMart in Playa; it's got everything you need and the bakery is awesome! Room service is quite good, but expensive. $18.00 for a bowl of chicken broth and a creme caramel-type dessert. However, it came with a basket of rolls and both were really tasty; the broth had fresh veggies that were still firm in it and good-sized chunks of chicken. Caesar salad had too much dressing but the cheese was fresh and it was a good portion size. There is no night life to speak of, but that wasn't really much of a hardship for us. We were looking for a place to have a couple of drinks later on one evening and couldn't find one; there ought to be at least one bar in the joint open until 1:00 or 2:00, don'tcha think? So we just went back to our room and chatted. We never heard our neighbours at all. This place is great for families with kids (it looked like the kids' programs were pretty good) and for the grandparent-age set. The whole place is very wheelchair-friendly. Little wagons with items for sale by the pool were cute and will satisfy your souvenir needs if you're not a hard-core shopper. All in all, it's not a bad place.

Once you get to the beach or the pool, we tended to stay there for the day. Therefore, I think it really doesn't matter which building your in because you really don't go back to your room all day. That said, it kind of puts you at the mrecy of the bartenders and restaurants. Happy hour is 11:00am to 1:00, all drinks anywhere on the property are 2 for 1. There are also drink specials that run all day. All the restuarants are good but pricey. It takes a good bit of planning to avoid this trap. We cooked breakfast everyday and a few dinners, pasta mostly The property has lovely walkways that are great for morning walks. It's a huge place. The staff are wonderful but try to avoid the timeshare people. They pose as concierge when you first check in, wanting to help you get familiar with the resort. We didn't go for the tour but people told us that it's at least 3 hours and it's very hard sell . I don't recommend the dive shop at the resort. My husband and I disagree on this, but an outside dive company, probably out of playa, would be worth the extra time and energy. I really recommend the travel agency at the resort lobby. the alltournative company was very good. We took the COBA jungle adventure which was great. Terrific guide and well worth the money. We rented a car but didn't really use it. My husband got nervious about possibly being stopped by the police, which people said happens all the time, regardless of your driving. Instead we took cabs to Playa, $20. one way. You have to go there at least once, to see the street scene on fifth ave.

We also stayed there for 2 weeks last year and bought 60 weeks through HSI, so we expect to be going back every January for at least two weeks. Mayan Palace is a great DESTINATION IN AND OF ITSELF. My wife and I fell into the schedule of walking to the concierge desk every morning to get a free Miami Herald, returning to our room for breakfast, then going to the pool, and finally going to Playa del Carmen for supper. It was a very relaxing schedule and we felt no need to go anywhere else. If I wanted more exercise, I would walk left (north) on the beach until it ended in about 25 minutes. My wife and I were able to read books we had always wanted to read and floated in the current in the warm upper pool (the warm pool made a difference when it was cold- below 80 F!). We could always find a chair in the shade. The Palace has an excellent ACTIVITIES PROGRAM. My wife did water aerobics every day, we had fun watching children swinging at a pi\u00f1ata, and we tried some Three Kings cake (free as part of the celebration). They also offer free drinks at 1 PM as part of a tasting. DISTANCES: We stayed in building 19 which at first seemed far away. It wasn\u2019t. We never managed to walk to the lobby through the beautifully landscaped \u201cjungle\u201d grounds (while looking a the plants and animals) without getting picked up by a shuttle well before we got there. Any shuttle runs the length of the resort, so once you were on one you could quickly get to the pool or your room without changing your seat. We found it a pleasant, interesting, 10 minute walk to the pool if we wanted to walk. (We were then in January. If it is hot, you can always take the shuttle.) RESTAURANTS: The dining options at the resort are much more expensive than Playa, and the Mexican food is more Americanized at the resort. If we ate lunch, we tended to eat at Brio (the healthy option on a second floor porch behind the fitness center). While we were there they opened a creperie in the grocery store near the pool, which we tried once and will try again next year. RENTING A CAR: We rented a car from Hertz in Playa. It was half the price of renting at the airport. I had no problems driving, but I tend to obey the speed limit and mostly stay in the right hand lane. You also need to be tolerant of the different Mexican driving habits and beware of the speed bumps (the worst one is at the entrance to the resort). Hertz did a few strange things like telling me they had no cars to fill my reservation and delivering a key to the resort and not telling me about it (when found out about that when we tried to turn the car in). Nothing that couldn\u2019t be resolved by a little humor, patience, and asking to talk to a higher level manager. Each year we debate about renting a car, for it costs $17 a day. It looks like you can take the shuttle from the resort for $7 per person. The return trip is a little early for our taste, so we would probably try the vans that leave from calle 2 between avenues 10 and 15. Some day we will get bored and go to Tulum and snorkel off Puerto Morales.

Our first trip was just perfect. I read all the Trip Advisor reviews and thought the negative reviews resulted from bad time share experience. After enjoying the Mayan Palace ourselves I just cannot see how anyone would think their experience there is terrible unless they had an axe to grind because of time share pressures. The time share presentation is done by a separate company. Every contact we had with the resort's representaives was pleasant and prompt. The check-in was siimple and the check out was easy with no issues. We had the front desk print up our bill periodically during the week to see how things stood and it was always accurate. The concierge was invariably helpful. There is foreign exchane in the lobby area with no commission. The exchange rate increased in favor of the dollar up to 13.5 pesos per dollar while we were there. We even enjoyed the time share presentation and got some good consideration for our 3 and half hours, an hour and a half of which was preliminaries and buffet. We loved the free buffet breakfast at the Del Lago restaurant. We were taken on a tour of a new Grupo Mayan section of the resort called Bliss. It was beautifully appointed but we were not tempted to spend the money to upgrade. We politely and firmly declined to buy and we were given the promised gifts. There was no high pressure. The ocean is beautiful and interesting. I enjoyed the rocky tide pools. Wading out into a sandy ocean bottom would have been pleasant too but I liked the interest of the rocks better. The sand is clean and white. I walked out in the ocean with water sandals and enjoyed the waves . There were a lot of folks playing out in the sea, many older folks snorkeling about 35 yards off shore who carefully picked their way on the rocky shelf close to the shore. I found the sea there more interesting than in Playa del Carmen with wall-to-brown bodies obsuring the white sand. There was parasailing boat out there as well which I had an itch to try. They take you out to the boat in jet skis and let you sail out of the boat and reel you in again at the end of the ride out in the ocean. Building 8 was perfect: next to the lobby, close to the shuttle, close to the tennis courts and close to the cabs. It was about a five minute walk to the internet store and convenience store and the pool just beyond. Shuttles to Playa were very convenient. They drop you off at the Wal-Mart where we shopped for food and ate in the apartment a couple of nights and most breakfasts. LIked the convenience of charging everything to our room, no hitches there. Liked the easy towel exchange. We took towels on two excursions and changed them out continuously. Wonderful excursions booked through the travel agency in the lobby area. Chicen Itza tour was perfect. We stopped and swam in a large cenote on the way. Water was great. There are roots from the surface above hanging down nearly a 100 feet seeking water. The guide, Rex, had a degree in archealogy and very charming. Isla Mujers excursion was not as nice. The island was not as cool as I thought it would be. Older town and a little run down. But we had fun on the golf carts and saw some grand views of the ocean at the south tip of the island. Skip the snorkeling in Isla Mujeres. Not much to see for the trouble. We did see a big barricuda. The snorkel trip at Puerto Morelos was fantastic. That is the best snorkel scenery around. I have seen Cozumel, Fiji, Hawaii. This beats them all for variety of coral formation and variety of fish and clear water. Manta rays, turtles, sand sharks and every variety of colorful fish are found about 200 yards off shore. The best excursion was the Altournative Zipline and Cenote snorkel tour. Snorkeling in cenotes is as much fun as you can have. The zip lines were good but I have seen better. They had an interesting Mayan Shaman speaking Mayan words and lighting incense in one of the caves that covered a cenote. All these tours were arranged by Mayan Palace. We never saw a sour face at the Mayan Palace. Good service in all things. There was only the hint of a smell when we first entered our apartment, nothing we ever noticed again. The unit was very commodious. We had no trouble cooking but the area was a little small. The maid does not do the dishes. Trash receptacle a small. We loved the landscaping as well. The crocodile hole was cool and the Flamingos marvelous. Even saw hiding in the landscaping bushes an interesting rodent about the size of a cat with legs like a cat and head like a rabbit, dark fur . I think they called it a Serete. Our good friends came with and loved it just as well. Mayan Palace is a great place to chill or to be active. Good place to take kids but we are in our mid 50's and were never pestered by children. There are so many fun outdoors activities. At first I thought I would take turns visiting all the Mayan Palaces in Mexico but now I just want to go back to the Mayan Riviera.

The lobby is between Bldgs 9 & 10. We were in Bldg 11. It was a pleasant 7 minute walk to the pool. There were regular shuttles from to the pool/beach for anyone who needed them. Bldg 21 is farthest away. Press to stay in Bldgs 1-12. We had a beautiful 3rd floor room with a balcony. Golfers should stay in Bldgs furthers away since they border the Jack Nicklaus golf course.

Other reports complained about mosquitos - there were none when we stayed and we saw evidence of a mosquito abatement program in effect (some regular spaying). The staff were all very attentive to the guests. The beach is great but the shoreline is not suitable for much swimming due to the coral at the water's edge.

The surroundings are beautiful, because the amount of people taking care of the plants and amenities is just unreal. We rented a car from American Car Rental, also known as Continental, or Caribean, and we had a great experience. It is one of the companies that offer full coverage insurance with 0% deductable. For 4 days, we paid $165 for a small size car. Which was great, we think. I know that you can rent a car for $10 /day, but the insurance factor was important for us. There is an Avis office on site of the hotel, but they wanted to charge $60/day not including insurance. Absolutely redicilous. So I think we got a great deal. We had no problems on the roads, with police. During picking up, we did check thoroughly the car, for any nicks and scretches. And we marked everything.

We spent a week and totally enjoyed everything about the resort!!! Our group included my family (myself and husband and two college-age daughters) and our friends (a couple with two college-age sons). We had the master suite with two bedrooms and living room/kitchen. Yes, the beds were hard and I had read the suggestion of asking for eggcrates but they weren't that bad and nothing you couldn't adjust to. We were asked about the \"breakfast\" presentation (timeshare presentation) upon arrival but said we really didn't want to make any plans at that point and we were never asked again or pressured to attend. I had read that it turned into a 4 hour presentation and was high-pressure so we had already decided to decline on attending. Prior to our visit I emailed the conceirge requesting a non-smoking room in building 1-5. She told me they would try and honor my request. We did have a room on the first floor in building 7 which was non-smoking. The walk to the pool was very nice--not too far--just a few minutes along a shaded path. In my opinion building 1-8 would be fine if you will be going to the pool or restaurants. We never took the trams on the grounds so I am not sure about the convenience of those. Happy hour at the pool is 11-1 and plenty of fun!!! Several days we booked palapas which cost appx. $30 and if you spend $30 with the pool waiters on food or drink you can have the $30 removed from your bill upon checkout (just keep track of the dates so you can have the adjustment made). This was not hard to do--a few drinks and maybe a snack or lunch covers it. There are plenty of activities going on around the pool and on the beach to keep everyone busy or just spend the day laying by the pool enjoying the great weather! The beach was very nice...large area with alot of seating. Like other reviews had said the water area is very rocky. When heading towards the water go left and take a 10 minute walk down the beach to another resort area where you will find a roped off sandy area to play in the water. There are chairs there but they are for theresort guests only so we just left our stuff on the beach and it was fine. (We did encounter some topless sunbathers there--which is not allowed at the Mayan Palace) The staff at the Mayan Palace were all wonderful. We never had any language barriers and they were all very accomodating. We ordered pizzas from room service serveral times and it was very good. We ate at all the restaurants except for the one by the golf course. Everything we had was very good and priced as expected. Overall I would definately recommend this resort to anyone....the negative reviews should be ignored--we did not experience anything I had read in them. Expect a great vacation at a great location!! The security on the grounds was also very good...guards at the gates and we would see security staff everyday walking through. Very safe atmosphere! We also went to the Mexican buffet & show at DelLargo on Thursday night. Great time and good food!!! Price includes the show, buffet and unlimited drinks! When travelling to Playa de Carmen or Cancun it worked better for us to hire a taxi for our group of 8. We just went out front by the lobby where the taxis line up and made arrangements with the drivers directly. We set up several trips the day before and they arrived as planned. For our trip back to the airport our driver only charged us $65 for our group which was a better deal than the $15/per person the resort charged. I have our favorite taxi drivers cell number so if you are looking for a reliable driver (speaks good english and drives safely) contact me and I will send his name and number to you. After experiencing the travel in Mexico I would probably not ever rent a car...better to let someone else do the driving that is familar with the laws and road signs, etc. We had a wonderful experience here and look forward to returning!!", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cIt was just, nice\u201d", "Author": "dlkeiler", "ReviewID": "UR23674641", "Content": "Arrived on the 9th of Jan. to a very large resort. We were originally put in a room in the very last building-21 with a view of the road and a small parking lot. We asked to switch and talked to a very helpful -Pamela- and were moved to building 10- great place to be- right in the middle of everything. Had to take a tram everywhere on the grounds. The pool was beautiful and very large with 2 swim up bars. The beach was rocky and not great for walking. No where to walk to. Alot of palapas to choose from at the pool and the beach. They said the resort was full but we found that there were not alot of people there. The Havana Moon restuarant was never full and you could always get a table. The food was good, a bit overpriced. The buffet at \"Del Lago\" was very nice and an ok selection of food $21.00 for breakfast buffet. We didnt find the activities that great- but then we tried to do things outside of the resort. Cancun was an hour away and for 5 people was a $45.00 cab ride each way. Playa Del Carmen was 30 minutes away and $20.00 cab ride each way. I would highly recommend taking the city bus for $1.50 pp. Playa was alot of fun, alot of shopping and plenty of bars and restuarants. The weather for 4 of the 7 days was very cloudy, cool and light rain. But you have to go with the flow and we did meet some very nice people. I would not recommend this resort if you have 15-21 year olds, not alot for them to do if the weather is bad. You have to go to Playa or Cancun for night life. The room was very nice- we had 5 adults and a 2 room suite, plenty of room for all of us. We will go back to Cancun and we did enjoy Playa, maybe next time we will get to Cozumel, the ferry is a large yacht and only a 20 minute ride-", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crownsville, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort with Something for Everyone\u201d", "Author": "pweath", "ReviewID": "UR23671444", "Content": "I read over 50 reviews on this resort before booking and I was not led astray. Let me start by saying I am an avid traveler and have traveled to every state in the US, caribbean countries and Europe. This resort ranks in the top three of my travels. If you like cruising, like me, you will love this resort. It has everything a ship has, it just does not move. The resort itself consists of 2 main areas. One is the Mayan Palace where we stayed an the other is the Grand Mayan. The Grand Mayan is more exclusive. Both places are timeshare driven. We traded in through RCI. We did not sit for the presentation. People who went were very upset and said it went on for hours with high pressure. The 10% off of your bills does not cover everything. I stood beside a Man who was furious upon learning this when he was checking out. This is an incentive for sitting through the sales pitch. Enough about that. The buildings are large and the units are giant. I have stayed at 5 star hotels and these were as nice. Floors are marble, granite countertops, sliding glass doors onto balconies that have various views. Unfortunately, there are no chairs on the balconies and they are a bit small to put one out. What a waste.The unit had big bathrooms, great towels and linens. The downside were the beds that were very firm. If you do not like a firm mattress, ask for a foam bed topper. They will put them on your bed. Unfortunately there is not an easy solution to rock hard pillows We ended up using pillows off of the sofa. By the third day, two of us were sleeping on the sofas. My girlfriend and I took our grown daughters for the week. We had a one bedrrom king suite with bath & kitchenette and a connecting hotel unit with two queen beds and a bath. I read the suggestion to get building 1 through 7 but I have to tell you, we got building 11 and it was perfect and I will tell you why. The building was right next to the main building where we registered. The morning newspapers, concierge, currency converter, excursion desk, car rental and tram & shutte pick-up were there. All of the trams start from this building and the wait is never more than a couple of minutes. The trams take you around the resort. You are minutes away from the pool and restaurants It rained most of our week and we totally depended on the trams, and they were wonderful. All of the restaurants are at the pool area There is a two story building by the pool that houses a deli, grocery ,shopping area, cybercafe and an Asian and Italian restaurant. To the left of the pool all the way to the beach is the Havana Moon restaurant, the spa and the fitness room along with Brio a health food lunch place. On your way to the beach you will pass Balchi, a mexican restaurant that was simply our favorite. The resort has a daily activity schedule including movies for children. There is a buffet and show every night .The food costs money but the shows are free except for the Thursday night Mexican Fiesta. Make reservations early. As the sun goes down, make sure your doors are closed. We had no problem with bugs except for the night I stayed back to relax and read. It was raining and I left the doors open. As the sun set, the bugs were attracted to the lights in our livingroom. When my daughter returned, she saw that the ceiling had filled with mosquitos. I called the front desk and they were there immediately to irradicate the problem. There are shuttles to Playa that cost $3.50 per person. A cab will cost $20 to go to Playa but we had 4 people so sometimes when the schedule did not fit our needs we grabbed a cab. It is a 20+ minute ride to Playa. We took other travelers suggestions and left the stanard $3pp tip daily for the maid on the pillows. We were given a complete set of bath items each day and a beautiful flower arrangement on our last day. We went to Tulum and Coba to see the ruins because the excursion to Chicken Itzu is 11 hours long. We just did not want to spend 3 hours to and back from the area on a bus.We swam with the dolphins. The excursion desk actually has three different companies. We went with Aventuras for $99 a piece and it was a great day. Family members can ride along for $5 and watch.You can do everything at this one and save $25 to $50 dollars. You can actually book excursions cheaper at travel agencies in Playa on 5th avanue, saving you quite a bit of money. 5th Avenue is the shopping district in Playa. There are no bargains there unless you want a massage. They offer a 1 hour massage for $33 dollars that is amazing. Money well spent. For souveniers you will do better down by the beach or in Tulum. Also, the shuttle drops you and picks you up at the Walmart in Playa. The city does not boost confidence when you are walking 7 blocks to the shopping district but we were told that the town is very safe. Just don't walk down 4th. Lost of drunks. We were told by the locals to NOT use the ATMs on 5th avenue. Some stole your account number and emptied your account at home.You can get money at the resort either by ATM or front desk, so protect yourself. All shops take american money as well as pesos. I think I have imparted all I wanted to. One more thing, do not drag your computer like I did. There is no wifi in the units and the price is $7.00 an hour at the cybercafe whether you use there computer or your own. I would go back in a heart beat, even with the pillow problems.

We booked through ebay from a family that has a timeshare. We were a group of 8 (2 families, 4 kids and 4 adults) and had a 2-bedroom suite in bldg 6, on the second (total 3 floors) floor. This bldg is close to the lobby and 3 min walk to pool and beach. You walk along a beautiful curved path surrounded by lush greens. It is possible that it will be a much longer walk if you stayed in say bldg 20 but they do have shuttles that run every 10 min. The rooms were spacious, clean and well manitained. The kitchen was fully loaded including a blender. We had absolutely no problem with housekeeping. The best part of the resort is the pool or should we say pools, since 4 or 5 large pools are interconnected that the kids never get bored. Of course, you can waddle to the pool bar for a fresh coco frio! One thing worth mentioning is that although the resort is on the beach, there are no oceanfront view rooms - all the rooms face the tropical jungle which is actually quite nice (we went expecting oceanfront view). The beach itself is average (compared to other beaches in Riviera Maya area) and they have limited water sports available for extra cost. The best place is to relax is the palapas by the pool - complete with a full size bed and linens! These need to be booked in the morning (first come first served and they get booked quickly, so be there at 7:30) for $30 but this is credited towards poolside drinks and food so it is in effect FREE! You can also use the spa for $15/person/day charge. We found it well worth the price. The fitness center is also decent and is free. We did not eat much on site (we used the kitchen and ate wherever we went) but we heard the food was good albeit pricey. A trip to Walmart in Playa Del Carmen is worth at least to stock up on water, milk, bread etc. If you dont rent a car, you can take a shared taxi (a minivan run by the company called Conectiv) that stops right at the entrance to the property, for just $3 per person. Also, the 5th avenue at Playa Del Carmen is a cool place to hang out or take a a stroll during the evening/night hours. The convenience store on site is not too shabby either. We made trips to Tulum and Xel-Ha. Tulum beach is a must-see while Xel-Ha is over-rated. It is worth taking a crash course in Spanish as very few speak Anglais. People are very friendly though. Another thing to be prepared for is traffic - there is an incredible number of cops looking for drug smugglers that traffic often snarls, especially late evening, so watch out and plan accordingly. If your cell phone does not work there, consider getting a calling card as soon as you get there.

There is shopping on 5th Ave. Taxi fro the airport was expensive $80 as only one company can pick up at the airport. Try to get the resort shuttle. Taxi back to the airport was $30 or $15 per person on the shuttle. We took the time share presentating and they were very pushy. Rushed us through the free breakfast, had a very short tour, then the hard sales pitch. They were not happy when we quickly said NO!. They did give us 10% off our bill, reduced rates for any tours that we wanted to atke, 1,000pp in spending credits and a bottle of taquila.

We had never visited the resort and actually found it on the advice of a friend who had stayed at other Mayan Group resorts. What a find! This was the PERFECT vacation for us. We booked a two-bedroom suite (master bedroom, large and comfy living/eating area, adjoining one bedroom with two double beds) and were placed in building 6 -which gave us very easy access to everything (pool,. beach, spa, restaurants, deli/grocery, shuttle to go off-site). We were able to fill our fridge with grocery items purchased at the on-site grocery/deli and cooked breakfast every morning in the room. Lunch was at the pool; we used the resort restaurants and room service for dinners, except when we were off-site. There was so much to do - so much that we finally decided that it was okay if we didn't see it all. (Seriously, it occured to us that it would be easy to go home exhausted if we did not consciously decide to have some laid back days by the pool or on the beach....attended to by the most pleasant wait staff one could hope for!!! ) For a family with teens, Mayan Palace offered all the right things. On site, we were able to go parasailing, jet-skiing and snorkeling. There is a registration booth on the beach, but the guys running these activities walk around the pool area advertsing the services, too. (No hard sell and everything is charged to your room. No cash exchanges hands during your stay.) We did all three. Snorkleing was the family favorite, although it took up the better part of the afternoon. Also, the bed of the ocean is very, VERY rocky at the resort and getting to the boats and ski jets required some careful maneuvering. The snokeling trip featured a side trip to a beach that had an ocean bed of sand and that was a nice hour. Also, beaches on either side the Mayan Palace provided much better ocean beds and these were within easy walkig distance. The Mayan Palace beach itself was very sandy up to the water's edge and there are plenty of chaise lounges, hammocks, chairs, plam trees and thatched canopies available if you want to be by the water. The pool was unbelievable. I can't describe it - except to say that it was enormous, beautifully appointed, and staffed with exceptional wait staff who made sure you had anything you needed. This was no ordinary pool but you'll have to click on pictures of it on the resort's web site to get a clear idea of what it looks like. (Note: Service could be slow by the pool and our wait staff noted the difference between a \"Mexican Minute\" and an \"American Minute\". Be patient. The snacks, drinks and luncheons you can order pool side are pretty tasty. Nothing gourmet, but good. The Margarita and Chcken bbq pizzas were popular with us, as were the cheese burgers. Great snacking food, too.) There is plenty to do off-site, too. The ruins of Tulum are nearby and Chichen Itzu is about a two-hour drive. Both can be arranged by the travel service in the front lobby. (We had planned to visit Tulum but ran out of time.) Other off site things we saw included: - Playa del Carmen (take one of the cabs just waiting for you outside the resort lobby; it's $18 one way for the whole family and gives you a lot more flexibility than the resort's shuttle). Playa del Carmen features an outdoor shopping area that goes on for blocks and blocks. Worth experiencing. Colorful local life. Along with a variety of shops, we found several nice restaurants and lots of local culture. - Excaret, a natural water park and nature preserve. We made the arrangements through the travel service at the resort. The trip price ($115 per person) included transportation, coupons for food and drinks, and a two-hour show that begins at 6:00. Don't miss the show....It gives you great appreciation for Mayan history and Mexican culture and pride. We loved it. Finally, the resort hires the most friendly people on earth. Every staff member we encountered was genuinely helpful and nice. This resort knows how to please its guests and there is no question we will return next year. We loved it. We had sunny days, 85 degree temps and slight breezes the entire time we were there. Oh -and pack lightly.

It was my first time using my timeshare, and I really bought it more to force myself to travel the world (by trading) than to actually visit Mexico -- I didn't think I would enjoy the resort experience that much. I had always wanted to see the Mayan ruins though, so decided to give this location a try. Having read lots of the reviews on this site, I was of course slightly trepidacious, although most of the bad ones seem to be written by people who just don't know how to 'go with the flow', so I tried not to take them too much to heart and went with an optimistic attitude. Also, I was travelling by myself and hadn't done that since my early twenties (and then I was at least going to a country where I spoke the language), so that was a bit nervewracking too. But I took a Spanish phrase book along and decided that I'd approach the whole thing like a bit of an experiment and even maybe write an article about what it was like. Anyway, I was way too busy having fun to take the time to write any sort of journal while I was there! The reviews, if you read enough of them, give a pretty good picture of what to expect -- I was not at all disappointed and, if anything, I was very pleasantly surprised. (Mind you, I did take my own twin bed size eggcrate which I was able to shrink down to the size of a small binder by putting it into one of those Space Bags and vacuuming all the air out -- I brought only carry on luggage for two weeks by using those things. I had planned to leave the eggcrate behind -- it only cost $12 -- but found that I was able to compress it enough to bring it home even without using a vacuum.) The grounds and pools at Mayan Palace are beautiful, the shuttles came very frequently and only once did I encounter one that was full, there were lots of fun activities to take part in, and getting out and about by public transit was dirt easy. I spent my first week in building 3, quite close to the pools, but got moved to building 11 the second week in order to be on the top floor (I'm a really light sleeper) and actually found that I preferred it. It was right across from the lobby, which has a stop for all the shuttles, so it was really convenient -- and the view of the sun setting over the golf course was really very nice. Being higher up like that I felt that there was a lot less likelihood of mosquitoes coming into the room if I opened the balcony door -- although I only got bitten on two occasions anyway -- once when I happened to be out by the heavy foliage behind bldg 3 at dusk and another time eating at the outdoor restaurant that sits beside the golf course, also at dusk (a good place to see the baby alligators by the way). Also, I gathered that buildings 11 and up were built in a later phase than buildings 1 - 10, -- certainly the mattress was much newer and somewhat softer, the kitchen had a granite countertop as opposed to stainless steel as well as nicer cabinets, all the taps were more high end and the thermostat and air conditioning controls were definitely newer. I never went down there to check, but I suspect that building 21, while much further from the action, would be nicer still. Building 3 was just fine though and had its own charm, being surrounded by lush green foliage, and certainly it was nice to be just a couple of minutes walk away from the pool. It's true that it was a little musty but that's probably partly due to it being a bit older and partly due to all the foliage -- and hey, it is a tropical country after all! I have a super sensitive nose and it only bothered me the first couple of minutes after entering the suite, and then I didn't notice it for the most part so it's really not that bad. The linens didn't smell at all. I did find out that there are only a few non-smoking buildings -- I think they are 4, 5, 6, and 7 (and maybe 8). It was only a problem on 2 nights, when I had to shut off the air conditioning since the smell of smoke seemed to be coming in through the ventilation system -- there was no smell of it in the suites at all though otherwise. I did go to the Owner's Presentation and they tried to get me to ugrade (I'm so naive -- I believed her when she said they just wanted to let me know about changes to the resort etc.), but it was fine -- no heavy pressure -- the buffet breakfast was very nice and the 500 free pesos wasn't bad -- and then I got 10% off my food and drink at the end of my stay as well so I wasn't sorry I went at all. My priority on my first full day though was to get myself into Playa del Carmen to e-mail my daughters and get some groceries. One of the shuttles (white flag -- 'Entrada Principal' on the front -- drops you at the main gate. You just cross the highway and wait by the side of the road for a Collectivo van that says 'Playa' on the front. It costs 15 pesos to go into Playa and 20 to return. The station in Playa is at Calle 2 and 20th Ave -- about 6 blocks from the WalMart store, but you can be let off a little closer if you just tell the driver 'WalMart'. He let me off at 30th Ave (they're numbered by 5's, so that's just 2 blocks from 20th), and about 3 blocks along on the northwest corner I came to an Internet cafe that only charged 10 pesos for an hour (the one at the hotel charges 75) and, better still, it only cost me 4 pesos because I was only on for 20 minutes -- I had expected to be charged the full 10. From there it was just a couple more blocks to the WalMart. You can also take the taxi shuttle van from the hotel lobby for 35 pesos each way -- it drops off and picks up at the southeast corner exit in the underground parking lot of the WalMart -- there's a bench and a little sort of patio there -- the concierge will give you the schedule. However, I HIGHLY recommend that you go to the MegaMart 2 blocks north of the WalMart. I was at both stores a few times and there is just no comparison. I personally did not find the MegaMart to be cheaper, but I would happily pay more to shop there anyway -- it was ever so much cleaner, MUCH less crowded, and a much more pleasant experience overall. It even has a very nice seating area in front of the deli and coffee counter -- if you buy a cup of coffee there they automatically bring you a whole basket of little pastries -- no charge! And I was able to get my groceries to the shuttle at WalMart by taking the MegaMart shopping cart to the end of the parking lot, crossing the street and picking up another shopping cart at the plaza in the next block and taking it to the end of its parking lot, and then had to carry my stuff only about 100' until I could get a cart in front of the WalMart. If I had it to do over again, and if I was just going into Playa for groceries, I'd consider taking my carry on bag with me just for the wheels. I also used the collectivo to go to Tulum (free on Sundays only if you look Mexican apparently -- great swimming in the ocean there but wear your bathing suit under your clothes if you don't want to change in front of everyone), Puerto Morelos (a nice little village about 10 minutes north of Mayan Palace with really great snorkelling and a good used book store -- had a pretty nice meal there too), and Akumal (a 15 minute walk from there to Half Moon Bay -- the dive shop there rents snorkelling gear for $9 US and you just take yourself right out into the water -- it was my first time and I thought it was pretty terrific -- a nice restaurant right beside the dive shop too -- the whole atmosphere just very laid back). In each case it was an easy way to go, although if you are in a group of more than two you might not always get on. They come about every 5 minutes though, so it's not a long wait for the next one. I tried not to be travelling right when the Mexicans were getting off work because I thought I'd feel kind of badly if they couldn't get on because I was taking a seat. You can also use the big ADO buses and I think they're actually cheaper for going to Tulum (it was 35 pesos each way on the collectivo from Playa and I'm pretty sure that ADO was only 20 pesos). Obviously I was trying to keep my costs down -- mainly because I didn't have anyone sharing the cost of the suite with me -- but also, I like to travel like the locals, to get more of a feel for how they live. I did take a fancier tour van to go to Chichen Itza -- as hard as I tried to avoid them I got kyboshed at the airport by a guy at the so-called 'Information' booth. I was so anxious to just find the Mayan Palace van that really I just agreed to go to the presentation at El Cid so he'd give me the information I was seeking. I TOLD him (and I told them too) that I already owned a timeshare but he was very young and charming and relentless and didn't ask me for a deposit or anything. I actually thought I wouldn't show up for it (even though he said 'I trust you and this helps me pay for my university education'), but met someone who had gone and said it was really nice so I thought 'oh what the heck I guess I'll go'. The perks were, besides another buffet breakfast (a girl's gotta eat, right?), a trip to Chichen Itza (which was on my to do list anyway and included a stop at a huge cenote -- really cool -- and a lunch of traditional Mayan fare with Mayan dancing for entertainment), a one hour therapeutic massage (it was great and included one hour of hydrotherapy as well!!), and a huge bottle of Kahlua (which I should have just left behind because it meant I had to check my bag coming home -- I know, bring out the violin). Again, the pressure was quite tolerable, the place was really very nice (in Puerto Morelos actually -- the taxi ride both ways was also gratis), and I'd have to say that the perks were definitely worth it. Chichen Itza is really amazing and I highly recommend it if you're interested in ruins. You could certainly do it on your own from Cancun but it's still a long trip and you'd have to try to sneak into another tour group at the site to get the lowdown on the history of all the buildings. As a Mayan Palace member I had free access to the gym but decided to book myself a massage there too and that includes an hour of hydrotherapy, so I used the sauna, steam room, and hot and cold tubs prior to my massage with Alejandra -- she is really good and I gave her a healthy tip -- charged to my room when it was all over. Then I used the Swiss shower -- a very nice experience. I pay $80 for a one hour massage at home so I felt that the price of 900 pesos, which included hydrotherapy and a little aromatherapy as well, was not at all unreasonable. Not only that, but the salon only charges 350 pesos for a ladies wash and cut (250 for men) -- next time I'll wait and get my hair cut while I'm there because I pay a lot more than that at home. I was surprised to find out how much I enjoyed just hanging out at the resort. There was stretching on the beach at 10 every morning, meditation an hour or two later, water aerobics (absolutely hilarious with 'Sexy Luis'), bingo every day at 4:30 (hey, it's really popular and I won a free buffet dinner), Spanish lessons, dancing lessons, beading, blackjack, poker, lessons on how to make drinks (you don't learn much but it sure is fun), beach volleyball -- and I even enjoyed a few really good 2 for 1 Margueritas at the pool. I never had a problem finding a Palapa to sit under and in fact really liked the ones by the beach -- it's the sound and sight of the waves that appeals me more than being in the water anyway. Also, there are books to be borrowed from both the Activity Center and the lobby at Brio (the spa). As far as food goes, I cooked most breakfasts and some dinners and bought a meal once a day for the most part. The first night I got a hamburger with fries at Havana Moom and it came with tiny little single use jars of mustard, mayo, and ketchup as I recall, which you're free to take back to your room if you want. The ones you get by the pool really are good too, and the portions are generous. The health bar upstairs in Brio has terrific sandwiches -- again, very generous -- and smoothies, and be sure to try the French Toast at Havana Moon -- unlike any I've ever had before and absolutely delicious and only 60 pesos as I recall -- I wish I hadn't left that until my last day. It turned out that someone from home joined me unexpectedly about the 5th day into my trip and still, for the two of us to eat and drink for the entire trip, both groceries and restaurants, including alcohol (and although I rarely drink the same can't be said for my companion), the cost was less than $300 Canadian (believe me, I have every peso we spent written down -- I'm just like that), and we ate very well. Okay, I've practically written a book and I doubt many people would read this far. If you have and you want to know more you can write to me. I really had a great time and I would definitely go back. Oh, and you certainly can drink the water at the resort -- they have their own treatment plant. Have a great time!!", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Times at the Mayan Palace\u201d", "Author": "AZ2MI", "ReviewID": "UR23112638", "Content": "This was my 4th time to this resort and must say they continue to impress and improve the resort. I was there between the devastating hurricanes in 2005 and they have not only made repairs, they continue to improve. We were there 12/5 -12th and had a fabulous time and met wonderful guests and staff members. The resort is a terrific place for guests of all ages and groups. We met one group of early 20\u2019s in a group of 20, they were having a lot of fun celebrating a college friends wedding. This is a large resort, but they do have convenient and quiet trains that take you to the different spots. I rent a car from ACE/Executive Car Rental on-line through Sidestep.com. It is easy, convenient and less costly than taking Taxis. I paid $151.00 U.S. for a small automatic car that was large enough for (3) people and moderate luggage. For me it is a convenience thing, but many guests took the M.P. shuttle to Wal-Mart in Playa or the bus that run outside the resort and they were very pleased with the service. I just like the convenience of having the car. However, if you want to rent a car for a day or two, do it on-line in the internet room and you will save some $$. ACE/Executive will pick you up at the resort and take you to their location a few miles away. Much less than calling or having resort, make reservations. The M.P. is always clean, I have a one-bedroom suite and it comes with (2) separate bathroom sinks, makes it nice for getting ready and (2) large closets with plenty of hangers and luggage racks. The rooms are large and were told they will be updating the beds in ALL rooms as part of their affiliation with Wynndam. I personally never have a problem sleeping but I know many folks feel they are too hard. If you call housekeeping, they will bring you an egg crate and remake the bed. A tip is always appreciated and my mom gets a goodnights rest. The kitchen is an efficiency, but enough to make most meals if you want. I usually whip up a nice breakfast in the room and eat lunch and dinner at one of the many restaurants on site. You must eat at least once at Tromonto\u2019s the food is excellent no matter what you order and the ambience cannot be beat. Very romantic, but can be enjoyed by all. The deserts are always great and visually appealing. There is also a Deli/Bakery near the pool. Poolside fare is great and the pizza is exceptional. The Havana Moon Cafe has live music every evening and has a great selection of entrees from sandwiches, pasta to steaks and pizza. This seems to be a hot spot for many guests. Please remember they place a tip on your bill, so no need to tip extra unless you want to reward exceptional service. We never got to the Taco Bar near the golf course, but it was always a happening spot for breakfast and dinner. Prices at the M.P. restaurants are much more reasonable than what you would find in the states or even Playa Del Carmen. Our most expensive meal was in Playa at the \u201cDistillaria\u201d and for the price, I prefer the food at the Tromonto easily. The pool is quite incredible as many have written and despite the resort being full, it never seemed crowded. The beach has some great furniture, loungers and hammocks for all to enjoy and they do provide full drink and food service there. There is also a water sports shack on the beach for snorkeling, parasailing, scuba diving and Jet Ski\u2019s. The jet skis are large for multiple riders and are $65.00 for 30 minutes. Very convenient and all equipment is well maintained. The gym/spa is modern. I had a 50-minute message and it was quite relaxing. There is always a pick up game of volleyball in the pool and on the beach. You can participate in the water aerobics or other activities or simply relax and enjoy. The pallapas can be reserved for $30.00, but that $30.00 is applied to you food/drink tab around the pool, so that is nothing. We saw a lot of families with children using them so their children could rest. December the sun is quite pleasant so no need to rent for me, in July I will be reserving. If you want to do a daytrip I recommend Xhl-Ha, this is an all-inclusive experience and the price is very reasonable for what you get. You honestly need to bring yourself, swimsuit and water shoes. They supply a large locker, fresh towels all day long, innertubes, snorkeling equipment ($20. deposit). They even will check in your suntan lotion if it is harmful for the fish and provide you with environmentally safe lotion. There are (6) restaurants and are open for breakfast to dinner and are included. There is even a large outdoor bar that is included. I had read in one of the reviews this was a great place to buy gifts and they were right. Far better quality and prices than in Playa or Cancun, we were pleasantly surprised by the prices. They even bubble wrap any breakables without your requesting. They also will take photos of you at various locations and you can purchase th photos on the way out of the park. There is biking, hiking, snorkeling, areas to jump from cliff's safe, water bridges, rope bridge challenge, cenotes, river tubing and much more. It never seemed crowded, even in the restaurants. I forgot to mention there is a \u201cspecial\u201d drink of the day that is 2 for 1 all day around the pool, so be sure to ask about it and there is a Happy Hour in which all drinks are 2 for 1. Our friend orders 4 beers and gets a bucket of 8. He always has a great time. Unless you have been to a timeshare resort, it is hard to explain the vast difference from a regular resort hotel. I never knew until I went as a guest and from that point on, I was sold. I have not had buyer\u2019s remorse, but I also continue to say no to the timeshare folks. The Mayan Palace staff does a great job of making your trip enjoyable. Please do not agree to the \u201cfree\u201d breakfast or whatever they offer you unless you are interested in purchasing a timeshare vacation. It is not worth it no matter what they give you and they do sell 65% of the time. Therefore, that alone can tell you the Groupo Mayan is a wonderful resort and their sales staff is persuasive. If you are looking to buy, you can really get a good deal if you are willing to put in the time and get them down in price. Remember you have the upper hand in the deal. I am always amazed at some of the negative reviews. My guess is many of these folks are miserable no matter where they are.

I had also read many reviews of both good and bad,but remained optomistic. We had a 2 bdrm / 2bath ajoining suite which was large and functional. The furniture like most in mexico was dated but in good condition. The maid service was great in the eve for turn down service and the day service was Ok but they routinely waited until after 3Pm to clean both rooms ? Not exactly top notch considering we left tip money almost everyday on the pillows. The staff was very approachable and spoke better English than my Spanish. I requested a lower unit number when I confirmed 72 hrs in advance and was told that it was not possible and to ask upon arrival which I did. I was told that it would not be possible to be in buildings 1-5 unless i was willing to downsize to a 1 bedroom for the same price, which I declined. They did put me in building 10 which is great because that is where the check in, conciere, and currency exchange are. The 3rd floor kep us away from all the noise and the view of the jungle was not bad.. ( I do prefer an ocean view ) but this hotel does not have any units that face the water, from what I am told. I never did check into the shuttle service. It's a 5 minute walk down a paved path through a beautiful tropical paradise to the pool. The only person that we encoutered that was rude and did not want to due their job was a women that was usually working the currency exchange. I am not sure what her problem was but she should be relieved of her positon. If I needed attitude I could have stayed home and went to work.... The shuttle to wallmart is 35 pesos or around 3 dollars and has service 3-4 times per day. I found out the hard way and have not seen this posted but you are not able to cash in any mexican money when you leave, so make sure you dont get stuck with a lot of currency that you dont' need. I am puzzled why this policy exists but you can exchange at the airport for a lesser rate, of course. I recommend taking the shuttle to walmart then walking 5-6 blocks and taking the public shuttle to Tulumn ( Ruins) and take a towel and bathing suit. The ruins are built on a cliff and the beautiful white sand beach has some of the most beautiful water you will ever see. Admission is around 5 dollars and the bus ride is around 3 dollars each way. ON the way back stop and have the driver let you off at Akumal , which has a stunning beach and a dive shop that will rent you snorkel gear for around 12 dollars. Take a cheap under water camera. We saw large sea turtles, schools of fish and coral reefs. The water is very calm and clear. We ate at the havana moon and the food was good and the price was comparable with downtown prices. I also stopped by the green bar, which serves tacos nightly. The food again was good and a little pricey, which I expect to pay at any resort. I don't agree with them automatically adding a 15 percent tip, I like to tip based on service and the waiter attempted to talk me into more food than i wanted along with drinks, etc...to run the bill up and subsequently the tip. When I declined I never was able to get his attention again. I found this to be very tacky and lacked customer service. We only found 1 additional charge on our bill that was bogus, which was an internet charge we disputed and was removed. I recommend saving all your reciepts and dating them. Check in and out was quick and easy. The grounds are beatiful and the pools are amazing. The water was always warm and the weather was 85 to 87 every day and mostly sunny. The beach was also very nice and I did have water sandles and ventured out to swimm in the ocean several times. All in All I would recommend this hotel and will consider staying there in the future.

We are members of Mayan Palace and have stayed at two other properties. This one is huge. If you're staying at the Mayan Palace, try to get as low a building number as possible. When you make your reservations, you can make a request but they really don't pay any attention to it. That said, it's probably better to have your request in their file. We made our reservations about 6 months in advance and requested a low building number and only because we vigorously complained did we get our requested building. Our room looked out over the jungle and we had a distant view of the ocean. It was private and very nice. I would recommend a jungle view over one looking into the property. They have shuttles that can transport you around the property. Fortunately, we're in good health and were able to walk. We had a 2BR/2BA unit. The room was spacious, clean and well maintained. Housekeeping was courteous and effective. We had a couple of minor issues when we checked in but they were remedied immediately. They rent out palapas near the pool for 300 pesos. As long as you spend at least 300 pesos at the pool or Balche restaurant, they will credit you the 300 pesos at checkout. We rented the poolside palapas twice and had no problem reserving one. There are also a number of palapas available at the beach at no cost. Overall, there were plenty of chairs both in the sun and shade. The pool is huge and there are different areas with different tempuratures. The swim up bars were nice. The beach was fine for laying out and walking but it's pretty rocky and really is too rocky to swim. There is a nice swimming beach about 15-20 minutes away. Just face the water, turn left and walk until you see it at the resort next door. The food was ok. The italian restaurant (Tremonte's, I think) was very good and there is a new Asian restaurant that was good. Havana Moon was ok and Balche's is good for lunch. We didn't eat at the buffet, but it looked ok. The timeshare presentation was ok. We did upgrade to Grand Mayan but could have easily walked away. If he's still there, try to get J.C. - he's not really high pressure and he's a nice guy.

Rooms you could hear everything of both sides of you and anyone walking down the hallway. Also the elevators about 60 feet away were loud all night long. First night had loud party next to us which didnt quit until about 4AM. Second night party started around 7PM and went to 2Am. I called the conciere and front desk but the party kept going. Next morning I talked to the conciere that the party had been going for two days. He said if it happen again let them know. I said why dont you leave a message to that room asking them be considerate to the adjoining rooms he refused. That night again the party started around 9PM. At 12:15 I called again for over an half hour trying to get the bell boy, conciere, front dest, room service but know one would answer. I started pounding on the door to see if they would get quite but with in a few minutes they would start up again. In he next hour other rooms took my lead and would go pound on their door and tell them to stop the party aaround 3AM they finally got quite. The next moring I again talked to the conciere and front dest and they again were little help. I told them that tonight I was going to probably get into a fight with the people next door if they didnt quite down since the would do nothing. I told them I was fed up with them and they recommended that I change rooms I said that I was not the problem and maybe the partyers should change rooms. That night they started parting again and I called the conciere again. They did call the room because I could hear their phone ringing. It did get quite for about 10 minutes and then it started up again. Aafter three phone calls to the room which didnt work fnally security came to their room. The fifth night hard to sleep as I kept waiting for them to start partying again. 2. Cant swim at beech. 3.Swimming pools all cold, ocean warmer. 4, Resort is not close to anything. 5.

It actually is very nice but takes some getting used to. We have been been trading timeshare stays for the last 20 years so we think we have a pretty good idea of what works and what doesn't. We traveled to the Mayan Palace during Nov. 9th thru the 1th, 2008. Weather was spectacular. The Mayan Palace is big. Either get used to walking or figure out the shuttle early. For example, shuttles with the blue flags go to the pool. Yellow flags go to the Mayan Palace furthest buildings. We stayed in building 15. You can request building 1 - 5, but don't expect to get it. My bottom line on the Mayan Palace is that it's big, well manicured grounds, very attentive staff. Don't expect too much due to the size. The pool is incredibly large. The beach area is good for lounging around, but not for swimming. Take water shoes if you plan on getting in. The Mayan Palace is a second class citizen to the Grand Mayan. SSome areas are off-limits to the Mayan Palace guests. Here's what we liked or did that worked out well: 1. took a collapsable cooler and took beer, mixed drinks to the pool. They apparently frown on this, but no one ever said anything. 2. Went to Wal-Mart in Playa del Carmen for food. Good prices but difficult to navigate. I'd recommend the Mega store. We've been in Mega in other places in Mexico and find them really nice and more what you'd find in the states. 3. Rented a car. Worked out OK. You might try renting at a location outside of the airport. Airport tax is high. BE VERY AWARE OF THE SPEED LIMITS! There are many speed traps around. We got stopped for speeding one night in Cancun. The cops were very nice, but we were set up for a \"$100 US fine and you'll get your license back\" . They told tell us that we had to go the Cancun police station the next day for a $200 fine. I finally asked if we could pay there and MIRACULOUSLY they said yes for $100! It's all a set up. Rental cars have an orange sticker on the back so they know what they are doing. Don't give them a reason to pull you over. But if you are, be nice, they won't give you any trouble. The parking lot at the resort is REALLY FAR from the hotel, but workable. 4. Restaurants there were good. We ate at Havana Moon and La Bolce' (sp?) . We didn't like the Mexican Fiesta there on Thursday. It's probably actually pretty good, but we've been to so many, I think we're finished wth those. Margaritas were VERY strong. Food was good. It's pretty expensive at $60 or so per person. If you haven't done a fiesta, its probably worth it...this on just wasn't for us. 5. We did breakfast in the room every day. Had one lunch there too...sandwiches. 6. Hamburgers, nachos and guac were really good at the pool. 7. Playa del Carmen was fun and within reasonable distance. Maybe 20 mins or so to get there. 8. Cancun...I can live without. It's just too much like Miami. Not much character. Hotel after hotel is all you can see on the little island strip. 9. Tulum ruins. It was OK and pretty cheap...may $8 each. The beach at Tulum (not the one at the ruins) is very nice, just a little hard to get to. If you want to go topless you can. You won't be hassled and you won't be the only one either. 10. Avoid the timeshares. We always do one (gluttens for punishment, I guess). The gifts are never worth the time spent. We were in and out in 2 1/2 hours, but we also had our own transportation. 11. Isla de Mujeres is fun. Unless you plan to swim with the dolphins (via Aqua Tours), I'd recommend just taking the normal shuttle. The shuttle takes you the downtown area, whereas the swim with the dolphins area is about 10 to 15 minutes outside of town. 12. While in Isla de Mujeres, don't miss eating at Rene & Renee's. Its on a side streeet that goes perpindicular to the beach in downtown. You can google it and find the address. Delightful couple runs it and the food it great and most affordable. 13. Isla Mujeres beaches are nice.. We saw a couple of topless sunbathers there.

I am writing becuase I found other reviews helpful and I want to share my experiences. First I want to say everbody,s experience is going to differ based on what you like to do or don't like. Then factor in good or bad experiences. I thought are stay was great. The only negative was that on the next to our last nite we had uninvited guests. The resort assigned our room to a family and at 10 pm they entered our room to our suprise. We called the desk and got new keys that nite. The next morning I spoke to the Mgr and expressed my concerns and that they walked in on my wife in a state of undress. That got us additional time to check out and a free dinner ( $ 60 value ). We are members so we got the free shuttle which saved us $ 30 which is good. The bad you are at the mercy of guests also using the shuttle and when they get in. You must arrange this in advance with the resort. The ride back to the airport is on you they do provide a shuttle back but it is $ 15 a person. My wife and I took at cab for $ 30 the same as it would of cost for the shuttle but it was just us. We declined the time share presentation becaue I didn't want time away from the sun ( 90 minutes in Mexican time = 3-4 hrs our time. ) Plus I didn't feel like dealing with someone getting me angry. We did choose to go on the next to our last day because it was going to be overcast. Especailly since we knew we would get 1000 pesos and 10% of our bill. ( tip let the people offering deals at the airport talk with you as you can use this to bargin with getting more out of the timeshare people ). If you don't want to buy or upgrade be firm with them. We laid it out on the table and said money was tight and that we could only afford a few thousand. We got an upgrade to the Bliss package. ( they are selling the grand bliss and bliss it is a cross between a mayan and grand mayan memebership ) with them joining wydham there is more services we felt were worth it. We tried to take the shuttle into town our first nite but the bugs were so bad we shared a cab with others. We also took at cab back from Wal-mart as we had several bags of groceries it was just easier $ 20 included tip. The shuttle is $ 3.50 from the resort and $ 1.50 if you go to the main hwy and take the Playa express. You can shop at either wal-mart or mega mart for groceries. The shop at the resort is not bad for price and selection if you factor in time and cost to go to town. Our stay was good we did the snokel trip twice they offer. We met a group of people so that gave us some bargining power. We did it for $ 38 US the first time and $ 23 US the second time. They take you to two reefs then a beach ( kind of the lame part of the trip ) to chill for a bit . You get all the beer and pop you want. We also took the shuttle into town with several people and took the ferry over to Cozamel ( well worth it ). it is $ 12 one way and if you buy only one way you can pay on the other side to come back and take either of the ferry rides back. They have vans $ 130 with insurance ( we had 10 people ) , cars ? , or scooters $ 25 and cabs I am told are very expensive. If you rent your own transportation you are at your own mercy to travel the island to shop and swim. Also if you want to ride out in the open air on the ferry get in line early seating outside is limited. otherwise you are inside the cabin area too cold. We also did Xel -Ha that was by far the best thing we did . It includes all you can eat and drink plus the majority of the waterpark. there are some things that are an additional cost once you get in but only a couple. We bought our tickets from the Blue Azul travel in Playa De carmen. it is near 5th st by the ferry area. it cost us with the exchange rate $ 84 a person. the resort wanted well over a hundred depending on if you get the timeshare 10 % discount. The only bad thing is the tour has to pick you up in front of the resort. but the resort has shuttles that will take you to the front if you don't want to walk. There are plenty of things to do and tours to take we were just tried to manage what we spent and get value. I cut and pasted several fine points out of the reviews I read and took it with me. If you are new to the Mexican culture it can be a bit overwhelming your first time there. Having hints on things helps the process. I also suggest brushing up on your spanish knowing a few basic words is helpful. But there are several areas where people are limited in their English so the more Spanish you speak the better.

Prepare to suffer at this remote, low-quality resort in the middle of nowhere. I just returned from this place last night with my family, and I would NOT recommend this resort to anybody... This resort has a TERRIBLE mosquito problem! Prepare to be eaten alive! You then have to pay a small fortune to but products from the tiny pharmacy to keep the bugs off and relieve the terrible bites. Everyone at the resort was covered in big, red bug bites! There was standing, stinky, green water everywhere... bubbling with mosquitos. The water features were so mismanged that the fountains were spewing green funk. There are simple solutions to this! I'm surprised that such a large, sprawling facility wouldn't be able to properly manage the bugs. This resort is in the middle of nowhere. IT IS NOT IN PLAYA DEL CARMEN. It's 30 minutes to Playa del Carmen on cramped, poorly scheduled shuttles to the WalMart in town. WalMart? Then you have to walk through dark streets with broken sidewalks to get to the main tourist strip. Just shops and restaurants...but nothing special. Don't wear the wrist band from the hotel that identifies you as a rich tourist ready to be hassled and exploited with terrible rates on everything. It's an hour to Cancun...on public transportation. You have to stand outside of the resort on a huge public highway and wait for a shuttle to stop. It was a fast highway, and there were stray dogs and lots more bugs feasting on us. We took a cab back for $50... The rooms were not nice at all. No balconies (you'll be eaten alive if you stay outside for a moment). Only garden views...which means the gardeners always have a great view of you. People coming by several times a day to spray repellant outside the doors and windows...asking you to shut the doors at all times. The halls in the housing blocks have no doors, so bugs, cats, all kinds of creatures get in. Then they mechanically fumigate these halls every night. DOORS would be a great solution!!! The kitchens were barely adequate. Uncomfortable beds. You come in the room everynight to the fresh scent of bug spray. The rooms in the Grand Mayan (on the same property) are much nicer...but if you are with RCI, you can't get one of these rooms. THE POOLS ARE NOT HEATED!!! So the kids (and adults) were shivering. The pools look beautiful, but they are empty because they are so so so cold. They only heat them for a few months in the winter, according to the staff. The chairs and loungers by the pool were so uncomfortable and didn't recline back. There were big drainage gutters all around (bugs!), and maintenance staff were washing out the big trash bags from inside the trash containers for reuse, right onto the lawns beside you. How unsanitary and disgusting! I had to forbid the kids from walking on the lawns surrounding us... THE BEACH IS UNSWIMMABLE!!! There is no sand once you reach the water's edge - just rough, nasty, algae-algae covered rocks. So you can't take a swim unless you are ready to walk 1/2 mile to a swimmable spot. The water in the sea was much warmer than in the pool, but all we could do was wade in up to our ankles. Such a MAJOR disappointment! This resort is HUGE...so you need to catch a tram to get anywhere...and the trams are small. So there's a mad rush to fit your family onto the same one. The crowd at this resort is definitely on the older side, and since the distances between your rooms and the pools and the restaurants is so vast - everybody is wating forever to catch a ride with all their gear. People are ruthless and don't care if you're carrying a baby and a stroller. They have been waiting for 20 minutes and will knock you aside to get onto a tram. The only nice thing was pretty foliage, a few decent restaurants (noticeably empty), and a nice children's activitiy center...which I had to use a lot, since the kids couldn't stand the freezing pools.

We were two married couples and one single. My husband and I own a timeshare through Wyndham. Through RCI, we used a studio room in a red week and traded up to a two bedroom suite. We were trying to keep our expenses to a minimum. We rented a car and drove to the resort, checked in and put our bags in our rooms. Then we drove to the local Wal-Mart where we got our groceries! Our suite had a full kitchen with a mid-size fridge, so we bought 2 styrofoam coolers at Wal-Mart and put the excess food (and alcohol!) in our coolers. We ate almost every meal in our rooms. We would head out to the pool in the morning and either go back to the room and have a sandwich for lunch, or else we would order something small from the grill at the pool. We bought all of our own alcohol at Wal-Mart as well, and packed our mini-coolers (cloth coolers we brought from home) full before we headed out to the pool. We weren't sure if we were allowed to have our own alcohol at the pool, so we kept our coolers closed. But there are swim-up bars that offer the same beer that we bought ourselves (Modelo Especial). No workers who walked by said anything about us having our own alcohol, I'm sure some of them had to see us reaching in our coolers occasionally! We were going to drive ourselves to Chichen Itza, but we decided to take the hotel-sponsored tour. We had a really good time. With that tour, there is a stop at a nearby watering hole which has a little ledge you can jump off of. That was a lot of fun and very refreshing! Chichen Itza was very cool, and I learned a lot about the culture. We believe we made the right decision to take the tour instead of wing it on our own. Since the resort and Chichen Itza are in two different states, there is a police checkpoint at the border. That may make an already nervous driver much more nervous! Now, we had a good experience overall...but...do not get suckered in to listen to a timeshare presentation! They told us it would take 90 minutes. We would get 10% off of our room bill as well as getting a $100 credit on our bill. The presentation ended up lasting around 3 hours! They were so pushy, almost threatening. They told us if we didn't buy into their resort, we would be black-listed on RCI and never be able to trade up again. They were a total turn-off, and no way was I going to buy into their company. I got home and expressed my disgust with their timeshare salesmen/women, and the person I talked to at RCI said they get the same complaint from a lot of people. There is no such thing as being black-listed from RCI (a week later I booked a week for 2, 5 star, gold crown resorts. One, one bed in Andalucia, Spain, and one, two bed room in the Canary Islands). At the end of the day, BY ALL MEANS, do NOT buy from the Mayan Palace.

The resort is a massive 1500 acres. Mostly utilized by the golf course (I did not golf). I was in building 17 of the 21 MP buildings. Building 1 is by the pool and 21 is the furthest. The resort offers a tram shuttle service that picks you up in front of your building and brings you to the main lobby. From there you hop on the appropriately color-coded shuttle to your destination. Very simple concept. Although, some people found it confusing. I was in a 2 bedroom unit (3187-85) and it was very spacious. It had a kitchenette. I did some light cooking. The bathrooms were roomy but lacked a double sink. The view from my room was of a wooded area and the \"under construction lazy river\" I prefer a view of the Caribbean Sea but this resort is not setup that way. Room service, Maid service and even a turndown service were top notch. The swimming pool was a huge, sprawling sea of crystal clear water, volleyball, scuba lessons, swim-up bars and relaxation. There were plenty of lounge chairs, palapas and towels to go around. The poolside wait staff was excellent. The beach is smaller and the shore is very rocky. Bring your watershoes. Better beaches in Playa del Carmen. The restaurants were good. Nothing phenominal. They were, for the most part , open-air dining. It was rather muggy during one of my dinners. The resort is a cashless system. Everything is charged to your room. Grupo Mayan Resorts are timeshares and fractional ownerships. Therefore, they would like your time for their presentations. They claim it's 90 minutes but, mine was 5 hours of high pressure sales. If you are interested in ownership, get through the sales presentation and then you get to talk with the developers.

We found the accommodations nice and the pool was amazing. However... While the shuttle was good, it was very impractical for a family of 6 - always someone getting left behind when the shuttle got full. Also, there is a shuttle from the far buildings to the lobby, and another shuttle from the lobby to the pool - so if you are unfortunate as we were and get the farthest room in the far building, you are going to spend a lot of time either walking or shuttling. I had emailed a request to the hotel for a room near the pool, and although they sent an email reply that they'd do their best, obviously the request carried no weight. We were disappointed the hotel would not allow early check-in and even more disappointed when we wanted to switch to a closer room and the resort required us to totally check out of the one unit for 6 or more hours before we could check back in to the closer unit. While we were in the far unit, instead of shuttling one evening we walked along the back jungle-side of the building. This proved interesting because we found several animals on our way - cats and some large creatures that we later found were relatives of racoons. OK, shuttle troubles aside, we very much enjoyed the beautiful pool cabana rentals and took advice from other tripadvisor members in renting those and getting reimbursement at checkout because we spent money at the pool bars. We found the location of the resort to be very remote from everything, so it was not too convenient to get do any grocery shopping other than at the small store on-site, but we did shop some there. We do try to hold food costs down when we travel. The resort provided complimentary transportation from the airport to the resort because we were thru RCI. They do not provide complimentary return transportation, however. We did not try the collectivo with our crowd, but we did have luck with cabs offering cheap rates into Playa. We also rented a car from the hotel one day and that was liberating but pricey with all the insurance. There were pool-side activites for adult and kids alike going on all day. There were games for the kids and a (hot) hike to show the crocodiles and flamingos that they have on-site. There were funny contests and games like \"Mr. Mayan Palace\" that kept us laughing.

Having read a load of reviews, we were somewhat concerned about the resort. However, what we found was that the negative reports came from people who obviously didn't enjoy exercise or, lucky for them, came from the USA where taxis and eating out are a lot cheaper than in the UK! I totally agree that, if you don't want to spend 3+ hours at a timeshare presentation - don't go. However, I guess those people who are moaning about it wanted the gifts and, possibly niavely thought that they could get away with a free breakfast and the presentation in 90 minutes! They are hard-sellers but I have yet to go to a timeshare presentation that is different. We calculated that 3 hours would pay us, in discounts etc, about $50 an hour and so it was acceptable. The initial package for the Grand Mayan, for 8 weeks, was $199,900 - farcical isn't it? We told them from the start that we wouldn't buy and asked to go when it got to 3 hours and, whilst they didn't give up trying, they decided that they were not going to get anywhere and so got us out with the minimum of fuss. The resort is huge and, if you can, get Block 11 ior 12 near the Mayan Palace lobby from which the shuttles depart. The suites in the Palace are pretty large and are adequate. In the Grand, they are of much higher quality though. Our cleaners came every day, changed towels when we asked and we had a turn-down every evening. I do agree that the hurricane protection (black, just see- through sheets over the balconies) look pretty bad and, if we had been in an apartment with them, I would have been really fed up, not having a view of the gorgeous gardens. They do flap about and, at night, they can be a pain but they didn't put us off our sleep. The whole resort is very clean and contrary to the last couple of reviews we (and most people) found the service very good, the staff very friendly and willing to put themselves out. The animation team work hard and, if you want to join in activities in and around the pool, there are lots, every day. 15% service is added to all food and beverage bills and you don't pay with cash, once you get into the resort - it's all on account. This is great as we never had to carry cash, or worry about leaving it whilst we were swimming. The pool itself is massive and is clean and has various features such as raised areas, 'beds' and waterfalls. There are more than sufficient sunbeds around the pool area and many more on the beach and there is waiter service to all of them, all day. However, the sea at the beach is not swimmable, although you can come out the resort, walk about half a mile to the left and there is an area, outside of another resort, where there is swimming and body surfing. The food is good, in whichever restaurant you go and, compared with UK prices, they are very reasonable. The Tramonto is the flagship one and the food is good and cost us about \u00a325 ($50) a head. Ther Mexican evening on a Thursday was fantastic value. It was all inclusive and cost $59 and I think that we drunk well over that - there was never a time when we had a glass with less than an inch or so of booze in it! The buffet was extensive and the show and entertainment was very professional. Again, I am not sure what some of the reviewers were thiniking about when they talk about the resort being miles away from anywhere. We have travelled extensively and, generally speaking, if you want a beach resort of this sort of size, it is frequently out of town and is a separate estate with little connection to its neighbours. It wasn't a great hassle to get the taxi bus into Playe del Carmen (mainly for the Walmart) and the $3.50 single was very reasonable. Even the $20 taxi ride back must have been half what it would cost us in the UK. The trips bought from the resort are slightly more expensive than from outside but there is the confidence that you are going to get there and back and be looked after. We went to Xcaret and Xel-Ha, the eco water parks and both were superb. The show at the former is as professional as you can get and worth staying late for. Have the all-inclusive packages for Xcaret. Xel-Ha is already inclusive and so you can eat and drink as much as you like, all day. A tip for Xcaret - don't get changed and immediately pick up your snorkel and go into the underground river. Everyone does this first thing and it's like Piccadilly Circus or Time Square, trafficwise! Leave it until afternoon and there's hardly anyone there. Going at this time of year has two drawbacks. It was cloudy and very rainy for several of the days and the mosquitoes and other 'no-see- ems' - as a US couple called them - are horrid! Would we go back - yes but there is some rule that says that, if you don't buy, you can't exchange into any Groupo Mayan resort for five years.

The two resorts (Palace / Grand Mayan) share the same grounds and although it was indeed a beautiful piece of property, the negatives far outweighed the positives from our perspective. First and foremost, the Mayan Group needs to spend the time & money to restore the beach area which IMHO should be one of their biggest assets; however because of the all the visible rock formations and the fact that it is very difficult to get into and enjoy the ocean, totally takes away from the entire property. They have a fabulous set-up at the beach with lots of comfortable loungers, tables, palapa's, beach service, restaurants, etc. etc. etc., but without being able to get into the ocean, as far as I was concerned, that beautiful view in front of me could well have been just a mural and in turn, all those amenities were wasted. Instead, we went into Puerto Morelos and spent the day on the beach as well as enjoyed some of the local people and some fabulous food & drinks. We found the room to be comfortable/spacious enough for the four of us, we could have used a much bigger fridge though, but were glad we brought coolers; maid service was average. I had to laugh at what they considered balconies and am a little perplexed as to why they went to all the expense/trouble to even build them as they are basically useless unless you want to open the doors and just stand out there, but considering the time of year we travelled (rainy season/100% humidity) it wasn\u2019t really conducive to stand out there anyway. The property is located out in the middle of nowhere which wouldn't have bothered me all that much except for the price of cab fare (which I thought was expensive) but since there were 4 of us, it was much easier to split cab than rely on the shuttle. As previously mentioned, cab fare into Playa was $200 pesos (or $20US) one way and we paid $170 pesos into Puerto Morelos. We found the prices on the property outrageous, so other than grabbing a six pack of beer the first nite ($138 pesos) we bought groceries and liquor at Wal-Mart on a regular basis which was considerably cheaper and worked well for us. I won\u2019t say anything further about the pool that hasn\u2019t already been covered in previous reviews. As other people have commented, the property is massive and we much prefer a smaller, more intimate resort where you can get to know the staff on a personal basis. Of course, this is just our preference and has nothing to do with the Mayan property. We went to the Mexican Fiesta they hold on Thursday evenings and thought it was fabulous. I believe we paid $1120 pesos for two of us which included a wonderful Mexican buffet, drinks (anything you wanted) and the show, which we thought was top notch. The staff we encountered were all wonderful and felt at times they went above and beyond to make our stay very comfortable. Kudos to all of you! We golfed the Mayan course and got a great deal which included green fees, clubs and cart for $650 pesos and as we paid with a credit card, it ended up being around $61 CAD each!

It is hurricane season down there and beware that they put these heavy black screens on all their windows. They will not take them down. They said they have them up from June thru November. It is not much fun to go to a tropical location and you try to look out your window and everything is obscured by black screens. If you are on an upper floor some light will come in during the day but on the bottom floors it looks like perpetual night. These screens are also very noisy when the wind starts blowing.

We could'nt stand to be in our room that much. The front desk staff is not helpful at all. The first night we were there and we wanted a new room, we called them 3 times and they did nothing. We had to walk all the way down to the lobby (which is a little bit of a walk) and only then did they do something. I booked this resort through RCI.

First off, we had guests so maybe we were more critical because we wanted them to have a great experience. The room was fine--spacious, clean, comfortable. The first three nights a maid came in and made up the sofa beds for our guests, turned down our master bed, straightened up the bathroom, and left Hershey's kisses on the beds. Same the second night. The next two nights she didn't show up at all. On the last night, she made up the sofa beds, left some kisses, and left. The pool is absolutely beautiful with swim-up bars and planned activities. It looks out on the beach/ocean. (Our room was in a building next to the lobby. Most often we took a shuttle to the pool. It is about a five-minute walk.) Don't plan on swimming in the ocean. The sand only goes out a few yards and then turns to rock. I have skinned hands and elbow to show for it. You can book ski-dos, parasailing, and sailboating. We didn't bother checking the costs. The food and drinks there are great although we are not picky eaters at all. Drinks during Happy Hour at the pool and beach are 2 for 1. Service was great. My only complaint about food and drink is that it is very expensive. Breakfast buffet was $22 each and Friday night steak and seafood buffet at Del Lago was $44 each. That's in dollars, not pesos. We're from Missouri and that is a lot of money for a meal. Another complaint is that all Mayan resorts are so far away from civilization and they don't offer free shuttle service. It was about 30 minutes to Playa del Carmen and 45 to Cancun. You can easily get a taxi but it will cost you about $50. We caught the local bus and it was very cheap but they stop anywhere along the road where people are waiting for a bus. It was standing room only for awhile.

You could easily enjoy time alone in the pool because of how wide spread the pool is, or indulge in the many swim up bars where most of the crowds are LOL! The restaurant are very good but kind of expensive. Like I said before the grounds are stunning, but also very large. The resort does offer golf carts that will take you around the resort to the pool, the lobby etc. but were young and enjoyed the walk most of the time! The beach is a little rocky but very beautiful! We were under the impression that the Mayan Palace is close to Cancun, its about a 30-40 minute taxi ride. A thing to remember is to barter with the taxi drivers, they do go down in price!! Playa del Carmen is a little closer to the resort, if your looking to try and save a little money the resort has shuttles that run into Playa del Carmen about 4 or 5 times a day and the price is only $4.00 per person. Which is cheaper than a taxi. The shuttle drops you off right in front of the Wal-Mart so if you need a few things you can pick it up there.

We were staying nearby at an adults only five star where we have stayed four times previously. We hired a private car to take us around for a few days to look at properties we might be interested in purchasing. Our driver mentioned that the Mayan Palace was owned by the Wyndham Hotel Corporation and that it was \u201cfractional ownership\u201d and not a time share, high end and that we may be interested. After expressing my trepidation about anything that smacks of time shares he assured us that this was different, very luxurious, etc. Our driver was referred to us by an employee of the hotel whom we trusted and I therefore agreed to a tour and was told it would take no longer than 90 minutes. We were given the tour and (I almost hate to admit this) liked the property and would have considered purchasing. We then had to endure four different salesmen for 2.5 hours before simply walking out. It is impossible to be a gentleman with these people. They are one step removed from the airport hawkers and Playa del Carmen merchants. They will simply not take no for an answer. They want you to spend anywhere from $40,000 to $240,000 immediately, that day for a unit with varying degrees of time purchased. They insist that you buy that day. They do not want you to leave nor will they give you any brochures, spread sheets, written numbers or information for comparison purposes. The sale must be made that day. They do not want you to compare or check their references nor will they give you any written material to do so. I think I may be like most people\u2026I like to consider major purchases and I don\u2019t even buy a car as an impulse purchase let alone locking myself in to a \u201cfractional ownership\u201d of a unit in Mexico for 50 years for $40,000 and up. We finally left with numerous sales people yapping at our heels. Upon reaching the driveway we ask for our driver. They said it would take a few moments and the sales people were still yapping at our heels. I told the concierge we were leaving now and that I would not listen to one more sales person for one more second and that we were walking back to our hotel (3 miles) and up the drive way we walked, past a construction site and a backhoe in the middle of the road, over limestone dust/rocks/debris with people in back of us hollering \u201cyou cannot walk on the driveway\u2026it is not allowed\u201d. I swear I would have walked the entire way had our driver not showed up much to the relief of my poor wife. In retrospect , I was naive and thought these type of sales tactics for time shares were long gone after the abuses of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. Apparently not in Mexico and, honestly, I should have known a fractional ownership is nothing more than a pseudonym for a time share. The association with Wyndham is what swayed me to enter into this semi-self inflicted torture of the psyche. Wyndham Management you should be ashamed for employing the type of tacky sales people you have working at this facility and employing these types of sales tactics. It is a disgusting to think that an American company would engage in these practices. I realize that the company is fighting for survival and your jobs are at stake, however, this reflects directly upon you, the management of Wyndham. You train these people and condone and instruct your staff in these high pressure, sleazy, tacky tactics. Is this why the Wyndham name is not on the Mayan Palace? Did you learn these tactics during your tenures at Cendant? You should be ashamed. I later learned that our highly recommended driver got paid $100.00 from Wyndham for referring and subjecting us to these masters of the disgusting sales arts. I fired him. I wonder how many others have fallen for his ruse. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not a rube nor did I just fall off the turnip truck and yet I fell for this scam. I offer my experience in the hope that you will avoid the Mayan Palace and our horrible experience. Personally, I will never frequent a Wyndham Hotel and I will urge my friends and associates to do the same. I would urge everyone considering the Mayan Palace or a Wyndham hotel to briefly look into their history; their somewhat checkered past and continually re-occurring capital, cash flow and management difficulties. Now I understand why they employ Mexican timeshare sales tactics as a standard practice. It would seem that they need the relatively substantial cash flow from time share sales to shore up other portions of the corporation and their lack of liquidity and declining stock value. It will be interesting to see how they fair with the deteriorating US economy, expected declines in vacations/time shares purchased and their inability to garner cash flow from their attempts at securitizing/monetizing timeshare mortgages. But then, most of the management is former Cendant people (yes, the mortgage company) therefore, I suppose you can not expect much more of them.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheyenne, WY", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this place\u201d", "Author": "Chisolm", "ReviewID": "UR20013254", "Content": "If you want to be awakened every morning by a phone call from a pushy timeshare salesperson, this is the place for you!

The resort has a shuttle to the Playa De Carmen Walmart (the most expensive Walmart I've ever shopped at) but they only run every couple of hours and end at 8:00 p.m. And the Walmart is a good 15 minute, not-so-safe walk to the beach.

We stayed in their studio room which is basically like a hotel room. We have done a lot of traveling and were blown away by this place - not only Riviera Maya itself but the Mayan Palace! The Mayan Palace is absolutely beautiful! The pools are endless, the beach is peaceful, and the restaurants have great food and GREAT service. The market/deli is convenient for snacks, drinks, and things you may have forgotten at home. The gifts they sell are also reasonably priced. Pros: - Great location! The Mayan Palace is right on the major highway that runs up and down the coast. If you are on a budget like we were, you just walk out to the highway, cross the road, wait 5 - 10 minutes and magically the \"Playa Express\" or \"Collectivo\" van will stop and for $1.50 per person (each way) you can get to Playa del Carmen for shopping, nightlife, tours, dinner, sandy beach, etc. You can also take this same taxi system to Cancun (although we did not do this). For comparison, a normal taxi from the hotel to Playa is ~ $20 each way, the shuttle from the hotel is $ 3.50 each way, or this one is $1.50 each way. It was safe, clean, and everyone was extremely nice and helpful. - Great snorkeling at the beach of the hotel! Although it's not a real reef (no coral - actually they made an artificial reef), there are tons of fish, small stingrays, urchins, etc. to see! - Happy Hours at the pool - 2 for 1 is great! - Pool is open 24 hours! - Free nightly entertainment at the Del Lago restaurant with FREE shows (except Thursday night Fiesta) Cons: - Water entry at the beach can be tricky because of rocks and spiny urchins. Definitely bring a pair of water shoes and you're set! - Beds were VERY hard/stiff. That was the only drawback of the rooms. We ate at the following restaurants: -Havana Moon (excellent service, excellent food, nice ocean views!) -Tramonto (excellent food, service). We were originally not going to eat here b/c we thought it would be too expensive. It has a range of options. You can get pasta for < $15 or a steak for > $ 40 so you can steer how high your bill will go. Food excellent, service, great, ambiance awesome! -Balche Pool Bar has great lunch, drinks, snacks at reasonable prices. -The deli in the market has great muffins/fruit for breakfast and great sandwiches for lunch as a money-saving alternative to the restaurants. We ate there a couple times. The snorkeling trip offered by the hotel is $46.00 per person and is well worth it. It has 3 stops (2 snorkel and 1 swimming/sandy beach). They also serve beer at the end and it's a lot of fun. Only down side is they pack the boat FULL. Playa del Carmen is a charming town. All of the restaurants we ate at were fantastic . We ate at two traditional Mexican ones on 5th avenue (Karen's and one other I can't recall the name of). We also ate at Alux which is actually in a cave with beautiful stalagtites and stalactites. This restaurant was a little pricy but worth it just for the ambiance! If you don't eat dinner there, stop by for some cocktails - it's truly a one of a kind experience! We did not take the tours offered through the Mayan Palace because we were on a budget. For a trip to Chichen Itza they charge anywhere from $85 - $125 per person depending on which tour you take. We were walking around Playa del Carmen one day and met a tour agent and got the SAME tour (Chichen Itza, lunch buffet, swimming in a blue cenote, and a stop in Validodad) for $45 per person! Our driver/tour guide was fantastic and we met great people from other resorts. If you are willing to shop around, you can find almost anything cheaper than what the hotel offers. The place we found this tour was a tiny tour stand just to the left of the ticket window where you buy the tickets for the ferry to Cozumel. I am sure they are there everyday...you can always say \"my friend recommended me\" and they should give you a deal? We also went to Tulum. Again, the hotel charges $60 something dollars per person to take you there. Tulum is VERY easy to get to and there are many signs throughout the ruins so a personal guide (in my opinion) is not necessary. From the hotel, we took the Playa Express to Playa del Carmen, then changed to the bus down to Tulum. One way it was like $13.00 for both of us to get there. On the way back, the bus was full and we figured out that there was a collectivo taxi that passes by Tulum and goes to Playa...so we took the collectivo to Playa and transferred to the Playa Express (or you can take a different Collectivo) back to our hotel. It's really really easy. Once you get to Tulum, the admission was something like $5.00 so you can do the whole excursion for under $25.00 for two people....can't beat that! We also ate lunch just outside the entrance to Tulum at one of the restaurants and it was the CHEAPEST meal we had at a sit-down restaurant all week so check that out! The highlight of our trip was swimming with the whale sharks. If you go between June and September, you MUST do this! You get to go out in the open ocean and swim with the largest fish in the sea! They are incredible. I booked ahead of time (space is very limited) through www.swimwithwhalesharks.com. I HIGHLY recommend this operation - they are fantastic. The tour is pricey ($195 per person) but includes snorkeling gear, swimming with the whale sharks, a second snorkel stop off Isla Mujeres, lunch, shrimp ceviche, beer, beverages, breakfast in the morning, etc. For $15 roundtrip, they will pick up/drop off to the Mayan Palace. Seeing so many whale sharks in one area (there were probably 100 our day) is REALLY REALLY rare - this is an experience not to be missed. Back to the hotel...we attended the Mexican Fiesta and LOVED it. It was our one expensive dinner but the food was great, show was great, open bar, and more. I am glad we did it. It was my boyfriend's birthday that night so it was a great way to celebrate. Tips: Be sure to request a room close to the pool so they don't stick you off in the middle of nowhere. We were in building 6 and it was great. When we arrived, I asked if they had a refrigerator we could have in our room and they did! So...if you want some cold waters, sodas, and beers in your room, ask if they can bring a fridge. The worst they can say is no. If you are in the 1 bedroom with a kitchen, you automatically have a fridge. We did take the timeshare tour. We did not buy a timeshare but enjoyed learning about the resort, the free breakfast buffet is awesome (normally ~$25.00 per person) and got 10% off our total Mayan Palace bill. So if you can spare a couple hours, it's worth doing, even for the discount. In addition, you get a slight discount on Mayan Palace tours (though they are still way more expensive than if you shop around). As far as souvenir shopping, we got the most bang for our buck at Chichen Itza (surprisingly). Playa del Carmen was astonishingly overpriced and hard to barter. Chichen Itza, very easy to barter and you can find nice gifts for not too much money. I wanted to buy a lot of silver jewelery and was surprised that it is actually really expensive. Round Mayan Calendar pendants sell from $40 - $100 just for the pendant. I was surprised. In Playa del Carmen, the easiest way to buy gifts if you want a good price and don't feel like bartering so much is to go to one of the several large stores where the prices are fixed. Overall, we had a fantastic time and would definitely recommend the Mayan Palace. If given the opportunity, we would definitely return there in an instant.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, but too big\u201d", "Author": "BeachE100", "ReviewID": "UR19540096", "Content": "My (wonderful) wife and I decided to stay at the Mayan Palace for our honeymoon. Honestly, there are very little regrets about the decision. I booked the reservation by trading on the RCI network. This property is an \"RCI Gold Resort\". I'll jump right into it and start with the \"BAD\" things, since that's what you want to see: The resort is big. In fact, it's simply too big. If you're at the back end of the resort, plan on over a mile walk to the pool. Their solution to this is golf cart-type trolleys that occasionally come to certain pick-up locations. Of course, we've waited over 30 mins at times. No one wants a trip to the pool to take 45 minutes - that's worse than my commute every day to work. To Also, they're expanding the resort to the north side, and it looks like there will be another huge pool there too, so maybe it will be better. The second issue is the location. The resort is in the middle of no-mans-land on Hwy 307. It's a 20 minute drive to Playa Del Carmen, and a 40 minute drive to Cancun. If you don't plan on leaving the resort, this won't be an issue. However, we are the adventurous type and wanted to snorkel, see the ruins, etc. We left the resort every day we were there, which required a lot of driving. Hey, at least gas is a little cheaper there. The third issue is the price. A can of beer is $5 USD. We got coffee for two one morning (not Starbucks, but something you'd find in your typical office) and the price was $9 USD plus a tip - Ouch! We avoided the restaurants as much as we could, although we ate at the Italian restaurant for our last night (reservations required) and the food quality was below average. For that meal, the price was about $100 USD. Avoid it! Fourth, they have limited parking and only 2 places to park, which means you will be doing a lot more walking if you have a car. Ok, now for the good stuff: You get huge clean rooms. The room we got (which I think is standard), was bigger than my first apartment. It had a small kitchenette, dining table, living room with 2 couches, end tables, TV, and private balcony. The bedroom had another TV and private balcony. The bathroom was pretty big too. Also, the entire suite was tile, which makes it look real nice and clean. Of the resorts I've been to, this one had some of the biggest rooms - Kudos! The pool is one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) in Latin America. It has multiple swim-up bars, volleyball, and tiered into 3 layers. Definitely very impressive. However, I don't think it gets deeper than about 4 feet, which may be to minimize accidents. The beach view was wonderful. There's a pier that extends out about 75 yards, and you can see an artificial reef they're trying to start. You can rent Jet Skiis (although the attendant didn't show up to work the day we wanted to do it), Scuba Dive, and Para-sail all from the hotel. The staff was very friendly. We met some great folks from the states as well as Europe while we were there. This resort is for everyone, from honeymooners (like us) to families. On a side note, If you're into Scuba, take a trip to Cozumel and don't waste your time on the main land. It's more expensive and less rewarding. Also, if you chose to dive a cenote (main land only), plan on paying a premium ($200+ for a 2 tank dive), and I wouldn't count on the guide knowing much more about caverns and caves than you (dangerous) and accidents happen frequently in these. 2-tank reef dives in Cozumel are $50-60 and it's a 30 minute ferry ride from Playa Del Carmen.

My mom arranged us thru RCI to stay at the Mayan one day after she came back from the Riviera Maya (arrived there a week before us). So we arrived at the hotel (as other travelers said its way too big, but first things first). The check in was ok, but after that the true mayan showed up, not a single bell boy came to us. So we had to manage to get to our room by our selves, we had to nearly-drive-out the Mayan to get to our parking lot driving thru a dirt road (two way but only one car can drive at the time) it's a dirt parking lot with no lights. Then we had to drag our baggage thru 4 buildings until we found our room (with the help of a map and some other people we crossed in the way), remember that no bell boy told us how to get there. A day before my mom called me and told me she left us some food she bought during her stay and asked us to grab a picture and a bathing suit she forgot there (same room as us) and when we searched all that stuff we found nothing, everything is gone, I asked the cleaning ladies and they told me that probably my mom got \"confused\" ... what?? they called my mom liar on my face!! We didn't want a drama for a pic, a bathing suit, some cookies, cereal, milk and some noodles... so we did nothing at this time. We left the room went to Playa del Carmen for the rest of the day and went back to the huge incredible pool at the Mayan (That I think this is the only good thing about this hotel), my wife and sister in law asked for some pool drinks but they got no drinks service at the pool so they had to walk to the nearest pool bar, the drinks tasted awful, where really expensive (paid about 10 bucks for eachs drink) and they where served on cheap plastic cups. After we got tired we wanted to get back to our room but we had to wait for about 30 minutes for the shuttle (golf cart) for this to happen (which always drive thru the Mayan Palace's own jungle and there's mosquitoes and a lot of other bugs everywhere. Ohh some other thing about the suttle, it's very confusing for every one. If you don't belive me be at 11pm at the lobby and there will be a lot of people asking which shuttle is going their way. The next day after getting an early morning shower I notice that 2 brand new T-shirts where missing from my luggage... guess what? THEY WHERE STOLEN, yes you red right the cleaning ladies stole 2 of my new T shirts, and also one T shirt from my sister in law's boyfriend, then we realized that they had stolen my moms bathing suit and all the food too!! I called the hotel operator to report this and guess what? nobody answered!! Obviously i did a report once we got to the lobby (again had to wait for 30 minutes for the hotel security supervisor to show up) they told me that they would start an investigation about it and that they would call me if they found something.... a month and week after and no one has called me from the hotel, not even to say they are sorry for the inconvenience.... Its a shame!! It is supposed to be a 5 star hotel, right? Now back to my city, my mom told me that she thinks that the cleaning ladies stole a blouse from her luggage too...

If you never leave the resort, you could get the same experience in the States, right down to the Spanish speaking help. Having said that, there is nothing inherently wrong with the Mayan Palace, and if you\u2019re a golfer, they have a pretty good course. It is a big place, with a great pool. Keep in mind it\u2019s a timeshare facility, but we did not take the \u201ctour\u201d and there was no pressure to do so. Our room was large, clean, serviced promptly, and had two TVs with cable. I think this is the rule rather than the exception. Regarding the beach: As others have said, once you enter the ocean there is a rocky bottom, but there\u2019s plenty of sand and lounge chairs looking out over the Caribbean. If you\u2019re going to be satisfied with staying on-site the whole time or if being at the beck and call of a shuttle time schedule doesn\u2019t bother you, you won\u2019t need a car. Cheapest full sized car from the Cancun airport will run about $200/week, but add another $500 for insurance and taxes. (Yes, another $500). At the Mayan there is no night-life, except eating in the restaurants or surfing the internet. Unless you confine your imbibing to their two-for-one happy hour (11:00 AM \u2013 1:00 PM) or their daily drink specials, drinks are $7.50 and beer is $4.20. The food is good, especially the pizzas which we ordered poolside. For a dinner for four with drinks for two, you will not get away from the table for less than $100. A week or so before you arrive call the hotel a few times and ask for a room in Building Nos. 1 \u2013 8 (with 1 \u2013 4 being the best). There are 22 buildings in a long row (check it out on Google earth), and the lower the building number, the closer you\u2019ll be to the beach and pool. Calling them ahead of time seems to help, although they will guarantee you nothing. There is a car park near Building 22 and near the lobby, which is between building 8 and 9. Playa del Carmen is a busy tourist town, and 5th Avenue is where it\u2019s at. High prices there, too, but the farther from 5th Avenue, the cheaper the food is - and we had no stomach ailments during the whole trip. For a more \u201cMexican\u201d experience, go north about 10 miles from the resort to Puerto Morelos - turn east at the light on the highway. This is a sleepy fishing village where you can get snorkeling tours for $25 to a very nice reef, or fishing trips for $200 for the whole boat. ATVs are available, too. Go to the blue kiosk on the east side of the town square to reserve. Good inexpensive restaurants on or near the town square \u2013 try the Oasiz (great grouper) or the Cactus (one block south of the square \u2013 good Argentinean beef). These places will cost about one-third of the Mayan and are much more authentic and interesting. We highly recommend a cenote swim \u2013 Dos Ojos is about 30 miles south of Playa del Carmen, and it is really a great place. We paid $30 to have a guide \u2013 and he showed us places you won\u2019t see if you just go in on your own. They have equipment that\u2019s included in the price, and the snorkel is fresh out of the bag and you get to keep it.

After listening to a 7-hour pressure sales pitch (forget the 90-minutes they say) about upgrading our timeshare to what turned out to just be a room/spa upgrade for us by the timeshare people (we found it was not what promised after we got home and tried to use the system-too late then to cancel), we stupidly caved (probably due to the intense humidity and heat, ignorance, and the belief that people are honest). Don't buy or upgrade this timeshare, only visit, and avoid the timeshare presentation as the benefits (free massage & some discounts) were not worth it compared to other timeshare presentation benefits we went to. We have been trying to get rid of this timeshare for years with no takers. The beach had large rock outcroppings all over the waterfront that really required water shoes for the ocean, and we couldn't even get in the water all week because of the strong rip currents. If you walk 15-20 minutes south on the beach, you come to a nice non-rocky beach. The resort activity beach shack misinformed us about a scuba trip we had signed up for and then said they would charge us if we cancelled the morning of after telling us when we signed up that we wouldn't be charged anything if we decided not to go. The room cleaners didn't replace the water in our room like other resorts do. The food was way overpriced, more than what we pay to go out to eat at nice restaurants where we live in the Southwest. The resort failed to tell us when getting a taxi that when taking taxis to Cancun (the resort is an hour away) that taxis coming back are more expensive. The weather was stormy half the time we were there. The Mexican Travel company there and concierge did not know enough details about the activities in the area. Because the resort is so large, there is a lot of walking since the rooms are not on the beach but back in the jungle (make sure to bring mosquito repellent). Also, we learned that the balcony doors lock automatically and cannot be opened from the outside if closed so if you are on the balcony, you can't get back in (we had to call for help to passersby and get a staff member with master keys to open our room door and let us in since we were on the third floor and could not climb down. The lounge/club was closed all week to what looked like renovations. Aside from the stress this caused us and a lack of relaxation/beach time, the entertainment was incredible at night in Del Lago (had a night like Cirque du Soleil) and a great band played 80s and 90s rock songs afterwards. The main pool is huge. We found that there was no enforcement to prevent Mayan Palace members from using the Grand Mayan pool area. The spa was very nice but should be open to everyone rather than just Grand Mayan owners for free (the workout gym was in the spa). The beach had plenty of chairs and bed-like areas. The food was better than Puerta Vallarta with more restaurants and choices but not great for vegetarians. The rooms in Mayan Palace are similar to Grand Mayan except GM has a balcony jacuzzi and whirlpool tub and upgraded furniture (we could care less about granite countertops verses laminate on vacation). The grounds staff don't speak English much so ask the concierge instead.

I had booked the hotel originally from Friday to Friday, but emailed back (several months in advance) and told them we would be arriving a day later and needed the reservation from Saturday to Saturday. When we got to the hotel, they said we were a day late and, despite the fact that this was their busiest check in period, there was no one in upper management available to assist us in correcting their mistake. They refused to change the dates despite my printed emails confirming our arrival (they even sent a shuttle to pick us up at the airport proving that they had received my emails!) Already frustrated and upset, we went to the room. Upon arriving at the room, we opened it with the card key and were shocked to find two teenagers in the room staring back at us, just as shocked as we were. Their parents came into the room through the adjacent door and we all came to the conclusion that we had been given the same room. I had been pleased to initially get a room in the low numbered buildings because they are close to the pool and restaurants, but when we had to schlep back to the desk we were given good news and bad news. We were being upgraded to the Grand Mayan (on the same grounds, but swankier rooms), but we were being put out in the Grand Mayan Jungle, far away from the pool and amenities.It required a tram to get to and from the pool and restaurants. Waiting for a tram in the heat and with the mosquitos at dusk was no fun. The room was gorgeous, bath products were generous 8 oz of Gilchrest shampoo. We had a jacuzzi and sitting area, flat screen tv, plus a balcony, but NO refrigerator to store water or drinks (and believe me a large bottle of water at the Mayan Palace costs $5). However, the maids take very good care of you, stopping in at night to see if you need anything and giving you Hershey kisses. It costs $8 to do a small load of laundry on your own, $11 to have a maid do it. What really irked me was the fact that they made you pay $10 an HOUR to access the internet and you had to travel all the way up to the internet cafe (a tram ride from the Grand Mayan Jungle) to do so. I have decided that if a place doesn't offer free internet service in your room, then you know they're nickle and diming you. The hotel is very isolated, making it difficult to take advantage of the restaurants in Playa Del Carmen unless you have a car. There are vans ($15 round trip) and taxis ($20 one way), but otherwise, you're a captive of the hotel and hotel prices (not cheap.) The beach is pretty, but you can't swim comfortably in the ocean because it is so rocky. (They are trying to do something about this, but still not quite there yet.) If you want to go into the water you should bring water shoes or go down to Playa Del Carmen for a day (be prepared, women are sometimes topless, usually older women, and it isn't all that pretty.) The staff was extremely nice and, for the most part, they were helpful. But one morning we needed the tram to catch a bus excursion we had booked leaving at 7 pm from the lobby area. We were told the trams begin at 6 am, supposedly running every ten minutes, but don't count on it- they have their own weird schedule. Just to be safe, we called up the concierge and ordered it twenty minutes in advance. It never arrived although we waited half an hour (not even the 'regular tram' went by). So we had to flag down a worker on a golf cart, who happily took us to the area where we caught our bus. I have to admit, you could hijack trams most of the time and get them to take you off their delegated stops when you told them that the regular tram hadn't been on schedule. The Havana restaurant had great food. The little beach snack restaurant had great mole chicken, but most of the overpriced drinks and restaurant fare was mediochre and we ate at every restaurant except the buffet on the beach. The grounds are beautiful, the pool lovely, but if you want shade (and believe me-in that heat you want shade) you have to pay $30 a day for a palapa. We never did get the extra night we had scheduled, because we decided to go up to Cancun for the night and enjoy those sights. Would I go back? I loved the staff workers (except for the flak from the reception desk) and the grounds were lovely. Even the patrons said good morning and good evening when you passed by each other. But I was tired of paying exhorbitant prices to buy water, food, laundry, internet and other amenities. No, I don't think I would stay there again.

However, the pool water became very hot and did not refresh you or cool you off when the temperature and humidity were 100%. The food wasn't that good - same old food every day -- boring choices -- and VERY EXPENSIVE! Drinks by the pool were OK but also very expensive and you had to start drinking at 11:00am because the 2 for 1 was from 11 - 1pm. Average drink $7-$8 (not pesos, dollars) and if your kids want soda, it's $3.00 a can (and is not included in the 2 for 1). Pool waiters were very friendly and accommodating and activities staff were also very friendly. If not for the pool, this place has nothing to do. You are stuck here to only give them your money (and remember that anything you eat or drink has a 15% gratuity added to it). And, plan on waiting around a bit to wait for their shuttle to the lobby, to the pool, to restaurants, etc. You are very secluded and isolated at this resort. You are 40-45 minutes from Cancun and 30 minutes from the town of Playa del Carmen. Being RCI 5 STAR GOLD CROWN members, this is the only resort they had available -- and we booked this January 08-- hint, hint, read the reviews and see why this is the only resort that is available! Hard to believe that this was the only resort available for the entire Cancun area. The Beach, very nice and beautiful to look at but unfortunatly you can't swim due to rocks... One last thing, be sure to keep all your receipts as everything is charged to your room. They do not accept cash until final checkout. They will try to take every penny from you and charge you for things that you did not charge -- they are good for that!

Most recently with my Sister, and my Mother for her 50th Birthday (July 10th - July 16th). Me, my Sister, and Mother just got back on July 16th and once again, I loved every minute of it. Yes, the Mayan Palace Resort is HUGE, but their are so many activities you can participate in, by yourself or with the wonderful activity crew... which do a great job at making everyone smile. And you just might make some new friends too. CHECK-IN: We have never had a problem checking in. We usually take the earliest flight so we can get to Cancun as early as we can. So we always arrive at the Resort hours before the 5p.m. check-in. When we arrive we immediately check in and if our room is not ready, we go hang out and swim by the pool or beach. I always, always, always ask for our room to be located as close to the pool as possible. And so far, we have never been any farther than building #7. Most recently was in building #3. If we would have been located past the lobby any of the times we vacationed here, I don't think I would have been too happy either. We are physically active so walking would not be a problem, and the walks are nice. However, when it's HOT out and all you want to do is swim and relax, walking a mile in the heat is not so much fun. But so far, I have been blessed not to have ever experienced this.... and hopefully never will! The timeshare reps will approach you and are very friendly. If you tell them no they kindly accept and will never ask again. I did not do the whole timeshare thing this time, and glad I didn't. It's not really worth the time or money AT ALL! In 2007 while vacationing with my Husband here, we had a guy named Ed. We kept telling him no, that we would not upgrade.... we just wanted our 10% discount. He was a blankity! Blank! Blank! Very, very, very rude! We did complain and nothing ever happened. I was hoping he'd get fired or whatever. He kept telling us his wife died a couple of years ago and he doesn't work in the timeshare sales because he needs the money.... he supposedly owned multiple car dealerships and sold them so now he's a millionaire!!! Ahahahahahahaaa! If he didn't need the money, then why was he so pushy and down right degrading? He was a huge jerk! ROOMS: We have stayed in the studio and the one bedroom suits. Both are very clean and my experience with the maid service was excellent. Their is a bit of a misty smell in the rooms, but nothing that bothered me one bit. Any hotel I've ever stayed at has it's own distinct scent. POOL: The pool is the best pool you will ever see! I love the pool. All of them. If you stay near the Balche Restaurant that's where most of the adult activities and games take place. They play lots of music, water polo, volleyball, drinking games, etc. And don't forget about the pools that trinkle down to the Grand Mayan Palace infinity pool. It's not as large as the main pool, but is very nice and over looks the lake. The pools are open 24/7! In the summer the water can be a bit too hot (I thought, but some others liked it). Usually I visit in the winter and the water feels great. BEACH: Honestly, the beach is not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. No, it s not as nice to swim in as the beaches in Playa Del Carmen or Cancun....... only because of the rocks. Due to the Hurricane that slammed Cancun in 2005, it has exposed the rocky landscape in the crystal clear waters. Do wear water shoes. I swam perfectly fine. I brought my snorkels with me and swam out past the rocks and waaa laaaa! Sandy, crystal clear waters and beautiful tropical fish. If you swim out to those dome-like structures you see in the water (warning: it does get deep), you'll see tons and tons of fish. And if you swim a little farther past the dome-structures, you'll reach perfectly beautiful waters. It is about 10-15 feet deep out where I was. I f you need to stand up you can stand on top of those dome structures. Sometimes the water can be a bit choppy so if you are not a good swimmer, it's best that you wear a floating device of some kind. If you do this, you'll be on your way to experience fantastic snorkeling. Kids were swimming/snorkeling as well as adults of all ages. Of coarse you'll want to supervise your kids when they do this, the water is choppy and gets deep. I snorkeled and swam out in the clear part for hours everyday and loved every second of it. Other than the jet ski's and boat riding back and forth to transport the people that were para-sailing. That was annoying... and I think that's what contributed to the choppy waters. But none the less, I loved it. The fish were as tropical and as beautiful as anywhere else I have traveled in the Caribbean (except for in Aruba!) RESTAURANTS: The restaurant we frequented most often was the Balche - located along the main pool. They had delicious food. We were always very satisfied. The prices are very reasonable. Havana Moon was an excellent place to go and have drinks at the bar and dance to what ever band was playing. Havana Moon is a fun, trendy, beautiful building. You must wear semi-casual clothing, but mostly men. No plain white, work t-shirts or cut off t's. I never ate there but will next time I visit. I was there in the evenings just to drink! Del Lago is a huge buffet style restaurant. I think every night they have a theme night and buffets. They are also open for breakfast too. Can be pricey..... but worth eating at if you're going to eat a lot! I've only ate there a few times. Tramonto's is an upscale, very nice restaurant. Never ate there, but did go to check out their prices. Not bad at all. I thought for it being an upscale restaurant it would be expensive, but it's not. Some meals were $10.00 -$30.00 and up, that I can remember looking at. You must dress up, again...... mainly men. Room service was our second most popular choice for food. We'd usually order room service while getting ready for what the night had to bring. Room service prices are also very reasonable and very, very tasty. Brio the health food bar is my absolute favorite!!! All natural and organic smoothies, juices, wraps, salads, and muffins! We usually went there every morning for our juices and brunch. DELICIOUS! It's located up where the gym and spa is. Also reasonably priced and no need to dress up. PLACES TO VISIT: Xel-Ha. I love this place. Xel-Ha's got restaurants, bathrooms w/showers, locker rooms, they supply the snorkel kits, inner tubes to float in the water, and amazing fish! By far one of my most favorite places to visit. You'll also see tons of Iguana's, and you can swim w/Dauphin's as well, extra charge. Tulum's beaches and Mayan Ruins. The beaches in Tulum are remarkable and one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I enjoyed the Mayan Ruin's, but my Husband however didn't really care. The beaches are worth seeing and swimming in, even if you don't care to see any ruins. And I'm a big history buff, so I enjoyed the whole package. Island Mejueres is a quaint, little Island off the coast of Cancun. The boat ride is approx. one hour. You can rent scooters, golf carts, bikes, or just simply walk on this tiny Island. There are several little shops and restaurants for you to enjoy. You can snorkel the calm, beautiful sea, and the beaches are very nice. So many adventures to take on this authentic little Island. The Carnival Cruise or in other words.... the Booze Cruise is a lot of fun! It's an all-inclusive package. The boat leaves from Cancun and takes you to Island Mejueres. You are welcomed by all the friendly locals and taken to the buffet. After they put on amazing dance shows and include the audience as well. Plus you can drink the entire time... to and from and on the Island. We had a lot of fun! Their are so many more places you can visit. I found beauty and adventure in everything we did. The buses are very safe, however will make most people feel very uncomfortable. I'm used to it... nothing to be afraid of. It's a bus with people in it. When you're on the bus and you're drop off destination is very close, you must stand up and walk to the front of the bus so the bus driver knows where you want let off. Other wise he'll drive right past where you want to go.... Yes you could say I know this from experience! Unless your final destination is the bus stop, well then...... Bus ride is $2.00 a person. Taxi's from the Mayan Palace to Playa Del Carmen were $20.00, for everyone, not per person. The vans can be cheaper, but I forget the price. A taxi to Cancun is about $35.00. If you're that high strung about how much money you're spending you can even bargain with the taxi drivers. It does work sometimes. Nite-life at the Mayan Palace is great except for the fact that all the bars close down at 11:30p.m. I think at least one place should stay open later than that. Which brings me to my next tip...... def go to the store on the resort, or into Playa Del Carmen to the MEGA or Wal-Mart and buy your snacks, beer, liquor, etc. At night when everything closed down we'd have our own alcohol to drink on the beach or along the pool. You will not get into trouble for this. We've been doing this since we've vacationed here every time. Their is construction going on but I not once heard any noise the whole time I was here. I love the Mayan Palace more and more each time I stay here. What ever floats your boat, right?

First of all, check in was in a tent. Very disappointing for my Mother's first impression of a million dollar luxury hotel. The parking lot was very far from our building. There were no lights at night or marked parking spaces. Several times we were blocked in. The parking lot was not paved- it was made of crushed stones and had many potholes- again very disappointing for such a high dollar place. The entrance/exit was one way so if you got half way down it and another car was coming you had to back up the entire distance. Very dangerous since it was unlit at night. The beach was the worst I have seen at a hotel. It was covered with small quarter sized spiny sea urchins. I saw several people fall down trying to wade out. You definitely need water shoes if you are brave enough to try it. The menu prices were very expensive- $13 for a single margarita! And no you don't even get to pick the liquor. The breakfast buffett was $20 per person. We paid $25 for a Pirates Night program for my son that was supposed to include food. He came back to the room hungry because they only gave him 2 slices of pizza. Shuttle service was poor. The were too few and they were always packed. There would be a mad rush to try and get on the shuttles and I thought a few times a fight might break out. Sometimes the shuttle drivers refused to stop even if you were at a marked stop. This made travel impossible with an elderly parent with bad knees. When the parking lot was full, 4 nights out of our 7 night stay. You were forced to use valet parking- it took over 40 minutes to get your car back the next day. Overall, we would never go back to this place.

The Grand Maya Palace is more exclusive. This is our 3rd stop in our 2-week Cancun/ Isla Mujeres/Riviera Maya visit. We rented a car to drive around and you needed one to stay at this place. Mayan Resort is huge, so much so it is a little overwhelming when we first arrived. We stayed at Building #21 (upon our request, the one closest to the parking lot). From our building to the lobby and the swim pool, however, you will need to take a tram. I actually like the tram. The wait can be a little long and crowded at times but it is fun. If you don't have car, you should definitely ask for buildings closer to the lobby. Without the tram, you can also walk inside the building corridor so it is not hot. With a property this big, the parking lot should be improved. The lot is not paved and small. The road is bumpy to the lot and good luck finding space when you arrive late. Be careful when backing out your car in the morning. Unlike other reviews, I found the room clean with a nice marble floor, granite countertop. We had a suite so it had a bedroom, kitchen, living room (2 sinks but only 1 bathroom). The sheets did have stains when we first checked in so we pulled it off for exchange the next day. You can fuse washer/dryer for $8/per load (include the detergent). It is a little pricey. With additional $3, you can have the maid to do the laundry and fold your clothing for you. That's a great deal. The store/market (Jade) has good selections. The sandwich/wrap/panini are reasonable price, $7 so as the breakfast pastry. Since we have car, we didn't eat at the property other than getting sandwiches. Lunch menu seems reasonable prices at the snack bar but dinner is a bit expensive. The ground is very well kept. There are always crews working. We had a tennis session there for $10 per session (not per hour). They can provide the balls and racket (sub-par quality though but didn't expect much). We attended a timeshare sales talk there. What a mistake it was, I had attended a few presentations but never had one this horrible. It was so bad I found it slightly amusing. The guy didn't talk to us at all during breakfast and briefly walked out from us. He lost his temper! I hope he changes profession for his own sake. What a dis-service to the property. I complained to the sales manager and property representitive. Oh, the swimming pool is not just big but huge. I have never seen a swimming pool this big, nice shape, a bit shallow but good. The staff led many activities. The kid's club is also around the pool. You can also play foosball and ping pong there. It is easy to go to tourist attractions from Riviera Maya. Tulum, Xelha, Xcaret, Playa del Carman, Puerto Moreles (north) are all on Rt 307 but you need a rental car. Watch out for the bumps in the highway (at least 5 to Playa del Carman for a 20-minute drive) and also beware of scams at gas station. Make sure the meter is reset to 0.00 and count your money. I got scam at PeMex #8120 (the first gas station on Rt 307 South from Mayan Palace). They told me I paid them 220 peso (but in fact I paid them 400 peso). I think I got scammed for not resetting the pump and pay them 200 extra peso. What a dishonest gas station. That is a rather unfortunate impression of my Mexico experience. Xelha is nice (the whole family likes it a lot). Xcaret is a little over rated. If you want to go to Tulum, go early in the morning (to avoid crowd and not as hot). BTW, it is free on Sunday. Get a copy of Frommer's Cancun day by day, I find it very useful. For grocery shopping, you can go to Mega or Walmart in Playa Del Carmen (Av 30). Ave 5 at Carman was very nice, many many restaurants and gift shops. Plaza La Fiesta has great selection but a little pricey. On our last day, on the way to the airport, we got pulled over by a police officer, who asked for money to make it \"cheaper\". I bargained with him to pay $20 from the $50 that he asked. A little scary but lucky we got off for so little money. Overall, we enjoyed the time in Riviera Maya and Mayan Palace despite the scam and corrupt polce.

This was our 6th stay at this Mayan Palace and it was as wonderful as always. My husband and I are timeshare owners at this resort. We took some friends (their 3rd trip with us) and our daughter and a friend. I will summarize the experience and will provide some property updates for those of you who are like me and are interested in the progress/changes made since your last trip. 1. We arrived Saturday afternoon. We rented a minivan in Cancun, but there was not enough room for all 8 of us, so we arranged in advance with the concierge for the Mayan Palace shuttle to meet my daughter and her friend at the airport. The shuttle was waiting at the airport upon our arrival. No trouble finding it in the mess of people outside the airport. The shuttle fee is free from the airport and $15 per person to return to the airport. 2. Check in was fine. Since we always take so many people with us, there are a lot of us crowded around the desk signing and getting our armbands, but it goes smoothly and there was only one other person in line in front of us. 3. We were in building 6. My daughter was in building 5 - just down the hall from us. The room was very clean and well stocked. Of course it is Mexico in July, so hello humidity. Not unusual and certainly nothing to complain about since we all know to expect it. 4. We stayed at the resort most of the time this trip--we were all tired and needed the relaxation. We used the car to go out most evenings for dinner and for a day trip to the Tulum beaches one day and to Akumal one evening for dinner. We always like the convenience of a car and usually explore more, but decided next time we may not even get one as we have explored a lot of the area over the years and the resort now has so many dining choices, we would certainly be happy eating there. Speaking of.... 5. We ate the the pool snack bar most days and found the food to be very good. The cheeseburger is wonderful and big enough for two. The Habanero Grill is located on the beach just beside the Havana Moon Restaurant. They have a buffet each night that consists of grilled barbeque ribs, chicken, steak, burgers, hotdogs, and wonderful, wonderful grouper. Also there is a salad bar, vegetables, rolls, and a large selection of desserts. The chairs are in the sand and it is very relaxing. The cost is $21 per person - all you can eat. The Havana Moon is a really pretty restaurant. We did not eat there for dinner but did eat breakfast several mornings. Most breakfast items were $6.50 and slightly higher and were delicious. For the first time ever, we had dinner at Tramonto one night. I had read mixed reviews and was always a little hesitant to pay higher prices for something that might disappoint - well, it did NOT disappoint. It was great. Between all of us we had the parmesan crusted grouper, ribeye, filet, bacon wrapped shrimp and the chicken parmesan. We all were very pleased. The prices ranges in the $20s for the entree. The steaks were the most expensive - around $26 to $28. Each entree is served with 2 side items. We will definitely eat there again. 6. Pool beds are now rented. We rented two on Sunday morning for Sunday and Monday. You can only rent for two days at a time. You must spend at least $30 at the pool restaurant and/or bar to get the beds free. The cost is deducted from your bill at checkout. This was done without difficulty. 7. I heard no construction noise during the week. I'm certain there was construction, but it sure didn't bother us. The area in front of the main building is where the construction efforts seem to be. I have included a photo of the progress. 8. Timeshare pitches: never bothered. 9.

However, the sheets and bedspreads smelled awful. The third night we were there they were changed and I had to call late at night to have them bring a new set, they smelled so bad. There was mold on one of the bedspreads and we had that replaced as well. Housekeeping did not do a very good job on a daily basis but it was still okay. Pool is awesome- great if you would like to sit at the pool all day everyday. We are more of beach people, and since we knew there was not great water access at the hotel we rented a car and beach hopped up and down the Rivera Maya. It was well worth the car rental and the research to find some great, quiet, beautiful beaches! Because we had the car, we did not eat at the hotel much. Had burgers at the pool one day - they were good. Shopped at Wal-Mart for liquor, water and snacks. Ate in Playa several nights - Los Tulipanas was our favorite! Had great food at Zamas in Tulum and found a great beach club on a beautiful streach of beach (Playa Maya) south of the Tulum Ruins where you can rent a palapa and hire a guide to take you out to the reef in the shadows of the Tulum Ruins for $20. Antonio was our guide and did a great job. We went to two different sites and spent about 2 hours snorkeling. The reef was in really great shape and we were able to see lots of different coral and colorful fish. We spent the afternoon in Tulum on our way back from Coba. Another must do if you are interested in the Mayan Ruins. Because it is not completely excavated, there is a real mystic and authenticity to the ruins in Coba. Rent a bike or tricyle taxi for the ride out to Nohoe Mul, the largest pyramid in southern Mexico. You will need all your energy to climb this one! Well worth the climb for the view that overlooks the jungle that surrounds Coba. Spent another day in Akumal. Beautiful area, great beach, where you can snorkel from the beach. We saw at least three large sea turtles while we were out. We rented a palapa at the Akumal Beach Club as soon as you enter the main gate off to the right. We ate at the Turtle Bay Cafe - great fish tacos!!! Spent a day in Puerto Morelos. Great, quiet fishing village. Looks like they are building a pier and upgrating their beach front. Looks like more development is one the way but right now its a great get away. You can snorkel here for $20 for two hours by hiring a guide at the \"co-op\" stand at the entrance of the pier. Ate at the Pelicanos Restaurant. Good food! There is also a great shopping area that is run by a \"co-op\" of families. Artisan square called Hunab-Ku, that sells all sorts of arts and craft made directly by the families and sold. It is about 1/2 a mile from the town square. Great crafts at a reasonable price. It was nice interacting with the artist there. Overall - the trip to Rivera Maya was great- but I can not say that the hotel had all that much to do with it. I probably would not go back- mainly because there are to many other places to stay that have much better beach access and that are not quite so large. The hotel was just okay.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWould not stay again!\u201d", "Author": "RalphGabby", "ReviewID": "UR17425535", "Content": "We stayed for 7 days.

After putting it off, and off, we finally booked in the month it expired, June 2008. While there, we did get hooked and are now timeshare owners ourselves of the Mayan Group. The Mayan Palace Riviera Maya Resort was very impressive. It was huge, and a fifteen minute walk to the pool and beach. We loved experiencing Cancun, Mexico at this resort. There were swimming pools everywhere; however, they were only 3 feet deep. I guess it is good for getting drunk and swimming at the same time. We took a cab into Playa del Carmen, 20 minutes South, and took the ferry out to Cozumel, which was one of the best parts of the trip. We snorkeled and used a day-pass at a competitor's for listeneing to their timeshare presentation. There are no courtesy shuttles into town, as we were previosuly told. It was also annoying having to wear a wrist band all week long, but there are so many resorts, I guess it is used to avoid resort hopping to all of the all-inclusive resorts. Watch out at the airport: They will bombard you with timeshare offers. We had not traveled in a while, so we were not prepared, and wound up going on two presentations, although the all-day passes were the best rewards. Also, avoid going out to Chicinetiza. It is a three hour drive out and a three hour drive back, on a two lane highway with a bus driver that passes on the wrong side of the road often. The roads are also very cut up. They do have bus accidents there a lot. We both got a mild case of Montazuma's Revenge (traveler's diarrhea), even though we drank bottled water every day, so watch out. It stayed with us for a week after we got back too. Our 7 day vacation to the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya in Cancun was one to be remembered.

We were at the Mayan Palace from June 13 to June 20. We had 4.5 sunny days, 2.5 cloudy days, but only a very few scattered sprinkles lasting a few minutes. Very lucky for this time of year I gather. But it sure was hot (94\u00ba F) with high humidity .. pretty uncomfortable mid-day if the wind wasn\u2019t blowing. Restaurants: We had dinner at the outdoor barbeque, Havana Moon, Del Lago, Balche\u2019 and Tramonto. We found all the food to be good but not great with Tramonto by far the best. The prices were reasonable. Pool/Beach: The pool area was nice but we strongly preferred the beach, unlike most everyone else. We never bothered to reserve the palapas at the pool since the covered structures were available at the beach free if you got there by 11:00 am. And the beach had the ocean breezes to keep us cool. There is a very nice sandy beach but the ocean itself is all rocks that are either fist size loose rocks or solid smooth coral with unexpected holes. Wear water shoes and watch carefully where you step. But the pool water was too warm (88\u00ba) and the ocean was more refreshingly comfortable. Happy hours: Two for one at the pool from 11:00 am until 1:00, later in the afternoon at the 19\u2019th hole and early evening at the Wine bar. Many pesos spent on the Pina Coladas. Entertainment: Carribean Night at the Del Lago was just dancing in colorful outfits. Mildly entertaining but free. Poolside entertainment was conducted by the staff was actually pretty good and funny but got to be very repetitious by the end. Karoke night was fun. The dinner music at Balche\u2019 and Havana Moon was different every time we saw it and always very good. Mexican Fiesta night at Del Lago had its ups and downs. Partly dancing in costumes again and partly a continuation of the poolside staff antics (same jokes over and over again) but some of the other entertainers were much better. Transportation: The shuttle to and from the airport was very affordable and very well organized by the resort. The 20 peso shuttle to Playa Del Carmen was not good. We waited in the heat of the afternoon for 30 minutes, got into a shuttle we assumed was the correct one but not one person spoke any english. There were frequent stops and we had absolutely no idea where to get off and it was a bit nerve wracking although it out worked out fine. Whew. Be aware there is topless sunbathing at the Playa Del Carmen beach which I enjoyed and happy hours until 5:00. We stopped at Walmart to buy breakfast and lunch food but again no one spoke English. We had a tough time at the deli and bought \u201cchocolate\u201d coffee which we threw out. The $20 US taxi ride back was much better. The Mexican Police are waiting everywhere to find the slightest infraction. One couple rented a car and got pulled over but never did find out why. They had to go the Cancun and pay a $100 US fine to get the drivers license back. There are very odd large speed bumps for no apparent reason scattered everywhere even on the main roads (even route 307) Tours: We hear that the best snorkeling is in Cozumel. The on-site boats have a shorter cheaper version that we did. We saw lots of fish but they were mostly the same five or so species. The one and only alcoholic choice at the open bar on the boat was Pacifico beer. We knew it was a scaled down version of snorkeling but it was lots of fun none the less. Now the (very expensive) Lobster dinner cruise was absolutely the highlight of the vacation. We lucked out with a bit cooler weather on a cloudy day that made for a fantastic sunset from a lagoon looking at Cancun (see pictures). The mixed drinks were absolutely horrible (we switched to wine) but the meal (although overcooked) was very tasty and in generous portions. We met lots of great people which made it fun. Accommodations: We were in building 18 which we didn\u2019t mind one bit (away from the noise of construction). There were frequent shuttles but we often preferred the nice walk along the beautifully landscaped walkways (except in the mid-day heat). We were on the ground floor which was not what we would have preferred. Not as much privacy from the walkways outside our window and just a few bugs that might not be as plentiful on the upper floors. The firm beds matched our preference and the air conditioning sucked the humidity out of the air so nothing was damp, musty, moldy, smelly or anything else as others have indicated. But there is no carpeting so our extremely noisy upstairs neighbors scraped their chairs across the floor making a horrible racket on a regular basis. We are a pretty laid back \u201cgo-with-the-flow\u201d kind of couple so I must say that anything I wrote that is negative is a very minor item (except that shuttle ride to Playa Del Carmen) and should be understood in that context. This is a truly fantastic resort and we had an incredible vacation. And I should also add that we kept every receipt and checked our bill at checkout and it was perfect.", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth", "Title": "\u201cgreat experience at the Grand Mayan\u201d", "Author": "acpent", "ReviewID": "UR17092734", "Content": "After reading several varying reviews about vacationing at the Grand Mayan, we were very interested to see what would be waiting for us upon arrival. First off, avoid the nicely dressed sales associates at the Cancun Airport. They were only trying to sell us packages that could easily be arranged through the resort. They grabbed us promising to \"help\" just as we were about to the door to meet our GM shuttle. The shuttle from the airport to the resort is free and needs to be arranged ahead of time with the concierge, but it will cost about $15 per person on the way back. * many reviews said rent a car and others said avoid if possible. If you are the type of traveler that wants to venture out to mingle with the locals then rent a car. If your style is more like ours and the pool every day is satisfactory, then I would suggest passing on the car rental. A cab into Playa is about $20. We also took the \"Shuttle\" or bus into Playa for about $2.50 per person. This was slow and a bit of a guessing game on where to get off, but it was economical and we weren't in a hurry. Upon arriving we learned there is a Grand Mayan and a Mayan Palace, but I didn't really discover much difference. Our room was in building #12 of the Mayan Palace. It was a master suite: clean, up-to-date, and convenient to the front of the resort/shuttle station. We were about a 10 minute walk from the pool, which wasn't as bad as some reviews mentioned. The Grand Mayan rooms were supposedly nicer and newer than the Mayan, but the only couple we met from the Grand Mayan complained of mosquitoes all over there room. major bummer. We highly recommend taking advantage of \"dos paro uno\" at the lovely pool. Service is great, but be warned if you order two drinks thinking \"buy one get one free\" they will bring you four during the 11am-1pm happy hour. This made for a fun lesson to learn. We loved the pool and the pool snack bar. The burgers and nachos are great and definitely for 2 people. They are about $10, but worth it if shared. We loved eating at Tramonto Wine Bar. The food was the best out of all the restaurants. It seems more expensive than the other restaurants, but the quality of food and great portions make it very worth while. We ate a lot of pizza from Havana Moon, and I heard room service was very good too. We met a couple that said it was okay to drink the water in the rooms, and they were fine on each trip for the last four years...we weren't brave enough. I highly recommend a trip into Mega Mart to buy a few big jugs of water. The water and snacks are cheap in town. The boutique was very convenient and had pretty good variety. However, it was definitely 10-20% higher than the mega mart. we were told to avoid the timeshare people at all costs...we had big plans to avoid them until they told us 10% off our total room charges and $100 room credit was in store on top of the free breakfast buffet... we caved and scheduled an appointment. Our plan was to act disinterested the whole time. Our gal was okay with this and put up with our disinterest. Warning- the deals are very impressive, and it is hard to say no no no. However, we were doing fine until the last round. We had to have a final \"check-out\" with the finance guy. He was so rude and completely distasteful in his interview with us. I would have given the experience three or four stars until meeting with him. my advice, take the tour, free breakfast, and room discount but know in advance what you're signing up for. All in all, it was a nice vacation. We brought board games to play in our room at night, and we didn't get too sun burned. I would definitely go back. The pool is amazing. Also, we never rented the palapa, but they looked wonderful. We never had trouble finding 4 chairs next to one another. The travelers who wrote reviews about reserving chairs at 6am must have been either crazy or traveling when the resort was much busier. we enjoyed sleeping in and drinking Miami Vice's for brunch.

It is more convenient to rent a car as the resort is fairly isolated- downtown Cancun is about 40 minutes away, the hotel zone is 30 minutes away. Don't believe all the negative reviews on here about this place. Here are our tips: - Do try to request a room in a lower numbered building. We had small children so they were willing to accommodate us. - The food on site is good, but can get old after a few days. Visit the Mega or Wal Mart in Playa del Carmen for breakfast/lunch foods, snacks and water. - No one in our party ever got sick after eating any of the food. - If you have 4 (yes, 4) hrs to spare one morning, attend the sales presentation.

Playa was great, went to Kool beach club, $7us for a chair, brought my own beer. Blue parrott club has a great fire show on the beach @ 11:30pm, Alux is a resteraunt in a cave, mix between Flintstones and a James Bond movie,very cool. 10 min. taxi ride from playa. must see. Bargain hard with stores on 5th Ave. start off at 1/2 quoted price. very nice cafes along 5th ave. Locals are great, truly friendly people. Decent ruins at Tulum, but one of the highlights of the trip was just south of ruins. Amazing how all the tour people just shoot in and out of the ruins when if you walk 15 mins. south of ruins (as soon as you exit ruins dirt road to left) will bring you to numerous cabana hotels, El Paraiso beach club was one of the nicest, coolest places on earth. Beach, bartenders etc. first class. DO NOT MISS! John Gray's place is a wonderful resteraunt in Puerto Morelos, sleepy fishing village, a few bars, very mellow town, good for a night off. When travelling throughout Riviera Maya use the collectivo, catch it right on the highway, anywhere on the highway, and it costs $2us to Playa, taxi will cost $20us. At Mayan Palace grab a taxi from reception to front gate, $2-3us. Great way to meet the locals and really get a feel for the place.

True the resort is on a rocky beach but the pool was so big and inviting, we never missed going into the ocean. The restaurants were all great, Havanna Moon was great, try to sit outside overlooking the water. Tramonto was an excellent Italian restaurant and a very romantic atmosphere, (you do need a reservation and men have to wear slacks) Del Lago a must for the breakfast brunch (best I have ever been too). The staff was wonderful, friendly and always willing to help. Property was extremely manicured and landscaped just beautifully. If you want to be by the pool, buildings 1 - 5 would be your best bet.

Rooms: We were in building 2 which is close to the pool/restaurants. It was a great location, and the rooms were nice. We were in a master suite, and except for two power outages (one in the middle of the night) all applicances worked well. This location was very convenient to be able to go back and forth from the pool without having to pack all necessary essentials. I can see how it would be an issue though if you were in buildings 9-20. This could be a very long walk and would take some of the fun out of the relaxation portion of a vacation. Pool/Beach The ocean is very rocky, and looks like it would be virtually impossible to swim in. Their is however a very nice white sand beach area with cabanas and hammocks which are very comfortable. The pool is awesome. Must be at least 2 acres of water surface. BE SURE to rent a covered cabana EARLY in the morning, and you quite possibly will have to rent it a day ahead of time. As a lot of people obviously found out earlier in the week, It makes all the difference in your comfort level during direct sunlight with 95 degree/100% humidity. There are two swim up bars, and bathrooms are located nearby. No complaints about the pool. Gym/Spa Awesome work out area with views of the ocean. Lots of cardio/weights available. I like to run outside, and you can easily get 3 miles in without having to double back. The gyms gets fairly crowed around 9:30am, so go early if you can. Skip the $80 massage, heard it wasn't worth it. Restaurants/Bars We mainly ate at the restaurant by the pool (It is called Balche during the day, and changes to a full menu at night.). The menu has many choices, and the food was good. This is the least expensive restaurant in the facility, and dinner/drinks averaged $25/person. Our travel partners were not fond of Havana Moon, and they also didn't care for the Room Service omelets. There is a very nice Italian restaurant called Tramonte, but I didn't travel to Mexico to eat Italian, so we didn't even consider it. The swim up bars at the pool are good, and there are always waiters walking around to take drink orders. The drinks are fine, but all have tip included, and beer is $4-$5 and mixed drinks are at least $6. We went to the Super Walmart in Playa Del Carmen the second day and loaded up on food/drinks. There was a small fridge in our room, so we could store the cold items. There were no problems bringing chips/salsa and beer in a cooler to the pool. I even saw some people mixing their own drinks without any problems. This will save you quite a bit of money during the week. Service/Staff Very courteous from the time we checked in until we left. Rooms were cleaned well and staff was friendly. They must have a landscaping crew of a thousand, because there were always guys working from dawn till dusk. Suggestions: 1. Request a room in buildings 1-4 2. Rent a cabana everyday if you can 3. Go to the Super Walmart in Playa Del Carmen and load up. The grocerys were cheap and there was a huge selection. 4. Wear sunscreen. I grew up on the gulf coast, and even I could not believe how hot it was. 5. Don't take the Chichen Itza or Glass Bottom boat snorkel adventures. 5. Take the catarmaran or any thing other than above mentioned. 6. Don't wait on resort bus. A taxi is only 20 bucks to Playa and well worth the money to be dropped off exactly where you want to be. 7. Be prepared to wait in the Customs line at the Cancun airport for at least 2 hours. This is the norm. 8. 5th Street in Playa is where all the shopping is located. It's a fun place to walk around, but lots of tourists. Final advice: If you haven't yet booked a trip, I would suggest looking at other resorts.

We were in building 17 and chose to walk rather than wait on the golf cart trolley. Once you got in your room, it was too much trouble to venture back out. There was really no common area to meet people in the evening other than the fancy wine bar. The beach was unuseable. It was very rocky and unsafe to wade out in. The pool was huge, but we are not pool people. The food was too expensive for the quality. The beer and drinks were also expensive. ($3.70 u.s for a beer). We went to Playa del Carmen and bought groceries at the Mega where the hotel shuttle drops off guests. The time share presentation was too long and fishy. They started out at $149 grand for a time share, went to $79 grand, then $49 grand. By the end of three hours they were at $7900 for 75 weeks of use. I walked around and noticed that everyone was getting different figures written down. I think its a scam. They got really agressive sending in at least four \"supervisors\" to talk to us. Then they got kind of pissy when we firmly said no. For our time, we got a free tour of chichen itza, 10% off charges to room. When we checked out they did not give us the 10% off claiming it was an either/or deal. I got a pair of gold ear rings stolen from the room. My fault, should have put them in the safe. In sum- the resort is good if you like the largeness and personality of Disney and like to hang out all day at the pool.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cStay at the Gran Mayan if you want 5 Star accomodations\u201d", "Author": "charterfinancialcpa", "ReviewID": "UR15825827", "Content": "We stayed at the Maya Palace for 7 days, April 25th to May 3rd, 2008. Since I believe in FULL DISCLOSURE in my accounting practice, I recommend that you book the Gran Maya first before booking at the Maya Palace. The Gran Maya's rooms are 5 star; with large condo units and balconies; and less than 5 year old furniture. The Maya Palace is really a glorified Holiday Inn (3 star accomodations at best) with minimal quality furniture. Both resorts share the same pools and restaurants and golf and onsite services. No difference, except that if you are expecting first class accomodations, go to the Gran Maya. We stayed at the Maya Palace, Building 8. Buildings 5 to 8 are the least noisy. The other 17 buildings at the Maya Palace are either bothered by the trolly transportation noise (traveling past the rooms within 10 feet of the balconies) or the steele construction being erected near Building 1 to 4. Contrary to a previous review, construction continues....which REALLY upsets vacationers, since most vacationers want peace and quiet. If you are stuck with reservations at the Maya Palace, DEMAND at your check-in that you get into buildings 5 to 8, otherwise you will regret your week's accomodations. In contrasts, the 8 Gran Maya buildings are all pretty quiet, with lovely exterior settings of grass lawns and trees. Any of these buildings would be quality locations. Arriving prior to the Check-in at 5pm will be a problem. But the Front Desk will give you a Luncheon Chit showing a 25% Discount at the Havana Moon Cafe. Reasonable prices, but don't believe in the 25% discount. This restaurant will charge you 25% taxes and surcharges, which will nullify whatever discount you might be entitled to. EVERYTHING which you order (restaurant, drinks, kid's arcane, golf) will have a 12% to 15% Tip posted to each receipt. And these guys continue to ask for another Tip. DON'T be adding more tips to their service. AND each restaurant will ALSO add another 12% to 15% Governmental Tax (on top of the bill + imposed tip). So after enjoying a marginally prepared and $40 entrie, with service which is also marginal.......your bill will be increased another 30% without any disclosure. REMEMBER, the Resort makes the Tip Monies. NONE of the servers get any of the tips. Most servers earn $10 daily, cash. No one every pays income taxes. Businesses only pay income taxes at 1% of their first $1 million declared income. So the extra Tips, and the bogus Governmental Taxes .....all go to the Resort. Speaking some Spanish, and having traveled to Mexico since 1992, we learned a long time ago to CROSS OUT the 15% imposed Governmental Tax, at the bottom of each meal or drink invoice......and once you sign your invoice (which is always charged to your room), make sure that you keep your receipt. When checking out, if you have your receipts, you can confirm that you did NOT authorize the imposition of this Governmental Tax. Some of our friends paid $1,000 in food bills over a 7 day period. These imposed taxes would have increased their food bills by $150. But NONE of them paid these taxes, because we all crossed off these imposed taxes. When CHECKING OUT.....there were MANY false charges added to our bills. We contested these charges, requesting copies of our signed bills.......and found that at least $50 were charged to our rooms at the pool. If the bills are NOT personally signed for, DON'T be conned into paying these bogus bills. The Laundry cost $4 per load to wash and $4 per load to dry. And the load are about one-third your normal load size. The interior transportation trollies run every 10 minutes from the Lobby, and are always prompt....so the complaints of waliking from Building 21 to the Lobby at Building 8 can be resolved Maya Palace is located 20 miles north of Playa Del Carmen; and 35 miles south of Cancun. Best to rent a car because the Resort transportation is not easily accessible. You cannot count on the Highway Buses; and no one will ever hitch hike around there. If you want to waste a lot of time, then book the Resort buses. DON'T rent from THRIFTY RENTAL. These guys are THIEFS. We had previously purchased Car Insurance through Thrifty. The Cancun office wouldn't accept this insurance. They claimed that any dents, accidents, etc. would ONLY be insuring US, not them. So they charged our credit card with a $2,000 deposit. Of course, their insurance (for total waiver coverage) was $25 daily. In our 30 minute visit at the Thrifty Rental Office, at least 15 other couples ran into the SAME misrepresentation. So, if you decline their $25/day insurance, be prepared to get your credit card charged by $2,000 deposit. DON'T rent any compacts, since most of these compact cars at the rental companies are rented the most. Our compact car had 51,000 miles on it, was dented on all 4 doors, in poor shape, and these thiefs claimed that their other compact cars had engine troubles. And our Compact Car was only 2 years old. Since Thrifty is located close to the airport, these THIEFS will also charge a 25% airport surcharge tax, no matter what car you rent. Of course, these thiefs don't disclose this little tax when booking your car......which can add an additional $75 to your 7 day rental. We stayed at the Oasis Cancun, which is a 4 star Resort in Cancun after the Maya Palace. These 3 days cost $100 per nite, \"all inclusive\" (all meals and drinks). Oasis has 5 resorts in Cancun, all of which are \"all inclusive\". The Maya Palace is a REAL \"rip off\" since their meals range from $12 (breakfast) to $17 (lunch) to $40 (dinner). Their wine prices range from $40 to $1,100 per bottle. You will pay $7 per drink around the pool, for water-downed drinks. If you can locate an All Inclusive Resort, we recommend that you go there first. AND the Timeshare Sharks......everyone tries to enlist you. Believe me, you just have to be persistent and say NO. They are offering you a 10% discount (which is non-existant since they will always charge you another 15% in Governmental Taxes on everything), and $100 credit to your end bill. This is NOT a bargain. Travel to Mazatlan, and the Timeshare Sharks offer $300 cash + 2 to 4 sets of tickets to the Fiesta. But Cancun has so many sucker Americans and Canadians, I guess the Maya Sharks think that they can land anything that moves. If you want to buy a timeshare.....check out the internet. The Maya Palace trading power is Minimal. And you can buy Internet Preowned Timeshares Units for $1,200 to $4,000 per week. Don't consider paying $15,000 to $25,000 for any weeks at the Maya.......such a rip-off.

Two pool bars. Activities if you are so inclined, poolside child care, plenty of chairs. The only suggestion I have is with the palapa rentals (thatched covering with a big bed). You have to show up at the pool by 7:15 a.m. to make your reservations. They should have a number dispenser like they do at a deli counter. Boy, were the tourists vicious when it came to their place in line!!! Mellow out...you are on vacation. The beach is nice to lounge on (chairs and hammocks) but it is tough getting into the water. Water shoes are necessary and even with that it is not easy. Did see some people snorkeling out there . Spa beautiful and massage great. Gym very nice also with alot of equipment. They have taxis right at the resort if you want to go to Tulum (about an hr. away) or Playa del Carmen. They have a travel desk where you can book excursions also. The resort has about 20 buildings but we never felt crowded. The place is buzzing with activity if you don't mind that. You do have to take the tram to the restaurants/pool but never waited for more than 15 minutes. The staff is very accomodating and friendly and really go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.

We had no \"buyers remorse\" in fact we signed up for another bedroom thinking that our kids would enjoy bringing friends over the next few years. The resort is beautiful and well kept. The service is very nice and you can always find help that speaks english very well. We rented a small car from Budget and visited Playa several times and Puerto Morales, a beaufiful fishing village with very nice inexpensive snorkeling. (2 hours $25 for adults, 20 for kids) and some cool dining places. John's Kitchen and his mother in laws place right on the beach. Food on the premises is really very good. We dined on the beach and had an all you can eat buffet of steak, chicken, fish and ribs for $21 adults and half price for kids. Most meals cost about $50-60 for the four of us. We visited Walmart and stocked up on breakfast and lunch items, but I think the grocery is more than sufficient and the prices are fair. We stayed at the Marriott in Cancun and loved it...but the prices were sky high for just about everything. The breakfast buffet at Mayan is lovely and there are free shows every night for some light entertainment. Check out the photogrpaher on premises...they will do a 30 minute shoot and you only buy if you like the pictures. We got some great ones! Since we are owners, they try to put you closer to pool so we couldn't complain about walking to pool, but we parked our car in the lot which was at the furthest point of the resort....big deal...you had to walk five minutes to lobby and take a shuttle.

My recommendations: 1. rent a car. We drove to seveal places and were very glad to have had the flexible transportion 2. Eat at Havanna Moon 3. Take 1-2 days and go to Chitchen itza or other Mayan ruins (I recommend Ek Balam as well) 4. If you have kids, see if they would like to do either pirate night, or 'camping on the beach' night from 5:30pm-10pm. Our kids loved it, and the staff was very attentive 5. Take the snorkle trip with the Mayan staff ($46 per adult; Kids 1/2 price). easy leaving from the beach, and really fun. 6. Bring LOTS of sunscreen. It costs about double (in every store I checked, including typical supermarkets) compared to US 7. Bring water shoes, Tiva's, or Keen's - as they are very useful for checking out the beach area.

The fridge is tiny, 2 low wattage burners on the stove, microwave, toaster, blender and coffee maker. No coffee or salt and pepper was provided which we thought was a bit cheap.

You could go to Playa Del Carmen and buy at Walmart, but plan on adding $40.00 us to the cost for the shuttle or taxi ride.

The service is wonderful, the walkways, rooms, restrooms, and restaurants immaculate, the people that work HARD very attentive and smiling. Check in right to leaving-we felt well taken care of, safe, and all our major concerns were taken care of. It is cash free so you have to get used to splitting bills at the end, but everyone is friendly and willing to help. The time share presentation we did was the only downfall, very pushy and rude, but the breakfast was nice and they certainly have a lovely resort to show. A bit of construction but well hidden and the service and beatiful grounds more than made up for it. If you like to be ennamoured in a resort and just want to do a bit of sight seeing, its all here. We recommend the snorkeling trip from the resort. Lots of fun and some local flavor, including soccer on a private beach!!

There were 5 of us and I am pretty sure we all had the time of our lives. We stayed a week March 8th-15th and it was the most amazing week ever! The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. Our room was very neat and clean 2 couches in the living room with a TV, a decent size kitchen table and a smaller kitchen area, but it did include a stove top, toaster, blender, and a medium sized fridge. All silver wear glasses and cutting knives were also included. The bed room was very spacious with plenty of room to put all your clothes and included a closet. The bath room set up was sort of awkward as it exited to both the kitchen and bedroom. I did not notice any musty smells what so ever during the week nor did I notice noise from neighboring rooms. The room service was excellent. Every time we left our room we always came back to a neat and clean one, and believe me with 5 college kids sharing one room they had there work cut out for them, not to mention the Hershey's Kisses they left on the bed for us every day, that was a plus! The one thing that blew me away more than anything about the Mayan Place was the pool. It was enormous, it was so clean and relaxing, plenty of lounge chairs available and tables. There are 2 pool bars in the pool which had amazing drinks, happy hour is from 11am-1pm so take full advantage! You could also order sandwiches and salads from the pool bar as well and have it served to you which I thought was convenient. All you have to do is grab one of the waiters who are constantly walking by to take orders. Ok, so the pool was amazing lets talk about the beach. The beach itself was nice a lot of lounge chairs set up in the sand and plenty of hammocks to lounge in. The water however was very difficult to get into. There is very rough rocks and coral on the bottom which make it painful to walk on. I went in twice with bare feet and don't recommend it unless you have some sort of water shoes or sandals on. The restaurants were very reasonably priced and had very good food. However, Havana Moon which is located towards the beach had live bands and dancing but I did not care for it. It was little more expensive and had smaller portions than other restaurants we ate at. Although, my friend got a shrimp salad and she liked it and it wasn't all that small..just don't get the chicken if you go! I recommend the restaurant by the pool. it was very good and you got a lot for what you paid for. And if you looking forward to ordering food to your room all they deliver is pizza which was kind of disappointing, but it came with in 15 minutes of ordering! When ever you want to go into the city you have to book a shuttle a day in advance. The ride isn't as long as people make it seem to be to Playa del Carmen. The shuttle there takes you to the Mega Mart which is like a Walmart type store, thats where we brought all our grocery's for the week, not expensive at all. You can book many different types of activities through the resort. My friends and I did a lot of them. The one we enjoyed the most was the trip to Tulum. MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS!! It was worth every single cent. It's a 2 hour catamaran sail down the coast to Tulum, You snorkel off the coast in the reefs and they serve you a full lunch buffet which was very good. You spend time at the beach there and then get a guided tour through the ruins. Its a full day but its worth it. STAY AWAY FROM THE JUNGLE TOUR!!! This was horrible and very misleading, we were spoused to be on jet skies touring the jungle, instead we were put on little motor boats with steering wheels through shrubs. The employees there were very demanding for tips when we returned and were very annoying! Overall we had an amazing stay and a very good time.

The hotel was immaculate and the service by all staff was faultless. The only down side was that the hotel was about 30 minutes from Playa del Carmen and 50 mins from Cancun and the shuttle bus had to be booked both ways so if you wanted to go back early or stay on you were tied to the time, Also the only Supermarket was in Playa del Carmen and the shop on site was slightly expensive but that was a very small critisism for an absolutely luxurious holiday.

We arrived on a Fri and our confirmed room had been mistakenly given to someone with a similar name and we ended up in building 19, far from everything. We did ask to have it changed and after lots of attempts the next day we were moved to building 10 which is where the lobby is located so was convenient to the pool and for trips. The shuttles ran very frequently and weren't a problem to wait for, never more than 5 or 10 minutes. The walks weren't bad either but our daughter freaked out about the iguanas and refused to walk anywhere so we used the shuttle often. The pool is awesome, the ocean is rocky but we walked to the right about 30 minutes and had a lot of fun swimming in the ocean. The activities were fun, especially for kids. They do crafts daily, we made lots of bead activities. The schedule is by the activities center. Our son even went on a crocodile tour by the golf course. They play bingo and have fun prizes. Behind the activities center is where you get towels and they also have an air compressor if you bring floaties from home. The church service on the beach Sunday at 11 was breathtaking as were the morning sunrises on the beach. They do have shuttles that take you to the front gate so you can cross the roads and take the bus or taxi into Playa for much cheaper than at the lobby. For a taxi we paid 7.50-10 and they always came before the bus so it worked out great. We got groceries at both Walmart and the Mega, the Mega seemed cheaper. We took a taxi to the bus station in Playa and bought our tickets to Xel Ha right at the bus station. Was $75 for adults and $50 for kids for all inclusive and bus ride for $8 roundtrip adults and $4 for kids, you just pick your time of return and that is SO much cheaper than booking through the resort. Than you can shop in town on your return if you want. The taxis back to the resort weren't as good of deals, but with some bargaining and going a block off the main ave. we could get back for $10 vs $20. We also did Tulum on our own and saved a lot of money. Kids are free and adults are only $5 I think, all ruins are free on Sundays. Back to the resort, if we had any broken items they were up to fix it very quickly or replace it. The happy hour at the pool bars is fun, drinks seemed pretty weak tho. We got beer and pop in town and brought a cooler each day and had no problems. Also, in the lobby on check in they have water bottles out on the counter so we stocked up on these whenever passing through, although it is only out on Fri, Sat and Sun, late afternoon into the evening. Watch your bill closely on check out as we had extra charges on ours that they simply removed when pointed out as did many other people. The rooms were nice and very spacious, they did not smell but always seemed wet. The kitchen was well stocked, even a can opener. They provide dish soap and do not generally do the dishes, but I did hear some people say the maid did there dishes. They had a beach party one night that was fun for the kids and you can watch the nightly entertainment for free except for the Mexican Fiesta which we were not able to do and was a bit spendy, $59 adults and $30 for kids but did include drinks. The concierge staff was very helpful and everyone we met was very friendly. We adults did do the cocktail lesson which was fun, water aerobics and water polo. There is a lot to do to keep all ages busy, even movie nights for the kids. The safe in the room is very nice and handy. My husband took the kids to the golf driving range and they had fun, that was one of the bingo prizes. Tennis was also fun, $10/hr included the raquets and balls. The resort does offer a shuttle to/from Playa daily for I belive $4/person from like 9-3 and must be booked a day ahead. Also, at the beginning of March anyway they offered complimentary shuttle from the airport to be arranged a head of time but you had to pay to return. We had 5 of us so just took a taxi and saved a lot of money.

Like alot of people, I was a little wary of some of the negative reviews, but as usual, some people are overly picky about some minor things. That being said, I have a few \"cons\" but many more \"pros\" about the place, and our trip to Mexico in general.... First the \"cons\": 1. We flew into Cancun on USA3000 and got a rental car at Hertz. I went with Hertz because I'm a Gold Member, even though they don't offer the \"just pick up the keys and go\" Gold service in Mexico that you get in the States. However, I will NOT rent from Hertz again due to the lack of professionalism at the Hertz rental counter. I got the usual insurance questions out of the way, but they wanted to put a $3,000 hold on my credit card in case there was any damage to the car, despite the fact that I had the extra coverage from Amex to cover up to $100,000 in damage, and I took the liability insurance offered. They kept saying \"We don't deal directly with the credit card company so you will have to pay us if anything happens to the car\". Okay, I am alright with that due to what I know the coverage is with Amex. But, after all the papers were signed, we were told to see the woman at the end counter to get our car, so we walked over to her, and after asking us where we're staying, she pulled out a map and started a soft sell timeshare approach! Geesh, I really didn't expect this inside the Hertz office from one of their (supposed) employees!!! We said \"no, not interested\" about five times and started trying to walk away, but as she had the keys to the car, we had to get past her. Hey, I'm used to getting accosted by timeshare folks, but really, inside the car rental place???? I am really disappointed in Hertz....maybe they can't control this in Mexico. 2. It gets better! We drive out of the airport and run into the first set of \"topes\" (speedbumps for the uninitiated), with an \"Alto\" (Stop) sign, so naturally we stop. Beside us on the berm is a police car and a couple policemen in uniform. One motions us over, so we pull over, and in broken English he asks me (on the passenger side) about my seatbelt, which I didn't have fastened due to the luggage piled in the back seat of the Dodge Avenger rental car (believe me, I usually wear my seatbelt all the time, and the trunk was full of our suitcases, and the two kids were crammed into one side in the back, so I had no choice due to the front passenger seat being pushed up so far). Well, my husband gives him his \"license\" (actually a photo ID card issued by the State that is very, very similar to a license--he had his real license with him), and then the policeman asks him to step out of the car. Husband gets out of the car (angry now because he knows what is expected--a bribe), then gets back in without offering any money. The policeman has his supervisor stop over, and they tell my husband to \"come back tomorrow at 10 a.m. to pick up your license\", and so husband says \"Okay!\", which they were not expecting to hear. A couple seconds later the policeman comes over and hands him back his \"license\" and says \"You get a break, you don't have to come back tomorrow!\" Listen, we got taken for this ruse four years ago when we stayed on Cozumel and rented a Jeep on the mainland to go see the ruins at Tulum. My husband then handed the cop a $20 bill. This time, he knew to call their bluff! We were not stopped or bothered the entire rest of the week, and we drove up and down Highway 307 to Tulum and back and to Cancun as well. 3. My son had $40 stolen from his wallet at some point. Having just read the previous post about people having money stolen while their bags were with the valet while checking in, which we did, too, I'm now wondering if that's where the money went missing. None of us could believe that the maids, who come twice a day to make the beds and turn down the beds, would do this. 4. Yes, the beach is rocky. However, there are little shallow \"pools\" with sand where you can splash, lie down and get wet if you're a beach bum like me. And since we had a car, we drove to other nicer beaches to get some real ocean swimming and snorkeling in. We found the beach chairs, hammocks and palapas, which are plentiful, to be very relaxing and more available for the most part. Plus, they have waiters just like at the pool area, which is only a few yards away, to bring you drinks. 5. Check in was okay, but I found it a little difficult to understand the young woman because the counter top is about two yards wide, and she was soft spoken with a heavy accent, but did speak English. We asked for a lower numbered building, but we had to wait to check in later since it was only about noon. When we went back at 4:00 to get our room assignment, it was ready but in Building 11, which is right by the lobby, so we actually were okay. Our view was of the landscaped grounds. The walk to the beach/pool was about 10 minutes, but many times we caught the shuttle right outside our door or at the lobby. Now the \"Pros\": 1. This is a beautiful resort! And they keep it immaculately clean, inside and out. The maids are extremely nice. They make up the beds every day, even the sleeper sofas (which are actually like twin beds) that my kids slept on, and then they come in the evening for turndown service leaving Hershey Kisses on the beds. They don't wash the dishes (there is no dishwasher). They were very accommodating to supply towels. 2. The food here is excellent. We only ate lunch at Havana Moon and Bolche, the pool restaurant, and had room service one night, but every time the food was very good. We ate breakfast in the room after stocking up on some essentials at the Mega and WalMart in Playa. 3. The pool!!! Wow! Biggest pool ever. You could always find a spot to take a dip or swim that was uncrowded. Two swim up bars to take advantage at Happy Hour, from 11-1 every day. Most of the time the pool area was quiet, but usually at midday the DJs showed up for some \"spring break\" type entertainment involving mixing a bunch of liquors together in a small paper cup for free drinks for the college crowd (and some older folks, too). There are many lounge chairs and palapas but you have to get there early in the a.m. to \"save\" the chairs or rent the palapa bed, which we never did. 4. Others complained about the hard beds but I slept like a rock each night and found them comfortable. The king sized bed is great in the master bedroom. The two sinks in the one bedroom units are good for 4 people. Bathroom is spacious and has a separate toilet area behind another door for privacy. Marble floors and countertops. Hope this helps anyone staying here in the future!

Check in was outrageous- we arrived on a Saturday night and it was pure chaos. We were being pulled in all directions and it was very hectic. Very unorganized. Be ready for it if you fly in late on Saturday night. 2. Beach- very rocky and we saw many jellyfish washed ashore. 3. The snorkeling tour to Cozumel booked through the resort was absolutely AWFUL. Not only was the whole trip disorganized but the snorkeling was the worst I have ever seen. They took the slowest boat possible and when we actually got to the spot there were a few coral and a couple of fish. I repeat DO NOT go!! Do try the Tulum Xel-Ha tour. Heard great things about it. Pros 1. The staff is great. They are so friendly and very helpful, the best I have ever encountered. 2. Premium tour to Chichen Itza- Highly recommend spending a little extra money. It will make your trip well worth it. The guide was amazing! 3. The pool- great pool with tons of room and chairs. 4. Rooms- I thought that the rooms were very nice. They did not smell moldy as many people have said and I did not find the bed or the couches uncomfortable. As for prices I was surprised to see that they were not as outrageous as many made them out to be. They are about the same as you would pay at a restaurant in the States. ($9 hamburger $15 dollar pizza ect) The market on site however is a tad pricey, we went into Walmart the 2nd day and bought food although I suggest going to the Mega instead.

It was a vacation after all, and so any criticisms need to be considered against that. We got a week at the Mayan Palace for $500 through someone with a timeshare. This is the second time we've done it (the Nuevo Vallarta Sea Garden was the first). We got a large suite with a living room, dinette, kitchenette, bathroom with two sinks and bedroom with king size bed. There were even two TVs (his and hers) though we didn't use them. As others have said, the rooms are a bit musty but it's the whole area--nothing much can be done and you should expect it in that part of the world. The air conditioning can help, though we had trouble getting the right temperature -- it was often too cold or too hot. If you get a high numbered building, ask nicely to be moved. When we checked in we asked for a low numbered building and got building 19, which as everyone has said, is far away. However, the person checking us in said that she'd put us on a list to be moved to a lower numbered building. Sure enough, the next day we got a call and they moved us to building 6. I don't know if we would have had the chance to move had we not gotten lucky and been in the room when they called. Building 6 was older but I thought the furniture was marginally more comfortable. Unfortunately, they were doing tons of loud construction outside. Not right outside, but you definitely walk out into a construction zone and can hear it. Still, we liked building six way better. You can get a block on your phone so the timeshare people can't wake you up if, like us, you like to sleep in a bit on vacation. We lost out block when we moved (they said it would move automatically with us but it didn't) but we asked that it be put back on and they complied. We set it so any calls before 10am went to voicemail. Works nicely. If you like to sit on the beach, it's quite nice. The view is beautiful, you can get right up to the water since there aren't swimmers, and the water is surprisingly warm if you want to wade out (you'll want crocs or beach shoes or something to wade out, though). You can't really swim, though. If you want to swim, Playa del Carmen is great. We preferred the beach to the pool for sitting since we find the whole afternoon activity thing obnoxious -- we just wanted quiet and relaxation, and the pool activities are not that. But plenty of people seemed to be enjoying them so if that's your thing, go for it. The pool was beautiful and there was always lots of space for a dip. As to the food, my wife and I have different views. I'm a vegetarian and found the offerings kind of limited, that room service really couldn't accommodate any special requests (which I made in Spanish, not English, though I'm sure my accent is terrible), and that some of the veg options, like the pizza or the fried rice at Havana Moon, just don't have much flavor. Their salads were good, though. I did better at the breakfast at the buffet -- lots of fresh fruit and other options, and Italian night there was alright too. We skipped the Mexican fiesta as it was pretty expensive (over $50 per person, which is a deal if you want to to partake of their all-the-liquor-you-can-drink policy). My wife has some excellent pork and seafood dishes, though. She's a foodie and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of some of her meals. We took the bus into Playa (reserve the day before) and shopped at the Mega which took care of 6 of our 7 breakfasts for the trip for the price one breakfast at their buffet. The bus is a decent deal, by the way -- rare for the resort, and things are much cheaper at the Mega than their convenience store on-site. Playa was really fun and worth a day trip. The beach there is great for swimming (crowded and public, yes, but you're milling around with Mexican families on vacation or taking the day off, which is cool). I found 5th avenue annoying and overpriced but a block or two over you could get better deals on crafts and textiles if you haggle. Silver was insanely overpriced on 5th, so watch out. We really like 100% natural and Media Luna for restaurants. Yaxche was kind of a dud despite the promising menu. It was cloudy one day so we went to Chichen Itza. You can do the bus trip for like $100 per person, or you can rent a car for a day for $100 a day from their car rental (still overpriced), or, if you're like us you could get on travelocity and get a car and a room at a resort need Chichen for less than the cost of two trips to Chichen Itza through the resort. We stayed at Mayaland (which I'm also reviewing) but some of the cheaper places (around $50/night) nearby are perfectly fine if you just want to crash. We drove out the day before and got up early and hit the ruins before the tour busses -- definitely the way to do it. In general, the staff we dealt with in person we helpful and responsive. Our room service waiter had to return twice to get us a meal that had some meat (for my wife) and some vegetarian (for me) but did so happily. The maids were great (though as others noted, you must do your own dishes). We had less luck on the phone with resort staff, even though I was polite and spoke decent tourist Spanish. I would recommend doing any important business at the resort face to face. Oh, and we were able to check out the night before we left. Overall, I liked the Mayan Palace setup better at Nuevo Vallarta and would go back there: you can see the ocean from your room and there was no construction, and a few restaurant options close to the hotel. But the Yucatan Peninsula is amazing in its own right -- Playa was sweet and we loved our trip inland. I might go back to tour the ruins, but I'm not sure I'd stay at the Mayan. Still, I have no regrets and we had a wonderful vacation.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Paltz, New York", "Title": "\u201cgreat time at Grand Mayan / Mayan Palace\u201d", "Author": "DeniseAck", "ReviewID": "UR14071589", "Content": "Our family stayed at the Grand Mayan in a 2 bedroom suite the week of Feb 10-17th. Us: 40's, Our Kids: 8 and 9, My Parents: 80 years old. This is our 3rd visit to different Mayan Resorts and our 2nd time to this area ( The first time was at an all-inclusive hotel 3 years ago) Though our rooms were in the \u201cGrand\u201d, the resort shares all the amenities with the Mayan Palace, so I\u2019ll copy this review in both places. Location: About halfway between Cancun and Playa del Carmen. Fine if you don\u2019t plan on touring much, expensive if you want to visit either city or go to some of the sites. We did Xcaret, Xel-Ha, and Tulum when we were in this area without my folks, so this time was more about staying on site. The cab ride to Playa del Carmen to go grocery shopping at the \u201cMega\u201d Commercial Mexicana was $20. There is a public bus that runs down the highway to Playa, but walking to the main gate and across the 4 lanes was too much for my Dad. There is NO shuttle to the main gate, at least not anymore, and it would be about a 15-20 minute walk. There is a hotel bus to playa but you need to book a day in advance so we couldn\u2019t use it. Hotel Grounds: Beautifully landscaped, perfectly clean and huge as everyone has mentioned. There was a fire in January and the proposed GM lobby burned down. I'll post a resort map in the \"pictures\" area. Although not perfectly to scale, the distance from the main MP pool to the buildings can be pretty far. Buildings 1-7 at GM and 1-8 are considered \u201cclose\u201d to the pool, so if you have some walking/handicap issues, you will hopefully get put there (be sure to mention that when reserving). We were in building 7 at the GM and it was still a 5-10 minute walk. There is access to the beach only from the Havana Moon restaurant to the end of the Pool. The area toward the bottom right of the map is jungle and fenced off from the beach with no cut throughs. We were originally placed in a room on the back side of the building and the map doesn\u2019t show how close the \u201cshuttle bus\u201d path is. Too close for privacy when on your balcony. We were able to move to the front side and even though we were on the first floor (i.e. no view of the lagoon) we had a huge \u201cfront yard\u201d of privacy. At Mayan Palace, the rooms on the front had a walking path about 10-15 feet away so remember to keep your sheer drapes closed. Rooms: Perfectly clean, well stocked with safe, toiletries, extra towels, extra pillows, etc. The GM is in a very modern, Picasso kind of style. Not my favorite, but great suite nonetheless. The maid service was great and only one time did we come back from the pool and our room wasn\u2019t ready yet. Put the \u201cmake up room now\u201d tag on your door when you leave in the morning and you shouldn\u2019t have a problem. The beds everywhere in Mexico seem to be rock hard. \u201cColchonetta\u201d is the word for the egg-crate type foam mattress pad that will make your nights infinitely more comfortable. Tip the maid generously for the retrieval and remaking of your bed with the foam topper. They make less in a day than what you\u2019d spend on lunch. Food: We ate at the restaurants once or twice a day. The kitchen in our room was more than adequate for the breakfasts or light meals we ate in it. We actually bought a little Teflon coated fry pan since the one they provide always burned our eggs and pancakes. Bring one from home. Also bring salt and pepper shakers from home and a jar of horseradish to mix with ketchup if you like your shrimp with cocktail sauce. Horseradish doesn\u2019t seem to exist in Mexico. From the grocery store in Playa, we got avocados, chips, eggs, butter, ketchup, salad makings, pasta, pancake mix, fruit, and the basics of milk, coffee, beer, tequila and limes. You can get fresh caught shrimp and fish in some of the neighboring towns (We were in Puerto Morelos and they were excellent!) They do start you with sample coffee packs and powdered milk in case you can\u2019t get to the store until the next day. The mini-market on site had some basics as well as pre-made deli sandwiches. Restaurants: The breakfast buffet at Del Lago was superb. Well worth the money and we would not eat again until dinner. We had dinner once there too and didn\u2019t realize it had a live show there every night. It was just us adults as the kids were at \u201cPirate Night\u201d at the kids club. We enjoyed it a lot, but I could see families with young kids getting antsy. We ate dinner at Havana Moon and it had a lot of specialty pizzas and it also was great and the view unbeatable. We had a lot of lunches at the poolside since once you settled in, you didn\u2019t want to trek back to the room. This worked out perfectly for us--take advantage of the 2 for 1 drinks at happy hour--since the $30 poolside palapa rental cost was credited back if you spent that on food and drinks. We found the best way to work this was to plan your days based on whether you got a palapa. Signups begin early, but if they are sold out for that day, you can get one for the following day. Then when happy hour starts at 11, your best plan is to go for ice buckets of 4 beers. When it is busy, the waiters are really hustling, but you still might have to wait. Having a bucket erased that irritation. Pools and Beach: The main pool is amazingly huge and has lots of fun spots--shallow beds in the water, the huge white cement balls, waterfalls, underwater walls you can walk on to cut through to different areas. The Grand Mayan Pool is much smaller but has some nice spots as well and there is a little sandy beach also. If you have small kids this is the place to be. They can build sandcastles to their heart\u2019s content (I think they offer sand toys for free), then walk through a small water trough to wash off the sand, and then go for a swim. The water gradually goes from 1 inch to about 4 feet. Perfect for toddlers!! I always hated when pool designs didn\u2019t think of the little ones. Technically you need the Grand Mayan bracelet, but I don\u2019t know if anyone would really kick you out. The beach is great for lounging, but not swimming. The hammocks are divine listening to music outside of Havana Moon. As you get close to the water\u2019s edge, the flat coral and rocks extend at least 20 feet out in the water. You can enjoy the tide pools, but don\u2019t bother trying to go out for a swim. We saw one lady slip backwards and crack her head. I don\u2019t think stitches were in her vacation plan. I slipped also on an algae covered rock, but I got lucky. Take a walk for swimming beaches. If you go left, the next beach up is better. If you go right, take a bit of a longer walk (30-45 min) and you\u2019ll find the most amazing beach!! Pinkish sand from the coral, soft as baby powder. Cut behind the properties next to the resort and walk along the tiny street until the cut through back to the water. Going around the point and through the barbed wire is no fun. Excursions: The resort offers many and you can get a 10% discount if you take the \u201cproperty tour.\u201d We made friends with people who took the snorkeling and they said it was ok. I think it was about $40 pp and you went out on a huge boat with about 50-75 people. We went down to Puerto Morelos by cab $14 and booked a snorkel tour right from the kiosk in the main square. Can\u2019t miss it. We ate lunch in the Pelicanos restaurant while waiting for our trip time and took pics of the lighthouse and pier that were really tilted by hurricanes. We paid $25 per adult and $13 per kid and it was just the four of us plus our guide on the boat. We snorkeled for 2 hours at two different locations. The guide swam with us the whole time and even towed the kids on a life preserver when the felt tired from swimming. He brought us to the best spots and pointed out sea turtles, manta rays, eel, little barracudas, lobster and of course a billion fish. I recommend it highly!!!! It was the highlight of our trip. We gave him a $20 tip for being such a great guide and thoughtful of the kids.

We traded a 2 bedroom full kitchen for what we got but that is a separate issue. The room had 1 drinking glass, no ice bucket, no microwave, no refrigerator, no coffee maker and two double beds. We made several request for additional items but were told no. We were in building 13 which is the very last building on the Grand Mayan side, with our balcony facing a construction project and woods. We we told this is a \"Garden View\" room and that there were no ocean view rooms on this property. They do not exist! I suggest requesting an odd number room if you are assigned to buildings 8 to 13 so you can overlook the golf course. Building 13 is so far away form everything we had to take one shuttle to the lobby and catch a second ride to the pool or beach. We joked that we were going into town on the days we wanted participate in anything this \"resort\" had to offer. I am a coffee drinker and enjoy a cup first thing in the morning. It is just short of a 1 mile walk round trip if you go to the 19th hole for a $3.00 cup of java. I do not mind paying the high prices but the distance one had to walk was a little much. The transportation does not start until 7:00 and it did not show up until 7:45. The pool was fantastic and I would recommend reserving a bungalow as it is truly worth the $30 it cost. You will get a credit for the $30 if you spend that much or more for food and drinks. You will have to remind them at check out for the credit as they forget. I was told by several to watch for that oversight and sure enough, I had to request an adjustment. The beach was fine. I did not find it too rocky to enjoy and really feel others may have exaggerated a bit. Rent a car and do not worry about the police as we had no problems as long as you obey the posted speed limits. We found it easy to drive and there is a lot to see in with a short drive. The resort staff were nice but we found many did not speak English and had little information regarding things to see and do off site. During check-in we were approached and asked if we wanted to have a resort overview(timeshare presentation) but simply said \"no thank you\" and were never asked after that. In closing, we found this resort to have the warmth of a tomb with no central place to gather and meet others.

I admit I was a bit nervous after reading some very negative reviews. Ater checking in, we were directed to a woman to get a map. We got the sales presentation invitation which we quickly declined. Then we were offered an upgrade to the Grand Mayan, $100 off the bill and 10% off the total bill. We had been happy to get building 5 which I knew was a great location. But, we asked if we could view both rooms. We did and the difference in the rooms was like the Travelodge and the Hyatt! My husband HATES time share presentations, but even he admitted it would be worth it. We also had been approached at the airport by a rep from a beautiful resort, Riviera Palace. The salesmen are like vultures as you leave the airport. But, we ended up with a great deal. In return for touring the Riviera Palace and a delicious breakfast buffet overlooking the beach, we paid $60 for two tickets to Xeh Caret, Chichen Itza, a taxi to WalMart and then back to the Mayan. The resort was beautiful and we would have bought if my mom didn't own so many timeshares. The only drawback about our trip is that you really need a week to chill at the resort and a week to sightsee. But we had a great time! We had no interest in going up to Cancun, but loved Playa del Carmen. If you are not into the party scene, you will prefer staying on the Riviera Mayan where tourism hasn't completely engulfed the coast. We also spent a day in Tulum and did a tour with Edventure tours, a custom tour company based in the Tulum Ruins entrance. The resort is truly HUGE and we only saw about 70% of it during our week! You could stay the entire week, never leave the grounds and have a wonderful time. We never had a bad meal and the room service was fabulous! Tramanto's was our favorite restaurant (I had the asparagus rissoti twice) and they have a fun, daily happy hour from 7-8. We are both wine drinkers and figured we'd be drinking beer and margaritas while in Mexico. But Tramanto's has a really good house wine. Food prices were very reasonable. DeLago is also a fabulous restaurant that has a different theme each night. We went the wrong way and ended up there on a Sunday evening. The buffet (South American theme) looked delicious with more food choices than I have ever seen! We had our Mayan sales presentation during the palapa fires and were eating a great breakfast in the DeLago when the fires began. Our presentation was cut short due to the fire. But, it was a strong sales pitch. Not by our rep, but the ones who followed. If you want to swim, head north for about a half mile and there is a pretty beach. Also, if you take your own soft cooler, you can stock it from WalMart. I must admit every staff member we had contact with was very professional and most cordial. Linda was the rep who upgraded us and even went to WalMart to buy me a coffeemaker. The hotel rooms at the Grand Mayan are lockout rooms from the two bedrooms. Although your neighbors are right through the door, ours were very quiet. Beautiful rooms with a jucuzzi that opens up to the bedroom. Rooms are cleaned daily and evening maids come and turn your bed down and leave hershey kisses. Wonderful thick, big bath towels and the colors were avacado green, white and light pine furniture. I couldn't believe the difference in the Mayan Palace rooms and the Grand Mayan rooms. So, I would suggest upgrading to the Grand Mayan if it's offered. Even though the Grand Mayan guests don't really need additional pools, they are so beautiful and the pool canals leading from the Mayan pools to the Grand pools are perfect for swimming laps. So, bring your goggles! Be sure to chat with the other guests. There is not a great deal of advertising in regard to resort specials and it seems some guests are lucky enough to spend several weeks at the Mayan. We got a lot of our information by word of mouth.

Not a bad walk at all. The building was newer. We did take a shuttle back to our building one day after a full day at the pool! We found that the service was always quick and courteous. The staff genuinely care about your well-being and try to help out any way they can. When we called for something, they came promptly to the room. There is now a lot to choose from in their grocery store/deli. Sandwiches and wraps were great! The resort now has a shuttle into Playa. It is $2 USD one way. Can't beat that. You need to make reservations with the concierge early to get a spot on the bus. I have to put a plug in for Edventures tours. We booked with them online, prior to our arrival (edventuretours.com). Eddy (the owner) and Carlos (another guide) took us to Tulum ruins, a freshwater cenote snorkeling, Akumal bay snorkeling, a beautiful lagoon snorkeling, and an awesome restaurant that resembled a tree house, for dinner. Carlos had beer on hand all day also! Overall, I would defintely go back to the Mayan Palace.

The room and the grounds were always clean and very well kept. Right now there is some construction going on -- they are putting in 2 new pool areas, I think. But, we didn't find the construction to be distracting or annoying; the view of the construction off our balcony wasn't great , but we didn't spend enough time in the room to let that be a problem for us.

There were always plenty of lounge chairs by the pool, so we found it to be very relaxing and enjoyable. The activities desk is right by the pool, too, so there is always something going on for young and old alike. The resort itself is huge, so depending on your building, you may have a long walk to the pool area and the beach. We were in building 11, which is right by the main lobby and about 10 minutes to the pool. We thought it was actually a perfect, centrally located spot. The rocky beach is terrible for swimming, but great to just lounge around and get some sun. They do have free kayaks at the beach, so we took those out and then swam off the kayaks further out from the beach. That was a lot of fun.

What I got for my trade was a small hotel unit with no dinette area, fridge, microwave or anything but 2 twin beds and a view of the trees (I could almost see the ocean about 1/4 mile away from the room). BOO! The resort is beautiful and so is the beach area and pool, but the layout is just wrong. As far as I know, none of the rooms are ocean view and ours especially was a 8 to 10 minute walk to the pool and beach. We were in the building where the lobby was directly beneath us. We didn't spend much time here at all mostly because of the prices of the food. Maybe we're just spoiled by the \"All Inclusive\" resorts, but it just seemed to me that everything was just outrageously expensive. A sandwich by the pool snack bar was around $6.50, and breakfast for $25 per person? Come on!!! We went to the local supermarket, bought a styrofoam cooler and stocked up on sandwich meat, PB&J, doughnuts, etc. My wife was most irritated with the fact that they didn't offer complimentary coffee. We had to either by it out of the vending machine in the lobby for $2 or at the restaurant for almost $3. (They add a tip for everything you order). They also do not have WiFi for your convenience. It costs $7 per hour and you have to walk to the building near the pool to use it. On a positive note, the staff is very friendly and helpful.

By that I mean there is a lot of ground to cover. I can see how it might take people along time to get to the pool. We stayed at the Grand Mayan Palace in building 3. The walk to the pool was probably about 5 minutes away. I never timed it but I'd think that is accurate. However if your staying at the Grand Mayan there is a private pool for those guest's closer. The main pool is worth that walk though. However, I was a bit frustrated that finding a chair was difficult. I believe the hotel should enforce the rules and remove towels that are just sitting on a chair for a person that hasn't been there for 6 hours. We did encounter this and I find that very rude. The beach area is large, but also pretty packed to get a chair. I didn't swim in the ocean there at all, in fact I only saw a few people swim in there. The restraunts were pretty good. We could not get into the italian place for dinner as it was always full. There were other places on the resort that were good though. We had dinner a few times in Playa, but I can't recommend one. There is a store to get items also, but didnt' give it much business. I would recommend to anyone wanting to see the Mayan ruins to take the trip to Chichen Itza that is offered by the resort. It takes awhile to go there but worth the sites. You stop on the way to swim in a cenote if your interested, which I did. Its basicaly a 7a-7p trip. We also did the Xcaret, but not sure if I would recommend it. It seems kinda trashy there and very touristy, the show at night was ok but as you would expect was all in Spanish and I don't know much of it. We also did the snorkel tour that they offered from the resort, and that was definately worth the 50 dollars. If you like fish and coral reefs, then do this! I would say all in all the vacation was nice, but my wife and I are not hard to make happy. If your laid back then you'll be fine. If your high strung and want everything perfect this isn't the place for you. I will add that the staff was outstanding. I never had a problem with anyone there.

Havan Moon was a cool little place to eat, food wasn't amazing, just good but there was a great live bacd and a dance floor that was a lot of fun. Tramonto is a great place to eat, nice atmosphere-happy hour from 7-8 and yes, it was a little pricy but not crazy. We ate in playa del carmen a few nights and the food was fantastic there. The clubs were fun. It was about a 20 minute cab ride for 20 buck. Or you can take the public bus for 3 bucks a person. The hotel also offers a shuttle but it doesn't run late so we stayed with the cabs. cancun is about 35 minutes away, a $40 cab ride or take the public bus-much cheaper. Cancun was fun-we all relived the golden years of spring break and headed to Coco Bongo and Senor Frogs. Coco Bongo was great-it's $40 open bar, and they put on a show every 20 minutes which was amazing. I would definitely go back to the mayan palace. I loved the food, the service, the pool, and the area. If you are looking for a resot with a fantastic beach-this is not it because you are situated right on a reef so there is no swimming.

The resort grounds are lovely, kept in a pristine condition, and there is an onsite golf course right at the resort. We were a little disappointed that none of the rooms faced out to the ocean but the resort came with other charms. We had two very spacious rooms, two bathrooms, two balconies, and the kitchen and living room area in the middle. Our guest had a lot of privacy and was impressed with the room arrangement. Many people have complained about being misled with an invitation to attend a timeshare presentation, when the sole purpose is to actually sell the guests a timeshare. The salespeople are pushy and aggressive but the upside is you become informed about timeshare ownership and receive a few perks for giving up some valuable pool time. Since my husband and I are Mayan owners, we were interested in what was going on with all of the construction and other new resorts being opened. We were not interested in upgrading to the Grand Mayan or purchasing additional weeks. One must be of strong character and give these timeshare people a definite \"no.\" They are used to this!!! As a thank you for our time, we were given a buffet breakfast. We have attended timeshare presentations in the past and the salesperson has at least let us eat our breakfast quietly before the \"attack.\" Our salesperson was all business and liked to talk while eating but it still didn't shorten the time. In addition to the breakfast which was very lavish, we received $100 deduction and 10% off all purchases which was taken off at checkout. One of the problems at the resort is the distance to a supermarket. There is a market on the premises but it doen't carry all of the food items, is kind of pricey, and is only good for a few starter things, or suitable if you you plan to eat out most of your meals. Otherwise, a trip to Playa del Carmen to the Walmart super store is mandatory. The hotel shuttle leaves regularly from the resort and must be arranged at least a day in advance. It drops you off a few blocks from Walmart so be prepared to walk. While walking, you can take in some of the cute boutiques and silver jewelry stores. We had a lot of heavy items after shopping so we took a cab back to the bus stop to go back to the resort. The cab was only a few dollars and well worth it to have some of the food items that we wanted. Although we had dinner in Playa del Carmen, which was fun, the best food and restaurants were right at the resort. We liked the Italian restaurant at the resort and ate there twice because of the good food and ambience. Some people we talked to took the ferry in Playa del Carmen to Cozumel where they also have a lot of good restaurants and shopping. Cozumel was on our wish list of excursions, but we chose instead to take the full day trip to Chichen Itza. Chichen Itza is listed as one of the \"New Seven Wonders of the World\" in National Geographic. We made the arrangements for the trip at the hotel and received a discount because we attended the timeshare presentation. There are several choices for the trip and we were advised to choose the one right below the most expensive as you got the same choices anyway but different buses and less money. The tour company provides food on the bus and takes the tourists to a restaurant for lunch. All in all, we had wonderful weather, an enjoyable stay at the resort, and would highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cReviews are overly critical\u201d", "Author": "ScreenNameFive", "ReviewID": "UR13601787", "Content": "I recently returned from our vacation at the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya (not the Grand Mayan which is attached) and found past poster's negative reviews to be overly critical. I have posted a copy of the rockiest part of the beach for you to judge for yourself. From reading past reviews I would have thought we would have had to wear protective rubber suits to go swimming which is not the case. Just walk down the beach a bit and it's fine. My boyfriend and I went with one other couple and stayed as guests of timeshare owners. We range from our mid 30's to early 40's in age. Over the past three years, we have been to several resorts and found this one to be nice but not over-the-top. The pros: -No hassles for presentation (we didn't even get asked to join a presentation except by the vultures at the airport) -Our room was a suite and it was HUGE. There was no musty smell and it was clean as could be. It had a king size bed, kitchenette, microwave, dining area, living room, two tv's and more. -The fitness center is very nice...3 bikes, 3 ellipitcles, 6 treadmills, a yoga room and a circuit training area plus free weights. The free weights (dumbells) only go up to 50lbs though. -The food was good enough. Nothing to rave about but nothing to be disappointed in either. I really liked the simplicity of the 19th hole restaurant for breakfast which was around $12 per person. The room service staff that delivered the food was excellent. -There is beach volleyball everyday at 11 and 4 even though it is not mentioned on their website. -Around the pool they have little huts with beds you can rent for the day. Your food (up to $30) is comp'ed when you rent these. -The pool water was nice and warm. -I think 2-for-1 happy hour starts at 11:00AM. I recommend the mango daqueri hands down! -There is a fantastic bar and restaurant above the market that we didn't explore until our lat night. I don't know about the food because we didn't eat there but the atmosphere with drinks was fantastic. You can relax inside or outside. The Cons: -We were in building 17 so the round trip walk to the beach and back would be around 20 minutes. You can take the shuttle but most of the time we walked or jogged it. Don't forget anything in your room when you leave in the morning or you'll eventually be annoyed at the distance. Otherwise it's not a big deal. Learn the flag system of the shuttle and you'll be fine. (yellow means the shuttle is going to the rooms, blue means it's headed to the pool/beach, etc. There is a sign in front of the lobby explaining the four flags) -If you want to take the public bus to Cancun, Playa, Tulum, etc. there is no sign that says \"Bus Stop.\" Just walk across the highway from the entrance of the hotel and wait. It will come even if you stand there wondering if you are in the right place. Security may ignore you if you try to ask them questions about the bus. Things to note: PRICING -Pricing is good for some things and really high for others. Foods from the market deli like chicken wraps, sandwiches and brownies were normal price... but then normal things like a can of soda were expensive. At the market, I paid $1.50 for one can of diet soda. It was even more expensive at poolside which charged me $2.70 for the same size can plus they added their 15% gratuity. I did not like that at all, especially when I can buy a can of coke here at home for 50 cents in a vending machine. Examples of poolside costs: Shrimp and Steak Quesadillas $12.50, Evian One Liter Water $6 (the BonaFont bottled water is cheaper. If you don't care about brand, get that one instead), Margarita $6.50, Daqueri $6.50, Pacifico Beer $3.70. Examples of Room service costs: large pizzas were $15 each. We bought three and had friends over to our suite to watch the superbowl. It was great! PEST CONTROL Some people complained of pest control foggers being used early in the morning. They fogged our area every night between 5-6 so we didn't really notice. The fogging doesn't take long anyway. BEACHSIDE ACTIVITY CENTER On site there is a place to book a snorkel or dive tour. I did the snorkel tour and the staff was very patient with my apprehension once I got to the reef and the snorkeling was decent but be prepared for a lot of trash and no bathroom on the beach they take you to after you snorkel. The beach I'm speaking of is not the hotel beach. My final review is that the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya is not the horrid place some reviewers have made it out to be. It's very clean and nice with very polite staff that speak English. If you want lifestyles of the rich and famous, this isn't it. But for the rest of us, it's a good vacation in Mexico.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "medicine hat, Alberta Canada", "Title": "\u201cBe prepared to walk\u201d", "Author": "Gerry/Linda", "ReviewID": "UR13558069", "Content": "Second time at the Mayan Palace and just to let everybody know the shuttle to the front gate has been cancelled. They will give you a ride back but be prepared to wait and don't believe what the security at the front gate tells you. They will tell you the shuttle will be there in 10 minutes but after 30-35 minutes would just get frustrated and walk in. Never saw the shuttle on our walk in either so it was an hour or more . The worst thing is the water in the pools at the front gate smells like a sewer and it takes everything not to vomit. When you see the water you can understand why as it is green. Tried to get a cab to take me from the front gate to the lobby but her refused so I walked in after coming from Playa Del Carmen in the Playa Express. If you want to go out to the highway to catch the buses a cab will take you out for $3 or catch the gold cart at the lobby and it will take you to unit 19. Walk through the parking lot and your walk is 6 minutes to the front gate. I did not not want to go to the presentation as the sharks wait for you when your checking in. After telling him that he told me it was his job to inform me and said \" you probably couldn't afford it anyway\". The wife was pretty upset with that comment and RCI was told about it on the comment card. They really don't give you much for getting stressed out for 4 hours or more even though they tell people its only 90 minutes. Most everybody I talked to said it left a sour taste in their mouth after leaving the presentation. Lets say you spend $5000 on a two week holiday . That works out to $350 a day. Their are 10 really good hours in the day so that is $35 an hour. Multiply that by four hours at the presentation and it works out to $140. They give you $100, 10% off your bill but not during happy hour and I believe $20 off your golf. So if your bill at the resort is $1000 and 10% of that is $100+$100+$20(golf) for a total of $220. Would you get all stressed out for $80 or less. The pool is great but you better be prepared to walk and why older people buy there I have no idea. Restaraunts at the pool were good and prices were okay. One other thing, if you go to the presentation and buy there remember that the longer you stay and the more you haggle the better the deal. These guys are good and they wear a lot of people down after four hours. We went to Playa almost every night as it had a better night life than the Mayan Palace. Best snorkeling we found was at Akumal beach and Puerto Morelos was second. At Akumal you can go to the lagoon which is a $6 cab ride from the arch and $7/person to get in. There is no beach there, a few benches and rock. It is well worth the money to see it. Lots of parrot fish. Akumal has turtles,barracuda and sting rays along with thousands of fish.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cA balanced perspective\u201d", "Author": "GVish", "ReviewID": "UR13441584", "Content": "I'd like to balance some of the past comments made regarding the Mayan Palace Resort with some of my own experiences. I've been to the Cancun resort now close to a dozen times in the last 4 years and am happy to admit that I am a timeshare owner there. Like other posters, I too, have travelled all over the world and I've even lived in Mexico during plant launches and product changes (in other cities). Our permanent home is in Michigan. To bring context, we vacation 4x per year and Mayan Palace is one of many places we stay at. Note that a timeshare speech is a lure with a price tag and I find that all of them are the same ...even in the US. If you don't want the pain, don't be naive or greedy and try to grab the seemingly generous handouts. As a general rule, we don't bother with the timeshare pitches anywhere we go. The Playa/Cancun facility has been, and still is under construction. The long distance to the current pool from many of the buildings is a function of the facility's large size and the fact that their second (river pool) has been under construction for almost 2 years with a re-do after Katrina hit Cancun and flattened parts of the new pool structure. The new pool facility will complement the current (lavish) massive, ocean-front pool and I am looking forward to our up-coming trip in March '08 to see the progress there. The development of this Cancun resort is following (generally) the development of the MP Puerta Vallerta property and that facility is awesome (was there 11/07). With each trip to Cancun, the pool and facility gets nicer and alas, the hotel also gets larger. I do not regret that but I can see how that can surprise someone who thinks they are going to get a hotel room on the ocean. With very few exceptions, the beautiful rooms at Mayan Palace are perpendicular to the shore and do not provide head-on views. Mostly, the one side gives you the facility and the other side often gives you the jungle...both are beautiful. Our kids have been spread from high school through college and we are comfortable with the security and quality of the resort to permit them late hours. There are numerous activities during the day with a good spread in their target audience (from ceramic fish painting to the college favorite Mixology 101 (drinks) to water aerobics and volleyball). As long as parents do their job and keep their kids in the right activity path, there are no problems. The key point there is personal responsibility. Don't ever cut your kids completely loose at any facility. The Mayan Palace Riviera Maya is approximately half way between Playa del Carmen and Cancun and equally convenient to get to both. If you are a pessimist, then it is equally inconvenient. We use the hotel shuttle to the front gate and take the city bus or taxi to either destination at least once a day for shopping or dinner. If you are planning on visiting this hotel, I recommend the following suggestions to enjoy this area: 1. If you get to the front desk early in the day, check in is officially at 4 or 5 in the afternoon. Often there are rooms available earlier, but in peak season you might have a wait. Pack a carry-on bag with shopping bags and swim suits and drop your suitcases at the front desk while you either swim in the pool for the early afternoon or- better yet, go into Playa del Carmen and pick up some groceries and tequila for the week at the Sam\u2019s Club there. If you are not a member, you can get a 1-day membership. After 2PM on Sunday, the grocery stores stop selling alcohol but the beer stores still do. A taxi from the (street) entrance of the hotel will charge around $25-$28 for a round trip and the driver will wait while you shop and drop you off at the main entrance with your groceries so the bellhops can place them in plastic bins and transport them to your room. As for the hotel shuttles, they run 80% of the time to a very consistent schedule. You can plan the time to leave your hotel room based on the last time one went by. You can generally hear these motorized golf carts pass by your building if you are listening for them. Learning the pulse of the facility makes it really easy to get around. Depending on the shuttle, you will likely need to wait 10 - 15 minutes for the next one at any given location. The exception to this is the shuttle after the weekly Mexican Fiesta party which is often full and you just might want to walk rather than wait. Catching a shuttle away from the pool at dinner time can also make you wait for the next ride as this is a peak ride time. The golf course is pure joy. I am an amateur golfer who enjoys losing 1-2 golf balls on the front 9 holes and another 3-4 on the back 9. My father (a far, far more experienced golfer) also loves the course and has played many of the best courses in the US. This Nicklaus par-3 course is a challenge and a joy to play with its well-maintained fairways and transitions from hard packed sand to challenging greens on a near island (H18) and across large ponds (H14?). I rate the Mayan Palace La Tramonto Italian Restaurant as a \"very good\" dining facility that will compete very well with many of the expensive eateries on the Riviera Maya to the North. We make a point of dining casually and, again formally there at least twice on each trip. We've also dined in the expensive Hotel District to the North many times (Lorenzillo's (sea food), Ruth's Chris (US steak), Brazilian Steak houses, etc). Having travelled to Mexico probably 40-50 times total in my life, I've never gotten sick at Mayan Palace and their attention to cleanliness is apparent and appreciated (yes, you can get into trouble with food even in an expensive restaurant on the Hotel Strip in Cancun as I did 1 year ago at a very up-scale Brazilian Steakhouse. In Mexico in general, I'd recommend that you DON'T EAT THE UNKNOWN PEPPERS on your dinner plate unless you really know what you are doing. In spite of my traveling pedigree, I was very wrong with one dinner (green peppers) and paid a terrible price that lasted 2 days. With the groceries we get in Playa del Carmen on the first day, we eat many of our breakfasts and quick lunches in the hotel suite through the week as a matter of economy and convenience. We're not members of the buffet crowd but the Mexican Fiesta sure packs one (as does the Caribbean dinner by the pool). We travel with 5-12 people typically and enjoy the fact that we can congregate in one suite and celebrate a light meal or a snack. Considering that this facility is next to the thick Mayan jungle, I think its a smart policy to make residents responsible for KP duty on the dishes (it keeps the food mess down). Would I like full maid service? Sure, but I really don't mind rinsing off our breakfast bowls. I guess we're not as messy as some people are. Though the hotel has a great menu of excursions available, we buy all of our excursions out of a kiosk in Playa del Carmen about a half block N-W of the Cozumel ferry docks (the kiosk is right across from the building that resembles a white church, 1 block north of the Carlos & Charlie\u2019s'. The people there use newer vans, excellent guides and we've had excellent trips to Tulum, Chi Chen Itza, the gardens etc. Book your excursions a day or two in advance. They will pick you up in front of the hotel because they are not permitted on the hotel grounds (you pay double for that privilege if you book excursions through the hotel) - note that every large hotel does this for the most part. The best beaches are found at the hotel district (these are artificial beaches) and the best natural beach is found at Playa del Carmen - it is awesome. The beach at the Mayan Palace is rocky and comes with the location. Many of the facilities in the area truck in or dredge in sand from other areas but the periodic hurricanes wash it away. The beaches on Cozumel are a taxi or scooter or rental car ride to the South of the island (NOT in walking distance) to San Francisco Beach for example or to the eastern shoreline (rough water but beautiful). We venture over to Cozumel each vacation visit and do a casual beer tour around the island while soaking up the beautiful sights. We don't rent while on the ferry but as we exit the ferry, go left 1/2 block on the main street, turn into the stores on the first side street, then at the end of the first block, go left again to the second building across the street. I have only had good results renting scooters and cars there. Look for the blue (chopped) VW bug in the side yard - we've squeezed 7 people into that car for two island tours on two different visits (2 in front, 3 in the back seat and 2 on the back of the back seat gripping the roll-bar. Hey, it's Mexico...and we drive very slowly. The island of Cozumel has a bar on the east side at the E-W division road - the bar is called Mezcalito's Bar & Grill. The beer is ice cold and the view is gorgeous. While doing the island tour, our kids did snuba diving (using an air hose as a breather) on the coral reefs and they had a blast. Back at the Mayan Palace, we've rented the jet skis, scuba equipment, taken diving lessons, golfed, massage at the pool, sauna, whirlpool, golf again, work out at the spa and then dined like kings to get even with the exercise. We use the bikes, tennis courts and cart paths for exercise and love the well-maintained grounds. The flowers and jungle foliage are not as plush in Cancun as they are in Puerta Vallerta, but that changing as they get closer to finishing the Cancun site (I figure it will take until 2011 based on the rate of progress in Cancun). During taxi rides and during visits, I've had the opportunity to enter several of the other hotel properties in Cancun and Playa del Carmen. Some have prettier entrances and some are closer to the night life in town. There are plusses and minuses to each of these. As we have spoken with dozens of other vacationers, we've been very pleased to discover that few hotels could offer a central location to so many attractions and with such a beautiful facility. This is not a bed & breakfast. The pool is open 24-7 and we've slept at the pool and in the palapas (covered beds) on the beach. Cancun is a convenient direct flight out of Detroit for us and why we frequent this part of Mexico.

We had a hotel-type room (no kitchen). We're a couple in our 30's and felt a bit out of place here as most of the guests are seniors. The resort is dead after 10pm. Some comments: -the food in the restaurants is awesome. Not cheap but worth it. Lunch averages $40 and dinner $60. The Tramonto restaurant is great and every single waiter we had was wonderful. We tried every restaurant. Havana Moon has a nice vibe and is a good spot for breakfast. -front desk staff will lie to your face. I couldn't believe it. -swimming in the pool during and after sunset is perfect. Its nice and warm and lit well. -the shuttles to Playa and Cancun suck. You gotta book early and stick to their limited shuttle and they're always late. The one to Cancun drops you off at a large American-style mall far from anything else. They did indeed get rid of their shuttle to the front gate...so forget about taking the collectivo (local bus) anywhere -the bed and pillows are as hard as a rock and I'm no princess. I would probably bring my own pillow. -the snorkeling trip to Puerto Morelos is great. The coral and reefs are in good shape and we saw a lot of diverse marine life. Very impressive. The best trip of the week -Chichen Itza is a site to behold! Long day but worth it, if you like that kinda stuff (we do!). -Xel Ha was a nice park with yummy food but not worth the price.

PROS: The POOLl!!!! Loved it. It's huge and the drinks at the swim up bar are wonderful! Poolside food is good too and the entertainment and sports (water volleyball, etc.) at the pool are fun. The food. The food in all the restaurants was above average. The juice bar at the breakfast buffet is great. About 10 fresh juices daily. The view. The view of the beach is also great. But you can't go in the water because of the rocks, so it is more of a tease. (see cons below). The housekeepers. They are so nice. And they try to keep ithe rooms clean. Give them a good tip, they make per week what most of us make per hour in the states. Truly. Room service. AWESOME! The breakfast buffet, besides the juice bar, was not worth more than one visit to check out local cusine. However, order from the room service menu for half the price for breakfast and be delighted!!! Great for late night snacks too!! If you're Catholic, they have Sunday Mass on the beach. Simply breathtaking and inspirational. CONS: The beds. The beds are hard as a rock. Try to imagine putting a sheet over a table and sleeping on that. That's your bed. The beds again. The beds are damp. There is a SERIOUS humidity problem in the rooms. When you get into the bed, the sheets are literally damp to the point they are somewhat wet - yuck! Kinda like trying to fall asleep in a wet towel. That alone will make me never return. The room. Because the humidity is so high in the rooms, the room smells musty, further adding to your sleeping pleasure. The walk. The walk from our room to the pool was terrible. I had recently had surgery and requested a location close to the pool. Request not honored. It's a long walk from anywhere past building 4 or 5. Trust me on this, whether you had surgery or not, it is a long walk. Night life. Cancun and Playa del Carmen are about a $80 and $40 cab ride round trip. There is nothing else in the vicinity. The activities at the hotel end around 11PM. We like to stay at the pool/beach late, eat around 8PM and go out after. By the time we were done dinner on most nights, there was nothing to do but sit in your musty, humidy and damp room. The beach. Although the beach was lovely, there are sharp rocks which make the ocean unswimable. For an ocean lover, this is a tragedy. The only time we were able to go into the ocean was when we visisted Tulum (beautiful - don't miss it!). Besides the ruins, Tulum has a magnificent beach and there is a beach 10 minutes sourth of Tulum, Paridise Beach, where there is a lovely swimming beach and an on-beach restaurant where you can hang out and relax. It's a 45 minute ride to Tulum, but definately worth the trip. The timeshare presentation. We received $60 per person room credit and 20% off our bill, however, I would have gladly given that back if I could recapture our 4 hours lost on the presentation. Like many others, when we told them we couldn't afford it, they were downright RUDE! The alleged \"top manager\" told me that \"common Mexicans could afford the timeshare and if I couldn't maybe I should get another job!\" Could you imagine that? X-Ha - Or maybe it should be X-ahhhhhhhh! DO NOT GO THERE!!! I am sure many of the people who work there are nice and honest, but the ones we ran into were liars and petty theives. We left a $40 deposit for snorkel equipt. with them in cash. They tried to keep our deposit because they said that \"other people\" didn't return their equipment. Huh!?!??!?! Then, after that story didn't fly, they said that we only left $20, and they would give us $20 back. They said this as I watched one of the guys pull one of my $20 bills from the deposit box and throw it on the floor to make it look like I only gave $20 (ybut our name is written on your deposit). In Spanish, I heard the one guy say that our bus was leaving in 5 minutes and that we would give up soon. Much to his dismay, I understood what he said and we did not give up. I also called the guy out on the $20 on the floor. As 10 employees surrounded us including one \"manager\" we argued for 45 minutes . With an asthma attack from being so annoyed, we left the park - with our $40. Of course, he was right and we missed our bus and it cost us $50 to get home by cab, but it was worth it. Damm if I will let them keep our money, I rather give it to the cab driver!! Our hotel contacted X-ha and complained. They sent us a tee-shirt. Like I would ever do any free advertising by wearing their shirt. (Can you tell I am still a bit annoyed). SUMMARY We had a nice time despite everything because of the friend we were with and everyone's ability to \"get over it\" however, If you go to Mexico, go to Cancun instead of Riveria Maya and stay at the Hilton. That hotel is fantastic and if you stay in the beachfront villas, you get breakfast and a happy hour with snacks that helps keep down the cost. It is more fun up there as well with lots of shopping and restaurants and clubs. The ocean is more blue up that end as well and the pool is just as nice. The staff is even nicer.

While it had its good points we definitely would not stay there again. Luckily we were in a building that was not too far from the beach and lobby. It would have been miserable to have been in one of the far buildings. The first night we ate at one of the restaurants and my son got food poisoning. Afterwards we went to the hotel lobby and told one of the people at the counter but they didn\u2019t seem particularly concerned or interested in helping us. The beach is nice but you can\u2019t swim in it. We saw one person who tried but her feet were cut up so much that they had to take her away in an electric cart to get first aid. Our room itself was nice and clean. There were two places on the walls with brackets for pictures but there were no pictures. Do not buy a timeshare at Mayan Palace!! Like everyone else we were told it would take 90 minutes which simply was a lie. If they can\u2019t tell the truth about how long it would take, what else are they lying about? At the beginning of our tour I said we would stay for 90 minutes. When the 2 hour mark came up the salesman kept telling us he had more to tell us. When we became insistent, and said we were not interested in buying, salesman # 2 came over and tried to convince us to buy. We have been to many timeshare presentations over the years and this was by far the most high pressure. They would not take no for an answer. Next came a manager and then another manager after that. By this time we were getting pretty frustrated. When a 5th manager came over and tried to get us to buy we finally stood up and started raising our voices. At 2 \u00bd hours they finally said they would give us our gift and we could leave. I am sure we would have been there another hour+ if we didn\u2019t get angry. There is no conceivable way that the sales presentation could ever be done in 90 minutes. As part of their sales pitch, they told us that the Mayan Group was the 3rd most sought after property in all of R.C.I. (the timeshare exchange company) which has several thousand properties. They said the timeshare we had in Maui was rated about #1000. I found it hard to believe that they were the 3rd most sought after timeshare property- it would have to be ranked higher than timeshares in London, New York City, Venice, etc... I called RCI and asked them to verify the rankings that I was told. It turns out the Mayan Palace salesman lied again! RCI said they do NOT release the ranking of individual timeshares to timeshare owners like me or timeshare properties like Mayan Palace.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Time !!\u201d", "Author": "rowboatgirl", "ReviewID": "UR12902005", "Content": "My boyfriend and I went to the Myan Palace and had a great time.

Almost everything was perfect. The food at the restaurants was superb. We ordered room service a couple times and it was good. The service was exceptional and friendly from the concierge to the housekeeping staff. The pools were amazing. The room was very large with a great bathroom. The deck with the cooling pool built in to it was large and comfortable. The hallways and common areas were always clean. The spa was wonderful. The resort was beautifully maintained. Even thought the resort was very large, we never felt crowded because it is so spread out--we were glad to be in a building that was closer to the pool areas--only about a 1/2-mile walk that was wonderful. If you are in a building that is farther away, you just have to catch the shuttles that will bring you in to the main area. We would certainly go back. The major drawbacks we discovered were that do-it-yourself laundry was inconvenient--just pay to have your laundry done if you need it. The mattresses were uncomfortable and linens fall short of the quality was saw in other parts of the resort. The food and alcohol in the little convenient store was way over priced but the bottled water was reasonable. We spent $40 to take a taxi to the Walmart in Playa del Carmen. The savings was worth the trip. Plus, you have to check out the Walmart--they have a fresh fish section, a large liquor warehouse and a humidor where you can get Cuban cigars! Even with these few drawbacks, we felt the overall experience was still excellent. Nothing that was that drastic that it ruined our stay. One last piece of advice--book activities and do them when the weather is nice and you have the opportunity. We had wonderful weather the first 4 days and expected it would be that way the rest of the week so we booked snorkeling trips and were going to parasail later in the week. On New Year's Day afternoon, the weather changed, it got cooler and cloudy. It also became very windy so all of the snorkeling and parasailing was canceled. If you want to do something like kayak, snorkel, parasail and the weather is nice--just do it so you don't regret it later.

The experience is aesthetically paradisal: every plant and tree in its special place, manicured daily by dozens of gardeners. The pool area is extensive and spotlessly clean. The food is excellent if Mexican--spices used creatively: best tortilla soup, for instance, among other delights. If another cuisine, however, it's merely passable: e.g. Italian or Chinese. The staff is almost studiously polite and smiling most of the time. The rooms are spacious and the kitchen well-designed; the maid service very good. The minor downside is the distance from the rooms to the restaurants and poolside/beach area. This is overcome for the most part by shuttle carts, but still there is a small wait. The big problem is the distance of the resort from Playa del Carmen: nearly half an hour's ride and $20 each way in a cab. Alternately, you can sign up for the $8 r/t shuttle bus that leaves every two hours. In between these two issues is the beach site, which is beautifully situated but with a rocky entry to the water: something which may be addressed by water slippers and eventually some sort of bulldozing.

We were a group of 14 with two 2 bedroom units the first night and one more additional 2 bedroom unit the second night (did not have availability for all three units the first night when we booked back in July and also checking back periodically) At check in we showed our confirmation slips and asked if by chance anything was available so we could all be in our units that night and they very nicely accomodated us. Two units were in building 3 right next to each other and the other was in building 4...so, very convenient. Not sure how they decide who gets what units. We are not owners ourselves but rented from an owner (off the internet) although the other couple we were traveling with are owners. This resort is big and I have never thought anything of it in the past as we love the walking but this year we had someone with us that has a harder time walking long distances so I have learned to look at it through her eyes too and it was a little more challenging for her. I personally loved walking the grounds and the beaches. Service was great everywhere. We ate at most of the restaurants and had room service a number of times...all were good. And of course beverages and lunch by the pool. We did rent the palapa beds the first day (3 of them at $30 per bed...but if you spend that in food and beverages by the pool that day you get the rental fee credited) We did notice that a lot of the beds go unused because of the rental fee which is a shame but it is far better than the first come first served....save the beds with a towel...cut throat method that was used in the past (I will show you my scars from two years ago if I have to :).....I didn't think they enforced the rental thing after the first day because no one came around to check to see if we had proof of rental that first day...so later in the week, rather than wait in line to rent a palapa we just used one knowing we were going to spend more than that by the pool that day anyway. Low and behold...someone did come around that day to check for a rental slip and I didn't have one but had already spent more than that poolside so they let it go for that day. Check out was a breeze and all room charges were correct though we did have to ask them to remove the first days palapa rental which they did immediately. One last thing.....they have added shuttle service to Playa del Carmen which is a good thing at $4 per person round trip. We were just never able to use it due to it always being full when we wanted it and not having any early departures (starts at 9am) Because of the new shuttle service they have stopped providing complimentary shuttle service out to the road to make it easier for us to catch the bus or the playa express. As I said....if you have difficulty walking far this is not easy so we were forced to rent a taxi to get us out to the main gate. At $1 per person each way it added up. (although for walkers it is only about 3/4 of a mile or so if I had to guess) That's it I guess....we did go off site 4 days of our vacation...Isla Mujeres, Xel-ha, shopping in Playa and our Edventure tour (our best tour ever!)", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cWorked for us\u201d", "Author": "joey125", "ReviewID": "UR12563670", "Content": "We were at the Mayan Palace for a week and found a lot of the reviews to have been very helpful. Because of being 30 minutes from Cancun and 20 minutes from Playa Del Carmen and wanting traveling flexibility we rented a car from Caribbean-rent-car (full insurance) which went very well. They're a good company and quote their full price up front, no gimmicks or monkey-business when you return the car assuming you have taken care of the car which we had. Otherwise it looked like a taxi ride (which we never took) was about $40 roundtrip to Playa Del Carmen. And it is a very long hike on the resort road to the to the very busy highway if you are thinking about catching a bus or collectivo by the side of the road. It can be done, but I wouldn't do it with children, adults only. If you do rent a car, you will need cash (pesos but will probably take dollars) for gas. No credit cards were taken. The buildings for the Mayan Palace are in the shape of an 'I' from the beach towards the road with Number 1 being the closest and Number 21 the furthest (closest to the car parking lot). They do have trams running every 10 minutes so you don't have to walk. e didn't mind the walking since you didn't feel guilty about eating a little extra while on vacation. If you have a toddler, bring a stroller, and bring a backpack to haul stuff back and for forth from the pool/beach. Our room was very nice, had a living/kitchen/dining area, 2 bedroom (1 king and 2 double bed), 2 bath. It was intended to sleep 6 as the living room has a couch pullout which we didn't use. The pool is very large, multi-level and nice. The pool area is big enough that you could always find a chair somewhere. The beach area was all right, but you needed rafting shoes or sandals in order to go into the ocean to swim/wave jump (fun) /snorkel. Otherwise the rocks are too sharp/uneven for bare feet, although some people did go in with their barefeet. At check-in we were asked about attending the timeshare presentation for a $100 room discount and 10% off activities. We didn't do it after reading the reviews but the couple we were with did (hadn't read the reviews). The '90' minutes presentation turned into 4.5 hours, and the couple said they were closed on 4 different times and was very high pressure, the most they had ever seen and they've been to a number of these. Finally after saying no many many times, they literally had to get up and walk away. They might have considered buying but didn't like the feeling of getting pushed into it. There are multiple restaurants onsite. A couple are comparable with the mid-priced chains in the states, and the other 2 are a little more upscale. For example, the \"upscale\" breakfast buffet is $21 per person and the nightly buffet (menu changes nightly) at that restaurant is $34 per person. There is a breakfast buffet at the 19th hole (the golf range restaurant) which is small but $12. We ate there once and liked it. For a cheaper alternative and food on the go, hit the grocery stores in Playa Del Carmen. In our room was one of the mini-fridges so not a lot of space and the little freezer in it did not work (ice cream turned into sludgy soup). On 30th avenue in Playa between Constitution Ave and Juarez Avenue is a Walmart and also a Mega for groceries. We went to Walmart twice since we were driving right by, but the 2nd time they did not have any milk, completely out. Don't know what the Mega store is like but it looked big. The resort did have a nice gym, cardio equipment, free weights and machines but charge $10 a day per person, or $50 per week per person or $70 per week for 2. I went once for fun. There is also a spa (didn't go to it) and a little fitness cafe where I picked up a protein smoothie ($8.50).

I'm happy to say, we didn't experience any of the problems that people spoke about and we would definitely return to Mayan Palace in Riviera Maya. Mayan Palace was a beautiful facility. Our arrival was a bit confusing and we were almost talked into taking a taxi even though we had scheduled transportation from the hotel. First time visitors should be very leery of the airport \u201chelpers\u201d they tried to talk into us into taking a taxi for nearly $100 (US) from the airport to the hotel. Take the hotel transportation it is much cheaper, $15 (US) per person. Our accommodations were very nice; the room was huge and very clean. Only draw back to the rooms were the walls. The walls are very thin; you can hear a lot of what is going on in the rooms around you. Although I've experience that in the majority of hotels and resort sites I've stayed in. As for the facility layout, it is really spread out so you did have to walk a ways to the pools, restaurants, and beach. My husband and I didn't mind the walk and they did provide transportation to this area. The staff was exceptionally pleasant and very accommodating. The majority of the staff in the lobby and primary areas spoke clear English. They were also very patient and easy to work with when we had questions or had to make last minute changes. The pool area was beautiful and huge. As with most resorts you had to get to the pool early for seats. The cabana rentals are worth the $30 (US) for use the entire day at the pool. The water line in front of the resort is covered with large, jagged rocks which made it difficult to impossible to swim in this area. The beach was clean and sandy. The restaurants had fair to excellent food variety. The service was a bit slower than we were accustom to, but we did get used to \"Mexican time\" as it was termed. The pricing was fair for both the food and beverages. We would definitely recommend the 19th hole snack bar, they had an a great breakfast buffet. Also the Havana Moon was great for lunch and dinner. We did take few excursions through the hotel agency. The prices are a bit high, but the trips we took included all food and drink expenses. The location of the resort seems to be about in between Cancun and Playa del Carmen, so anywhere you go there will be an hour or more drive for most of the activities. The buses are very comfortable. The tour guides were very helpful. We would strongly recommend taking the premium package for Chichen Itza. Our tour guide, Mac, was excellent. He was extremely informative, spoke very clear English, and had a lot of fun with his job. Additional his assistant, Andres, was very helpful and a lot of fun.

Then make sure that you actually get the 10% discount off of your bill, because they will forget to deduct it. And keep an eye on any valuables do not give them to the bellman.

We exchanged through RCI. I will say that after booking I was a little nervous after reading reviews. We had a great time at this resort; however, I don't think I would go back to it. This place is HUGE! It took us 15 minutes to walk to the pool, which was fine because if you didn't want to walk you could take the trams that come by ever 5 to 10 minutes. We were in building 16. I enjoyed that the resort was soo big. The walk to the pool allowed us to walk off all the calories from the night before. The pool was the biggest I've ever seen so it never seemed too crowed. We'd get down there around 830 or 9 am and never have trouble finding a spot. It was nice not having to play the towel game. The reason I wouldn't go back to this place is because it is a non-all inclusive. We usually do all inclusive so this was a bit of a change for us. The resort was 15 minutes from Playa and 30 from Cancun so you'd either have to pay for a taxi or plan at least a day ahead to take the hotel shuttle to town. We did make some meals in the room. If you plan to eat or drink at the resort expect to pay for it. As far as resorts go, the food and drinks weren't the most expensive but they weren't exactly cheap either. Beers are $3.50. Mixed drinks range from $6 - 10. Food ranges from $9 for a Hamburger to $15 for a pizza. The buffet is what gets you. We had no idea what the cost would be and it ended up being $25 per person. Yikes! We still had fun though. We did the happy hour at the pool from 11-1 they have 2 for 1 drinks. Then each day they have a drink of the day until 5 that is 2 for 1. You have to ask what it is though. They don't offer that up. The service here was great! We were missing a remote and they brought it to us with in minutes of calling. All of the bartenders, waiters, and front desk staff went over and above what we expected. As others have said, the beach is terrible here! You cannot swim in it. You can't even hardly walk in the water because it's so rocky! I know the hotel is trying to rebuild the beach but they could at least clean up the trash that has collected on it for not. There was trash everywhere on the beach. It was quite sad.

I could be wrong but I have the feeling that a number of people who have written negative reviews abut the Mayan may have felt blind sided by time share presentations and then let that color their entire stay.

Time share sales are what they are and if you are tempted by the incentives, then you should be prepared for the pressure. \"time share sales reality\" We have been time share owners for 5 years and booked this stay through RCI. We are family of 6 including 4 teenage children and we all went on the vacation and stayed in a 2 bedroom unit with the galley kitchen in the living area. This was, without exception, our best time share vacation ever. The size of the resort meant that there were always activities going on if you chose to partake. Or you could comfortably do nothing. Fortunately, the weather was stellar during our visit. My wife and I both are gym goers and the they had a great gym for a resort, that you may or may not have to pay to use depending on some color coded wristband system that I never fully understood. Certainly one of the best pools I have ever seen and the palapas were great, especially when you consider that you get the $30 reservation fee back in poolside pool and drink which was never a problem for our size of family. Personally, we liked the cashless system. We also used the spa which was very nice as well. As for the beach and the rocks, well, we had a great time turning rocks over and discovering the sea life that dwelled below. The beach itself is very nice. Just not good for swimming in the water.

After checking in we were told to go talk to these people about our room assignments, but they were only interested in selling us a timeshare! (Everywhere we went the whole trip someone was trying to sell us a timeshare & we werent even safe from harassment in the hotel! ) What was most upsetting was that we traded a suite with a full kitchen and living room through RCI for a hotel room with two double beds that was tiny and smelled really bad, I assume it was mold from the humidity. I had read some reviews on this website just before we left and thought \"how bad could the smell really be\" IT WAS BAD. When we got there, I didnt think I would be able to get used to it. Keeping the air on helped some, but people with asthma or bad allergies should stay away from this hotel. I was really suprised how bad the room was for all that money they charge! We asked for a refigerator and or a microwave at least 4 times and the staff kept telling us they would look but never got back to us. The other thing that bothered me about the hotel is that they do not accept cash at any restaurant, store, or bar at the hotel. They make you keep a line of credit and charge everything to your room. I was annoyed that we HAD to do this and it was obviously a way to encourage more spending since you are charging everything to the room the whole trip. The hotel was also not near anything!!! It is so much farther from Cancun then we thought, it cost $45 by cab to get there. We took some buses to keep costs down but the hotel did not give out any information on city buses! They acted as if they did not know because they want you to take their shuttles, which are more reasonable than cabs, but the city bus was only a few pesos. The pool was nice, I wish it would have been heated because even though it was 85 degrees outside, the water was always freezing and too cold to swim after 3pm. Another thing I hadn't realized is that the beach that the hotel is on is so rocky that you cant swim in it. I saw one person trying to walk out between the ginormous rocks the whole time I was there. The beach was pretty to look at, and a lot of people would lay out tanning there. The beach and the pool were a decent walk from the main buidling, you can take the shuttles that go around the hotel but sometimes there was a really long wait for them. At the end of our 7 day trip we had grown very tired of the menus at the restaurants and some things were very overpriced. We had planned on getting a couples massage at the spa, the prices were comparable to spas in the US. We decided that we didnt want to give the hotel any more money and would just do it elsewhere. On a positive note, the hotel was beautifully landscaped and they did have a few activities going on, and the staff was nice for the most part.

Must do your homework planning !!\u201d", "Author": "behmrt", "ReviewID": "UR11223635", "Content": "This was our first time visit to Mayan Palace Cancun, November 7-14, 2007. Have been to Mayan Palace Puerto Vallarta Marina in January 2007. Would rate both properties 1st rate resorts for vacations. For those who complain......\"you can please some people some of the time, but not all people all the time.\" Traveler note: THIS IS A TIMESHARE PROPERTY ! Their goal is to sell you a timeshare contract. No different then you visiting a automobile showroom.........the car salemen will attempt to sell you a car. Here are some tips for travelers and one's I need to remind myself to use on my next visit: 1)Rent a car on CheapTickets.com.....the Mayan Palace is not in Cancun, it is 25 minutes drive south. Your 5 or 7 day vacation should not be wasted seeking public transportation. 2)The car rental employee when asking for a map, will give one and solict you to attend a timeshare presentation. The offer will be for $150 - 200 US cash, plus local trip(s). Ask for it in writing. 3)Mayan Palace check-in will be near 5 PM. Reason: check out is 11 AM - 12 PM. Change into your swim suit and hang at the pool. 4)Before reaching the check-in desk, you will encounter a \"Mayan Palace Greeter.\" She will share information on resort layout and solict you for a buffet breakfast and 90 minute (seldom less then 120 minutes) timeshare presentation. Note she / he will match the offer from the car rental agency, plus 10% discount on your meals and drink charges. All this adds up to reduced food and drink outlay, which saves you money. 5)This property has 20 to 30 3 story buildings ! When you make your reservation REQUEST BUILDINGS #1 THRU #7. #1 is adjacent to the pool and #7 nearest to lobby and car parking lot. All other building require walking and/or waiting for electric tram shuttle. 6)Request a 3rd floor unit; otherwise, 1st and 2nd floor southside units look into trees.....no oceanview rooms anywhere at this resort. 7)Yes; the beach front is rocky; however, stroll 150 yards south and enjoy super beach.....no people. 8)Use your car rental to visit Playa de Carmen. Easy street parking, great beach and 5th Avenue is a nice change from pool lounging. Visit Tulum and Porto Moreles. 9)Drive north thru Cancun's Hotel Zone.......boring. Avoid Old Cancun, it is like a Texas border town. Do take the ferry to Isla Mujeres and rent a golf cart for a hour's drive around the small island. 10)Take the \"basic Chichen Itza\" lower priced tour. The tour is best with an English speaking guide, so do not attempt to save money and drive your rental car. It takes 12 hours, you leave at 7:40 AM and return at 7:30 PM. Do not recommend driving after dark in Mexico. Only difference with the \"premium tour\" is that they offer hard liquor vs beer. 11)Purchase your room food and beverage items at the MEGA Store in Playa de Carmen.......not at the Mayan Palace grocery store (prices are quite high). 12)Remember that the 10% discount on room charges applies only to resturant and bar tabs. Use it or lose it. 13)Timeshare sales defenses: Answer their survey with you only take 1 week vacation on odd numbered years, this is your 1st timeshare presentation, you'd rather spend your vacation at your uncle's lake cabin, you're not sure you'll have employment when you return home. Remember ! The sales person, the sales Mgr and the vacation sales person is not your friend ! They have a job to do and your's is to finish as close to 90 minutes and take your freebies. 14)Monday night football on the big screen in the 2nd floor bar off the pool area. Rooms offer 4 English speaking TV channels. 15)Use the lobby ATM for Mexican peso dollars. Many resturants in Yucatan Peninsula will not take your Visa, MasterCard. 16)With a tan braclet, owner or guest of a owner, go use the Mayan Palace Grand sand beach pool and bar. 17)Evening floor show at the Del Lago is great. You need to only order a drink. Would we return........in a heartbeat ! Staff is friendly, helpful and always greet you with \"Ola.\" Try and find that in the USA ! The pool staff works hard to entertain children and adults, alike. It is not unusal that the car rental and Mayan Palace requires a deposit from your credit card. On check out, just ask for the imprint. People complain about the resturarnt memo prices...it is a capative resort people.

We loved almost every minute of our vacation and I'd like to encourage everyone to give it a try. Of course if you're on Spring Break or you're young and want to party all night in downtown Cancun, I'd recommend booking someplace closer to town. If you're out for a relaxing week at a luxury resort where you can relax and get a tan, this is the perfect place. And if you venture out a few days to visit Tulum or Xel-Ha, just rent a car for the day and have a great time. And please, as a current owner who's been through the presentation, do not book the four-hour timeshare sales presentation. Even if you escape the \"room-of-doom\" unscathed, it will ruin the rest of the day as you stew over the high-pressure ordeal...all for a lousy hundred bucks and ten-percent off your tab. Shop the secondary internet resale market if you really want to own a timeshare. And yeah, the beach is beautiful and very useful for everything except swimming. That's fine, just bring a kite or lounge around all day in the sand while drinking a cervesa or two. My advice is to NOT bring your water shoes. You don't want to venture out in all those rocks and have a wave knock you into that coral. For 46 bucks you can charter a boat at the activities center on the beach and they'll take you out on their boat to two locations for snorkeling, plus stop at a beautiful beach where you can play in the waves. I understand you can do the same thing for much less in PDC or Puerto Morales, but you'd have to have a rental car. Information is the only thing lacking at the Mayan resorts. That's why tripadvisor is so useful for us. You learn more by reading these reviews than you'll ever learn at the \"presentation\". Here are a few things we learned this week: - Breakfast Buffet at the 19th Hole Snack Bar, Monday-Saturday. 12 bucks which includes the tip. Very quaint, cook to order eggs, and a beautiful setting. Very informal. - Havana Moon Restaurant. Awesome, but you might ask for a table outside if the music is too loud. Try the Pad-Thai or the Skirt Steak Tacos. - Golf was great. 69 bucks which includes rental clubs and cart. Get an early tee time before the hackers arrive around 9am. You can play as a single and blow through the course in 2 hours. Very challenging...lots of water and sand. Good condition. Par 54 with 18 holes. - Settle your bill and check out the night before you leave. Save your receipts. Sometimes you'll find an extra charge on your account and they have no problem removing it, but if you wait until the morning of checkout there won't be time. - Mayan vans to the Cancun Airport run 15 bucks/person, and leave on the hour. The guy was right on time and we had no problem arriving at the airport 90 minutes prior to our flight. - Personal preference, but when you arrive and when you leave, just load up one of your pockets with one-dollar bills and hand'em out for tips along the way. It's not worth humping your bags all over the resort and to the room for the 4 or 5 bucks it will cost for someone else to do it. Heck, just one Margarita will cost you seven bucks anyways, so why scrimp here? - Remember you're in another country. 10 minutes in Mexico might end up being 15. And every day is different when it comes to maid service. Some days you'll have two washcloths, and other days you won't have any. Never could figure that one out. - Some folks who might have a physical limitation have a legitimate reason to complain about the distance to/from the pool. As for me, the ten minute walk back to the room counted as my aerobic workout for the day and made me feel better about eating that order of chips and guacomole. ;- ) Bye the way, the guac is phenomenal, and only six bucks. - We didn't go this year, but the Mexican Fiesta on Thursday night looked fantastic from afar. Wish I would have attended. Instead I got caught up watching the Green Bay game on the big-screen projector up in the Tramonto Bar. It was a lot of fun having both Dallas and Green Bay fans in the same place. We had a great time. - Internet: 7 bucks/hour upstairs from the gift shop. If you bring your laptop they do offer wireless access for the same price, but only within range of the internet cafe. Even then I had to get the attendant to help me set things up. He'll look at your ip address and configure that connection on his end for service. Once that's set up you can get a fairly good signal at the pool, just outside of the cafe. There was often a wait for the desktop pc's in the cafe. - Rooms: Beautiful as stated on this site, but as with a lot of the rooms in Mexico there was a damp, musty smell at times. We had a ground floor unit in Building 9 of the Grand Mayan. Someone told me they switched to a room on the 3rd floor and the room smelled much better. Maybe some air-fresheners might work...I don't know. And hot water: sometime lacking first thing in the morning. Not sure if they use it doing laundry or what. I woke up at 4:30 am on departure day only to shower in lukewarm water. Food: What worked for us was a breakfast buffet in the morning, and room service at night. Average room service tab for two was 37 dollars. Try the Skirt Steak...yummy. Drink: Every day there is a \"drink of the day\", but it's usually something off the wall that isn't worth the 2 for 1 price. The day we did the drink special they were serving Fuzzy-Navels. Yuck. Anyway, happy hour is 11-1 at the pool. And 3-5 at the 19th Hole. My wife's drink was a \"Mudslide\" (very good btw), and I stuck with Negra Modello. The beer comes in a bucket with ice, which comes in handy to keep the other 2 for 1 drinks cold. Pool: Get there early if you want a chair at the Grand Mayan Pool. The main pool had lots of chairs open, so no need to hurry down there. The water was on the cool side, but very refreshing this time of year. That's all for now. Feel free to contact me with any questions. We've been going the Mayan resorts for almost ten years now, so obviously we love it. Just skip the \"presentation\" and you'll have an absolutely wonderful vacation.

I had read recent reviews and was more than nervous about the negative comments that had been posted, especially since I was the one who coordinated the whole trip, but absolutely everything was wonderful. From the check in to the check out, everything went very smoothly. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our favorite was the young man who cleaned the floors in the hallways every day. He always greeted us with a smiling \"Buenos Dias Senoritas!\" and told us to have a wonderful day. That about sums up the attitude of all of the staff. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which had a ref, stove, sink, & microwave in the kitchen area, 2 pull-out sofas in the living area, and a king sized bed in the bedroom.

After hearing all the complaints about how far away the beach and pool were, I was nervous, but the tram came about every 10 minutes, and the walk to the pool was just not all that far (about 5-10 minutes) and very lovely. The pool was absolutely gorgeous and ENORMOUS! We rented palapas on 2 different days. With the food that we ordered poolside, the palapa cost was reimbursed. It was nice to have a shady place to relax after sunning on the beach or by the pool. Although the ocean was rocky for swimming, the beach was immaculate and the sand powdery white. We ate at the beachside restaurant and the restaurant by the pool and both had great food at reasonable prices (definitely get the guacamole!) The service was excellent. In all, we had a marvelous week and would absolutely go back. Just a few notes about some of the other activities....definitely go to Chichen Itza to see the Mayan ruins. This is the best place to get souveniers (and cheapest). Its a long day, but well worth it. We took a tour and the guide was very knowledgeable of the history of the Mayans. (I wouldn't have rented a car since we were 4 women and the police were very liberal about stopping cars) We also went to Xcaret which was a wonderful place, but I learned a few tips: 1) Go early (we didn't get there until noon and didn't have time to do all the activities); 2) Snorkel down the river, but don't turn in your equipment at the end if you want to snorkel any other times during the day....you will have to re-rent it.", "Date": "November 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "mermelindo", "ReviewID": "UR10873096", "Content": "I spent one week at the Mayan Palace and I can only say good things about the place. We were four people and we stayed in a suite with two bedrooms. First off, the rooms were gigantic. It is easily 5 times (no exaggeration here) the size of any room in any hotel that you pay 3X as much in Montauk,NY. They were beautifully decorated, and quiet. I recommend people to stay in any building from #1 to 7 so you can walk to the beach and pool area. Call them prior to your arrival to request it. The service at the resort was impeccable. Everyone was extremely nice and polite, even late at night (most of the time for us). The facility is beautiful, they do have an amazing taste. From the decoration of the pool area all the way to the restaurant and lounging area, everything looks just amazing. The restaurants are beautiful, even though we did not eat there since we went everyday to Playa Del Carmen. We did have the US $20 breakfast buffet on our last day, and even though it's kind of pricey the food and location made it totally worth it. The gym is great, with lots of equipment and spinning class. While at the pool make sure to ask about the drink of the day, so you can have two for the price of one. They also offer a happy hour every day from 10 to 1PM, which is 2 drinks for the price of 1. The only thing that I did not enjoy at the resort was the beach. It is rocky even though from the outside it looks gorgeous. One way around it is to take a rubber sandal with you so you can deal with the rocks at the bottom. But there are so many other beautiful beaches (Playa Del Carmen, Akumal, Punta Solimao) in that area that we did not mind. Couple things that I recommend people to do to get the best out of their trip to that region of Mexico: 1- Rent a car. It's cheap and there is a lot to see all around it. 2- Eat at least once at this place called \"La Cueva Del Chango\" in Playa Del Carmen. (38 Street below 5th avenue). The food there is amazing, the decor is just fantastic and the service very friendly. Our waiter Paolo is a great, if you go there ask for him. 3- Have a drink on the beach at night at Fusion (Playa...). Beautiful place with a live band singing jazz, Brazilian and Spanish music and the crowd is mainly made of 26-45 yo. 4- Go to X-caret and do the river under the tunnel thing and then have a drink on the beach there. Don't stay for the show, it's crapy, but the buffet is pretty good. If you don't want to spend too much money, bring your own food and snorkeling equipment. 5- If you like snorkeling, it's worth buying your equipment in the US and take it with you to Mexico. They charge you a lot to rent it US$8 and you just don't know what kind of mouth has used in the past. In NY I paid US$19 for it and it saved me already a lot of money. 6- Go to Cenote (underwater caves). Dos Ohos (two eyes) and Gran (big) Cenote, are two of the best ones. 7- Check the Mayan ruins, there are a bunch of them. Have fun.

We read all of the reviews. The latest ones scared us and we expected the worst ... MUST say that we were pleasantly surprised. We stayed in a one bedroom suite in the building connected to the lobby (building 10) ... we just had to walk down a hall, take the elevator up to 2 and our room was right there! Shuttles for everywhere on the property were right downstairs off the lobby or we could walk 5-10 minutes to the pool/beach/store/bar/restaurant etc. It is a nice walk! The grounds are well maintained! I did NOT see lizzards, iguanas, scary things mentioned in other reviews!!! (I saw ONE iguana on the way back from the beach in a tram) ... and no bugs except the tiny microscopic ones that hung out in or around our sinks in our suite. I did get itchy bug bites on my feet and ankles ... I suggest possibly bringing some OFF bug towelettes in your beach bag and apply shortly before sunset or bringing some cortizone. This was obviously the slow season ... mostly older people, honeymooners and couples with small children which was nice!! No long lines, no long waits. The staff was relaxed, cheerful and helpful. The weather was perfect. It drizzled one morning before we left our room but other than that ... NO rain. There are two dfferent resorts on this property .. The Mayan PaIace and the Grand Mayan ... I believe the Mayan Palace is the older (not as nice) of the two from talking to others who were staying at the Grand. Yes our blankets were worn and some of the sheets had stains ... BUT they were clean!! I didn't need brand new sheets ... just the bleached clean ones that I got! I smelled the musty smell only when I entered the suite ... I am not entirely certain where the smell was coming from .. possibly the giant vent over the door? BUT the room was sparkling white ... I imagine a lot of bleach and chlorine is used at this place. The climate is a bit on the humid side ... so of course you are gonna get that smell ... I was utterly amazed at how clean the rooms were ... There are two maids ... one who comes in the morning and another who comes in late and turns down your bed and makes up the couches for sleeping if you have more than 2 people. Our night maid left candy kisses on the turned down sheets. We live outside of Chicago ... so the prices at the resort were not unexpected ... soda is 27 pesos ... MX domestic beer 37 pesos ... mixed drinks anywhere between 75 - 105 pesos a piece ... cheeseburger/fries 90 pesos ... we figured on the high side and that it would cost $2.70, $3.70, $7.50-$10.50 and $9.00 ... so in the end we were again pleasantly surprised! The resort wont accept cash for anything! Everything was charged to our room and everything has a 15% gratuiity included (except the spa treatments and the store)! The henna tattoes that are done by the pool ARE cash basis (possibly the braiding and souvenirs by the pool too?) We kept all of our yellow receipts and they all added up to what they billed us on check-out. You can ask the conceirge for your bill ahead of time and they will print it for you. I could see that in the busy season the shuttles to the beach etc could have long lines ... so a building closer to the beach (1-8) would be preferable!! Happy hour on the beach and at the pool is 11-1PM ... but there is also a \"drink of the day\" that you can get 2 for 1 on the beach or at the pool all day long so don't forget to ask what it is. Angel (a waiter by the pool) was great! The cocoloco drink comes in a giant coconut that has been decorated to look like a face ... it is worth getting if only to get your picture with it LOL I think one of the restaurants has a happy hour from 7-8. Since the property is between Playa del Carmen and Cancun ... getting the $1.50 Playa Express to either of these places is difficult! They were mostly always full even in the slow season ... so you can try one of the other shuttles that are around $2.50 ... a taxi ride is gonna cost you like $15-25! The city bus ... if you can handle it ... is cheap!! Just stand on the side of the busy highway and wave them down LOL We went off the resort property when we got there (Playa del Carmen Walmart for food) and then MWF. Monday to Cancun, Wednesday to Playa del Carmen and Friday to Isla Mujeres ... between that and shopping at Walmart when we first arrived we benefitted by NOT getting an all inclusive rate!! So weigh your options before choosing all-inclusive. Havana Moon restaurant on the beach at the resort was beautiful! We ate outside on the terrace several times. The beach at the resort is beautiful BUT if you walk into the water there are a lot of rocks (hurrican damage) so bring your water shoes if you want to swim in the ocean at the resort. You can rent a lounge chair/umbrella at Playa Norte in Isla Mujeres ... and that beach is stunning!! White sand and blue water with no rocks or anything! They also have hammocks on the beach. Rental fees can be steep but it was worth it for us to do it for a day! The water taxi from Port Jaurez in Cancun is about $7 US for a round trip! You can rent a golf cart to tour the island on your own. Highly recommend visting this island as a day trip! They are also rebuilding so it is amazing to see everytthing from how the poor are currently living to the hurricane damaged homes to the rebuilt gorgeous ones! One of the new houses is shaped like a beautiful white conch shell ... the ruins at the south end of the island are interesting, the restaurant on the cliff there was beautiful/restful/peaceful when we went ... and I got to see a few iguanas there!! Senior Frogs in Cancun was a lot of fun ... Rudy (a waiter) was hysterical! If you have never been here ... you have to try it! There is also a Senior Frogs in Playa del Carmen! Don't be surprised to see a truck load of armed soldiers lurking outside of a bar ... they won't talk to you if you approach them ... they look all serious and mean ... we just ignored them when we walked by ... heavily armed police are all over the busy highways. Not gonna talk about the crazy drivers down there LOL Off the resort ... it would be a good thing to have known a little Spanish (besides the common tourist phrases) ... and their money system!! They love US dollars ... but dont ever expect the correct change if you use it so bring a lot of small bills if you are not using Pesos!! LOL For 3 gurls in a foreign country ... I never felt at risk ... even after dark off the resort grounds ... it was creepy at times ... but never had any problems! I suppose everyone is going to have different opinions on their trip ... so the opinions voiced here could be partly the reviewers perception or attitude at the time? I can only say that I can't imagine a better trip for the money! I can't think of anything else ... I will try to upload some of my 850 pictures ;o) ...

The service is amazing and I can't believe how many workers are there. Yes the place is humungous and you do have to take a tram to get from here to there, but really it isn't that bad. We were in the very last building, as far from the lobby as possible, yet we walked from time to time. Once you get to the lobby, the walk to the pool is literally no more than 5 minutes. If you are extremely overweight or just lazy than yes you won't like waiting for the tram to the pool. The walk to the pool is very pretty with lots of lizards to look at along the way. As for the trips into Playa Del Carmen it is $20 for a cab, but only $1.50 for the local shuttle. The shuttle picks you up across the highway and makes stops here and there but it is not bad at all. Those who paid for a taxi each time into town are foolish. As for the atmosphere the pool is where to be. The pool is humungous and there are servers running around everywhere. I spent the large portion of my last day at one of the two swim - up bars. Food was excellent. Get the Guacamole!!! Reasonably priced roomservice and what do you expect for 24 hour service, a full restaurant?

If you're going in October (or any other time during the rainy season) you should be prepared...and bring an umbrella. while it was occasionally sunny throughout the day, it also POURED and the humidity was sky-high. (Was still better than being home though as it was on average about 85 degrees.) 1. bring several pairs of shoes that can get wet. Thankfully I brought one pair - wore them almost the entire stay! 2. bring more clothes than you think you need - again, we got soaked, and you can't dry out your clothes because of the humidity. I had a skirt hanging for 3 days and was still damp when I got home! They do have a reasonable laundry service - about a dollar to wash and dry a shirt. 3. I noticed a previous poster said something about the mold. we didn't notice any mold on the walls when we checked in, but by the end of the week there was a bit. The rooms are very clean and nice otherwise just be prepared - especially if you have mold allergies! Additional tips: 1. Don't bother renting a car. They have a free shuttle from the airport (walk out of the terminal and past all the timeshare salespeople and ask someone where the shuttle is to the Mayan Palace.) You can easily catch a Playa Express shuttle from the resort to Playa del Carmen or Cancun for $1.50 - $3 each way. The bus station in Playa del Carmen will have service to pretty much anywhere you want to go, including Tulum, Chitza Nitza (sp) or anywhere else. Same in Cancun. 2. Bring bugspray!! I have about 30 bites on my legs... don't know if this is normal because my husband has maybe 2. But I wish I'd had it. 3. They fumagate the property from 5:00 to 8:00 at night. (not continuously, but you'll see the workers around with their smoke machines.) It's not toxic, or horrible smelling - just be prepared. But again note that it doesn't get rid of ALL the bugs! 4. The resort is pretty big, but walking isn't a big deal, and there are plenty of shuttles around so you don't have to walk if you don't have to. 5. The staff speaks english for the most part and is extremely friendly, but they appreciate any bit of effort to try to speak spanish. I only wish I'd known more! 6. The restaurants are reasonable priced, but you can also get grocery supplies in the store at the resort. Don't rush off to WalMart as most of us did unless you want to go for the experience. The resort shop is slightly more, but not enough to warrent the hassle of the trip to WalMart and back. 7. There is a \"show\" on Thursday evening that is worth seeing... however be prepared as they don't tell you how much it is when you make your reservation. I believe it was $59 per person, and they always include a 15% tip for everything. You can also just go for drinks and the show for $29 - but they won't tell you that! The buffet was pretty good, but I'd rather have eaten beforehand. This review might seem a little negative, but really we had a very nice and relaxing time.

We stayed in building three. The room smelled musty and everything in the room stayed damp. We live in Houston so we know about humidity. This was a mold problem. The backing of the mirror in the bath room was so bad that you had to \"position\" yourself to see your reflection. The bed spread, pillows, curtains were not in a condition to be donated to the Salavation Army. Upon complaint we received some type of machine which was suppose to eliminate the smell and a free brk buffet. I also had a problem with the difference in the way the Mayan guest were treated vs the Grand Mayan guest. For example, if you stayed at the Mayan you were allowed only one pool towel, yet if you stayed at the Grand you allowed unlimited towels. Has upper management obtained a study that determines Mayan guest rip towles off where as the Grand guest do not?

We rented a cabana every day we were there to try and keep the sun off our 6 month old (and my very fair skinned brother!) It was $30 but if you bought $30 worth of food or drinks they would credit the $30 rental back. The best part of this place is that they a have scuba diving boat and shop on site. All you have to do is walk down there and get on the boat and dive. Ross was a fanstasic diving guide. We were in building number 12 which is near the lobby and it took maybe 5 minutes to walk to the pool. My husband and 3 year old would take the shuttle and I would walk with a stroller with my 6 month old and we would get there about the same time.

We had a morning maid that cleaned and made the beds. We had a evening maid that took the bedspreads and decorative pillows from the beds and turned the sheets down. She always left chocolate kisses on the pillows. We only ate two meals at the Mayan Palace. One meal was at the Balche Poolside Snack Bar. We had a small problem because we had been swimming and only had tank tops, and they require shirts with sleeves in the evening for men. They lent us a shirt and the meal was awesome, but expensive. We had room service for breakfast the last day. It was very good, and not much more expensive than if we had gone to a restaurant. We rented and car and it was great. We got it from National. If you get a car from them avoid the time share shark at the table outside the office. We drove to Tulum, Puerto Aventuras, Playa del Carmen, Hidden World cenotes, Puerto Morelos, Xpu-Ha, Xel-Ha, Paamul, and Cancun. We went fishing, sailing, snokeling, parasailing, swimming, and shopping. The best shopping deals for souvenioirs we found were in Cancun in the shopping by Chedraui grocery store. We like Chedraui and Mega better than Wal Mart for groceries in Playa. We got stopped while driving by the army. They searched our car for drugs and weapons. I hear that this is not uncommon, so don't be alarmed if it happens to you. We saw army road blocks on th opposite side of the highway twice after we were stopped.

The trip was a 59th birthday present from my wife. It was our second vacation in Mexico. Our first was at the Marina El Cid in Mazatlan, in May 2007. We found the reviews on Trip Advisor to be very accurate and useful. We had a one bedroom suite in building 7 on the third floor, room 3508. It was a short walk from the main lobby and not a long walk to the pool. We never used the shuttles to get back and forth on the property. We only used the shuttle to the front gate to catch the shuttle to downtown Playa Del Carmen. We were very pleased with the room, with one exception. The bed was absolutely horrible. It was like sleeping on concrete. Also, the humidity was so high, that the A/C had to be kept on high all the time . I was freezing. Also, the bedding always felt damp from the high humidity. We were unimpressed with the food at the Mayan Palace and thought it was too pricey. Fortunately, we rented a car on our second day from the hotel, and went grocery shopping at the Walmart in Playa Del Carmen. We were skeptical about renting a car after reading some reviews about the Mexican drivers and the speed bumps. Both were accurate. However, we watched the speed limit and always stayed to the right. We highly recommend that you rent a car. It's much too hot to stand on the side of route 307 waiting for the shuttle to stop. We didn't spend much time at the resort. We were determined to get our money's worth out of the car rental. We were gone before noon every day, and made sure we got back before dark. The service was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We would prefer to stay in the Cancun \"hotel zone\" if we vacation in Cancun again.

The Mayan Palace/Grand Mayan is a Mega Resort that has everything you need right there and they take pride in their appearance, ambiance and accomodations. I read many reviews about various resorts and realize everyone has their own expectations about vacation. I like to think about what I want to do before I leave and decide what to do after I arrive. We did not opt for all inclusive because we like to eat in sometimes and watch what we eat. The pool bar had happy hour for those not AL and the restauraunts(don't know about the nightly buffet) were moderate in price and had good food. The Mexican Fiesta was better than I have seen at other resorts and the food there was better than usual buffet fare. Great decorations and show. The water and lettuce are safe at the resort. The pool is phenominal(open 24 hours!), the grounds are perfect(and eco-friendly) and the staff are friendly and accomodating. Palapas everywhere for shade and sun with lots and lots for chairs and lounges both at the pool and on the beach. The beach, as the other reviews stated, has \"rocks\" that are actually dead coral reef and getting in the ocean can be tricky--take water shoes! We walked on the beach every day and found some pretty sea shells. There is a nice pier and the night we arrived the owner's daughter was married and had her reception there--awesome! They do have shuttles to take you from place to place and right now there are no units in the Palace that have oceanview(Idon't know about the Grand Mayan views). We were in building 16 and did request a closer building but decided that the shuttles were good enough for us. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes, usually less, and sometimes we opted to walk and take in the beautiful scenery. Keep in mind that September is LOW season! One shuttle takes you to the highway so you can catch a bus or taxi to civilization(ha ha.) If you plan to use the bus, don't try to use it in the evening unless you are a patient person. After the first venture, we decided to go to PDC in the late morning and come back before 4pm. The map the resort gave us did not give us the best place to catch the bus(Playaexpress) back, but we learned to get off at the end of the busline and walk to Ave 5 and back. Supposedly you have a better chance of catching the bus back if you get on at that point. Taxis are also less expensive from the highway in front of the resort to PDC and from PDC back to the resort than the posted resort prices. Housekeeping was great, the resort sprays for mosquitos x2 a day so you don't have to worry much about bites(take repellent anyway, you'll need it.) The activity staff is very animated and active, but geared toward the party crowd. Not that they aren't entertaining to all ages and do have a special kids program. Pool/Beach waiters and bartenders were the most friendly and helpful. I have my own thoughts about the watersports providers they have on-site. The excursions are probably fun, but when my mom and I were on the beach picking up a few seashells, they told us we would be fined hundreds of dollars at the airport--or worse if we took any seashell home. They were very rude. We did make the resort aware. I am going to post some pictures and hopefully they will assist you to make your own decision about going to the resort.

If you plan to stay the day at the resort and want shade or have kids I do recommend renting a palapa - $30 per day but you get that back in credit towards the pool bar and restaurant.

We rented a car for the week and went to Playa several times as well as Tallum (and yes, I did get pulled over for speeding...85KM in an 80KM zone - $60 / 600 pesos paid to the officer). I highly recommend going to the Mexican version of Walmart just south of the main street down to Playa on 307...great selections, cheap prices and a better exchange rate than Walmart. The only things that was off about the resort was the prices in the Deli, the hard and short bed (I'm 6'3\") I live in Manhattan, NYC so the dinner prices were fairly priced.

First I must say the resort is beautiful, everything you read about their pool is true, it is huge and beautiful. The employees are wonderful and everybody is so nice and friendly. Also I must mention that is true that the beach is not swimmable (extremely rocky). But I guess to compensate the beach issue they are building more pools including a wave pool. If you really want to enjoy a nice beach, you have the option to walk about 10 min. to the right of the resort, and you will find a nice beach. Also Puerto Morelos is about a 10 min. drive to the north and there is a beautiful beach there too. Before I forget I must mention that you rent a car if you are planning to stay there, I booked mine thru National and I got a great deal. It is imperative to rent a car, taxi cabs are expensive and there is so much to see. The service that they offer to transport you around the resort is so well organize, the golf cart from the lobby to the pool run every 10 min. but we found it very entertaining to walk. From the lobby, (building 10) to the pool is about 8 min. walk. If you are staying in building 11 thru 21 I will suggest taking the golf cart. Once we learned \u201cHurricane Dean\u201d was approaching we asked the locals about what to expect. The very first thing they told us was \u201cthe hotel is going to try to get rid of you, but there isn\u2019t a better place to be safe as the Mayan\u201d (I later learned that the Mayan Palace build their own hurricane shelter and other resorts on the Riviera move their guests there). They told us not to worry that we were going to \u201csee a lot of action on the days before but not to be concern\u201d. And that was true; the management took no chances on protecting the property and their guests. They also try to talk to me into evacuating to the \u201cnearest safest city\u201d (a 13 hrs. bus drive to Villahermosa). I found out that about 600 guests were going to stay for the ordeal. So I decided to stay. The hotel relocated me and my family from building 3 to building 11 (closer to the lobby) as well as many people as they could. I must stress that the service, communication and organization before, during and after \u201cDean\u201d was exceptional. They brought food to every single room the night before and the morning after \u201cDean\u201d. The work of all the employees was unique. Thank you Mayan Palace. The morning after \u201cDean\u201d they brought back every single employee and they were working so hard to make sure we were able to continued to enjoyed our vacations, parts of the pool were ready the same day and everything was back to normal in 2 days. We visited Tulum, Akumal. Puerto Morelos, Cancun, Cozumel, Xel-Ha, Xcaret, Playa del Carmen and many other places.

My family (mom, dad, younger sister) were headed down from Philadelphia to Riviera Maya for two weeks. The first week was to be at Mayan Palace and the second at the Sunset Fisherman, south of Playa del Carmen. I have to warn all first-time visitors to the Mayan Palace- it was hard for us to find! We didn't know that it was part of the Grupo Mayan, which included both the Mayan Palace and the Grand Mayan. So look for signs saying Grupo Mayan- that's where you want to be. We arrived 6 hours before we were supposed to check in, but they let us check in early. Of course, our room wasn't going to be ready for a while, but we went to explore the pool and beach area. The pools were incredible! They were massive, and if you don't know what i mean, look at some pictures! The only thing that wasn't satisfying about the pools was the fact that the temperature was as warm as bathwater. The pool probably wasn't that warm before the hot season began. Still, it was cooler than the air, so i was ok with it. We found that if you arrived early in the morning (before 9:30) you could find a few chairs in the shade, under a palapa. Anything with a grass roof is called a palapa. We actually didn't spend that much time on the beach because the ocean was really rocky on the bottom. i told my friend this and she said,\"Well, couldn't you still swim in it?\" Let me stress the absolute rockyness to you. It was not nice to swim in. Unless you're wearing water shoes... I could have tried that... So eventually we checked into our room, which was very nice as hotel rooms go. My sister and I slept on the couches, which the maid made up every evening while we were at dinner. Occasionally, she left us a chocolate on our pillow! We always left a dollar or two for her. The beds were quite comfortable. For dinner every night, we drove to Playa del Carmen and then strolled along 5th avenue. By the way, if you want to get your hair braided, it is much cheaper in town than it is at the hotel. We ate a a different restaurant each night, usually with an upstairs table on the railing. You have to be there to know how nice that is. We would take home the leftover food and and have it for lunch the next day. For something different, try eating on the beach at Playa del Carmen. Walking barefoot in the sand, eating a delicious dinner on a deck, and watching Cozumel light up are lovely end to your day. So far so good, right? Well, there are a few more things you should know about the Mayan Palace. It is true that most hotel rooms are too far away to walk to the pool and/or beach. If you can make it to the lobby, a shuttle comes by every 8 or 10 minutes. The ride is usually really slow, but hey, it beats walking! Also, there is the view issue. None of the Mayan Palace rooms were ocean view. It was a disappointment. So hurricane Dean bumped us out and we got a flight to Baltimore.

We were pulled over twice, one time going only one mile over the speed limit (seriously) and it cost us $100.00 cash on the spot to get away from him.

The hotel is about 40 mins south of Cancun and 20 mins north of Playa Del Carmen. The property is huge with a wonderful pool. Activities are arranged each day at the pool area, however we were not told how the pool palapas work or when the shows are or any additional information on the resort. There are shows at the buffet restaurant but am not sure if you can watch them without eating at the restaurant. The resort is on the beach however the beach is rocky and not the best swimming conditions. The nearest beach is at another resort about a 12 min walk away. Big surprise, the resort is NOT airconditioned except for the rooms and 1 restaurant. This was unpleasant when the temperatures were in the 90's with high humidity. The rooms are not on the beach or pool. Our room was in the middle of the current resort (they are expanding) and it was a 10 min walk to the pool. There are shuttles but if you miss one it is about a 15 min wait for the next one. You are a bit isolated and to go anywhere you'd need to take a taxi (from the resort) or can catch a bus from the main road (a 10 min shuttle ride from the hotel). Besides the small store and 4 restaurants there is nothing nearby. The pool cafe had a lovely lunch menu and catered for kids also. The prices were reasonable for a resort and no cash is accepted at any time. We were asked to do a timeshare at check in and when we declined we were left alone. The front office service was shocking. We tried to take advantage of their express checkout. After 3 requests in a 10 hour period, we never got a copy of our checkout bill. We also had to make 7 calls to get them to give us an urgent fax which they kept on saying they were bringing to us. A request for sheets (that were there that morning) for the sofa beds also required 2 calls within 45 mins. Since you are in a jungle, they fumigate every night. This can be a problem if you have allergies. There is building going on but this is not a problem. If you want to relax and stay at a resort, this resort is for you. If you're looking forward to getting away and waking up to ocean views and beaches, you won't get this here. If you like to go out and experience some of the mexican culture and surroundings then be prepared to either drive or stay somewhere else.", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orangevale, California", "Title": "\u201cWe Will Go Back!\u201d", "Author": "highlandgirl22", "ReviewID": "UR8370989", "Content": "We were at the Mayan palace through a timeshare exchange, and stayed in a 2-bedroom Master Suite. The suite was clean and modern-attractive, but not fancy. The beds, as noted in other reviews, are VERY hard, but we still slept well. The highlights of the resort, in our opinions, are the large, beautifully maintainted pool, the delicious, well-prepared food, and the friendly, accommodating service. We read the reviews and found that many people complained about the high prices of the food at the Palace. Our experience was that the restaurants provided good value for money. The prices seemed moderate and the food was very good. For instance, we found the \"Del Lago\" buffet breakfasts and dinners to have high-quality food with a wide variety of choices for about $21 (US) for breakfast and about $30-35 for dinner (not including adult beverages). Also, the poolside \"snack bar\" called \"Balche's\" had really wonderful local food for very reasonable prices (e.g. about $12 (US) for an enchilada dinner entree). We ate breakfast a few days at the beachside \"Havana Moon.\" The setting is beautiful, but the food is just OK. And there didn't seem to be enough servers, so we waited a long time for things like coffee refills and the check. And this was not the case at any of the other restaurants. A few helpful things we found out: 1: Use the concierge service via the e-mail BEFORE your vacation to reserve a palapa, if you think you'll be wanting one during your stay. Currently it costs 300 pesos/day ($30US) to rent a palapa, and they will credit up to that amount of your poolside snack and beverage charges when you check-out of the resort. 2: You can also request with the concierge prior to arrival to be placed in a building closer to the pools/restaurants. We HIGHLY reccommend buildings 1-5 (1 is closest to the pool, building 5 is about a 7 minute walk). We were in Bldg 3, and it was about a 5-minute walk from the pools on the closest side. It's another 5-minute walk to the farthest side of the pools and the beach. It may not sound like a long walk, but with the heat/humidity, it can feel like a chore to have to go back to your room from the pool when you forget something. 3: A note about local taxis. We successfully took taxis to and from Playa del Carmen twice (it's $20US each way for the fare). We had no trouble, but talked to some people who rented a car for a few days. They saw FOUR taxi accidents in the few days they drove around. And on our way to the airport, we saw a FLATTENED taxi (must have resulted in fatalities) being hauled away from the scene of the accident. Just something to consider when you're thinking about your local transportation options. In summary: The accommodations were great, the food was fabulous and the service friendly. The resort was beautiful.

I wasn't sure how the room numbering worked and our room assignment was 10-- (i'm not exactly sure). I assumed from that we would be in Building 10. When we got there, we were changed to another room and ended up in Building 5. It was a perfect location, it was a short walk to our car (Definitely advise getting a car) and a short walk to the pool. The pool, as said, is huge. There are always plenty of people in it, but it's so big that you can find your own little spot if you want to get away from people.

Although the resort is bigger that what we are used too (Hacienda del Mar \u2013Cabo, Pueblo Bonito-Emerald Bay-Mazatlan) we enjoyed it and would go back. The rooms are bigger that Hacienda or PBEB but there are no oceanfront or ocean view units. We did get a golf front unit overlooking the second hole. However, the unit had no chairs on the balconies so you could not sit with your morning coffee and enjoy the view. Without question the water and beach is better at Mayan Palace than a Hacienda or PBEB. The resort runs a very efficient transport system to get their guests to the different areas of the resort. The wait for transportation was never more than 5 minutes. Additionally, workers would normally ask if you needed a ride if they saw you walking on the cart path. We found the staff workers friendly, respectful and totally professional always greeting you with a friendly \u201cbuenos dias\u201d or \u201cbuenas tardes\u201d.

We had a small six-can cooler that we used to carry water, beer and soft drinks. It was never a problem. The location of the resort was not a problem with us as we had a rental car. So it was easy for us to get to Cancun, Puerto Morelos or Playa del Carmen for dinner. Plus we had day trips to Tulum, Cozumel and Chichen Itza.

I personally stayed in a 2 bedroom unit and it comfortably slept 4 adults, 2 children and 1 infant. We did stay at the Mayan palace, not the Grand mayan, but the rooms were great almost 900 SQ FT. We stayed in building 2 which was a few hundred yards from the pool, those who stay at building 3, 4, 5 or 6+ the walk isn't so bad, any building past that you're in deep space nine from the pool. They have a boutique (resort grocery store) and the food prices there are a JOKE. For example, 1 liter of milk is $2.50 / a bag of chips is $5 / a bottle of Corona is almost $2 - If you can, go to PLAYA on your first day, on the way back stop at WALMART or MEGA grocery store and have your taxi driver wait for you while you shop fast. Pay tha man an extra tip - and you'll save a ton of cash. This is a cashless resort so everything is billed to your resort, TIP IS ALWAYS INCLUDED ON YOUR BILL - so no need to tip any additional. When the bar charges you $2.50 for a can of Fanta or Coke, I feel that restraunt is ripping you off. We spent a fortune at the bar and the drinks were not even that great. Beach does suck, its super rocky and it's too hot to huff it down the beach. So for those who want a good beach day, simply take a taxi to playa del Carmen, walk the beach by the pier - head north and find a good beach bar. You buy a bucket of beer for $12 bucks (5 beers) and they will let you sit at thier chairs/umbrella - the playa beach rocks..we spend several days sampling different beach bars. It's nice change of pace to pay for a $3 hamburger and $1.50 fish tacos - felt like old Mexico....TO COMMENT ON THE OWNERSHIP PRESENTATION - yes I did it, sure they say 90 minutes more like 2.5 hours, but I was interested in what they had to say UNTIL he told me the price was 80K, got them down to 25K, but I wasn't going to make a decision that day and put down 30%..ANYWAY - I wasn't mad, I did like the resort enough to inquire the cost, got $120 ROOM CREDIT and 10% off room service - They had a great gym, so if you like to get your workout groove on, they got a great gym to do so. The activity center is great, I booked a 2 tank dive for under $100 which included everything including gear. It wasn't as good as a COZUMEL dive, but to wake up and walk to your beach to scuba dive, can't beat it. Thought this feedback might help those who are traveling soon - any questions feel free to email me.... SUMMARY : MAYAN PALACE ROOMS ARE GREAT / SERVICE AND STAFF ARE GREAT / FOOD IS TOO PRICEY AND IS OK QUALITY - sampled 4 of thier 5 rest. / DON'T FORGET TIP IS ALWAYS ADDED TO YOUR BILL/ STORE IS TOTAL RAPAGE - buy food and giant jugs of water from MEGA or WALMART. / OWNERSHIP PRESENTATION IS WORTH THE TIME just SAY NO....80K no thank you./ ACTIVITY CENTER WAS GREAT - 2 TANK DIVE UNDER $100 -- staff was friendly and boat picks you up from MAYAN BEACH - WOULD I STAY THERE AGAIN? If I had a big group like I did, Would strongly consider it.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort!\u201d", "Author": "Luiz_Ferreira", "ReviewID": "UR8138776", "Content": "We went to Riviera Maya last feb (17 to 24).. Sorry abot that, but better late than never. I was with my girl and my parents. We had 2 double rooms in buildings 16 and 17. Each room had 2 double beds and a beautiful bathroom. No mini fridge nor kitchen utensils. In room safe and a TV with a about 10 American channels. Check in was a breeze (less than 10 minutes). We got there early (11am), and they had one room ready. We then left our things in this bedroom, and headed for lunch at the restaurant by the beach. Great food and great service, as it was all around the resort. After lunch, we went to the front desk, and got the key for the other room. Thank God, no timeshare rep bothered us. Maybe because we are brazilians and they think we don\u2019t have money for that... lol About the resort, believe other guests: it is HUGE!!!! From our bulding to the front desk, it would take around 7 minutes by walk. And another 5-7 to the pool and beach... But you can always take the shuttle to almost every part of the resort. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t spend much time at the resort, as we were out for the day everyday. When we reached the resort, the only thing we wanted to do was eating and resting before heading to Playa for the night. One day, though, we laid by pool and took some tequilas and beers. It was great to relax by the pool, wich is ocean front. Don\u2019t miss happy hour, when you get 2 drinks for 1. I liked Modelo Especial (beer) and El jimador and Herradura Antiguo (tequilas). Yes, if you want a palapa, you should wake up before 6 am and place your towels on one of them. By 6:30, no more palapas available. We only tried 2 restaurants (the one by the pool and that one on the beach), and room service. I liked them a lot. Of course, expensive. But, hey, you are in the middle of nowhere. If you go to a restaurant in the city, you would pay more for the transportation. Great food and terrific service. I\u2019ve heard that some of the restaurants offer shows at night. The pool is huge, as the resort itself. Yes, the beach is rocky, but you can always walk 10 minutes and experience a better beach. Regarding transportation, if you want convenience, take a cab at front desk. If you want to save some money, you should get the shuttle to the main entrance. Once there, hail a bus (really cheap) or a cab. I\u2019ve learned, only on the last day, taxis charge you more if you get them inside Mayan Palace. Around 70% more, sometimes... If you have the chance, book hotels transfer from the airport. If you don't, at the end of the trip, you should take the shuttle to the main entrance, cuz other transfers are not allowed to get you at the main lobby. Location: Unfortunately, Mayan is located in the middle of road from Cancun to Playa del Carmen. So, it takes you 20-30 minutes to reach playa, or about an hour to get to Cancun. Have to mention their tourist office. They can book any trip you want. And it costs no more than booking through other agencies. Great service! Rental office is the down point, as the run from 8am to 5pm. I wasn\u2019t able to reach them. All in all, I think Mayan Palace is a great resort. It could be closer to any of the city centers, but the complex is amazing. My parents are thinking about going back next year with my nieces, just to experience the resort.

Once check in was done, we were approached by their time share sales reps. We listened and said very politely, we aren't interested in buying anything or even the free offers that they had. That was it, no one ever bothered us again the whole trip about time share presentation. We had a grand suite in Mayan Palace, 2 rooms in bldg 13. The rooms are HUGE....we never felt crowded and uncomfortable. Yes, the beds were a little hard, but still OK to sleep on. We had 3 separate thermastats to control the room temperature.....which was VERY nice! We let the kids do whatever they wanted the whole week, never pressured them into getting up early (except for once) and you know how kids are.....especially at that age LOL. It all worked out for everyone. Must husband and I celebrated our anniversary while we were there and it was nice to have our 'alone' time. Can't do that in a regular hotel room with kids! We did Deep Sea fishing with Maroma Marina (booked through the resort). Wouldn't recommend that. If you want to do some fishing, best thing is to go to the Marina first to see if anything is being caught. But fishing is also good and bad, so you really never know. We didn't catch anything, but had a good time anyways. Then went to Chichen Itza. LOVED IT! Booked it through the resort, VERY HIGHLY recommend it. It's an all day excursion and worth the money. We had to get the kids up early and they didn't mind....they loved it too! Very interesting. The other days we spent was RELAXING by the AMAZING POOL! Loved that very much. Plus their happy hour everyday. Drinks are OK. We found that the frozen drinks aren't worth the money. Best buy is regular margaretti (not frozen) We tried taking a cooler down to the pool and we got caught. So can't take a cooler there. The food was OK, nothing spectacular. AND EXPENSIVE! Our favorite waiter was at the Havana Moon down by the beach, his name is Sylvester. Ask for him when you go.....he's great! He remembered the drinks we had before and one time I even asked him to check to see if they put any alcohol in one of them......and took care of that (extra shot at n/c). We didn't go to Cancun....but we went to Playa Del Carmen. EXCELLENT. We ate at Ajuar. The best food and drinks. We also ate at La Parrila and was OK. Too crowded and the food wasn't that great.

XCARET: We spent an entire day (and evening) at Xcaret eco-park. I highly recommend this \u2013 an incredibly beautiful and huge ecological park! We had so much fun here! Culture, animals, snorkeling, incredible cenote \u201cfloating rivers\u201d, etc. We purchased the all-inclusive Xcaret-Plus ($79 per person \u2013 expensive but we felt it was well worth it!); this included: admission, buffet meal (choose between four different restaurant buffets), incredible evening show (2 hour cultural extravaganza!), 2 bottles of water/soda during the day, all snorkel equipment, towel and nice-sized locker. Check out their website: [--] TULUM: We spent most of a day in the area around the tiny town of Tulum (south of Playa del Carmen). The town is not much, but the beaches (POSTCARD PERFECT!) and the Mayan ruins are higly recommended! The Mayan ruins are easy to get around and see, very interesting, and sit on top of a cliff overlooking a beautiful beach area \u2013 beautiful! We went to a beach are just south of Tulum near the beachfront resorts Azulik, Cabanas Copal, etc. We could see the ruins in the distance, and we could see the outline of the island Cozumel across the bay! The fine white sand was perfect (felt great on your toes!), the Caribbean ocean water was crystal clear (and varying hues of aqua and beautiful BLUE!), few people and it was beautiful perfect beach for as far as our eyes could see in any direction! RENTAL CAR: Yes the insurance is expensive (exceeded the price of the rental car!) but we sure enjoyed the ease of getting around with our own car! We had no problems with parking or gas, etc. We got a nice Nissan Sentra from Thrifty Car Rental (rented it in the Cancun airport) for $292 for the week (just over $300 for the car insurance!). However, the \u201cfederales\u201d (Mexican police) are everywhere and they are stopping people for speeding (radar). The roads are excellent in this area \u2013 watch out for the \u201cspeed bumps\u201d \u2013 as they are huge!!! Overall we had a great time, would enthusiastically recommend this resort to anyone and we would love to return to this reort and Playa Del Carmen again someday!", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mountain View, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Resort!\u201d", "Author": "smadison", "ReviewID": "UR8097888", "Content": "We had a fantastic stay at the Mayan Palace in July 2007. I was initially dismayed by weather reports predicting thunderstorms and rain for the entire week we were going to be there. Not to worry! It rained the first night we were there, a light tropical rain, and we heard a few claps of thunder one morning while sipping 'Tickets to Fly' at the swim-up bar, but every single day was sunny and gorgeous and thoroughly enjoyable. Check-in was quick and efficient. They did offer to buy us breakfast and take $100 off our bill along with special rates on activites if we'd sit through a time-share presentation, but we declined and that was that. Never another mention of time-share pitch. If you don't like dealing with high-pressure time-share sales, Just Say No ;) The room was fantastic. We stayed in the one-bedroom with kitchenette that included an under-counter refridgerator, blender, coffee maker, toaster, microwave, and 2-burner cooktop. The lounge had two comfortable sofas that converted into twin beds at night, each with trundles underneath that could combine to form a double. The kids slept even better than they do at home (could have had something to do with wearing themselves out at the pool everyday, too!). Our bedroom had a nice king-sized bed (not at all the rock-hard agony some reviewers complained of), plenty of closet and drawer space, and our own table and chairs. The bathroom in this unit did not have a tub but did have a spacious shower and two separate sinks, which suited us perfectly because we could quaranteen the two teenage girls to their own section. The grounds are incredibly beautiful and well maintained, and I was pleasantly suprised to learn that the resort had earned Green Globe certification award for sustainable tourism. They really go out of their way to reduce, re-use, recyle and generally operate in the most environmentally friendly manner. The golf course is immaculate and was perfect for our level of play. Green fees were extremely reasonable, tee times easy to come by, and professional staff extremely available and attentive. We paid for a golf pro on our first round. I expected maybe an hour or so of instruction, but instead we had the gentleman who managed the entire course ride along with us for the entire front nine! We had so much fun that we made a habit of getting out on the course in the morning before it got too hot. Green fees include golf cart, clubs, tees, towels, and even a cooler with water on ice. You do have to buy your own balls ;) The pool is definitely the main feature. It's really a series of interconnected pools so large that you can find an area that's really suitable to your mood. There are kids areas, a huge jacuzzi area, islands, built-in lounge chairs, party areas, quiet areas, and two swim-up bars. They have poolside activities in the day in the center area, but if you aren't in the mood for that (had a bit too much tequila the night before?) you can reserve a distant palapa and snooze by the beach. The beach was GREAT. A lot of reviewers complained about the rocks. I don't get it. There's a huge expanse of white sand beach with lounge chairs facing the ocean shaded by palm trees, a kids climbing structure and slide, and a nice pier to walk out on. There is a water activities station from which you can get kayaks, snorkling gear or book a guided scuba session. There are rocks just inside the water that form amazing tide pools--my son was endlessly fascinated by the colorful fish swimming between his legs. Swim out a few feet, and you're surrounded by clear blue tropical waters. If you don't like the rocks by the shore, there's a pure sand beach just a hundred meters north. The reservation system on the palapas seems to have been drastically improved from that about which previous complaints were made. We had no trouble reserving two palapas for the entire week on the afternoon of our arrival, simply by contacting the activities director. There is a fee involved, but when you hand in your reservation receipt each day you are rewarded with a bucket of beer, sodas, and water. There are waiters who come around contstantly replenishing the ice in the bucket and fetching whatever other food or drinks you require. There is a no-cash policy that's actually pretty safe--they scan your signature when you register and every till compares your signature when you make a purchase. Still, a few cash tips here and there go a long way. In particular, we made sure to tip the lady who made our beds every evening, and the lady who had the task of tidying up after the kids each morning. Both went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed in our rooms, and then some. Note: gratuity was NOT INCLUDED in every purchase as some reviewers have reported--only on standard service items such as food and drinks. Purchases in the shops, palapa rental, green fees, etc, included tax but not gratuity. We generally ate lunch at the poolside grill, which had your standard assortment of snacks. We tried the beachside restaurant one night, Tumtah. I found it a bit odd, to be honest, a random fusion of Mexican-Asian. My husband and I shared the seafood combination. It featured scallops, shrimp, fish, and calamari and was brought to our table in a ceramic urn in the shape of a fish filled with coals, which was pretty fun. The food was good, and the band playing was pretty impressive as well. The girls shared some kind of chow mein noodles dish that was far less interesting. Another night, we tried the fancy Taramonto Italian restaurant. Wow. Best resort food ever. They doted on our 3-year-old son, made the girls feel like princesses, and managed the perfect balance of attentiveness and privacy to enjoy our meal. There was an incredibly talented Cuban violinist who came over to our table and played a song specially for our son, who was utterly mesmerized. And the food was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The girls and I were able to share the Chateaubriand between the three of us. My husband argued that his Filet Mignon was better, but I wasn't convinced ;) We even cooked some in our room, especially breakfast. The store has all the basics, but at resort prices. There is a 7-11 a few Km up the road, and several large shops in Playa del Carmen about 15 minutes away (I recommend the Mega, but a lot of ppl like the Wal*Mart. We don't even shop at Wal*Mart at home, so I couldn't quite bring myself to do it in Mexico). Local goods are much cheaper than American/touristy stuff--we filled a tray with fresh baked breads and pastries that came to a grand total less than 20 pesos, but the loaf of white bread was 45 by itself. The mexican bread was much better. What else? There was construction going on for the Grand Mayan, but it never bothered us during our stay. Our room was in the long arm running along the golf course, where the only sounds were the birds. The trams ran regularly although we mostly walked to the main lobby then took the tram to the pool. Trams are color-coded by destination, so it's easy to get on the correct one. A guy comes by every evening and sprays for bugs between 5pm and 8pm, so you'll want to keep doors & windows shut then. The fog quickly dissapates, and it was such a relief not to be swarmed by mosquitos. There was a free newspaper available every day at the concierge desk (Miami Herald, Cancun edition, which wasn't too bad). The resort is about 15 minutes away from Playa del Carmen, which turned out to be a great place for teenagers. We rented a car, and gladly paid the $5/day for valet services which were extremely efficient. All-in-all, I was glad to discover that most of the negative reviews on this place have complaints that have either been satisfactorily addressed by the resort, or were due to unreasonable expectations. Yes, the place is spread out (which means you're not all on top of all the other tourists and can get some peace), yes, you can expect to pay tourist prices at the resort (where wouldn't you??), yes, timeshare pitches are pushy (um, duh? if you don't like them, just don't go), yes, it's not right in the middle of Cancun or Playa del Carmen (I don't like being in the midst of the tourist areas anyway, but they're easily visited by car). But we had no problems reserving palapas without getting up at the crack of dawn, we had no problems with getting around the resort, we had no problems with towels (they give you cards to exchange for towels so that they can keep track, but don't really carry through on the threat to charge you if one goes missing), no problems with language (all customer-facing staff speak fluent english, and even help you learn some spanish), loved the \"rocky\" beach, loved the spacious pool, loved the kids and adult activities. If I happened to return to the Mayan Riviera, I'd definitely stay here again.", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWay to far from ocean\u201d", "Author": "pendle10", "ReviewID": "UR8063625", "Content": "We planned this vacation since at least 8 months.

We have stayed in this part of Mexico before (4 times-various resorts) and know the area and resorts well for comparison. Positive: Pool is great-large and spread out. Definitiely rent a palupa for 30.00- which includes 6 drinks (water, soda, beer). We had one facing the ocean in the quiter area of the pool (#31) and had a beautiful, relaxing, indulgent afternoon. Food was also good and I thought reasonable for such a large, nice resort. We loved Havana Moon-a beachside restaurant with a lovely, casula atmosphere. Staff-majority are extremley nice and eager to please. 15% tip is always included and they work hard to earn it. Gym is new and large-one of the nicest facilities I've seen-work out with soacious ocean views-also a small health food cafe inside with fruit smoothies-fresh and delish! Rooms are clean and large (we had a one bedroom unit). Negative: Ocean is rocky and basically not swimmable unless you wear shoes and can navigate through lots of rocks-thank Hurricane Hugo for the erosion. We walked down towards the Iberostar resort and swam in \"their\" ocean-which is perfect. Nobody stopped us to check if we were guests. We were in building 20-we requested to be away from construction and we were very far from pool/beach-I never mind walking, but we have a 5 year old that likes to poke and explore-so it was an inconvenience. On my own, a brisk walk to the pool took about 30 minutes. There are shuttles and if timed right (you have to take 2) I got to the pool in 10-15. We would pack up for the day and not return back to the room until we were changing for dinner-b/c it would be inconvenient to go back to the room! But-we really didn't mind too much-it did however, keep my husband and I from venturing back out at night after dinner when the kids (15, 12, &5) were in for the night. In a nutshell-a positive family vacation. The pool area is the big appeal and the location (near Playa del Carmen-great beach town). Would like to see activities center do more for teens-they seem to appeal mostly to the drinking crowd-shot conests, etc. -we stayed clear of the swim up bar near the grill-different crowd-kind of rowdy.

The stay was a freebie from RCI. The resort is as big and beautiful as any five star resort in the area but the resort's size, location and focus on the bottom line hinders the ablility of the resort to deliver a truly pleasurable vacation experience to the average traveler. I've assembled a list of do's and dont's from our experieince at the Mayan Palace. Hope they help. Do: Plan on spending at least $800 (family of 4/7 nights) at the resort or you will not enjoy the resort. It is possible to spend much less but it is never fun to count dollars while on vacation. Remember no cash until check-out can be used at the resort. Take a collapsible cooler (ignore the no-cooler rule) and take your own assortment of beer, soda and water and snacks with you (no glass bottles) to the pool/beach area. Use gallon size freezer zip-locks for the ice. As the ice melts you can use it for drinking water, it is cold, purified and doesn't cost $3. If money is no object then you need not take a cooler and leave the zip-locks at home. Buy at least one round of drinks during happy hour at the pool. The wait staff will appreciate the order and look the other way as you induldge from your cooler. Note: Two times per week just after happy hour the activities staff serves free drinks as part of the entertainment. If one goal of your vacation is intoxication check the schedule. Learn and follow the rules for palapa use. If it is true that there is now a $30 USD charge for the palapas then skip buying a round. The palapas are great and the staff will enforce whatever rules are in effect. Take pool floats, they have a compressor. If you are not comfortable with your check-in or room ask for a manager to help and be persistent (not rude). You will eventually get what you want. Note: A 12 noon check-out is available if you ask for it. Buildings 1-5 are closest to everything. Use taxi service (max of 4 persons per taxi) or rent a car. If you rent a car obey all traffic rules or add at least $100 per infraction to the $1000 noted above. Negotiate the return cab fare from Playa to $10-$12. Eat fish tacos from La Floresta (next to the power plant in Playa) and have dinner at La Parilla in Playa. At the hotel have breakfast at the Half-Moon, have chicken nachos at the pool,pizza, burgers etc are all good. The portions served at the pool are large enough for sharing. The parillada served for dinner at the pool snack bar is very good and can feed two-four. If you use a shuttle service for transportation to and from the hotel other than the resorts make sure to schedule your pick-up with the concierge or your ride will not get access to pick you up. If your ride is late they are most likely at the front gate, the concierge will get access for your ride. The bellmen politey will ignore you. Get to know the activities staff and schedule. They do try and want to help you enjoy your visit. Do not: Stay at the Mayan Palace if you are booked in a hotel room and on a tight budget. If this is your first time to the area do not waste your time at the resort's sales presentation. There are much better places to stay. Expect the front desk staff to be helpful at check-in. Expect consistent waiter service. Expect comfortable pillow-top sleeping. Ride the bus to Playa. Crossing the highway and waiting on the side of the road is just not worth it. Catching the bus to Cancun and taxi back is an ok adventure. Eat at the breakfast buffet or any other buffet (ignore if you are a buffet junky). Spend the $69 per person for the Mexican buffet and show. Go to Xcaret for the same money and see a real show plus enjoy a day of all-inclusive and all the other activities they offer.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bartlett", "Title": "\u201cThey could do better.\u201d", "Author": "nowako", "ReviewID": "UR8027679", "Content": "The best thing here is definitely the pool.

The humidity in our room was so high that our cloths never really dried, and the pillows would begin to get musty by the end of the week. The bed was hard as rock, and very uncomfortable for me.

Our maid service did not start for 2 days after I called and complained. About 3 days into our stay we stayed in our rooms to relax and take a nap. But a maintenance guy had to replace a door across the hall from our room he spent 2 1/2 hours pounding and drilling to replace a door. After the first hour we spoke with Monterette a manager to see if we could do something about it after several more calls and another hour we got our answer of its only going to be another half hour can you live with it for that long? After the first week we returned from a diving trip to find that our keys had been turned off. I called the front desk and they told me somebody would bring a key right over. 1/2 an hour later I found our maid and had her let us in. 2 hours and several phone calls later our keys finally arrived. The spa staff was even worse than the maintenance, front desk and bell staff. They seemed to get pleasure from ruining peoples vacations. On our first visit they did not want to let u sin because we had not made a reservation at least 2 hours in advance. The place was deserted with no one using the facilities but they did not want to let us in. On another occasion when we did make our reservation and the place was packed at least 4-5 people in both the wet and dry sauna. They would not let our daughters use the facilities because they were not 18 yet even though they were accompanied by their mother and turned 18 while on the trip. After the they turned 18 we returned to the spa and they called me a liar and would not let them in until we went back to the room got their IDs and proved they were old enough now. Not only were they rude and unhelpfull but they did not maintain the facilities. On one visit to the sauna they were out of hand towels, one of the showers I tried to use would not turn on another had a plugged drain and was overflowing by the time I finished and both the water and tea decanters were empty. Our check out was a continuation of the bad attitude and inefficiency. Monterette had comped us breakfast and we had to ask for a manager before the person checking us out would even look for the note in our file saying we were comped. It took 25 minutes to check out even with no line. IF you would like to be respected as the 5 star resort you are advertised as being I would highly recommend addressing these serious deficiencies in customer service.", "Date": "June 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denham Springs, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cNever Again!!\u201d", "Author": "kpickerell", "ReviewID": "UR7804007", "Content": "The Mayan Palace is like staying in a compound...way too large and too exhausing getting from point to point.

But what really left a sour taste in our mouth and has made us vow never to return was the time share presentation. These guys are shysters! The price started off at $79,900, and by the time we left 4 hours later, they were husting us with a price that was less than $4000. In addition, they kept promising things that we knew they couldn't deliver, such as free cruises. We kept telling them that we weren't interested, and they kept passing us off to another salesman who was more aggressive and obnoxious than the one before.

They wave free stuff in front of you to intice you to go, and of course, with a group of 6, free tix to Chichen Itza and free breakfast was a good motivator. So we went to their sales presentation and what a mistake! First, your sales person sits with you at breakfast (a bit uncomfortable!) Then you sit through a lengthy sales presenatation, and when you tell them no, they bring someone else in. When you tell that person no, they bring someone else in. Overall, it took about 5 hours out of our day. We were very upset! This started our vacation out badly. The resort is so huge you have to take shuttles to get around. We had to take 2 shuttles to get from our room to the pool. This was so inconvenient! I wanted to step from my room and be right at the pool or right at the beach. No room were located on the beach. No rooms even had a view of the beach. The rooms were nice, but the beds were so incredibly hard and uncomfortable!! It was nice having a kitchenette in the room so you could save some money by going to the store and buying your own food. There are not many restaurant choices on the property, and the 3 they have are overpriced. You cant pay cash for anything, so the bill can be quite surprising at the end! The staff are friendly and helpful, a little too helpful though because they all want the tips! All in all, it was not the vacation I was hoping for. I would never stay here again. I would've liked to be closer to downtown where all the action is. The resort is so far from everything you are almost forced to stay on grounds.

The entire resort was perfection, from the gorgeous pool ,grounds and rooms to the very accommodating staff. We were located building 18, which was pretty far from the lobby and the pool area. It was about a 10-15 minute walk , but well worth it- the topical walkways were incredibly beautiful. There was always a tram available just within minutes if needed. The rooms were luxorious and very comfortable- we are a famliy of four and stayed in a one bedroom unit with plenty of room for all of us. The resort has several restaurants on site, including one on the beach. The food was very good at all places; although we didn't love the buffet. The beach is beautiful and very close to the pool area, however not really able to swim because it has lots of coral, There are plenty of lounge chairs both by the pool and the beach area. We definitely recommend reserving a Palapa( a big shaded area ) at the pool, but you need to get there early in the morning to reserve it. The resort has water sports on site, however a little pricey. We went into Cancun to Aquaworld for jet skiing and parasailing-it was perfect for what we were looking for and had every type of water sport available at reasonable prices. We also enjoyed the Xcaret, a natural eco-park. This was also expensive, but worth it.

Much natural light and bright colors gave the place an airy feel, I left my balcony door open most of the time I was there. (They spray for bugs, so no bugs!). The bathroom was huge and well stocked, I love the jacuzzi. The bed was wonderful. I have Kyfosis and find most hotel beds too hard or too soft but this one was perfect. I loved the king size and was dissapointed to go home to my queen. The kitchen was stocked with everything I needed for simple snacks and meals. The mini pool was great for the feet after walking around the Yucatan all day. The Pool: I hate swimming. I have OCD and I just can't stand to go swimming. But this was the nicest pool I've ever seen. Nicer than the one at the resort in Malta and that was a darn fine pool. Huge, blue, and with lots of things for kids to play around.

You don't really experience the city though since it's so far away. Our experience at the hotel itself was great except for parking. We rented a car due to the steep taxi prices but there were only two parking areas. Because of the way the resort is laid out if you didn't get the car parked by 8 you had to park in the far unpaved parking lot. Most times there was a car to take us to the lobby but several times it wasn't there at the right time, and of course going back to get it was the same story, sometimes you caught a car and sometimes you hooved it. The rest of our experience was great. We got invited to a sales presentation but turned it down because we didn't want to sit and say no for 90 -120 minutes and they graciously didn't push, there was a non-pushy rebuttal about free stuff but when I said no again that was it. We got a phone call (assume it was them) I didn't answer and they redailed 2 more times, one right after the other that was annoying but no other bother the rest of our stay. We had breakfast in the del lago twice (really good and excellent service) and saw sales presentations going on at every other table. The grounds were fabulous! Yes the pools are huge but I was so in awe of the design and layout it never seemed an imposition to walk around it. Plus, there are several areas with raised surfaces to short cut. I took a lot of photos of the pools! The lobby service was great. The beds were hard but not uncomfortable and we never woke up sore. We had a studio (RCI said only thing available) and found that we really missed the kitchenette. Housekeeping was awesome, I asked one gal for a coffeepot; she advised me that coffeepots weren't part of the studio deal but that they were trying to locate one for me. 5 minutes later there it was! All of the staff was friendly and ready to assist with anything in English or Spanish! If your going for a great beach experience you have to go to a different area.

I found them mostly actuarte.I am going to attempt to do a very quick summary for you and I hope that it helps. Heres some typical questions: Is the resort large? Immense So large that they run two shuttels to the pool and two to the golf course and two to the restauarnts. Can you walk ? Of course you can along some beautiful walkways, however, it can be as long as a twenty minute walk for you the shuttels are by far easier. Is it beautiful? very, extremely well maintain , beautiful flowers and well groomed. Is the service good? The finest. What about the beds? Hardest things I ever tried to sleep on, much like laying down on a sheet of plywood covered by a sheet.So bad that they provide you with those egg-crate coveings for the beds. What about the quality of food? really very good for the most part. What about the expenses.? This is where they get you. You pay extremely high prices for everything.The pool hbar had a happy hour daily between 11 am-1pm. typically are bill for two drinks was 19.50 which included the tip. It was not uncommon for our dinner ( for two) to run 85-120 us dollars. now, if you have breakfast, lunch & dinner plus spend some time at the pool bar you have easily dropped 180-220 for that day. Do the math,Add it up if that what you want for a seven day vacation then you have found the right place. That is why lots of people rent cars and go into Playa to walmart, and cook their own breakfast and or lunches there in their condos. What about the spa? beautiful very relaxing. had a massage there. cost 85 dollars. very nice. The gym or workout area cost ten dollars for each day you use it also. What about the beach,? The beach area is great watching the ocean is always nice. Having said that you cannot go into the water here because of the rocks. How was the entertainment on property? we attended only the thursday night enetrtainment which was the Mexican Fiesta night. The buffet was at best average . the entertainment superior. It final cost was 125 US dollars. Tips Included Everything ( meals & Drink) has the tip automatically included. Would I go back? not to this resort. It was like staying at the Hilton for seven days. Just not my cup of tea. I do not know what to tell you folks that hasn't already been said. It is a very nice incredibly large resort. Designed for the Older person i would say. Younger people had little to do, no activities other that sunning themselves or drinking. If you are under 50 then and like action this is not your place. If you are older and like quite times, expensive diiners and have and unlimited bank account. Here's your place.The time share people are some of the most agressive I have ever seen. You can make it through their presentation but not without losing some skin of your own. This place immediately sticksyou with a Time share rep at the time you check in . So beware and be warned. .

The landscaping was the best I have ever seen you can tell lots of money and a lot of thought had been put into to it not to mention the pool it was huge it contained a bar along with a large rock fountain and it never went deeper than 4 feet so no possible way of a older child to drown. The pool then continued down into a river like part that led down to a man made beach to relax on. If you go down past the pool there is the beach area with nice clear water to snorkel in but in order to go into the water you need to wear water socks or something else on your feet because of all the rocks. The restraunt prices were not outragous but could have been a little cheaper there is an on sight store called the boutique that sells groceries but is a total rip off 17.00 for sun block 4.00 dollars for water, best thing to do is go down to Playa del carmen and go to walmart for sunblock and what ever else you might need the taxis are very expensive 18.00 per person or you can take a collectivo for 2.00 per person.

It is a large, large timeshare property. We had a two bed condo which we traded for our two bed at whistler, bc. For the trade fee it was a good deal. The condo was comparable to ours in size and quality, but maybe not location. The food and drinks were good. Liked the Havana Moon, didnt care for the fine dining, others were ok, never did the buffet. The design of the hotel is odd, many of the rooms are way out there, no quick dips in the pool, or sitting in the bar waiting on the rest of the group, to far out. It is a 15-20 min walk from the furthest rooms to all the activities, pool, resturants, and beach. The pool is very nice, they need to give every set of guests a day pass for one of the big palapas and end the competition. My husband went out at 5:30 one morning and they were all gone. Please understand that there are adequate lounge chairs and regular palapas, its just the \"grand\" ones that everybody talks about. Anyway here are the tips and things that improved our trip: Get a car. It was easy to drive and there is so much to see in the area. Otherwise it is inconvient and costly to go anywhere. Go snorkling in Puerto Moreles, right off the beach for free. Have many dinners in Playa del Carmon on 5th. Great Place. with much atmosphere. Go to Coba, rent bikes(3$) and climb a temple. I bet they will not allow this much longer. Visit a cenote, we went to one near chitzen itza that was incredible. There is a great list on the site here. Be the first at Xel-ha and do the all-inclusive. You will spend the whole day and it is great. Very worth it, have the sit down steak dinner, and the buffet and lots of cocktails, amazing for the price! Snorkle, river float, sleep in a hammock. Beautiful place.

Overall, we had a nice time. We went to the time share presentation and it definitely left a sour taste in our mouths and will never attend another one. It certainly wasn't worth our time or the discounts we were given. The salesperson of course, was extremely nice and of course pleasant at the beginning and we only got a brief overview of the resort...certainly not the \"tour\" they promised us. We saw one room at the Grand Mayan and one room at the Mayan Palace and walked past the pool. That was it. Like others, when we said \"no, we weren't interested in buying\" as we really couldn't afford the price they were asking we were passed off to the salesperson's manager and he pushed us even harder to buy. We still said no, that the time share thing wasn't for us. (This was our first time share presentation so we really didn' t know what to expect or how things worked with time shares.) They told us up front that it was okay to say yes (of course) and that it was okay to say no but it was NOT okay to say we needed time to think about things. (Red flag for me there...especially not know the cost of buying in and if we could afford it or not). After the manager quoted us a price per month and asked if we could afford it, I flat out said no, we are not interested and we could not afford it. They basically told us that using money as an excuse not to buy in wasn't acceptable and left rather ticked off at us. It was very clear that they didn't like the fact that we said we really couldn't afford buying into the time share as an answer ,even if it was true, it seemed that it certainly wasn't a reason not to buy in. We were then passed off to a gentleman who said he was with the developer of the hotel chain and wanted to ask us a few questions about the presentation. He asked us several questions on how we thought the presentation went, how are presentor treated us...etc. THEN...he pulls out a piece of paper, wanted to know what they quoted us and gives us YET ANOTHER pitch to rent now instead of buying in. I think my husband and I both had the same look on our faces of disbelief as to how cunning these people really are. We told him no, AGAIN, and that we were done. He said okay and we were on our way...2 1/2 hours later. Certainly not worth the $80 USD we saved on our final bill and certainly not worth the mental beating we both felt we took by these people. We were both extremely exhausted and irritated afterwards that we didn't much enjoy the rest of our afternoon that day. The remainder of our vacation was MUCH better. SKIP THE BUFFET! We found that the a la carte restaurants have better food and much more reasonable if you aren't going to pig out. We ate twice at the buffet before trying Balche (pool restaurant) and Havanna Moon (just past Brio Spa). The food was 10 times better and the prices seemed less than what the value at the buffet was. It seemed like we spent 1/2 as much eating a la carte at the other restaurants. We skipped the Thursday show at Del Lago and opted to take in the show with our Xcaret tour...FANTASTIC show at Xcaret. Xcaret isn't as kid friendly as Xel-Ha and Xel-Ha is all-inclusive (food and beverages). For groceries, there are several stores in Playa del Carmen. The best ones being right off of or right on hwy 370 south of Juarez Blvd. Chedraui on the left side of the highway (heading south) and the other (Soriana) in the shopping mall, Centro Maya, on the right side of hwy 307 heading south a few blocks past Chedraui. Don't bother with Wal-Mart down there...the other two markets are SO much better! The beach area, for swimming, is horrible. They were hit hard by hurricane Wilma back in 2005 and the water is now almost all exposed coral and rock. You can go in to about your ankles and that's it. The sandy beach area for sunbathing is large and very nice but for taking a swim and cooling off, the pool is GREAT. Even though there were a ton of people staying at the resort, the pool always had enough room. The bed palapas have to be reserved and the palapas with lounge chairs go quickly. We finally got to the pool early enough (6:45 a.m. or so) to get one with the lounge chairs, dropped our stuff and then headed to breakfast at Havanna Moon. Don't take too long as they WILL move your things if they sit there for longer than an hour unattended early in the AM. Once the towel stands open, we didn't see them moving anyone's things. Be prepared to walk quite a distance from your room to the pool/beach/restaurant areas. We were in one of the last buildings in Mayan Palace and it was about a 10-15 minute walk (depending on how fast we walked) from our room to the pool and restaurants. It was a nice place but knowing what we know now, we won't go back.

Check in was fast, easy and we got in early. The grounds were well maintained except for the many construction areas. The place was clean and rooms spacious. Ocean was beautiful to look at but you couldn't go in it because of the rocks. The bad things. Amenities such as coffeemaker frequently not in rooms because other guests had the same issue. When we asked for a coffeemaker the concierge told us she couldn't provide one!!! What? Getting coffee in the morning was a project because you had to take a shuttle to a restraunt to get coffee. If you wanted to use the gym you had to pay! Paper signing is insane! You sign for everything. Everything is tipped at 15% even when there is no service involved ie: store purchases, internet service. I mean EVERYTHING!! Everything is way overpriced and then add 15% and you feel like Mexicans are living in your pockets. You are at the mercy of the resort and their prices because getting to a store of the nearest town is time consuming and by taxi costs $18. We took the bus system to everywhere to save money, but don't expect the concierge to help, they want you to use their taxis. They must get a kick back because the taxies outside the resort gate are half the price. You will be charged $30 if you lose your only beach towel!! Stupid! Trolley system, which you must take unless you are in building 1 - 6, is slow and inefficient. The last straw for us was, the morning we were leaving we had arranged a private transfer to the airport. We waited patiently in the lobby. I asked a bellboy about where or pick up would happen.

Room? We were at Mayan Palace in a 1 bedroom studio (w kitchenette) for the first week in building 21. Second week in a 1 bedroom in building 2. Great attention to detail, no cracks or missing tiles etc. We saw maintenance staff repairing rooms several times. Looks like they stay on top of things. Ice machine broke one afternoon, and was repaired the next day. First week - New building, Great room, soft mattress, fans in bedrooms for those that don't prefer a/c throughout the night. Nothing broken, everything good quality. Shampoo, soaps, 6 towels, two TVs, safe, blender, coffee maker, small fridge, two burner stove, microwave. Bdg 21 - very quiet, Longer walk to pool and lobby but we didn't mind, nice to walk off dinner. Second week - older building, normal hotel sized room, hard mattress, TV, clock radio, safe, shamppo, 4 towels. Bdg 2 - CLOSE to pool but noisy building, slamming doors repeatedly, construction on new facility center starts at 7:30 with metal on metal. Housekeeping? First week was perfect. Second week, minor stuff, missing towels, glasses and bottles left in room for days (could be confusion). Note on cleaning - insane We saw cleaning staff through open doors on check out days and everytime saw staff moving EVERY piece of furniture (even fridge) to scrub and squeegee the floor. Food & drinks? Fantastic - great quality burgers, club sandwiches and pizza for the trailer park folks to three style ceviche tostados (at Havana Moon, vegie grilled sandwiches (at the gymnasium health food bistro) and Asian Duck pizza for those who prefer to avoid the trough of fast food joints. We prefered eating in PdC. Great food. You CAN bring ice coolers, bubba mugs, jugs to the pool. There are signs saying NO, but we never saw anyone spoken to by staff. Bringing a cooler or jug, sure cuts down on your drink bill for those days by the pool. Landscaping? The property is beautiful. It's huge but again they show such attention to detail. There are lots of butterflies (several large ones wandered into the reception lobby several times while we were there) Iguanas, and birds on the property. Staff? Great. Friendly and helpful. During our two week stay, we only saw one waiter that never smiled - maybe he's shy. Activities? LOTS of Activities for adults and especially kids. Opportunity to try scuba for free every day. Drinking games and pool aerobics or \"something\" every day. Can be noisy if you are sitting on that side of the pool. Don't like it? Sit on the otherside of the 2nd? largest pool in Mexico. Each day animals are brought around the pool for photos, spider monkeys, parrots, etc. 15 bucks but fun to have a monkey on your shoulder for a few minutes... Pool? Amazing. Beach? Nice sand on the beach, but changes to rocks a couple of feet into the surf. Golf? Par 3 golf course, but challenging. Lots of sand and water hazards. Take lots of balls, the water hazards like em. Noise? Buiding 21 was nice and quiet. Building 2 was noisy with construction noise and nosiy with drunk kids yee-hawing as they walk home from the pool bar. we regretted asking for something closer to the pool. Which leads me into the next item... Spring break? We will now avoid spring break from now on... Bugs? One spider in our room on the second week. My Fiancee is trying to sue the resort for counselling and therapy costs. Lots of interesting bugs on the property at night though... Thursday night Fiesta Mexicana show? We saw it on a Trip Advisor recommendation. The food and drinks were great, the show was fine, but go see the Ixcaret night show for a great show. Transportation? On site the shuttles (Blue flag - lobby to pool, Yellow flag - rooms to lobby, Red flag - lobby to Main gate, Orange - lobby to Grand Mayan) are great, and the paths are beautiful to walk on. Off site just catch the Red flag shuttle to the main gate. Going to Cancun? Stand on the side of the north bound highway. Wave at the large white PLAYA EXPRESS bus, when he stops, open door, get in, pay driver 23 pesos for one way (he has change) grab a seat, get out when you want (tell driver). Final stop - Bus station in Cancun. Going to Playa del Carmen? Stand on the side of the south bound highway. Wave at the large white PLAYA EXPRESS bus, when he stops, open door, get in, pay driver 15 pesos for one way (he has change) grab a seat, get out when you want (tell driver). Final stop one block from 5th Avenue on 2nd street - near the bus station in PdC. We never could figure out time the shuttles ended. sometimes 9 sometimes 10:30, sign says 11:15 pm. The drivers don't seem sure either. Taxis are expensive 18 USD each way to PdC. I think 35 USD each way to Cancun. Places to eat in Playa del Carmen? All the restaurants are good, some are fantastic. There are so many, our favorites were Media Luna and Playasia. Another for those adventurous enough to step off the tourist strip...Hope in a taxi and ask the driver to take you to La Floresta. It's a seafood taco restaurant on the federal highway (carrredas?) beside the electrical plant. Sounds attractive I know, but the shrimp (Camarone) and Fish (Pescado) tacos are cheap, fresh and delicious. They also have cocktails, small and large. They have table service, clean bathrooms, but no english. Open for lunch into the late afternoon but appeared closed for dinner. We ate there 4 times in 2 weeks - great. Suggestions? - Change your money in town, check the rates. - Take some cheap golf balls of your own - Take a thermos jug or buy one in town - Eat in PdC - After checking stores and Covi the cheapest Gin/alcohol we found was at Walmart in PdC - If you have a kitchenette: Food cheap at Walmart in PdC Microwave popcorn for snacks Spices Salt and Pepper", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "aussie in usa", "Title": "\u201cHard sales pitch\u201d", "Author": "yapyap60", "ReviewID": "UR7217315", "Content": "Great spot .. good service ...

Our expectations were high but not unreasonable, and our experience probably exceeded those expectations somewhat. First, you'll notice lots of photos of the pool. The pool is the big draw here (though they have a very nice beach, as many others will have noted, the coral and rocks come right up to the shore, so swimming is not the easiest--if you want to swim, I suggest hiking the 20 minutes down to the Iberostar resorts along the beach. As beaches are Mexican Govt. property, there's nothing to keep you from enjoying them wherever they happen to be), and most of the day it is well-populated, though never crowded (it's too big to get crowded). There are a number of palapas (thatch-roof covered \"beds\") around the pool. On Sunday morning, we obtained the pick of them when we got out around 6:00 AM. By Monday, they were starting to fill up around 5:45 AM. By Friday, anyone arriving later than 5:00 AM was lucky to find one. As others have mentioned, we saw no indication that the security people ever confiscated items, despite indicating in your welcome brochure that they would. It seemed to us that several people were choosing to sleep all night at their palapas (or at least the last half of the night), which was permissible as the pool is open 24 hours. If you don't get a palapa, don't worry; there are more than enough reasonably comfortable chaise longues surrounding the pool, or on the beach. If you like to watch the sunrise, bring a travel mug. Other guests obviously knew this as some had done so. There is literally nowhere to get a cup of coffee before 7:30 AM, so you will want to make one in your unit and then bring it down with you. The same goes for tea, orange juice, or anything other than bottled drinks. Food at the resort is quite decent. If you are expecting gourmet creations, this is not the right place; however, except for one dinner, we found the food quite palatable and a good selection. Many seemed to do as we did--have a large breakfast at the buffet around 10:00 - 11:00 AM, then a late lunch, or snack and dinner later in the day. The beach restaurant (Havana Moon) serves a nice breakfast for roughly half the price as the buffet, and the atmosphere is nice. Units were comfortable and clean, though the beds are like bricks covered in sheets. As we were dead tired most days, this was no bother, but it certainly gave you a reason to get up early. Unless you like your mattress very firm, you will probably find it harder than you're used to. Only quibble was with service. Some days we did not get housekeeping till almost 5:00 PM, despite asking for early service at 6:00 AM. Twice we had turn-down service arrive after 9:00 PM, well past our seven-year-old's bedtime (not to mention her parents!). Also, Mayan Palace kitchens are adequate for snacks and very light meals; nothing more. Bar fridge, tiny icebox, two burners, small microwave, coffeemaker and toaster are what you get. Had we been there longer than a week, this might have been an annoyance; as it was, we were just fine. The grocery store onsite is fine if you aren't buying too much--you will pay a premium of around 30-50% over what you would find in town (water is an exception: 2 litres at Mayan Palace cost around $3.50 US; at Wal-Mart in Playa, 10 litres cost $1.35 US. Of course, you'll want a cab at $18 US to carry your 10 litres of water back with you). Bus service to town was perfectly fine--a shuttle will take you to the highway (if you don't want to walk along the golf course for a kilometre), and buses arrived every 10 - 15 minutes. On weekends, buses left Playa as late as midnight, for 12 pesos (less than $1.25 US). Last of all, the geography of the resort is a little too linear--you will find yourself traveling to and from the beach along the same route repeatedly. They are building a central lobby and \"aquapark\" to open late in the year, and this may change things a bit. In the meantime, it can get a wee bit boring if you don't ever go off-resort for some activities. The lobby, building 9, is about a 10 minute walk from the pool. The furthest building, 20, is about another 12 minutes or so. While some might complain about the distance, I don't regard it as a problem, but ask to be in buildings 1-10 if this matters a lot to you. They do run a shuttle every 10 minutes or so if you can't manage it by foot.", "Date": "March 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice property, but no ocean views\u201d", "Author": "Bschinski", "ReviewID": "UR7191967", "Content": "My wife and I brought our three kids (18-25) and had a great time.

The balconies are only about three feet wide but it was enough to fit a chair from our dining table, so I was able to smoke a cigar there in comfort. The fridge was too small for our needs but we had brought along a large cooler, which proved invaluable. There is no dishwasher or oven, only a two-burner stovetop, but the kitchen was well-equipped with all the cookware, utensils and dinnerware we required. The microwave, coffemaker, blender and toaster were in perfect condition and worked well. We cooked dinner every night but one. Eggs for breakfast and sandwiches or leftovers for lunch. The big salad bowl got lots of use and was helpful for fetching the quantities of ice the cooler required. The closest supermarkets are in Playa del Carmen, about fifteen miles away. We liked the Mega Foods best, though we also shopped at the Sam's Club, Walmart and Chedraui stores there. We brought a personal DVD player which readily connected to the TV so we often watched movies at night. My only gripe has been mentioned in other reviews. Contrary to their written policy, the staff permits people to reserve a shaded palapa with just a pair of sunglasses or a baseball cap. At five thirty in the morning, guests come down to the pool, claim \"their\" palapa and go back to bed until ten or so. Those who arrive at eight am find that all the shaded spots are claimed in this manner and there is little likelihood that one will become available as long as the sun is out.

The unit was spacious & very clean in building 19 facing the golf course. We used taxis for transport to & from the airport & our one trip into Playa del Carmen. We bought a few groceries & liquor from the on site store. Prices were comparable to any other resort we have experienced. We were approached for the timeshare tour during check-in, said \"no, thanks\" & were never bothered again. Breakfast our first morning was at the Carabbean Moon, a truly awful meal in every way. Poor service, cold overpriced tiny portions of mediocre food, & noisy, unappealing atmosphere. Subsequent meals were the really good buffetts at the Del Lago and room service which was always prompt, plentiful & delicious. The distance to the pool & beach annoys some folks, but we found the stroll enjoyable and the exercise kept us from gaining too much weight from the abundant food & drink. There were organized activities offered all day for all age groups & interests. We are novice golfers & really loved the challenging Nicolas designed 3 par although it is rather expensive at $69 with cart & clubs. We play much better full courses in Palm Desert for much less. We highly recommend the all day tour to Chitzen Itzea. We didn't mind the 15% automatic gratuity added to everything since we found the service excellent (except for the breakfast fiasco.) All in all, this resort is top notch, but for one small but aggravating thing. Those who complain about the long hike to the pool seem to have no trouble making the trip at 6am in order to place a shoe, hat or room towel on every chair or lounge with a hint of shade around the pool. They must then spend the next several hours taking their time eating, shopping, sight- seeing or watching TV because they are most certainly not occupying the spaces they have \"reserved\" & the resort staff is doing nothing to enforce the plainly stated rule against the practice. I was very tempted to go down about 7:30am and rearrange all the carefully placed shoes & hats and then sit back & watch the show starting around 10 when the lounge savers start showing up. We have never experienced this extreme level of this practice in the resorts in Hawaii, Arizona or California. And we don't believe it is a \"Mexico thing\" either since we didn't see this in Cabo San Jose or Puerto Vallarta. We can visit resorts as nice or nicer in those lacations & not have to experience this rude, selfish behavior . We will not return to this resort .

The hotel asks patrons not to \"save\" chairs and I appreciated that idea as the concept of shared space on the planet abounds here.

The grounds are huge, well landscaped and beautiful. The sound of birds in the trees and look of forest greeted us in the morning. Transportation is available on and off the grounds. On the grounds golf cart trains take guests to destinations. Expect to be several blocks from the pool or ocean, though also expect lots of options for exploration. Taxi rides to Playa Del Carment and Cancun are around thirty dollars, though the Playacar Express and busline pass frequently and offer the ride for 2-3 dollars. Prices at the restaurants are high but with planning and selection there is something for everyone. We found live entertainment everynight around the pool or at a restaurant. The Mini Market on the grounds is high, I would say closer to price gouging. We golfed and found the executive course challenging with picturesque and unusual approaches and greens.

We went to the \"90 minute\" presentation on the first day - we were totally greedy and went only for the free buffet breakfast, $100 US and 10% off our bill. If anyone knows a way of \"politely\" calling the presentation quits after 90++++ minutes (do we actually count breakfast in that time?) then please let me know. I was called rude by our \"friend\" Philip, but enough was enough. We got out of there after 1 p.m. But I must say a savings of over $200 was perhaps worth it at least to see the physchology behind all of their sales pitch (interesting to just sit back and watch) We would definitely go back to this wonderful resort.

The rooms have high ceilings, reasonably nice furnishings, and feel comfortable. Although, from our 3rd floor room you could hear a roof motor all night long. If you are in building 7 or higher the experience is quite different than being in building 1-3. Alot of walking or waiting for trams. There is a very large construction project going on in the middle of the main area. On one level it's not so bothersome, but I don't think my vacation experience should be anywhere near any type of construction. The resort is on a beach, but none of the rooms face the beach. Also, the beach is not a swimming beach because the rocky-coral terrain comes right up to the shore and it's not deep enough to swim above the reef. Walk 10-20 minutes north and you get to a nice beach. We had just one query about the timeshare presentation at check-in and it was not agressive at all. A couple of tips - 1. A very nice spot is the beach deck at Havana Moon restaurant in the morning - beautiful view of the ocean. 2.

I was very concerned about the resort from reading reviews. Here are our honest impressions: - easy to find / get to (like the other resorts along the coast off the highway) - beautiful hotel, I'd say between a 4 and 5 star place - rooms were gorgeous, with marble floors throughout and granite in the kitchen - no bug, noise, or any other problems - pool is huge, very nice, enjoyable to be there - beach is nice to lie on, but you won't be able to go in the water - restaurant food was good (not great), but had a terrific meal at Tramonto on our last night (Lobster special!) The major downside was that we were in building 18, a LONG trek from the lobby, from where you'd have another long trek to the restaurants / pool / beach. It was a 17-20 minute walk from one end to the other, which made going back to your room for a second to get something or change a big deal. Walkable for us, but I would think families with young kids would have a hard time. Simply put, the resort is MASSIVE. I've stayed at all kinds of resorts, big and small, but I was amazed by how spread out it is. That's not something I enjoy on vacation as I prefer something a little more convenient and intimate, but not the end of the world either. We rented a car - which we strongly recommend. We went on our own schedule and went into Playa Del Carmen whenever we pleased (to the grocery store and out for dinner). The Mayan Palace valet put a dent in the rental car...too bad...but that's what insurance is for! Also, go to XCaret, we really enjoyed our day there. Overall, we'd rate our vacation an 8.5 / 10. If we had been in a room closer to the beach, it would push it up into the 9's. I'd go back - which I guess is the ultimate test.

These cabbies charge double what they do outside of the resort. The trick is...you have to cross a very busy highway to catch a cab into town. It is very dangerous. It seemed to me the resort would care more about the safety and convenience of their guests and provide an accessible/safe bus stop. The food at the resort was very expensive as was the bar. It was good, but costly. Every night around 6:30 pm, grounds staff fogged. Several guests complained about the timing (just as we were lining up for taxis and dinner dates, and if you have a bit of respriatory ailments as I do, you could be in for a reaction.

I started to worry when I read some of the reviews posted here, but was pleasantly surprised. This was our third trip to the Mayan Riviera, and we love the area. We stayed at the Moon Palace in '99 and the Xpu-Ha Palace in '04. The Moon Palace was great. The Xpu-Ha Palace was nice, except for the leaky thatched roofs, that had animals living in them. My main complaint with the Palace resorts (Mayan Palace is not one of them, confusingly enough), is the expense. They are around $350 per night per couple. They are all-inclusive, but the food isn't that great, and we simply don't drink enough to make it worth it. The Mayan Palace was definitely on par with the Moon Palace. The rooms were great. We stayed in a two-bedroom suite with another family (4 adults and 3 small children total). The amount of space was perfect! The kitchen was great. We went to Walmart in Playa del Carmen for breakfast and snack food, which saved us money. We got some groceries at the resort, but they were very expensive (over $2 for a liter of milk and over $1.50 for one Corona). Unfortunately, there is no real shuttle from the resort to Playa del Carmen, so we opted to pay the cab fare, instead of crossing the highway with three children to get to the bus stop. The restaurants at the Mayan Palace were expensive, but the food was very good -- much better than the Palace resorts. We also had some great food at restaurants in Playa del Carmen. The all-inclusive resorts always made me want to eat there, since the food was already paid for, so this was a nice option. All together, my family spent about $300 at the resort restaurants, bars, and the grocery store. This was after about $100 off, because we attended a timeshare presentation. I have seen complaints about the timeshare presentation. If you go, be aware that it is high-pressure sales. We felt it, even though we already owned a timeshare, there. From it, we got a $50 credit for us and a $50 credit for our friends (even though they did not attend), 10% off of our total bill (again, our friends got this, too), and about %20 off of tours (we went to Xcaret, which was perfect for the kids). We felt it was worth it, but that's just because we were able to resist the sales pitch! Our friends said they weren't interested, and were not bothered anymore. We spent most of our time at the pool and the beach. It was a great pool for the kids. We spent two days at Playa del Carmen, which is the nicest town in Mexico I've ever been to, went to Cozumel for a night, and spent an entire day at Xcaret. It was a great family vacation!

Playa Del Carmen gets old real fast (the merchants on 5th Avenida can be extremely annoying). Check out Puerto Murelos- its laid back and Los Pelicanos has great seafood. The merchants in Puerto are way friendlier and there is a craft market where the sellers make everything themselves. Be careful of the salesmen trying to offer you discounts for touring new resorts.

We could have taken a cab for a little less money, but it was worth the peace of mind to have someone greet you by name and take you to a waiting van.

I want to write of a few things that I think would enhance the resort and A LOT of things that we liked about the resort!!! I also want to say to feel free post with any questions/etc. I found the use of the reviews very helpful before we left for our vacation! Things that would enhance: Billing system was inconvenient. The resort is a cash-less resort meaning EVERYTHING is charged to your room. IF you are under one bill that is convenient. However, due to our situation (3 bills) we had to REALLY keep track of our receipts to make sure that we were being charged correctly. I would suggest some type of manual signing system that would recognize handwriting...or some other way of keeping track of this information. You could easily give a different room number than your own and sign the name that appears at the bottom of the receipt. We stayed in Building 13...not complaining about the location as I feel the walk is nice to work off some of the calories from the nice restaurants. However, they need a restaurant and/or general store more towards the front of the property. Some evenings the walk was a little overwhelming and I feel I might've bought more if there would've been a store/restaurant more towards the front of the property. Not a big deal just a suggestion. Beds were EXTREMELY hard!!! Language barrier was a little tough at times. For the most part we worked through it, however at times when I needed an answer quickly or a definitive answer it was difficult. There was a pretty bad stinch from the drained pond around the general store building. It was a little overwhelming at times! Last but not least....being that we were a little younger it would've been nice to have some things to do on site in the evening. This was our first trip down and didn't want to go off the resort too much at night becuase we weren't familiar with the area. Felt as if after dinner there was NOTHING to do for a younger crowd. Not looking for a \"Senor Frog\" experience, but a nice bar with some local live music would've been nice. Balche was nice but got old being there every evening! Things We Liked: No push for timeshare. Not sure if it was the timing at which we arrived (9:00 pm) or if we were just lucky but we didn't have any major push for a timeshare presentation...just one phone call! Shuttles were nice and always available. Even saw a large iguana on one ride from pool to lobby. The grounds were extremely clean and very pleasant to look at. There was some construction going on but nothing that interfered with our vacation/experience! One evening I even saw a weird animal on my walk back to my room from the pool. Not sure what it was! The beach was nice. Yes it was rocky as others talked about but it was pretty clean and had plenty of chairs to enjoy the view! Would've liked to been able to go out on the peir but it was closed while we were there! The staff were OUTSTANDING! Roman at Pool Bar 1 and Frankling at Bar 2 were very welcoming. The housekeeping staff were ALWAYS polite and the rooms looked very nice after they had cleaned them. The activities committee at the pool were also fun. We didn't get a chance to really get involved with the activities, but the staff were fun and those that were involved always looked as if they were having a good time. They had adult and kid appropriate activities. We always felt as if we were at home while there! A major plus to the resort!!!! In speaking of the rooms, besides the beds, they were VERY nice! Big...spacious...with great amenities! The POOL!!!! The POOL!!!! The POOL!!!! This was where we spent the majority of our time while we were on the resort. It was gorgeous. The temperature was nice...a little cool in the evenings, but if you went up to the upper levels it warmed up. The palapas were always busy, but figured if I was in the Riviera I should be in the sun anyways! This is a major draw for the resort and we LOVED IT!!!!! Food - Balche was EXCELLENT! We spent most of our dinners at this restaurant and really didn't have any bad food there. The pasta, burgers, filet mignon, bruschetta and nachos were some favorites. The only thing that didn't \"hit home\" was the shrimp fried rice that my husband had...said it tasted like dirt. We went over to De Lago one evening but I have to admit I was a little disappointed in it. In the book in the room it said it was a Spanish night and when we got over there it was actually a BBQ night. The food wasn't necessarily bad, but not things that I enjoy and we spent $32 US dollars each for the meal. Didn't go back over there the while time we were there! We never made it to Tramonto (sp?). All in all I would suggest this resort to others. It would be nice to be a little closer to the action in either Cancun or Playa but it was also nice to be out away from everything. We ventured off the resort mostly into Playa but also to Tulum one day and to Cancun one day. Both were nice places and Playa was nice also. If there were some things to do in the evenings for the \"younger\" crowd I think we would've been more pleased with the resort for sure. Next time we will just be sure to rent a car to enable us to get off the resort in the evenings.", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vernon, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cIt's nice but book in Playa\u201d", "Author": "u2girlie", "ReviewID": "UR6470570", "Content": "(note: i've included a few pictures. the beach picture was taken at Mamita's Beach Club -- NOT the Mayan Palace beach) First, if you haven\u2019t booked this resort yet, don\u2019t. Do yourself a favor and book something in Playa (like Hotel Shangri-La or Las Palapas). If you have already booked it, don\u2019t panic! It\u2019s a nice resort and you\u2019ll have a good time. It\u2019s just not very convenient to the good stuff Playa has to offer but it\u2019s completely possible to have an AWESOME vacation. We did!! We stayed at the Mayan Palace from 11/19 \u2013 11/26. A friend of ours who has a time share was able to get the room as an exchange through RCI. It was a very nice hotel but not one we would choose if we weren\u2019t staying there for free. Here\u2019s some info on the hotel and on Playa del Carmen. Most of it you\u2019ve probably read but thought I would share another opinion for you! I\u2019m going to start right from the point of arrival at the airport. I have to thank all the people who posted before me because they all educated me so much on what to expect. I felt the need to pass it on! When you arrive in Cancun, you will pass through immigration and then customs. Once you get through customs, you will have about 50 people ask you where you are staying. Ignore them or politely say \u201cI\u2019m all set\u201d! These are the time share people and we saw many a poor soul get sucked into talking to them. Keep walking till you get to the exit to the outside. You will be greeted by men in grey shirts asking to take your bags and what hotel you are staying at. Let them take your bags and tell them Mayan Palace. They will walk you over to the Mayan Palace van where the Mayan Palace driver will be. They will be wearing red shirts and navy blue pants. Tip the grey shirt guys for carrying your bags. I gave them $1 (US) per bag. When you get in the van, the guy will probably offer you a nice cold Corona. Feel free to take it but realize they\u2019re going to charge you for it and you\u2019ll need to pay him $2.50 per bottle. It\u2019s a fun way to start your trip to Mexico! Once you get to the Mayan Palace, you will realize just how BIG this place is. You will arrive at the lobby entrance and the guys will take your bags for you. Again, have some $1 (US) bills ready to tip them. When you walk into the front lobby, you will be greeted by someone who will take you to the next available front desk attendant. They will check you in. Request a room close to the pool. It may take a few hours to get the room ready but you will be happy you did. We did this and we got building 8, room 1092. They held our bags for us and we went and hung out by the pool. There is a restroom for you to change into your bathing suit and shove all your clothes into your suitcase. After you check in, they\u2019ll have you talk to a time share person. We did but told her right away we had no interest in doing a tour. We read enough of the reviews to know it wasn\u2019t worth it. They\u2019ll tell you they will get you discounts to the different tours. If you find that worth it, then go for it. We didn\u2019t want to waste 2+ hours with a time share tour so it wasn\u2019t worth it for us. We politely refused the time share presentation and NEVER heard from them again about it. They will require a credit card upon check-in. They do NOT take Discover. They will put a $400.00 (approx) hold on your card (4,000 pesos). This is because the resort is a cash-free resort. Everything gets charged to your room. You can not pay cash anywhere on the property. Keep every receipt you get so you can match up to your bill when you check out. Our receipt was perfect but it\u2019s a good idea anyway. You will also receive towel cards. Do NOT lose them. You will be charged $30.00 for losing them. We hung out at the pool that first day and went for a walk on the beach. The pool was beautiful but cold. Not sure if they got a bunch of rain before we got there but the temp was icy! We went for a walk on the beach and everything you have read about it is true. It is rocky and we never swam in the ocean there. In fact, we only went on the beach once and it was that first day\u2026.we also only went to the pool once\u2026that first day! After that, we spent all our time in Playa \u2013 but more on that later! The room was huge! It was also beautiful. We had a room on the 1st floor and had no problems at all. Sure, we heard the hallway noise every once in a while but it wasn\u2019t bad. When we were in our bedroom, we didn\u2019t hear anything. There was a nice safe bolted to the inside of the TV stand. You set the password and they\u2019ll show you how to use it when you get into the room. We kept our passports and other valuables in there. It was nice not to worry about them. There was a mini size fridge, 2 burner stove (no oven), a sink, some dishes, blender, coffee pot, utensils, a kitchen table for 4, 2 couches that pulled out to sleep 2 each and a HUGE bed in the bedroom. The mattress was super firm, to say the least, but honestly, I\u2019ve never slept better. There are 2 bathroom sinks \u2013 one inside the bathroom and one out. That was really nice because 2 people could get ready and not be stepping on each other! Also on the property is a really nice gym (according to my friend), a few restaurants (we only ate once at the resort at Balche\u2026it was pretty good), a grocery store (very pricey but good for snacks and sodas), an internet caf\u00e9 (pricey at $4 per 30 mins but convenient). Yes, there is construction but it didn\u2019t really bother us. Even though the room was beautiful, we only slept there. We never cooked a meal there. We didn\u2019t hang out there (or at the resort). We went into Playa every day, all day. Playa is where the fun is! Do yourself a favor, get out of the resort! Take the shuttle to the front entrance. Cross the crazy highway but BE CAREFUL! They drive extremely fast on that highway. If you have little kids, take a taxi. If you can\u2019t move quickly, take a taxi. If you can jog across a few lanes, GO FOR IT! You will wait on the other side of the highway (if you\u2019re going to Playa) for the Playa Express. It is 15 pesos to get into Playa. That\u2019s $1.50. If you take a taxi, it\u2019s $130 pesos or $13 U.S.. Ride the bus into Playa. Don\u2019t panic if they take a right off of the highway once you get into Playa. They\u2019re just going to turn around and possibly drop a few people off. Stay on the bus until it pulls into its tiny little bus yard. From there, take a right out of the bus yard and walk down to 5th avenue (aka Quinta Avenido). This is where all the shops are, the vendors, the restaurants and bars. It\u2019s very nice and well kept up. You will be harassed by vendors trying to sell you stuff. Beware \u2013 they will rip you off. Make sure to walk around and check out all the prices BEFORE you buy anything. Chances are you\u2019ll find the same thing $10.00 cheaper a little ways down the street. I learned that with the Mexican blankets my first night! Another warning, your wrist bracelet they give you from the Mayan Palace is like a homing beacon! All the time share people on 5th Avenue know that bracelet and will try to suck you in. IGNORE THEM! If the beach is what you are all about, take my advice, go to Mamita\u2019s Beach Club!! Walk down 5th Avenue to Calle 28 Norte. Take a right and follow to end. Take a left and then a quick right. Mamita\u2019s is at the end on the left. You can rent lounge chairs on the beach for 40 pesos each. They have waiters you can order drinks and food from. The food is good. A lot of the women go topless there so if you like to lay out without your top or enjoy the view, any part of this beach is the place to be! It\u2019s a really fun atmosphere! If you want to go the cheap route, bring a collapsible cooler and find the Mega grocery store. Fill up on beer, soda, and snacks. Then, take your blanket and towels and still head to Mamita\u2019s. You can set up your towel in front of the chairs closer to the water line. You can not rent chairs AND have a cooler. They won\u2019t do that. There is a place 2 spots down that will but they charge you extra for the cooler and the chairs. All beaches in Mexico are public. So you can go to any beach and hang out. The beach clubs will just restrict the use of their chairs and their bathrooms. We went the cheap route the first few days and then rented chairs. It was easier than lugging the cooler! Don\u2019t waste your money going to Xel-Ha. It was nice but go snorkeling with Dani. His snorkeling set up is based out of Mamita\u2019s dive shop. It was cheaper than going all the way to Xel-Ha and a lot more relaxing!! The Playa Express stops running around 11:00 (maybe a little earlier). If you are going to stay in Playa past 10:30 or 11:00, plan on taking a taxi home. Don\u2019t pay more than 150 pesos to get back. Negotiate with your taxi driver and pay them before you get into the taxi. That way there is never a question as to what fare they agreed to! I am in the process of booking our next trip back to Playa. We are planning on going in May and will be staying in Playa. We are actually considering moving down there we loved it so much!

The resort was very well maintained, clean and the staff professional. It could prove to be helpful if you speak Spanish as somethings can get lost in translation, but if all you've got is 7th grade espanol-you should be fine. You can definitely tell the difference bwtn other large or boutique properties as this is a true timeshare. I personally don't want to cook breakfast (or anyother meal) while I'm on vacation, but its probably great if you have kids. The breakfast buffet is $21pp and is pretty standard-nothing to write home about. We stayed in a hotel unit with 2 double beds w/large bathroom on the 1st floor. We read a previous review and decided to bring ant traps-which we put out the first night and had no problems. Yes, the beds are hard-but what can you do? If you're staying for a week it gets better by the 3rd night. Be sure to request a building near the pool so you don't have to walk too far. But there are shuttles to take you where ever you want to go. The pool is clean and large and plently of seating for everyone. The beach is rocky, but the sand area is quiet for an afternoon nap. Food: There is a store on premises that charges $1.70 for a can of soda ($1 for CocaCola) and the restaurants & room service charge $2.70 per can. A bag of Doritos is $6.30. Trust me, take my advice (and the red shuttle to the exit) and go to Walmart. (A short ride by bus to Playa del Carmen.) A cab ride back will cost $18. But is well worth is you have kids or a husband who loves to snack. Otherwise, the food is decent at all the restaurants. (They tell me that they're working on the fly problem at Balche's) Del Lago Buffet charges $32pp for a dinner buffet and show (if thats what you want to call it) and wasn't worth it. Buyer Beware: Drinks are not included in the buffet price. Don't expect the fastest service when ordering by poolside. They'll get to you eventually. Timeshare Info: As soon as you arrive a representative gives you the song and dance about the presentation which will get you $100 off your final bill, plus an additional 10%. Although it takes a couple hours out of your day-its worth it. Our rep took us for lite brunch at Del Lago (they paid, we tipped) and afterwards a tour of the premises. (Ignore the Grand Mayan as you won't be staying there anytime soon-its all part of the 100 year plan.)She must have thought that we were born the day before, because the deal wasn't worth it.

We have found that when you go to a different country you can not put USA expectations on every experience. You need to go with the attitude this is an adventure and make the most of where you are, and not put a negative spin on the experience. Not everything is perfect even in the states. The Mayan Palace is a very large resort out a bit from Playa Del Carmen, but easily assessible. The pool area is huge and lovely and they work everyday to keep it clean and groomed. We found everyone from the pool staff to the housekeepers to be pleasant and helpful. The rooms are clean and well appointed. It is a lovely walk to the pool and the restaraunts on the property. We found the food to be very good and the service was quite good. We like to leave the property and go to town to experience the restaraunts, so we only ate dinner at the resort twice. The beach area is lovely, but is a bit rocky, so actually swimming is not the best idea. There are lots of palapas around the pool and they were taken early, but there are others without the padded beds that allow you to have shade or relief from the frequent rain showers. The only aspect of the trip that we didn't enjoy was the humidity, but when you go to the jungle, you must expect it. There is lots to do at the resort and in the area. The ruins are very interesting and Excaret is a fun experience. One lovely thing that the resort provided was large 4 ounce bottles of shampoo and lotion and soaps so that you did not need to pack any of these things. We have decided since the last FAA rule change on carry on that we will shop when we arrive and just not pack any ot the personal items, so that we can downsize what we pack. You really only need shorts and tee shirts and a couple swim suits. Only at the Italian restaraunt did you need a better outfit.

We stayed there for 2 weeks from 9/3/2006 \u2013 9/16/2006. While it is a large resort of 3 story buildings, the complaints about how long it is to walk to the pool are greatly exaggerated. Walking was pleasant, with lush surroundings, and no big deal. We stayed in Bldg 5 of the Mayan Palace. We did request a low number building closer to the pool. We were first given building 17, though the front desk clerk called it building 7. It turned out that he meant, building 7 of the new buildings along the golf course. I went back upon discovering this and he changed us to building 5. The lobby and nexus for transportation is in building 9. There are comfortable shuttles running to all buildings and the lobby and pool. We found that it was easier to just walk, unless the shuttle happened to be there. It took about 4 minutes to walk from building 5 to the pool. It was about 3 minutes to walk to the lobby. The discussion about the palapa beds is also overstated. There are many palapas, grass covered, shade canopies. Some have thick beds under them. Some have chaise lounges. Occupancy during our stay was only about 15%. So there weren\u2019t many people there. We got the beds most days. Sometimes they were available when we arrived. Other times, we took chaises near several palapas and then moved when someone left. The main thing to know is that they aren\u2019t that comfortable anyways. They are thick, but very firm. They are covered in a very sturdy waterproof plastic. The chaises aren\u2019t that comfortable either. They are hard plastic with the same sturdy waterproof plastic, canvas like material stretched taught over them. There is no back support. There are 2 kinds. Most can\u2019t be elevated enough to sit up to read. I suggest getting extra towels and rolling one behind your head, another to elevate your book, and perhaps another for the small of your back. The pool is beautiful and very expansive. It is 3 levels flowing from the highest to lowest in a series of cascades. It is never more than about 4 feet deep. There are several raised platforms and walk across stepping stones. We were disappointed that it was so warm as to not be refreshing. The rooms are large and very nice. While they do not look toward the ocean, they do seem to look upon pleasant jungle, and sometimes towards buildings and construction. There is a great deal of construction going on, both at the resort, and in the general area. It was not a bother. We rarely heard it. They do spray to control the mosquitos from 5 \u2013 8 pm each evening and tell you to keep your windows closed. At about 90 degrees F., we were glad to have the windows closed at all times. The AC worked well and was a constant white noise. It did not cycle on and off. The floors are a polished limestone, very pretty. I\u2019d recommend avoiding the first floor rooms. People walk through the connected buildings, on the1st floor, towards the pool, which is open 24 hours. (You do have to turn in the towels by 9pm) They will talk, and the sounds will carry. There is no carpet to dampen sound, and the doors allow sounds between the bottom of the door and the limestone floor. The beds are very, very hard. I\u2019d compare them to sleeping on a carpeted floor. The king sized beds are Eastern kings. The couches in the living area are considerably softer, and about 6 foot 3 inches of inside space. They have pull out trundles that create 2 more beds. The pillows are also very firm, making it difficult to keep one over your head to reduce sounds. The blackout drapes are quite good. The refrigerator is about 16 inches wide, and 16 inches deep and under counter height. There was not a separate freezer section, so freezing things was not too easy. There were 2 hot plate type burners for cooking, no oven. There was a small microwave. We had a double boiler pot, coffee maker, and a variety of utensils. We wanted a large bowl for salad, and a frying pan. We called housekeeping, or the front desk, and were told they didn\u2019t have such things. We asked a maid in the hallway, and had them when we returned from dinner. It was amazing that the concierge and operator politely said no on several occasions, and a request to the lowest level employees got things accomplished right away. There was also a table and 4 chairs, with an additional table and 2 chairs in the bedroom. We would have liked a reading light. Lighting was a bit too subdued. We were most impressed with how nice all the lower level workers were. Maids, bellmen, waiters, bartenders, everyone that we met were most eager to help. The resort could do some things better that are management choices. The TV sets were 19 inches. One in the bedroom. One in the living area. Neither had remotes at first but they were brought when we asked. We would have very much liked a VCR. The cable TV was good. There were many stations in Spanish, and several in English. We could only find CBS as a main network. There were CNN and CNN International. Fox News, Headline News and a German news channel in English. They had the American Network, in English, and National Geographic, some animal channel, and TNT. They had 2 CineMax channels and 3 HBO stations, all the programming in English, but with Spanish discussions between shows. They did not have a TV Guide channel, or any way to figure out what was going to be on. They used Cablemas as their cable company. I went on the internet to try to figure out the schedule but could only determine that it wasn\u2019t the Cancun or Playa del Carmen versions. I got some inclination it could have been a feed from Merida. They got many requests for a TV Guide channel, that does appear to be available from my on line explorations. I bought a TV Guide in the market but didn\u2019t get a match for our system. Mayan Palace is known for being the most aggressive Time Share seller. I recommend against agreeing to undergo the process. They are all over you as you check in. They make it sound like they are going to show you what the resort has to offer. You might have already met their people at the airport. They promise 90 minutes. They offer $100 USD and 15% off of your total charges. They treat you to breakfast while building rapport. We tried not to impede the saleswoman\u2019s progress with questions. She seemed so very nice. After a bit more than 2 hours, we finally had to ask, how much is this? She had to draw a lot of circles and arrows and headings to show her bosses that she had hit all the points. We told her to go ahead and write all that down, but that we wanted to go back to vacation, not spend all day in the presentation. They wanted $109,900 for the time share. They were probably going to cut that in half. But, do the math! 50 weeks times $110,000 is $5.5 million dollars. They weren\u2019t going to be in the ballpark of serious consideration. She brought over the high pressure guy that spews numbers at high speed. We said no many more times before giving him the pointer that at 90 minutes to 2 hours, we were willing to think about their deal. At well over 3 hours, we didn\u2019t even want to listen anymore. They walked us over to get our paperwork for the \u201cgifts.\u201d This is where they hand our paperwork to another guy who tries to sell us a bunch of deals that are different, and somewhat less expensive than before. We finally got our written receipt for the gifts that we had to ask for. Upon checking out, we found that the $100 USD had been converted to 1010 pesos. The rate of exchange we saw posted at many places was 1075. When they converted our final bill from pesos to dollars, they used 10.30. We were also told that the 15% we had been promised only applied to non-specials. So all the 2 for 1 drinks didn\u2019t count. And they didn\u2019t apply to tax or tip either. They also didn\u2019t apply to the internet usage, or the bottle of mixer that they had charged us 690 pesos for, when the market charged 390. We hadn\u2019t gone to the $50 USD per person Mexican buffet and show, but that too was also a special. The desk clerk explained that the time share and the resort were different companies. I explained that if the resort let the time share people lie to the guests, the guests will be unhappy with the whole resort. Always give a little more than you promise, not a little less. And the receipt I showed him of the time share \u201cgift\u201d had not said anything about there being exceptions to the 15% being of all the charges. It wasn\u2019t a lot of money. If you want to stay at Mayan Palace, enjoy your vacation. Trying to get paid to listen to their presentation is not worth it: not in your time, and not in the likely aggravation. Everything you buy at the resort is added to your room charge. And everything gets another 15% added on. We were very pleasantly surprised by the restaurants. We had a large pizza from room service when we arrived, for about $ 15 USD, before the extras. They don\u2019t offer the large size at the poolside restaurant, Balche, but the special was $14 USD, and it was a medium. Balche has a nice selection of meals, with Mexican, Chinese, salads, and a variety of sandwiches. Many of these were 650 to 870 pesos. You can always ask for agua de la casa, at no charge. The quality and presentation were great. The atmosphere is very nice, casual, poolside dining. The band starts at 8pm each night and was also nice. The drinks around the pool were mostly 530 pesos. They printed somewhere that you weren\u2019t supposed to bring coolers down. We often brought a little 6 pack cooler with some water and soda, and were never asked not to. They have poolside games much of the day. They also show some movies on Wednesday and Friday evenings on the beach. And they have some movies for kids. Tramonto is their elegant fine dining, Italian restaurant. They do require long pants for the men, though they weren\u2019t enforcing it. Many of the dinners were a bit under $20 USD, including bread, and vegetables. Presentation and quality were great. We did not go to their buffet restaurant, Del Lago, except for breakfast and the time share. Transportation can be cheap if you\u2019re willing to wait a bit, and haggle a bit. There is only the one highway along the coast, so there are plenty of modes of transportation all going your way. The bus to Playa del Carmen was about 10 pesos, and the Collectivo vans would accept about 20 \u2013 25 pesos, each. The cabs will sometimes match these prices, but if you ask, they\u2019ll quote you $30 USD, about 320 pesos for however many in your group. The resort will arrange airport pickup for $55 USD in a cab, or $15 USD each in a van. We didn\u2019t find it, but didn\u2019t really look, but were told that just outside the terminal, and around to the right, you could get vans to the resort for about $2.50 USD each. I recall that that was also the bus fare from Mayan Palace to Cancun. We really enjoyed the all-inclusive package to Xel \u2013 Ha, and highly recommend it. You can get a discount by buying the package at the Playa del Carmen Wal-Mart. Tulum is worthwhile. There is no entry charge on Sundays, or if you are a student, teacher, over 60, and something else. Bring water. Chichen Itza is a must do, but a very long trip. There are discounted package trips available in Playa. These constrain your time at the site, but add convenience and some nice features. If you take a separate bus, we were told $7 USD each for roundtrip, but when we purchased our fares, it became $28 USD each. We think that we got stuck with unnecessary 1st class bus instead of the regular. There is little difference. The guided tours were very expensive and not worth it unless you have a large group. I think the charge was $48 for about 90 minutes.", "Date": "November 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cFair Hotel - - Stay Away From The Sales Pitch\u201d", "Author": "nitespirit57", "ReviewID": "UR6165955", "Content": "The Good, the bad and the UGLY: Good: the place is very clean and beautiful to look at.

My husband and I had booked our trip in Feb of 2005 for our honeymoon in November 2005. Needless to say because of Hurricane Wilma we were had to honeymoon at another spot but decided to try to return to our original honeymoon destination for our 1 year anniversary. Therefore, I have been reading trip advisor comments for almost 2 years on this resort. I have to say that I was a little concerned at first from all of the negative comments. However once we arrived at the Mayan Palace, I quickly realized that people will and can complain about anything and everything. If you just sit back and relax and allow yourself to have a nice vacation then you will. On the contrary, if you allow yourself to focus and nit pick every little thing then you will not have a good time and probably should have just stayed home. Most of the things that people complain about on the site were untrue for us. We stayed at the Mayan Palace and our room was impressive. The resort was beautiful. The first day that we walked around we were in awe of the area. There was some construction going on as other entries have suggested but they are trying to better the resort and build new facilities. They have to build sometime. It was never loud or annoying. Our only regret is that we wanted to see what the indoor pool, beach bar, etc. was going to look like after it was all completed. I thought that the beach was much better then what I had pictured from the past entries. I am not a big swimming in the ocean person so I just enjoyed lying on the lawn chairs and taking in the beautiful scenery. If you want to swim then you can walk a little ways to a better beach just a few yards south. We did in fact attend the time share presentation and I would recommend it for what you get. We were there for a total of 3 hours and received $100 voucher, 10% off of our total bill, and discounts on all the excursions that they offered. All in all it was worth about $230 for 3 hours of our time. If you think that this is worth it to you then I would suggest doing it. We definitely did. We never once felt threatened or felt like we couldn\u2019t leave. If you just continue to say no politely then they will thank you for your time and let you go. They do have a couple of people come over to you to try and give you other deals\u2026 but again just continue to say no and you will be fine. We definitely never felt like we were being held captive like some of the other entries suggest. The entire staff was very enjoyable and always went out of their way to be hospitable. Tips were always included in your bills and we never felt pressured to tip more if we didn\u2019t want to. We had a great time with all of the activities people at the pool and participated many times in these activities. We look forward to them everyday. We took the snorkeling excursion from the hotel and thought that it was very enjoyable. It was about $45 pp. They give you free drinks and beer the entire time and take you to two different reefs so I think that the price was reasonable. The pool bar food was very good and we ate there quite often. Tramontos was also very good. We enjoyed the buffet on Italian night but I think that the buffet could be a hit or miss depending on which night you go and what kind of food you prefer. Some suggestions: *Do bring bug repellent as the bugs can be a little annoying at night. *Bring a small cooler that you can take some of your own drinks to the pool with you during the day. *Go into town as other suggest to get snack and drinks. This will save you some money rather than eating on the resort the entire time. *TTake advantage of the happy hours or the 2 for 1 drink prices. 11 a.m. -1 p.m. at the pool. 7 p.m.-8 p.m. at the Tramonto bar and 10 p.m.-11 p.m. in Del Lagos. I guess that you could say that your experience at the Mayan palace is what you make of it.

I went for a run and it took me 30 minutes to run from our room, to the pool, back thru the lobby, up to the main entrance (to the hwy) and back to our room. I can run 3 miles in 23 minutes, so there's a ton of walking involved. If you have small children, under age 4, I think it would be a nightmare. The pool bar happy hour is great. De Lago has good food. We went to the Mexican Feista and had a great time. The beach there is small and the water is full of rocks, but you can manuever your way down to the Ibeostar to walk along the beach. The rooms are spacious and the sofa's very comfortable. The only compliant I had is we never truly had any hot water. We asked for a correction on this, but it never happened. Also, there is no venting in the bathroom, so your suits never dried out and became sour. So we had to wash them with soap. It was super easy to get into playa using the Playa Express collectivos. We took a cab in one night for $10, but usually they want $18 each way, so only did that on the return trip to the grocery store. Any questions?

I'm wishing we were still there. The Resort is stunning. The landscaping is lush and lovely so that even though there is quite a walk to the parking lot or for some to the pool (we were lucky enough to be in building #2 very close to the pool) the walk is enjoyable. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which turned out to be exactly like the one pictured in the website. Our rooms were spotless. They were cleaned everyday, the beds were turned down each night. LInens were changed everyday. It is a tropical location and the humidity is so high that is is true that your clothes will be damp and wet suits are slow to dry out. Our clothes never did completely dry out so we took them home in a plastic bag and just washed them right away. It's also true that your clothes and room will be drier if you keep the a/c very cool, so bring a sweater and some slippers. We ate at the Balche Restaurant for breakfast and dinner several times and enjoyed every meal. The prices are very affordable. We loved being outside, and at night, the view of the pool is so beautiful. We rented a car from thrifty and picked it up at the Cancun airport. We wish we had remembered to see if we had coverage in Mexico with our regular car insurance policy but since we did not ,we opted to get full coverage which more than tripled the rental fee so that for the week the cost was $360.00. We did think that having the car was well worth it. We took side trips to Playa del Carmen (5th street is a must--We went there almost every evening), Tulum, Xcaret (we saved a few dollars on our tickets by purchasing them at Wal-Mart), and Chichen Itza. We also took the ferry from Playa del Carmen to Cozumel. In Cozumel we rented scooters (30.00 a day for a two seater). The scooter rental suggested a private beach where we snorkeled and had a wonderful lunch served right on the beach. It was a fun day but I would skip Cozumel next time. I shopped for pottery and vanilla and guess what? The best deals I found were at the Cancun airport. Maybe this is because I'm not very good at bartering. Anyway, you can buy the vanilla at the airport and they will deliver it to your gate. This allows you to bring it on the plane. (due to new security rules). I highly recommend the Mayan Palace.

Thanks to all of those who wrote previous reviews. They helped immensely!! We took advantage of our timeshare with the Mayan and could not have been more pleased. My husband and I traveled with my brother and his wife and we were so impressed with the staff and cleanliness of the resort. Everyone could not do enough for us!! Okay, now to specifics: It is important, if you don't want a long walk to the pool, to ask for the lowest number building you can. Tipping someone for a better room was on our agenda, but we didn't need to as we were in building 5. Also, we were not bothered except for a few phone calls, about the timeshare presentation. Not a big deal at all if you are up front with them and tell them you are not interested. The palapas are definitely an issue...for some. We just had to get up a little early to secure one. 6 am was the optimum time and several of the \"complainers\" were ones that arrived at noon and wondered why they did not have a palapa. We did notice that people would leave for 3-4 hours after putting their stuff on the palapas, which is not recommended, nor fair to others. If you want a palapa and wish to keep it, stay there!! The swim up bars and pool areas were incredible. Clean and wonderful. It seemed that each pool had a little different temperature, which was awesome for some of the cloudy days. We took the snorkel trip to Puerta Morelas. GOOD ONE!! Our guide helped us see lobsters, sting-rays and even a barracuda!! We had a smaller group and that was nice. The food and drink after the snorkel trip was GREAT!! Booking through the resort is definitely the easiet for your daily tours. They are helpful and transportation was not an issue. The workout area is well equipped and very nice. Nice people and the smoothies are pretty good. Beware of the protein one..it doesn't taste very good. We were impressed with the spa as well. I had a wonderful massage and relaxing day. BUT BE CAREFUL if you do the spa. As you check in, they give you a long pamphlet to read and then before you can read it, someone escorts you to the sauna, steam room and showers and tells you to get ready. There is no time to read the pamphlet...but DO!!! It says...way down on the list that you must wear your swimsuit in the common areas..sauna, steamroom, hottub, etc. When I arrived, I had the entire place to myself...so it's easy to assume you can just wear your towel, especially when the last step is the shower..who showers with their swimsuit on??? Most people go into a steam room with just a towel... ordinarily...but here it is not the case...beware... you might catch someone who did not read the pamphlet, sitting in the hottub or the steam room in their birthday suit. Luckily, I was not comfortable in my birthday suit, but it could have been very embarrassing. While waiting in my towel and robe in the hottub area, two MALE staff members came walking through with towels. YIKES!! The \"swimsuit\" issue seemed to get lost in translation. They did apologize and took wonderful care of me...and actually it was my fault for not reading! There is a beach area. From the other reviews, I figured there was NO beach. They have palapas and lounge chairs on the beach so you can see the ocean and enjoy the sound. Would not recommend walking out too far..still rocky but word was that tons of sand was coming in the next 7 weeks. They are doing their best!! Tramanto restaurant was good, but not excellent. Our favorite place to eat was La Parilla...authentic mexican food and to-die-for lobster and Shrimp in Playa. Would recommend the 5th Avenue Shrimp!! On that note, it is important to be aware that many restaurants in Playa take CASH ONLY, so you need to be prepared for that before you sit down. The bars like Carlos and Charlie's and Senor Frog's take credit cards, but many of the restaurants do not. For a late, after the bars, good eat.. we recommend Serapes!! 50 cent tacos... and incredible!! Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We had excellent service in all areas.

Our room was super clean. We did have those tiny ants, but because of trip advisor, I brought RAID ant traps with me and \"problem solved\". EVERY SINGLE staff member at this resort went above and beyond to make you happy. They were so kind. I would say the only thing this \"Irish family\" would have to complain about would be the lack of alcohol in the drinks! It seemed to take a lot to get \"happy\" during \"happy hour\". I solved my problem by getting shots with juice on the side! We only ventured from the resort a few times. The first time we took the shuttle to the outside of the resort and waited for the bus. Too many misquitos!!!!! My advise, pay the extra dollars and take a nice comfortable cab from the lobby door steps. Speaking of cabs......the cab drivers were WONDERFUL! Funny, kind. They made us laugh and we made them laugh. Food was pricy but this is a VACATION people! I enjoyed the fact that I didn't have to stand in a kitchen and prepare meals all week! The activity staff prepared all types of things for the kids. They made necklaces, paper flowers, had bingo movies. It was great. My kids had a sense of freedom on this vacation. They didn't argue with one another one time all week! It was great! We did go to XEL-HA all inclusive and this was my biggest disappointment. It took over an hour to get there because I booked it thru the travel agency at the hotel. We were one of several stops. We had to be in the lobby at 8:50 and didn't get to XEL-HA until 11am. The park closed at 5pm. By the time you snorkel and go down the river you have about 2 hours to do your \"all inclusive food and drink\". I thought the food was horrible. If you are going to do this, I would say book it in Playa and take a cab that way you might be able to enjoy more of your day at the actual location.

The room was decorated in a horrid color scheme of teal green, lime green, orange, yellow and red - enough to cause nightmares! Mine had tiny ants that required the \"fumigator\" and I looked up from the bed one night to see a lizard on the wall. The room was so damp that a piece of lingerie I washed in the sink was still wet two days later. When the a/c was turned up, it became cold and wet as opposed to warm and wet. My swimsuit never dried out from the time I took it off in the late afternoon to the next morning. Hair dryers are worthless - no power at all. I would advise bringing your own, but it is no use. Your hair will be flatt, frizzed, or limp the second you walk out your door. Forget makeup. Slick your hair back and don't even try to wear anything but a swimsuit outdoors. The restaurants are outdoors. No relief from the heat. There may be a breeze, but also insects. Many of my fellow guests were covered in bug bites. On site grocery/shops are very pricey, but still cheaper than going into town or eating at the buffets. A trip to the closest grocery in Playa by taxi is $40 RT. Drinks at the pool are $10 each including the obligitory tip. They heavily solicit them from 11:00 to 1:00 when they are 2/1. You must get to the pool by 6:30 to get a cabana. All are gone by 7:15. Many guests reserve them by placing items (book, magazine, a towel) early and never come back until after lunch. This seems unfair and the mgmt says they remove items left unattended, but I never saw it happen. BTW, the pool is only 3 feet deep. Not good for actual swimming - more like wading. The weather is oppressive. They say it is only 86 degrees in the heat of summer, but it was in the high 90's my entire trip in late October. I was unable to visit any of the local attractions due to the extreme heat and humidity. Some staff were courteous and helpful - mostly the housekeepers, cleaners, etc. Higher positions such as front desk and sales were not. The sales presentation. DO NOT under any circumstances attend the presentation. It is not worth it no matter what they offer. The staff are very abusive. I told them I was happy with my current timeshare and they accused me of wasting their time. I declined to have breakfast as it was outside and they told me I would be unable to get the $100 room credit. I merely asked to hear the presentation in the sales area where it was cooler. They asked me to leave. Most who I talked to said they were not let to leave until after several hours. Many spent the entire day trying to get away. When you try to leave they threaten to keep your gift. Later when I complained about the experience, they ignored me completely. Anyone on the sales staff is not to be trusted. They will say whatever they want to get what they want. I saw an elderly couple with more time than they could use pressured into buying even more. This was taking advantage in the worst way. DO NOT make a phone call. They are $6.50 per minute. I was told they were less then $10 for a short call of 5 minutes or so. My call was $35. The resort is huge. You must wait for the shuttles to take you anywhere. No handicap access. This was not a problem for me, but for others I talked to. Many of these vacationers are Seniors. No grab bars in the bath, no ramps. Wheelchairs must be taken over curbs. No shuttle transport for w/c or those not able to climb in and out of high up vans. No in room internet access. Unacceptable in a resort of this nature. No clocks anywhere. Bring your own alarm for that early wake up to the airport on your departure day. Operator wake up calls are not reliable. Staff will solicit you for tips at every opportunity. I had a water staff employee approach me and ask what happened to the tip he expected from the day before (he was not around when I finished my trip). How rude. If you go, bring slippers. The floors in the rooms are slick and cold. Water shoes are the only way to enjoy the rocky beach. Nightly shows - they are poor quality and many bits remind me of Spring Break - limbo contests, etc. Also, the daily \"noise\" at the pool consists of drinking games, karioke, etc. There is no escape from this between the hours of midday. If you like hearing \"YMCA\" blasted from the speakers, you will love it. If lying in a pool is all you want, go to Florida. It is cheaper, takes less travel time and is less complicated.

First off, the resort isn't really central to either Cancun or Playa de Carmen, but cheap busses and taxi vans are an economical way to get to both. The lobby is always hot and humid-I believe it was actually hotter inside the lobby than it was outside. I think a supposed 5-star resort should have AC in their lobby. Check in staff were pleasant, but because we were on a 'bonus week', we were stuck in building 19-as far away (nearly a mile) from the pool and beach as you could get. They have shuttles that run between all the buildings, but finding the correct shuttle when you needed it was usually difficult, and waiting in the hot sun without benches wasn't a great option so we usually ended up walking. Hallways are not air conditioned, so by the time you reach the pool, you're very hot and sweaty. We did take the shuttle to our building on arrival, with our baggage supposedly arriving 10 minutes later. After waiting over an hour for our luggage, we called-they apologized and finally delivered it 15 minutes later. The rooms are quite nice-we had a two bedroom suite with kitchenette. They are fairly large and comfortable, but not terribly luxurious. Overall, the rooms and the resort don't have much personality-rather blah in character, but pleasant enough. The pool was fine, but the beach still hasn't recovered from Hurricane Wilma. It had very sharp, rocky areas and wasn't condusive to swimming at all. There is construction going on everywhere-apparently they are adding 'new features' like a theatre for Cirque de Soliel. Alot of the resort is blocked off and there's constant construction noise. There really isn't much to do currently at the resort-just the basic swimming and sunning. Internet usage is restricted to the Internet Cafe, which costs an expensive $7 an hour to use. There is no option to use a wireless connection in your room. 5 star resorts should include free internet access. The only two restaurants we ate at were the pool bar, which was very good and reasonably priced. Service was fine and usually quick. The breakfast buffet at Del Lago was also quite nice. We ordered a room service pizza, which was good as well and not at all expensive. Drink prices are rather high, however. The tours we booked through the travel agency at the hotel were excellent-good tour guides and inclusive, with good food provided. We were called the morning after our arrival asking us to come to the lobby for our 'welcoming' package. The welcoming clerk was very kind, explaining some of the features of the hotel. She said that if went to their sales presentation, we would receive $100 our hotel tab, plus 15% off any tours or food there during our stay for sitting through a 90 minute presentation. Even though we've received much better incentives before at other timeshare resorts, we agreed and were signed up for the next day. Our sales rep was Paty-she started out very nice, but seemed uncertain if we were interested in buying. We had gone through a presentation at their sister resort in Mazatlan, and hadn't really liked it. She called over a sales manager, who decided to let her take us through the presentation because we hadn't had a good enough sales rep before. I wish we had left then! She rushed us through the complimentary buffet breakfast, which was very good. She insisted that we pay the tip (apparently not completely complimentary!) She then drug us through the presentation, showing us the 'superior' rooms at the Grand Mayan and then back over to the Mayan Palace, to basically show us the same rooms we were already in which was a waste of time. Paty then took us back to the sales room, where she started showing us all these numbers of how many weeks you can buy, and then rent out your weeks so your purchase pays for itself. It sounds good in principle, but is actually more of a shell game-they keep switching numbers around and moving so fast, all the time stressing what a good deal it is. She kept lowering the price and weeks available-they start out at $109,000 for 8 weeks and she worked down to $8000 for one. When we let her know we weren't interested, and were happy with the time share we already had, she became very nasty. She berated us for wasting her time and ours, and called us 'miserable'. She told us we taking money away from her and to never go to another timeshare presentation, even after we explained how we were solicited and certainly didn't go out of our way to solicit them! She treated us like we were stupid for not being interested in their 'superior' offer. After abusing us more but still attempting to sell us a timeshare, she finally brought us over to the ending sales rep. His job is to try to get you to come back with a cheap package to 'try' out the resort, but actually costs $5000 and you still have to pay $350 for each week you use. He was apologetic when we told him of our unpleasant encounter with Paty, but overall was a very nasty situation.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cThey Saved My Vacation!!\u201d", "Author": "Tokim", "ReviewID": "UR5911641", "Content": "What a great place!!

This is our second time staying here and we love it. You can't help but be overwelmed but the beauty. Far enough away from the city to be in the culture of Mexico, but close enough to the city if you have the need for the hustle and bustle. We originally visited this property before it even opened (Nov 2004 I think), and can fully appreciate the ongoing construction not to mention the reconstruction of that which was destroyed by the hurricane. We were sorry to see the loss of the beautiful restraunts on the beach front. But we were told the new ones should be open in December. For all the grumbling about the construction there are those that can appreciate the progress and the vision for the future. Looking forward to our next visit. The new waterpark and pools should be open near the end of the year. I took several of the tours with my 17 year old daughter (booked through the resort travel agency) and with out a doubt the snorkle trip to Puerto Morelos was one of the best snorkles I've had in the Riviera. The crew is great the sites are awesome. Saw barracuda, lobster, moray eel, rays, and countless others. So be sure to check out this day trip. It actually is two hours in the water and a nice meal. By comparison the trip to Isla Mujueres is more like a cattle drive with a couple hundred snorklers on the site at the same time. A bit disappointing, but we got to see the island for the first time.

Like many others, we were skeptical after reading hundreds of reviews. I'm happy to report none of the negative reviews were encountered on our trip. Yes, there were several \"sales\" representatives at the airport, but we just continued walking and saying \"no gracias\" and were left alone. After our ride, which we had reserved prior to leaving home, took us to the hotel, we were greeted by the desk clerk very curteously and professionally. Our room was just as we had requested, a one bedroom suite. It was clean and nicely decorated. Because of the time, (7:30 pm) we quickly sought out some place to have dinner, which ended up being the Balche restaurant. Dinner was very nice and again, the staff was excellent. I should mention the heat and humidity made our stay a bit uncomfortable, but we knew going in that it was the hotest time of the year, so we just accepted it and made the best of it. We were in building 14, I think. When I asked the bellman what building we were being taken to he said 4, but I think our group of buildings were newer and we were in building 4 of the new section. In any case, we were a bit far from the pool, but always had a quick pick up by the shuttle. We took the all inclusive tour of Xel-Ha and Tulum, which was fantastic! We did a lot of snorkeling and found Tulum to be fascinating. We spent most of the other days either by the beautiful pool, which everyone seems to agree on, or a couple of day trips to Playa del Carmen and Cancun. Unfortunately because of the heat, our day at Playa was cut a little short. We found that after walking for about an hour or so, we couldn't tolerate the heat much more. The transportation to Playa was on a local bus and the ride home was on a collectivo. Both were fun experiences! You get a lot of the local flavor traveling that way. On our last day, we scheduled another snorkeling trip in front of the hotel on the beach, which was wonderful. We were taken to two different spots located on a reef and saw several fish including two baracuda! All in all, our vacation was just we had hoped for! Lots of sun, swimming and snorkeling, sight-seeing and excellent accommodations. The staff was as good as it gets. We never had a problem with sales people and truly felt as if we were being catered to and pampered. Both my husband and myself went to the spa on our second day for a massage (hubby) and facial (me). With only a small mix up on appointment time, the entire experience was very relaxing and enjoyable. So, like many others have suggested, just go with an open mind, be positive and take in the ambience. You'll have a wonderful vacation and I'm sure will want to return soon. We were lucky enough to be guests of a timeshare owner, so it cost us very little in terms of our stay. We would love to return someday, but in the meantime, we have fond memories.

Here's our take on the resort: ************* THE GOOD ************************** Service. Any time you turn around there were hoards of service personnel waiting to help you and answer any questions might you have. Service personal were well groomed, wore uniforms, were always very polite and gracious. Restaurant quality. The beach front restaurant is still being rebuilt after the 2005 hurricane.... so the Pool side \"snack bar\" is serving as the beach/pool restaurant. The prices were $18 to $35 (US) for dinner entr\u00e9es. At night live music is provided. The food was very good (presentation, taste, etc). The \"Lagoon\" restaurant is where they offer a breakfast buffet. It was an excellent buffet with all sorts of Mexican and US dishes. Price: $18 USD plus mandatory tip. The pool. Said to be one of the largest free form pools in the world, it certainly is huge. The water is about 4 foot deep through most of the pool with some sections shallower for kids. They had beach chairs, umbrellas and even covered beds all around the pool. It was very nice. ************** THE BAD ************************** Phone rates. Phone rates are $6.50 USD per minute to the USA, $5.50 USD per minute to Canada and $4.50 per minute USD to anywhere else in the world... that\u2019s right, you can call Cambodia for less than calling the USA. Even 800 calls within Mexico have a very hefty connection charge (and possibly per minute fee as well, I can't remember). Recommendation: To make calls use a cell phone of your own or using calling cards with a payphone in the resort lobby. To receive calls, have your friends call the resort directly (don\u2019t use the 800 number in the USA that the resort provides\u2026 they will charge hefty long distance fees if you do). 3 hour sales extremely pushy sales presentation. We had read on one of our guidebooks, (Moon guidebooks I believe) that this resort was known for their pushy sales tactics. They boast the largest time-share sales room in the world (it certainly was quite large). What was supposed to be a 90 minute presentation turned into 3+ hours. We were first offered a package at close to $70,000 for a \"right-to-use\" for a few weeks at the Grand-Mayan. They tried all sorts of sales tactics\u2026 including my favorite: Trying to sell my wife on a package so that if I were to get terminally ill, we would have some place to spend our last few weeks together. Although our sales rep was quite nice, when the \u201cmanager\u201d came over, he actually was quite rude (as was the \u201cdeveloper rep\u201d). One interesting thing they noted: Every 5th year they charge an extra maintenance fee ($800) to replace ALL the furniture in the rooms to supposedly maintain the 5-star status of the resort. The management takes all the old furniture and donates it to Mexican charities (as a tax write-off). So yes.. you as the owner pay excessive fees for new furniture ($800 X 52 weeks = $42,000 USD) for a few chairs, tables and a sofa bed\u2026 and the property manager gets a huge tax write-off with the donation. Recommendation: if you attend the time share presentation, don\u2019t be pressured into any of their \u201conce-in-a-life-time\u201d offers. Remember that buying time-shares is almost always better on the re-sale market. Rocky Beach. The 2005 hurricane wiped away the sand under the water and what\u2019s left is sand on the beach up to the water\u2019s edge and only rocks under the water. Recommendation: Go to a beach at Playa Del Carmen if you want to get in the water. They\u2019ve got great beaches and a good snorkeling reef at Playa del Carmen. They even have a Wal-Mart in Playa del Carmen. Shuttle service un-predictable. There is a central parking lot in the resort near the main lobby. Little vans and golf-cart-sized trains move people between the Mayan Palace, the Grand Mayan, the restaurants, the beach, etc. These supposedly run every 15 minutes but we found them to be quite un-predictable and didn\u2019t really follow a schedule. They had clocks that were supposed to indicate the \u201cnext-departure-time\u201d, but we found these to me in-accurate more often than not. Lacking patience and probably needing the exercise, we ended up walking most places instead of waiting for the shuttle. Our room was on the golf-course, so this translated to about 1/3 mile each way to the parking lot, \u00bd mile each way to the pools and even further for the Lagoon restaurant or the Beach. More of a construction zone than a resort. They are building like crazy. Much of the north and western edge of the lagoon is blocked off with construction walls. They are adding new buildings all over the resort. During the day, the sounds of large construction equipment, pounding, jack-hammers, etc is quite pervasive throughout the resort. Another concern: The pools and beach front seamed well sized to handle the current number of rooms. What happens though after they finish adding so many more buildings? (It will likely feel crowded). Cheap construction, hard floors (rooms echo). The bathtub/shower was one of those pre-fab plastic/fiberglass units that wasn't installed well... the sides flexed heavily when pressed on. The tub/shower faucet was plumed backwards (left for cold, right for hot) even though the red and blue colors were on the left and right respectively. The rooms felt very utilitarian. The hard floors, walls, ceilings with plain colors didn't feel luxurious at all. No in-room internet connection. In the USA I can get a free internet connection in a 1-star hotel. Though they offer an \"Internet Cafe\" which charges per hour for net connections, why don't they offer in-room net connections if they are truly a 5 star, gold-crown resort? Mandatory tips. To make it easier on their guests (and to conveniently make it so that few of their employees handle cash) the resort is a no-cash zone. Everything is charged to the room. There is a mandatory 15% gratuity (included in all food charges). Gratuity should not be mandatory in my opinion. Though the service we received was excellent\u2026. We should have been given the option of adjusting the gratuity as we saw fit. Mosquitoes: The lobby is open-air and even before we were checked in while in the lobby, I found a mosquito biting me. We were prepared though and brought plenty of bug spray. Applying bug spray is highly recommended especially in the early morning and the evening when mosquitoes are at their worst. High laundry prices: To do your own laundry with your own soap it costs about $8 USD per load. Recommendation: Find a cheaper laundry-mat in Playa-Del-Carmen. ************* THE UGLY ************************* Ants in the room.. Note: We were in a second floor room. The first day we arrived we left out a cookie on the kitchen counter wrapped in aluminum foil. The next morning we found a large quantity of small ants all over the cookie. We cleaned it up, called house-keeping. They came with a small can of raid and said that yes the ants were common especially when any type of food was left out. We found these same ants all over the main room and in the bedroom as well. We decided to purchase our own can of RAID (specifically anti-ant) and also some powder to put down. Even though we used both full cans of insecticide. All around the kitchen area, in the cupboards, along the baseboards, etc. we still later found more ants. Another employee we talked to at the resort said \u201cyeah, these ants come out around June-July and stay around until Mid-October when the inexplicably disappear\u201d. He continued: \u201cThese small ants are quite harmless, in-fact, you can even eat them. They aren\u2019t like the large black ants that you\u2019ll see on the side walks\u2026 now those you should be concerned about if they get in the rooms.\u201d My take: No resort should have insect problems in the rooms and claim to be 5 star. Recommendation: Don\u2019t leave ANY food out on the counters, tables, etc. Wash all dishes immediately after use. *********** SUMMARY ************************* We came away viewing the resort as a huge money making machine. They are adding many facilities (shops, activities, etc) to the resort to keep you spending your money there rather than going off campus. It was nice to be away from all the hustle and bustle of the Cancun Hotel zone, to be closer to Playa-del-Carmen, which is just as nice but more laid back and slightly less touristy than Cancun. We liked the good aspects of the resort well enough to perhaps go there again some time should the opportunity arise. If we do go again, at least we will know what to expect.", "Date": "September 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cI Don't Understand How Anyone Can Give This Less Than Four Stars!\u201d", "Author": "wowzers17", "ReviewID": "UR5812645", "Content": "From the moment we arrived at the Mayan Palace, we had the best time of our lives! Don't be fooled by negative reviews; you WILL have a good time at the Mayan Palace. We stayed from September 9-16. We didn't rent a car because after reading the reviews, we felt it was unncessary and we could not have been more right. If you call ahead, you can arrange for a shuttle from the Mayan to pick you up at the airport...just watch out for time share people. Right after we went through customs there they were, and they were so sneaky! The Mayan drivers wear RED shirts with their emblem, and one of the time share sharks came up to me and very simply asked where I was from and where I was staying. I answered the Mayan Palace and he said \"ah yes, go out through those doors and look for the people in the yellow shirts, and they will not only take you to your destination, but will help set you up with some free tours.\" If you've been paying attention, the drivers at the Mayan do not wear yellow shirts and this man was blatently telling me a lie to get me to listen to his company. If I had not known about the RED shirts (the concierge will send you a confirmation email when you set it up, confirming pickup information), I would have wasted who knows how long of my life. After we got to the Mayan Resort we checked in seemlessly and were not haggled even once by the time share people at the resort. Our room was in building 15, which after reading the past reviews sounded horrible, but in reality it was far from it. Going to the pool consisted of a two minute walk to the lobby (through the beautiful gardens might I add) and taking a 5 minute shuttle ride to the pool. All said and done, it probably takes ten minutes max to get to the pool from building 15, and it's not even that bad, since you are distracted by the lovely grounds. Sure the beach was rocky...but the pool overlooks the ocean, so it was no hassle to swim in the pool and still have an ocean view. The pool was maintained very well in my opinion, especially considering how huge it is. Yeah, there were a few leaves here and there, and in the corners where the flow isn't good, there was a little sun-tan lotion scum, but in the rare instance you did see some scum in a corner, or leaves floating, you could just swim away. Who swims in the corners of a pool anyway? The pool was way too large to be held up on a little bit of inconvenience which comes with pool ownership in general. Basically, I was very impressed by the pool, and having owned a pool myself, I was additionally impressed by how clean they kept it considering it's size. If you want to know about the food, read elsewhere, because I feel it has been accurately analyzed in othere reviews for me to go into it here. To sum it up however, I had no problems with any of the food. I felt it was priced well and was very delicious, no matter what place you choose to eat. More on renting a car: I and my fiance' went on this trip expecting to do a lot of activities, so renting a car was definitely in our crosshairs. However, everything we wanted to do we were able to schedule through the travel agency at the Mayan. All activites scheduled through them include charter bus service (that's right...those big busses with the comfy chairs) FROM THE LOBBY (no having to meet anyone at the front gate). Additionally, all activites scheduled through them include whatever meals you would normally eat during the time of the excursion (for the Chitzen Itza excursion we actually got breakfast and lunch). So basically, it may cost a little more, but you are getting literally door to door transportation, meals, AND whatever you signed up for. All you have to do is show up in the lobby at the time your charter bus leaves and everything has been pretty much taken care of. Conclusively, NOT renting a car is the way to go; yeah, you'll pay a little extra by scheduling it at the resort, but you probably would have spent extra on renting a car and buying meals anyway. Definitely visit Xel-Ha, and if you are traveling as a couple, DEFINITELY do the Lobster Cruise. Everyone creates their own reality, so if you are looking to nitpick and find things wrong, you probably could, but if you are going to have a good time and enjoy yourself then you definitely will!", "Date": "September 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious & Beautiful!\u201d", "Author": "butterfly8054", "ReviewID": "UR5810088", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Mayan Palace on the Riviera Maya over Valentine's Day 2005.

It had a very large free weight and machine room, a large cardio room with about 5 treadmills, 2 elipticals, and 2 bikes (i believe this was the makeup...I just remember it was a LOT), and there was even an aerobics room with mats and exercise balls. Every morning there was a HUGE breakfast buffet with everything that you could think of from tables of various fresh fruit, a cereal bar, yogurt, granola, about every american breakfast food you could think of, and an elaborate mexican breakfast setup also. You could also get a number of fresh squeezed juices (even juices like watermelon juice!). My favorite though was the fresh omlets made to order as you wait! The rooms were gorgeous! Marble floors with mahogany door and trim. Our room was a garden view, but it was absolutely gorgeous overlooking a variety of tropical plants, and we could even see a little bit of the ocean in the background! Our room also had a small kitchen, which we used to make sandwiches for lunch or keep snacks in the refrigerator. There's a small grocery store onsite with the essentials!

You do a lot of walking, but the grounds were beautiful and there are continuous shuttles if you need them. No problem with the time-share people. We checked in late - around 7pm and were the only ones checking in. They asked about a tour and we just said \"no thank you\" - no hassles. We stayed in the Mayan Palace - building 3, but were upgraded to the Grand Mayan because they said they were going to do some maintenance in our building. Both places were nice. The Grand Mayan has a dipping pool on the patio, which in heat of September felt great! Pool is amazing and where you spend most of your day. There is a big beach for those who like the sand, however, it is true there is no ocean swimming there. Not being beach lovers, we enjoyed the rocks more. Took water shoes, and spend hours searching for shells in the rock formations. They were fascinating - go down at low tide. Also went scuba diving and snorking right there from the beach. Reefs were great. We rented a car through Budget - with insurance was about $310 for the week. Rented over the internet, printed out reservation & prices in both american dollars and pesos - was charged the exact amount that was quoted. Budget was friendly to deal with. Roads were well marked and we had no problems with the police. (Just watch for the speed bumps when you start to enter the towns). Spent quite a lot of time in Playa. People super friendly and helpful. Always felt safe and never like I was \"ripped off\". Also ate in Puerto Moralas a couple times at Pelicans. Great, fresh seafood, and you can't beat the atmosphere right on the beach. Would love to go back - but not in September. Although it was very quiet at the resort and in town (off season) it was VERY hot and humid. By the way, the alligators were in the small pond right outside of our Building - #7.

This was our first visit after purchasing 5 years ago and we had a fabulous time. Thought I'd share my thoughts while they are still fresh. I got so much from this site before we left, I just had to come back and report. 1) Yes the sale people are a bit fanatical from the moment you step off the plane. But if you know how to handle them you'll be fine. Even the hotel ones we're easy to handle. We just told them no, we weren't interested in upgrading at this time. It means we miss out on some discounts, but who cares. I budgeted before this and wasn't expecting discounts. 2) Scuba - Expensive and not very interesting but how easy is it walk to the beach right where you are staying? They do offer a cave dive too and I heard it's pretty good. Staff is excellent! Very friendly and accomodating. BTW it's SSI for those certification snobs. 3)Food - Thought the buffet was way over priced and not very good. Restuarant by the pool, the fancy italian place or room service is highly recommended. No more than eating out herer and the food is excellent. 4) Definitely go to the Walmart and get food for your room, breakfast, sandwiches, snacks and liquor. Just don't go on Sunday for liquor. They don't sell it at the stores on Sunday. 5) Bring all over the counter medicines you may need. They don't have any of the same stuff we get here. I caught a cold but luckily had brought some nyquil. Didn't bring dayquil though and had to use stuff that didn't work as well. 6) Bring suntan lotion - it's very expensive at the store on sight. Walmart may be cheaper though. 7) We used the Playa Express to go to Playa Del Carmen. Picked it up across the street from the main gate. 11 pesos ($1). Can't beat that. The trip back you have to go to a small parking lot off 2nd Avenue. It's just a card table and the vans that say Playa Express. Just tell the bus driver you want to go to Mayan Palace. 8) If you take the ferry to Cozumel, don't buy a round trip ticket. There are two copanies and they have different return times. It's easy to buy a return ticket once you are there. 9) Chichen Itza overnight is the only way to go. Bought and overnight package from entertain-plus.com and it was great. Stayed at the Mayaland hotel. Food was excellent and didn't have do to the whole middle of the day tourist rush in the heat. Only $80 per person included ride there (through Grayline Tours), lunch on day of arrival (get sticker from tour guide on grayline bus), room and ride back. Don't foget to tell the guides the next day thought that you are riding back with them and exactly where you expect to be dropped off. We caught the bus at a big shopping plaza and then they didn't go back there on the way home. We didn't really feel like a tour guide would provide anymore info than we could read ourselves in the pamplets. and we went around 5pm and then early in the morning the next day (had to re-pay to get in for this though). Mayaland other Tours - Don't do the cave tour. There's no air pumped in and it wasn't very interesting.

We knew going in that this was a timeshare, so we said no to the tour, and weren't hassled at ALL afterwards. We also knew that the rooms are built perpendicular to the coast, per hurricane regulations, so didn't mind not seeing the ocean view from our living room. The rooms are beautiful - marble floors, expansive living room, comfy couches, and a very serviceable kitchen. We had a few minor inconveniences in the room (the safe got weirded out, opening and closing on its own, and our toilet got plugged up on the last day) but one phone call, and we had immediate, professional, and polite service to fix the problem. We found the staff to be hard-working, professional, polite, and friendly! the pool, as many have already said, was amazing - clean, cool, HUGE, and fun - especially the activities directors who set up water aerobics, water volleyball, salsa classes, and \"name that tune\" games in and around the pool. We also used the beach - if you walk about five-ten minutes to the right, you will find a beautiful small sandy beach with NO coral or rocks to hurt yoru feet! We used that beach a few times during our stay. but if you want to sit right in front of the resorts beach, grab a lounger and put it in the water - you'll enjoy the soft water and a comfy seat at the same time! Food service at the pool or for breakfast was prompt, and efficient, and the prices were very reasonable. We did go to the fancier (and more expensive) Italian restaurant on two evenings, and were delighted with the cuisine, service, and a wonderful aria-singing waiter who wandered around the place while we ate. The Mexican show was great in the del Lago restaurant, but we also took time to have dinners/lunches in nearby Playa del Carmen - took a taxi many times, and an occasional \"Collectivo\" to town.. not bad prices, either. The only downside was the spa - while the facilities there are beautiful, soothing, and very clean, I didn't care for the massage I received - I\"ve had better in the past - this particular massuse didn't ask if I had specific needs and didn't seem to understand my questions or concerns.. I could have just enjoyed the spa - hot tub, sauna, steam room, swiss shower, etc, without the massage and be perfectly fine. We also went to Xel-Ha, using the bus system, and to Tulum, as well. Did a catamaran trip with Playa.info, which was so much fun, totally worth the expense of that trip. Folks also took the ferry to Cozumel, and did some shopping... we went snorkeling, swimming, ruins visiting, all in and around the Mayan Rivieria resort. All in all, this was a wonderful experience - and we experienced NONE of the horrors some folks on this website seem to crow about. Just remember - you're a guest in another country, and the folks who live and work there try very hard to make your stay a pleasant one.. Perhaps us as Americans need to do the same. Would I go back?

About a 10 minute walk from our room, next to the beach, not that far at all. The pool is very large with multiple levels. We spent 8 hours at the pool 3 different days! We highly recommend that you visit XCaret. It is close the the Mayan Palace and is an ecological park with very cool underground rivers and caverns that you can snorkel in. Animals (like a zoo), beautiful flowers (see the orchids) and several nice restaurants in the Park. Just go upstairs in the Palace lobby to book the bus trip to XCaret. Be sure to get the package with the snorkel gear, lunch and show. The buffet at the very unique restaurant was great. *THE SHOW* - the show at XCaret at the end of the day was probably the best large production I have ever seen in my life. IT IS A MUST SEE! The Mexican music, costumes, dancing etc. was absolutely wonderful! The only problem on our trip was when we took a shuttle into Cancun (about a 30 minute ride). The shuttle driver on the return trip missed the entrance to the Mayan Palace. I yelled at him and went up to the front of the shuttle to tell him, but he fed me some garbage about \"They are working on the road\", which was a total lie. He would not turn around to take us back, then dropped us off about 1/2 mile south of the Mayan Palace and we had to walk in the pitch dark. My wife almost fell into a hole. We complained to the guard at the gate. Also - Watch out for the TimeShare sales pitch (\"tour\"). Good Luck! Other than that one shuttle incident, our trip was amazing!

I originally did not like the layout of the hotel ( the buildings run perpindicular to the beach), so basically only the front building had beach views. My niece lives in Cancun and she explained that it had to be built that way due to Cancun building codes. Basically to make the buildings safer in the event of a hurricane. After hearing this explanation I relaxed more about that issue! The resort is very pretty and meticulously maintained. Any walking we did was always greeted by a clean, lush environment. Food was very good, but it is on the pricey side. Although after comparing it to the total cost of all-inclusive resorts, we ended up spending less. And I have two sons, 10 and 13 who eat like there is no tomorrow! The pool was excellent, well maintained and open 24 hours! (Careful, they do the major pool cleaning in the wee hours, so a private swim is a little hard to come by.) The spa is awesome, too bad it is not included in the price. Entrance price to the spa is fair, but the other spa services can be pricey. The beach was basically unswimmable. Due to Wilma, the is no sand, so it is VERY rocky. It is a beautiful beach to look at. I asked and they told me that they will be dredging sand from the ocean to repair the erosion. Bottom line, we will return. Over all experience was great.

Many times I just walked the 1/2 mile or so to avoid having to wait for a people mover (you were never sure if one was running to the remote parking area). The staff was extremely professional and polite, and the suite was nice. However, most rooms do not have any real views. In fact, most areas of the pool do not even have an ocean or beach view either. The pool is massive but that is it. My general feel for this place was that it was poorly designed both in regard to guest conveniences and aesthetics. Some folks have a 15 minute walk to the resort's only pool. Many times there were more people waiting for the shuttle than could fit on it, and many times they ran out of pool towels. I called room service for a glass of milk and was told it would take 40 minutes. Again, the place is too big for its own good. Lastly, for us anyway, everything to do on the Yucatan mainland (swimming beaches, Xel Ha, XCaret, Cenotes, Tulum, Coba, Chitzen Itza etc...) starts very close to or south of Playa Del Carmen. There are dozens of smaller, hotels in Playa or any of the numerous villages south that have ocean views and true Carribean ambiance for the same or less money.

Deboarding the plane with paperwork properly completed. Picking up luggage and heading through customs. Navigating the other side of customs looking for transportation. In this last phase you are immediately, and agressively approached by the \"time share salespeople\". They all wear uniforms and name tags that indicate they are passenger assistance. They try to give you maps and book tours. Continue outside where you will find the Mayan Palace folks in navy blue pants, red shirts with the Mayan Palace logo. Show the reservation you made by calling ahead or contacting them on the internet. They put you in a bus that holds about 8-9 people and you make the 25 minute journey to the Mayan Palace. Deboard the bus, let the bell hops take your bags and go inside to register. Wait in line for your turn. At this point you declare your status for the week. You are classified as adult or child (11 and under), owner of Mayan or time share swapper. Then you are given a wrist band that indicates this status you wear for the week. After registering, you are approached by the lady selling time share presentations for Mayan. They will offer you promotional prices on the tours, $100 off your bill and 15% off the other items that are not promotional pricing or happy hour. We were not offered an upgrade to Grand Mayan as we were already registered. We had requested a building close to the pool (1-5) after reading the other posts on this site. We were assigned to building 14 which was in the opposite direction of the pool from the lobby. This is not exactly the prime location. The buildings are layed out like cars on a train, end to end and in a numerical system that starts with one by the pool and continues to the distance. The walk to the pool, at a brisk pace, is about 12 minutes. A shuttle will take you to the lobby and from there you can catch a shuttle to the pool. The only issue is that these shuttles are a sporadic 20-30 minutes between runs from the remote suites. From the lobby, you can catch a ride to the pool about every 15 minutes. Workout room was very nice. $10 per day or $40 per week. Plenty of weight machines, free weights. About 6 treadmills, 3 elipticals, 3 bikes. Pool and Ocean: There are plenty of lounge chairs at the pool and a few cabana's with bed's or lounge chairs. The cabanas are claimed by 8 in the morning. The pool is absolutely huge in acreage. It is not very deep, maybe 4 feet at the most. In July, while we are here, the water heats up pretty well, it is probably about 95 degrees in the water. The beach, which you come to Cancun to experience, is terrible. My daughters were hugely disappointed when they could only go into the water that was mid calf deep. There are no jacuzzi's and no water slide at the pool. There are a decent amout of water activity hosted by the activity team at the pool. Restaurants: There are very limited choices on this property. We ate several times at the pool side restaurant. It was decent with moderate prices. Excursions: Chichen-Itza: Excellent tour of the Mayan ruins and lessons in Mayan history. The bus long is ride, but well worth it. The stop at the mexican handicraft shops is not a good place to get bargains. The stop at the senoyta is terriffic, the jump about 20 feet is cool, and the overall experience is wonderful. The guide was the best. It poured rain about 80 minutes into our tour. We were stranded in trying to stay dry for an hour before we restarted our tour in a steady rain. Xel Ha: Nice natural water park. Snorkeling was okay, raft run was fun; swam with the dolphins which was really fun but pricey. Food and beverage was a good deal. Cancun: only made it there during the day, missed the night life (drat). Prices were much more negotiable there with vendors.

Got to reserve a bed-palapa on the last day by going to it at 6:45 am. Cannot leave your belongings there for more than an hour as there was a hotel person making rounds. I saw him remove the belongings of a neighboring bed palapa as they had left it unoccupied for an hour. They should have a better system of reserving one. Playa del Carmen was absolutely great. Preferred it to Cancun. The food and service at Karens was so good that even the waiter seemed a little surprised at the large tip we left. We ate at the pool-side restaurant several times. The food was OK and a bit pricey compared to Playa del Carmen. I also recommend going to Playa del Carmen's beach instead of Mayan Palace's rocky waters. Although I recommend renting a car, the worst part of our vacation was our experience with Hertz. It took us over an hour to get our car...and that was better than many others. The average time at the counter seemed like 20 minutes and there was an excruciatingly long and hot wait for the cars to arrive as there was only one non-English speaking employee bringing cars to and from the lot. The scene was somewhat comical as this guy reminded me of Manuel of Faulty Towers. Beware of the estimated price Hertz quotes over the internet. Mine was quoted with evrything (including tax) at about $180/week but the girl at the counter charged my cc $300. I have no idea what Hertz will finally charge me as I was not given a receipt upon my return and told that the initial quoted estimate of $300 that was charged to my cc was my final receipt. I nervously await my cc bill. Tulum was quite inspiring. I recommend going there with plenty of food and water as the facilities there are sub-standard and pricey. Do take the bus ride from the parking lot to the ruins as the walk would be long and dusty. Also attended a 90-minute sales pitch at Moon Palace (near Cancun airport).

Why then did we book a stay there? Because so far it has been the only place we have been able to book for our trial membership that we paid hard earned money for. Note: if you make the choice to do their sales pitch, have them in writing say what you will get for attending (aim high), and most important DO NOT BUY. Stick to your guns and keep saying NO.

Take your money and reserve a villa in some exotic location for a week, you will get more for your money and memories too. So they did ask us again to attend their presentation to hear about what is new. But they did not offer us an upgrade or anything to suffer through it, so we said no thanks. (I was prepared for the lies this time, per another posters comments). The \"hostess\" told us no one ever declines! Check in took FOREVER and the lobby was very hot. The bellboy was very nice. Wish I could remember his name because I thought he went above and beyond his duties. We requested buildings 1-7 got building 6. We had a one bedroom with kitchen. Microwave, toaster, blender, dishes and frig. We bought some supplies at the wal mart in Playa. Bedroom had very uncomfortable king size bed. Our kids slept in living room, two on the couch's and one on a pull out. They said they were very comfortable! Bring some slippers for walking around in the room or use your flip flops, the floor is dirty. There was a picture missing in the bedroom, they had left the nails to possibly hang it. We had to have the safe bolted down, it was just sitting on the closet shelf ready to be carried out! Had a little ant problem even though we were on the third floor. Air conditioning in the living area was very loud. We finally called and one evening they replaced a part on it. I must say though that anytime we called for something to be done, it was pretty quick and the front desk called us back to confirm the request was met. The walk to the pool was not bad. Be careful when the path is wet, it does get slippery, Now to the famous large pool. It is a site to see! But DIRTY! On our second day, one of our daughters stepped on a piece of soder that was in the bottom of the pool, probably left after a patch job. They had to dig pieces out of her foot. A couple of days after that in a different section, my son found feces in the bottom of the pool. My husband asked for the area to be cleaned, they never did. Throughout our stay, there was disgusting slime and diaper pieces floating in it. Take a pop open floaty with you, it was great to have! Excellent pizza at the pool side restaraunt. Two lite eaters can share. We did the Mexican fiesta at the Del Lago. EXPENSIVE! The show was so, so it needs work. Best part was when they had some guests up on stage. Food was nothing to write home about. Got to drink lots though!! Did not eat at the Italian place. Heard it was pretty good though. The men needed shirts with sleeves, my son only had muscle type shirts so we did not go, so bring casual nice clothes. And reservations are needed. They come around for drink/food orders by the pool quite a bit. Spend, Spend, Spend! The store is expensive, but for water and 2 liter pop in a hurry was fine. Take the Playa express to Playa del Carmen, but go in the late afternoon/early evening. We went during afternoon and it was way to hot to enjoy, ate at Karen's great food and service there. Snorlking at Xel Ha was amazing, we arranged for tickets while in Playa, I think it was Cancun tours. Transportation, all-inclusive entry $90 per adult. River float not so good. Though the Mayan Palace does not allow the bus to come in, you have to get a ride down to main gate and it will pick you up there and drop you back off. There was never a problem with the bug spay they do in the evenings. Construction did not bother us, we just looked past it. Even though they say you are not to reserve the palapalas, if you don't you won't get one until later in the evening! I only saw one time that they removed someone's belongings and that was because a family asked them too, by 7 or 7:30 in the morning they are pretty much gone. The shade helps in the hot afternoon sun. You also check out towels and if you do not return them by 9, they say they can charge you. We always returned them! The beach is rocky bring water shoes. If you snorkle off the beach watch out for the wave runners! Will we go back to this resort? No. Wil I recommend this resort to anyone? No. If you decide to go there RESEARCH everything you can. Read past posts. It was also very crowded when we went because it is Mexican Holiday time right now. Don't know if that made a difference or not. Be prepared to shell out money. Another tip, bring a soft side rolling cooler that folds down (even though they say not to). Great for taking to pool for waters, and cokes. Tip your maid...she deserves it! It was the people that worked the hardest that were the friendliest and tried to make things pleasant. Oh and for the kids, on Wednesdays (double check this) they release baby turtles to the ocean and get to name it and a certificate. That was special for my turtle loving daughter. Weigh your options to all-inclusive verses the non. That's what I will do next time. I gave this resort an okay because that is what it was for us, yes we still had a good time even though we were not crazy about the place. How can you not have a little enjoyment with the ocean breeze and palm trees and HOT weather. We previously stayed at (pre-hurricane) Xpa-ha Palace.

Although everything went smoothly for the week, on the last day we were robbed while at the beach around 8:30 a.m. We suspect it probably was a hotel employee simply because there was hardly anyone else around, and one employee was suspiciously on the beach - he was dressed in non-beach/pool uniform. I do not blame the hotel per se, but the concierge did little to help. We got not even an \"I am sorry.\" I thought the least they could do would be give us a free meal or something. Generally, we found the concierge to be of little value - often we got no or wrong information. I agree with most of the reviews here. The rooms are servicable and the property fine. The pool is great - the only negative is the general lack of enforcement of the reserving policy. When we would get up each morning, we would find every bed and covered spot \"reserved\" with cups, shoes or a towel with the people not arriving for hours later. If you want a good spot, plan on arriving by 6 a.m to beat the overweight senior citizens. The food and drinks are decent with the former being pricey and the latter being priced well. The beach are is small but servicable. Like others, we went into Playa most evenings. I can highly recommend Karen's and The Tropical - great food and prices. DO NOT GO TO BIG LOBSTER. The restaurant mischaracterized its specials - got us in with 2x1 and then said \"only first order\" and the drinks were terrible - no tequila in the margarita's. Karen's is great, and Tropical has great food and better prices. Overall, the Mayan Palace is a decent spot - ideal for a family: lots of activities and remote so the kids can't wander off. We have done the all-inclusive in Cancun, which obviously is a much better deal.

First off, as always, thanks to ALL the tripadvisors who posted reviews. We were ready for everything and knew the good and bad-no surprises. I exchanged thru RCI (Orlando property) to get this place and it was the best exchange we ever got. My kids loved this place and the pool is all they say it is-except dirty. Especially nice is going to the pool at dusk and listening to the band(s) playing at the restauraunt (Balache-food/prices and service were fine) every night. It is quite empty. Shuttle service was regular-never waited more than 5 min. (always in shade) and room was fine-kids loved cartoon network (in Eng. and Spanish). The activity center for the kids is exceptional-the staff-as all the staff at the hotel- are terrific. Towel exchange is easy-just get them back or exchanged by 9:00 PM. Check in was smooth and the timeshare sharks were persistant but took no for an answer (NOTE: be firm and realize that 5 or more buildings are going up and each room needs to have 52 owners, so this will be a problem for some time). We enjoy walking as a family and purposely walked to the pool thru the gardens-in morning and evening, there is partial shade. Yes, the beach is not pretty but you CAN easily swim in the water right in front of the pool if you bring water shoes-we all did fine in K-Mart specials. ALL the days were calm, the water is so clear (no sand like Cozumel, Tulum or, yes, Cancun, beaches that I visited on this trip) makes the warm water crystal clear, you can easily see where you are walking as it is mostly level and NO spiney sea urchins. I went to the beach and in the water every day-no problem-but it was lake-like calm and I had water shoes. I could see how swimming here could be a problem in the winter or anytime the water is rough. Snorkeling here not good; remember rocks are not living reefs. Quite frankly, I do not see why some people hate this place-me and my family are very picky and we all loved it but can see why young kids would love it the most. It was hot and sunny our whole stay except, contrary to the earlier review, 3 hours on the friday, when it did rain lightly-that evening was cool and clear. Yes, the DEL Lago restauraunt, while shaded and despite the fans, gets hot (they built it so the sea breezes are blocked)-the Mexican Food was good (the show so-so)-plenty of fruits and great deserts and the buffet breakfast had everything and more-just don't go to late when it gets real hot-and it does-despite the shade. The buildings and the rooms have a new look and feel and the maid service is great. They have a small supermarket that sells all the essentials at high prices ($ 8.00 us bag of keebler cookies) so I suggest a one day trip to Playa. Take a cab in the morning, or if very hot, late afternoon and go to the beach-have the driver drop you off by the PIER-NOT the cozumel ferry Pier-but the unused pier north of this closer to hotel-the beach on the north (left ) side of this pier is much nicer-more space. The water is great-full of locals and hotel guests. After a swim, go up the sreet one block, walk the pedestrian mall on 5th ave south towards the Coz ferry pier if not too hot-stop at Acha Los Tacos (up from beach/unused pier) for a tasty and inexpensive lunch (Karen's is OK-great variety-but the food is so-so). Either walk back north on the beach if sellers got on your nerves or back up fifth ave. If I am not mistaken, west on same block you got dropped off at is the MEGNA/TARGET and next to that is the Wal-Mart. Walk the 5-10 min. Stock up and take a cab back. Unless you take the Coz ferry-you have no other reason (in my opinion) to return to Playa-unless you want to eat and drink away from hotel If going to Cozumel-go early-take a snorkeling trip-they meet at Coz pier-later, rent a jeep (scooters are cheaper but also much slower) see the windward side of the island-do stop at Coconuts on the cliff-great lunch/location or drive around to the lee side and go to a beach club (San Francisco's was nice-free to put blanket on beach/$ for chair rent). If staying late-shop in town after cruise ships leave and go to Pancho's backyard for supper-it was great. In same building is best shop for suveniers-Los Cincos Soles. Clean and friendly-as the restauraunt. You should not buy round trip tickets when you leave Playa just so you can take any of the 2 ferries that leave-could save you waiting 2 hours If you can exchange into this place-jump at it!! Continue reading if you are considering renting a car: This is the best way to enjoy your stay at the Mayan Palace. Parking lot is in middle of property and you won't feel trapped-although this is an OK place to be for a week. Yes, the LDW insurance is expensive, but get/charge the car on a credit card that covers this. I too bought from Avis 8 months prior to my trip and got a car with the other insurance (ldw was covered by my card) for about $40.00 a day. One tank of gas took us from airport, to Tulum (see seperate reviews by tripadvisors-excellent advice) which was great, to Playa, to Cancun where we stayed 2 nights and to the airport. If you go to COZ, there is a carpark behind the bus station 1 block from pier-24 hrs for $ 10 us dollars. I would never run my family and kids across a busy highway just to save a few bucks. Yes, it cost money-but savings by going to and from airport, Tulum (free on sundays and holidays), Cancun, etc made it worth every cent-especially when you add in the convenience. The roads are fine and well marked and you can not get lost, at least not for very long. There are plenty of turarounds/Returnos. The highway you will travel is ugly-think I-95 in Florida and you can not see the beach from this road at any point. Just keep to the speed limit and STAY IN THE SLOW/RIGHT lane and you will be fine and, lastly, make sure gas pump is set to zero before you unlock your gas cap.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "CHUDS57", "ReviewID": "UR5514292", "Content": "Yes its true for all the complaints about the salespeople 'cons' as everyone calls them...just don't do the upgrades and you'll be fine. Just remember this...when you buy at the Grand Mayan and then want to book a room to stay at the Grand Mayan and you can't it's because they are holding them for people to do the timeshare and then get a upgrade...it will be your room they have upgraded too...while you paid the $$$$ and end up in the original part of the Mayan Palace. On our last trip we ran into a few couples who on their last trip there had bought into the Grand Mayan....and guess where they were staying? They were told up to a year in advance that they did not have any Grand Mayan rooms 'available' - yeh right! We were simply on an exchange from our home resort and we were staying in the Grand Mayan as we had signed up for the timeshare con game when we got there (the same week as the other couples...what does that tell you?)....So, embarrassIngly enough for us and we could understand the frustration of the other couples as we were most likely in a room they should have gotten since they owned at the Grand Mayan. However, we did get what they said we would though - 15% off of our total bill and the upgrade. However, I like the ambiance of the rooms and the colors better in the original Mayan Palace so no upgrades for us next time. But even with all of the timeshare hooplah, this is one beautiful resort....the pool is magnificent...nothing like it - even the one in Puerto Neuvo does not match it! With all the people laying out by the pool you can still have a measure of privacy, and you can usually get a cabana if not at first eventually during the day sometime which is fine....I am not in a hurry I'm on vacation. We've been to this resort 2xs now and I am booking our 3rd trip for 2008. It is beautiful at night all around the resort - it is very impressive - they light up all of the pool area and the trees. One year we ate in the restuarant on the beach (can't remember the name but it was a really nice - romantic if you wanted it to be)and it started raining a bit - which wasn't a big deal - but even if it was the cutest little baby turtles were scurring around for dry ground and scooted into the restuarant - things like that make a vacation memorable. There was another restuarant next to it that is painted in all the carribean bright colors - the food was licious - and lots of it. And they have a live band some nights as well. The breakfast buffet has got to be one of the best we've ever seen anywhere including at home for brunch! Room service is wonderful too. Our favorite restuarant is the Tramonto - for a very special evening. Live soft music and good food! If you are extremely cordial with your help you will receive a turn about....we always get great service from the bellboys to the waitress in the restuarants and by the pool....if you are friendly it will go a long way....we've met some great people and they stirred us in the right direction for outside restuarants and beachs. By the way we're not beach 'beach lovers' so if you are this is probably not the resort for you...too many rocks as the government only allows moveage of so many on each resort and it will be awhile before the beach will be what allot of people would really enjoy...we stay away from the sand...so if you don't mind that you'll be okay. If your a penny pincher or on a micro budget this is not the place for you and your family - just being blunt, unless you have a room with a kitchen to cook all your meals which is okay too, you can go into Walmart in town to pick up groceries of course the cab will cost you for that too. The mosquitoes are there for real...so bring lots of protection. This is a beautiful resort. Look for the best and you will find it - don't let the salespeople sour you of a good time - they are there to make a living too like the rest of us...just pass them by or better yet if your a JW (you know who you are) you'll be left alone like we were.

Here goes: If you can change your reservations do it now. There are too many really good resorts to experience. We vacation in the Yucatan every year, sometimes twice a year. Our visit at this resort was unlike what we usally experience. It started with check in. It was very chaotic and unpleasant. There was wall to wall people everywhere. Check in wasn't until 5 :00. No problem if they would have offered us a hospitality room and arranged for our bags to be delivered to our room. The size of the resort is absolutely too big. We ended up carrying our luggage and dive gear for an 8 to 10 minute walk to our room with no help from the resort. I know they offer that service, but it was not offered to us and because of all of the chaos we didn't ask. I suppose that was our mistake, although one really shouldn't have to ask. We lost the first day to many frustrations. I don't know about you, but I treasure each day that I have on vacation and I didn't appreciate blowing the first day when it wasn't neccessary. I must say that the rooms our beautiful. Housekeeping was outstanding. There are shuttles, but they often were either full when we tried to ride, or the time the driver was suppose to be at that paticular stop wasn't correct. The resort is beautifully lanscaped and very manicured. Great effort goes into keeping the grounds. The walk from where we stayed was about 8 minutes to the pool and car. Both, of course in opposite directions. The walk does give you an opportunity to enjoy the grounds. We rented a car and each time I walked to get it or walked from the parking lot to our room I found myself shaking my head, not believing the enormous size of this complex. When we reached the pool area, which was about 7 each morning I found food and drink left over from the night before as well as trash. I think it got cleaned up sometime around lunch time. Tables were dirty and I just couldnt' believe it. The service in the restaurants were o.k., but for some reason you had to wait anywhere from 5-10 minutes for your coffee. The waiters were not busy at the time, but we figured they must be told to wait for some reason or another. The service was very poor at the pool bar. I don't like it when someone acts as if they are doing me a service by waiting on me. In all my trips to Mexico I have never felt this way. I have always found anyone I dealt with very nice and working hard to accomodate. I could understand if they were overrun with customers, but that wasn't the case. We have great respect for the citizens of Mexico and truly appreciate how hard they work. We just don't understand why this resort is so different from the others we have stayed at. We made the best of it and managed to enjoy our trip, but there are much better resorts out there. Convenience is important to me especially on vacation. I have to rate this resort the most inconvenient place I have ever stayed at. Out of ten, I have to rate this resort at a four.

A friend is an owner. The Hotel is a resort. If you enjoy sitting by the pool, getting drunk, getting up at 6AM in hopes of reserving a cabana with a bed, eating your meals in a NO air condition enviroment, and using the spa, this is the place for you! The lobby has no air conditioning, all areas to eat are either outside or have no air.(Tramentos may have air, didn't go there since you have to make reservations and there is a dress code.) However there IS air for the Time Share Shark's sales room, and air in the bathrooms. All other public areas you are left to boil. Check out is at 10AM. It really sucks because if your flight is at 3PM like ours was today , you melt while waiting in the lobby! Absolutely miserable! We were able to get our scheduled shuttle moved up to 12PM instead of 1PM, tipped the bellboy for helping us out. I also found out the bellboys are paid $4.50 PER DAY, not hour. Amazing the amount of money the Mayan Palace makes, to only pay those guys so little! So please tip bellboys and the maids. Everyone works very hard at this resort. I experienced very good service from the waitstaff, and bellboys. The restaurant wait time and room service is slow, but I found the food was good. The desserts were especially good, tres leches cake and chocolate cake were awesome. Maid service was wonderful. I tipped our maid $10.00 and gave her a different bath and body works spray everyday. She appreciated the gifts and accommodated our schedule. She let us sleep in and cleaned our room later in the day. The room was very nice and you control the air conditioner, Our room was our heaven! We had a standard room, no kitchen. I requested a refrigerator and received one promptly. We are beach lovers and the hotel's beach area is AWFUL!!! I was warned but I didn't think it would be that bad, Well it was even worse than I thought possible! The first evening after we checked in, we decided to make the best out of a bad beach situation and look for seashells. My husband called out to me to get out of the water, because a CROCODILE was in the ocean 3 feet away from me!!! NO JOKE!!! scary, didn't really feel the need to get in the ocean after that!!! No one believed us, but I have pictures and other guests saw him as well. The pool area is big and family friendly. Happy hour is 11AM -1PM. The pool however is not very clean, black mold was inbetween the tiles. A Mayan Palace pool cleaner was scrubing the tiles with a snorkel mask on, as I was swimming in the pool. Kinda gross all of the mold just floating around... By Sunday afternoon I was bored and bitchy because there was no beach for me to frolic on! I 'm spoiled and are used to beaches in Cancun, No Rocks or CROCODILES. My poor husband and I felt like prisoners. The collectos are fine but who has the patience to wait around to see if maybe one comes by? My husband has no patience. We ended up spending $90.00 a day on a car rental. It was costly due to we wanted full coverage insurance. On Friday it rained pretty bad, we saw 3 roll over accidents. Atleast one was a rental. We feel it was worth every penny. We were able to get away and travel to other parts of the Yucatan. We went to Tulum, Cozumel, Playa del Carmen and Cancun. We were lucky enough in Tulum to happen upon a fishmen's beach , who allowed us to use the beach at no charge. We had the entire beach all to ourselves! Smooth sand, blue clear water, NO rocks or CROCODILES! Cancun is sad. The hotels that are up and running, the beaches look awesome! Personally very sad to see the Sheraton gone, and the Grand Aqua still closed, old stomping grounds, good times... Cancun is still under heavy construction, and will be for awhile. Still has the most beautiful beach around. Mamitas in Playa del Carmen is a very close 2nd. Parking at the resort is a joke, you can not get a space near the lobby unless you get back before 9PM. The other parking area is a great distance away and you have to take a shuttle. We were in building #8 right by the lobby, a short walk to the pool, but in the heat of July it is a very uncomfortable walk. I found a way to make it more bearable. I went down to the first level of my building and just walked thru all the buildings until I got to building #2, Then I exited and went outside. Time share sharks are moving in for the kill at time of check in. We encountered a very pushy female, offered us a key to the Grand Mayan $100.00 and a discount. My husband shut down her down with, \"We are not going to buy, we are not interested\" We still received a call from her the following day, I assume she couldn't get thru the previous day since we took the phone off the hook. (Ha Ha) Told her a firm NO again and wasn't bothered the rest of our trip. Through out our vacation we would see the Sharks walking around in the heat, with poor unsuspecting tourists. Very animated, feeding them their line of BS, should of warned them about the Mayan Crocodile!!! This resort would be awesome if they fixed the beach, and put the crocodile back in the lagoon. The excuse for the awful beach is hurricane Wilma, Yeah right... The water isn't blue like Cancun and I don't think even with a ton of sand covering the rocks would make a difference. I walked 10 minutes north and south, same crappy beach, who wants to walk in the heat ten minutes anyway! The Iberostar is more than a 10 minute walk away. The beach there is alot better.

We turned down the timeshare deal after check in and that was that. Not a big deal like some say. They run on a credit only system, We checked our bill at the end of every other day, it's easy to lose track of what you spend there. The breakfast buffet is a must! Make sure to have mosquito replellent and try not to forget to close the sliding doors at night or they will eat you alive. All of our cell phones worked and they came in handy since our whole group was six people. We have received the bill and no it was not that expensive.

They are actually the cleanest pools I've ever seen at a resort in Mexico. The swim up bars are nice. Make sure to get a list of the bars happy hours.

That's what I intend on doing in the future. When I get to the resort I would take them up on their presentation if they offer to upgrade me to the grand mayan + breakfast + any other discounts they usually offer.

So, just you know, I ENJOYED EVERY BIT OF IT! Checking in: $300 USD or a Credit Card is required. Tip: Ask for a room that is in building 1 to 7. Everything else is a far walk. Checking out: If you deposit $300 and if there\u2019s still credit left. They\u2019ll give it back to you in pesos. (Exchange is $1 to @ $10.50) Tip: If you want to exchange your money, go to Playa Del Carmen. @ $ 10.80 Room: The room is beautiful and very spacious. (No more details, judge for yourself!) Room Service: Breakfast ranges from $7 USD (ie. Omelet with sausage meal) to $13. Lunches ranges from $10 (Hamburger and Fries) to $18 Dinner ranges from $12 (Pasta) to $20 (Mexican tacos, Enchaladas\u2026) Tip: The portions are big and most of the time, we\u2019d share most of the food. Buy your juice, water and liquor at the on-site grocery store. It\u2019ll save you a lot of money and waiting time for your food to arrive. Waiting time for food is @ 30 \u2013 40 mins. Getting around: $208 a week, unlimited milage @ AVIS. Tip: RENT A CAR! It\u2019ll be worth it. You can go as you please. Remember, this is not an all inclusive resort, so you may want to go somewhere else and explore. DO NOT RENT IT FROM THE RESORT (very $$$) Pre-book one at the Cancun Airport. This is hotel is perfect because it\u2019s not far too far from Playa del Carmen. North is Cancun and south is Playa Del Carmen, Tulum and Xelha. Cab ride is @ $20 to Playa del Carmen Buses @ $1 Tip: Also see if your credit card covers your car insurance. Places / Attractions / Excursions: Playa Del Carmen (20 min south): It\u2019s a great place to eat. You\u2019ll find everything there. From American, International, Sea food, Mexican cuisine. You can buy souvenirs, alcohol and book excursions too. They\u2019re all along 5th Ave.. The major streets from where it starts are Jaurez Ave and Contituyentes Ave and walk along 5th Ave. There\u2019s a store like WALMART on Contituyentes. Cozumel (Island across Playa Del Carmen) Ferry fare is $20 round trip. 30 mins \u2013 40 mins boat ride. The dock is just the end of 5th Ave. by Senor Frogs (a club / restaurant) Tip: You\u2019ll feel nausea on the boat because of the rocking. I suggest sleeping right away or you might have to puke in a bag. The ferry comes at almost every hour. Last ferry from Cozumel is @ 10 pm or 11 pm. The beaches are amazing in Cozumel. You can rent a scooter for $25 ($10 more for insurance) I totally recommend it for getting around. *Great for experienced drivers* We only shared 1 bike, and it was fine. Snorkeling: So many great snorkeling excursions. Book one in Playa del Carmen or Cozumel. Tip: DO NOT BOOK EXCURSIONS FROM THE HOTEL. (over $$$. $30 vs $55 for the same thing.) Xel-ha (1 hour south) This place is for everyone. Couples and families. If you have a car, drive there instead of paying $80 - $110 with a tour. The All-Inclusive deal is only $59! (Food, drink and rentals included) (--) Cancun (night-life) If you really want to see how they PARTY! YOU CAN\u2019T MISS COCO BONGO!!! $40 - $45 for all you can drink. Show and dancing!

I actually took clips from many of the postings to bring along as a travel aide. I am writing this post while on our trip, as everything is fresh in my mind, but will probably finish after returning home. We are a family of four. My wife and I are in our early 40\u2019s, while our two sons are 14 and 11. We are all pretty well traveled, having visited many of the Caribbean islands over the years. This trip to Mexico is our first as a family, but my third. Upon arrival to Cancun I did not know what to expect, as my visions of Mexico were from previous visits to non tourist areas. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Our entry was quick, easy and in a clean modern airport facility. Having all our documentation in order made everything a breeze. It wasn\u2019t until we walked out the customs door with luggage in hand, looking like tourists, that our first taste began. Right outside the customs door are counters with what appear to be information personnel. They have the same outfits with ID\u2019s hanging around their necks. They have information alright...they are actually reps for the resorts, and are luring you into one of their slick sells. I have to admit, they are masters, and suckered us in quickly! After we realized, we walked away. All we were looking for was the contact to catch the shuttle to the Grand Mayan. We found the Grand Mayan person right outside the building, immediately to the right. I don\u2019t know if this spot is where he stands everyday. We did not see him right away, as there are dozens upon dozens of ride operators, all acting like vultures trying to get your fair. Be very careful here, these drivers will swarm you like bees and not stop. My wife felt a bit threatened here. If you are traveling in a group, I would suggest the group staying in one spot as one of you find the Mayan Palace rep. It will lessen the chaos here. Once the rep was found all was well. I had contacted the concierge via e-mail about three days prior to our arrival, forwarding name and arrival information. The hotel e-mailed back the same day with a confirmation. It was easy!!! Check in to the resort was quick. After reading all the wonderful information on this list, we new what to expect. We checked in at 2 PM, and were told our room would not be ready until 5 PM. We had our bathing suits in our carry on, and were ready to get changed. That is when the \u201cfun\u201d began!!!! We had the first sales rep approach us...smoothe, slick and low pressure. My wife and I had already decided to listen to the 90 minute presentation prior to arriving, so we used that as our bargaining tool. Since we were checked in to the Mayan Palace, waiting for three hours to get to the room, we played naive. The sales person said if we took the presentation we would get an upgrade to the Grand Mayan, 15% off tab, $100 credit and could get to a room right away. Our plan worked!!!!! Now, this was on a Friday. I don\u2019t know what happens if there are no rooms left at the Grand Mayan! The rooms at the Grand Mayan are absolutely magnificent! We have a two bedroom with a full kitchen. I measured our two room unit...a whopping 1482 sq. ft!!!. Everything is in pristine condition, and extremely clean. As someone stated in a previous post, the maid service comes two times a day. I might mention, that on our tour of the facility during the sales pitch, the two bedroom units in the Mayan Palace section were not bad either. You could tell they were a bit older and smaller, but still clean and roomy. My wife and I found a plus to the Mayan Palace, in that the second bedroom had two full size beds. The Grand Mayan bedrooms have king beds, as the two bedrooms are also \u201clock out units.\u201d The kitchens in the Mayan Palace are not full either, which really is not a big deal. All the floors are marble...rooms, hallways...evrything. Outside the rooms are very echoey, but we rarely had a problem hearing outside noise. The hurricanes have taken their toll. It is virtually impossible to enjoy the ocean in front of the hotel. The water is VERY rocky(coral). I did not see any attempt by the staff in improving the situation. In my opinion, It is beyond repair. It is a shame. Only a couple of times did I see people in the water. I honestly did not expect it to be that bad. The beach area is nice, but most people utilize the pool. The pool is clean, beautiful and very large. Both beach and pool areas are well staffed for recreation and bar/foods service.. Happy hour (2 for 1 at the swim up bars) is from 11-1 daily. The age ranges of guests at the resort is quite diverse, as well as countries of origin. There are newlyweds, families with infants all the way to retired couples. There are activities for all, both on and off the resort. There is a travel agent in the main building, who can book a variety of tours. There are daily happenings for small children and adults. I really did not see much for young teens, but our kids do not seem board. They partook in a soccer game by the pool, and also took advantage of the free scuba ding demo in the pool. They got the gear on and swam around. My wife and I have been doing the water aerobics class everyday at noon. Also stated in other posts is the size of this complex. It is VERY big. And yes, be prepared to walk...everywhere. We do not find it a burden. But if I was staying in a building beyond #5 in the Mayan Palace, I might think differently. A couple days before we had left the states, I called the reservation desk to request a room in building 1-5 of the Mayan Palace. They put the request in the system. Would it have worked? I do not know. There are shuttles to take you everywhere in the resort. I have not found a problem in too long a wait time.....5 minutes at most. After much research,we decided not to rent a car. The cost to get around here is quite low, and the rides are readily available and safe. We have been here two days now, and have taken the Colectivo and taxis a few times to Playa del Carmen. We are still ahead $$, as opposed to renting. Also, the parking lot here at the resort is not too accessible if you are in one of the outer buildings. The buildings DO NOT have their own lots. We may end up renting one for a day or two, we\u2019ll see. Also, I did not see any public parking in the the shopping area of Playa. For transportation, we take the shuttle from the main building to the front gate. From there, we cross the highway and wait for the \u201cPlaya Express.\u201d The cost is $1 per person. They drop you off at their \u201cterminal,\u201d which is two short blocks from 5th Ave....the main shopping/restaurant strip. I say terminal, but it is a small lot with a hut, card table and a bench. Again, It is safe here! From here, you can take a taxi(they are all over the place) to Wal-Mart to go grocery shopping. The taxi fair is $3...for the hire, not per person. On one occasion, we were lazy and took the taxi form 5th Ave to Wal-Mart. We asked the driver to wait, so he could take us back to the resort. That cost was the $3 + $18. Restaurants..... We are not ones to eat every meal in a resort. We usually eat breakfast, sometimes lunch too, in the room. For dinner we like to eat local fair. Play has some great restaurants. We have found some great and some barely palatable. For the great... Los Rancheros and La Parilla. Both are serve Mexican food, not the Americanized versions. The atmospheres are wonderful, extensive menus and priced reasonably. The quality and abundance of food was great. The wait staff was very friendly, and I did not feel like my digestive system would be in disrepair the next day. Yaxche was another great one. A bit more upscale, but still good. They food here was more Mayan in style. Senior Frogs was good. It is a great place to have fun. A big bar by the water, with crazy wait staff. The food was good, but less of that Mexican flair. It was sort of like a Friday\u2019s, or Carlos & Charlies style. Karen\u2019s, a restaurant that someone on this found to be fantastic, gave my son a case of food poisoning. No one else in our family got sick. During the week whenever we walked by, it was always packed. The food was nothing special. Another night we ate at Pancho Villa. I would stay clear. It was filthy, and I am still fighting Montezuma! The only two restaurants at the resort we ate at were Balche( a grill by the pool) and Del Lago. We had lunch by the pool daily. The food was very good. The prices are on the higher end...but better than what I expected in a resort. Del Lago serves a breakfast buffet daily. It is $15 per person. I am not sure if children under 11 are half price. The restaurant is huge, as is the buffet. They serve everything from omelets to great Mexican foods. We had one breakfast there. Del LAgo\u2019s dinners have a different theme every night. It has a stage area and entertainment. You MUST go to the Mexican Fiesta on Thursdays. It\u2019s pricey, but well worth it. Again, an extensive Mexican buffet. Dinner and entertainment begins at 6 and it goes until 10:30. There is an open bar during that time. It was wonderful time for all! The cost is $50/adult, $25.00/under 11. OK, the timeshare sales pitch. If you are a weak person who cannot say \u201cno,\u201d DON\u2019T ATTEND!!! The pressure starts off pretty low, then it builds. We told them we agreed to the 90 minutes. They promised it would not exceed. I\u2019ll be honest, their offerings of properties is very impressive, and as a timeshare owner in Aruba, I was very interested in their product. But I am not about to spend $15,000.00 based on a two hour sales pitch. And after their verbal abuse, I can almost guarantee I will not buy there. Now, if you are going with the intention of buying, YOU will have them right where you want them. NEGOTIATE...you will get much more than what is initially offerred...extra weeks, no maintenance fees, etc. All in all, this is a wonderful resort. It is large, safe, well maintained, and has much to offer guests of all ages.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbus ohio", "Title": "\u201chad a nice time\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5419815", "Content": "my wife and I just returned from the mayan palace and had a nice time.

We were a little apprehesive about going to playa del carmen. It just seemed a little much to have to go to the road and deal with a bus ride down there. The only real problems we had with others were with americans. The airport upon arrival can be a little overwhelming. There is a ton of confusion and people running everywhere.

It was the pushy americans who would walk up and think they should be able to push thee way on in front of others that made it more stressful. REMEMBER: You are on vacation. Now the positive. We wee in building 6 and were a comfartable distance from the pool. We also took our sons walkie talkies so that we could comunicate with one another. That worked out well. We were a couple hunded yards from both the pool and lobby area. Not a big deal. The pool was very nice. Lots of chairs and shade as well. Very clean and spacious. The pool side restaurant was very good. We had lunch there daily. They also switch to a nicer menu in the evenings and both times we ate there our meals wee great and reasonably priced. We also went to the \"nice restaurant\" called the tramonto. It was also very nice and priced well. We went into playa del carmen twice and ate at a place called Karens. It waw so good the first time we went back just to eat there again. We also took a bar leaping tour in cancun. I would recomment it if you have never been into cancun. the couple we were with had never seen cancun and it was fun to get the excitement and night life of the area. The leaping tour takes you to 3 different clubs with an open bar and a host to make sure you are accomodated. We also did the xel ha tulum tour. It was a 1/2 day at each location and was a lot of fun. If you go to Xel Ha be sure to walk around to the opposite side and do the \"Cliff of Courage\" Over all it was a great trip. the resort exceeded our expectations and was very clean and freindly.

First of all, you can walk to any place on the resort and it will take you no longer than 10 minutes tops. The shuttle takes maybe 10 minutes on some occassions but that was rare. The pool as you have read is indeed incredible. The best looking pool you may probably visit anywhere. Playa de Carmen is great but Cancun is a lot more developed.

The lobby is right there in case you have questions about anything. Our room was cleaned twice daily. The daytime chambermaid even left a chocolate sculpture for our daughter one day in return for a treat she had left! The restaurants are wonderful at the motel.

The italian restaurant was a treat, as everthing they brought to us was an unexpected delight and the prices were very reasonable! The beach area was being improved and we enjoyed beachcombing there. The location of the Mayan Palace worked good for us because it was right in the middle of the peninsula. The travel agency in the lobby bldg. and the people at the concierge desk were very helpful when we were planning our daytrips. We went to Cancun and Isla Mujures to the North, and Xel-Ha, Playa Del Carmen, Tulum and Xcaret to the south. Anything you rent in the area requires a photo i.d., (golf carts at Isla Mujures, snorkeling gear, etc.) so be sure you have one with you. Extra money is also a good idea. Definitely do the all-inclusive at Xel-Ha as everything there costs extra and the plus package for Xcaret is the best value also.

We loved it so much, we sold our timeshare in the Bahamas and bought into the Mayan Palace Resorts. We brought our relatives this past Feb(2006) and everyone loved it. I had to convince them to leave the resort to explore the ruins and Playa del Carmen. Since we only bought the resort 2-bedroom - NOT the Grand Mayan, I called the month before we arrived to request an upgrade (at no cost) to the Grand Mayan (larger units and huge balconiesw/plunge poole). We had NO problem getting our request. Compared to the Mayan Palaces in Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta, this Mayan Palace is not as lush and gorgeous, but it is CLEAN, and gorgeous pools and beach. Be sure to rent a car. Playa del Carmen is a charming, romantic village - and a blast after 9pm!! The Mayan ruins are wonderful - and free on Sundays and holidays! The eco parks are truly amazing and worth the $. Enjoy the resort - typically expensive as resorts go, but you do have a small kitchen, so you can save some money there. The beach is beautiful - at high tide, you can just swim over the rocks about 15 ft and then it is sandy bottom. At low tide, you can pick your way over the rocks. They have also roped off an area that is mostly sandy bottom from the shore. However, we and the kids LOVE to explore the tidal pools along the beach - and there are a few that are big enough to use a your own private beach pool! The timeshare people ARE terrible, however, you just have to not go, or go and BE FIRM!! Our timeshare rep also wanted us to leave the tip for the \"free\" breakfast, but we just said we did not bring any money with us. Of course, since we already knew we wanted to buy, we just kept saying \"NO\" until they came down to a reasonable price! We have not regretted it at all. We have been to the one in Puerto Vallarta (amazing) and Acapulco(also amazing), but we truly love the Riveria Maya Mayan Palace because of the water, beach and the whole area!! Also, at the the riveria maya mayan palace, there are no vendors on the beaches - AND you can walk for miles before seeing any other resorts - although it looks like a new resort is going up about 1/4 mile down the beach. - Otherwise, it is very secluded!!", "Date": "June 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, SC", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely the Best vacation ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5372145", "Content": "We went to the Mayan Palace in late May/early June 2006.

The grounds are massive - about a half mile from beach to road, about 500 yards across. The Palace blocks are stretched out from beach towards the road, with reception about mid-way back. This means that if you are in a high numbered block (there are 20 of them) it could be as far as 600 yards to the beach, the pool and all the other facilities (which are all close to the beach). Each block is three storeys high and contains 12 villas. They are linked by a covered walkway at ground level or you use the electric trolleybus to get back if the walk sounds too far. We thought the evening entertainment at Del Lago restaurant was excellent. Different theme each night, all free except one night. No problems getting a dinner table but we think booking would be essential in the main season. We thought the food was good value in Del Lago, limited in choice at the poolside restaurant, and expensive in the Italian restaurant. The site is shared with The Grand Mayan (currently being developed), The building work in progress around Grand Mayan didn't impact us. All the non-villa facilities are shared between the two resorts. Unless you are happy staying on the resort, transport is essential. Loads of taxis into Playa at $20 or flag down the Mayan buses on the main road ($1 each person, every 10 minutes, no kidding, but pesos required!). We rented a car from Alamo in Playa - no problems and much cheaper than having the resort book it. The resort organises a full programme of daytime activities for little ones and also big ones (beach volleyball, water polo, aerobics, cocktail teach-in - that sort of thing). This was excellent. The resort seems to be currently upgrading people into the Grand Mayan if you are willing to submit yourself to the inevitable sales tour. Our one criticism would be the style of the buildings. In effort to look pre-hispanic 'Mayan', the boutique/shops complex looks like a Sears block from a shopping mall and the villa blocks resembled a modern high-tech office Science Park. The grounds, pool and communal areas are spotlessly clean and there's a constant army of workers around all day and evening keeping it that way.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cNot so bad-Will go again one day\u201d", "Author": "beloved30", "ReviewID": "UR5354019", "Content": "I stayed at the mayan palace from May 19th-May 26th.

All the good reviews were very accurate. We have no complaints whatsoever. We were in Building #1 which is next to the pool. I have a muscular disease but am able to walk, I was worried that we would have to walk a mile or so according to some of the reviews. Not so, it takes 5 to 10 minutes to walk from the Lobby to the pool at the most and that is not walkilng fast. As previously stated, the walk will do you good if you are able. We made that walk several times and truely enjoyed it because we had fun seeing the many lizards, pretty birds and the beauty of the many different types of flowers and borders along the walkway, plus greeting many nice people along the way. The staff is so very helpful, pleasant and do a great job. The construction is not bothersome, the pool is unbelievably huge as well as very clean and perfect temperature. The shuttles are available regularly and the drivers are very helpful, many do not speak English much but enough for all concerned. We did not leave the resort often. We ate at all the restraunts and found the food was plentiful and good. We had toast and cereal in our room for breakfast, ate lunch almost daily at Blache' Snack restraunt. I truely enjoyed the fresh fruit served in a half pineapple and always had it, my husband had a hamburger frequently. The resort does NOT have purified water but bottled which we had with our meals. We generally ate dinner at del Lago restraunt which is casual and has buffets for their meals. The entertainment is excellant and nightly and except for Mexican Night, free. The buffets were very good and a nice variety. One night we ate at Tromatos which is more upscale, dressy , (not real dressy but not real casual ); and the food was excellant. We both had the special which was prime rib and the most tender prime beef we ever had. The price was not bad because it inclluded all courses and was around $20 usd. All the restraunts were favorably priced and comparable to restraunts here in U. S, The rooms were more spacious than we expected with a kitchenette, dining area, living room with love seat and couch (not to comfortable) huge marble top coffee table and two end tables plus TV in a console with safe.You are able to get English channels. The bedroom was very large with king size bed, two end tables , table and two chairs, dresser and large closet. The bath was very nice with separate stool, and an additional vanity in a seperate room with another large closet. Walls paper thin? The noise was very limited and we weren't bothered by whatever noise was made by inconsiderate people in the hallway. Our room had a lovely view of the pool and walkway and the boutique. My husband treated me to a massage at the Spa. Heaven! The price was not to bad. The boutique had two stores and the prices were a little high and the variety limited. I am not a shopper so we got all we needed there instead of going into Playa del Carmen. Time share problems? We were asked nicely at Mayan Palace if we had been and we told them that we went to another and that was all that was said there. Now for our warning! No! Not about Mayan Resort but the minute we got off the plane, we were asked where we were going and not knowing any different we told a man who approached us where we were going. He said \"Good, come here and I will help you.\" Thinking he was going to get us to the Mayan Resort, we foolishly went. Wrong! He soon said that if we went to a time share talk at Sunset Resort in Playa del Carmen for 90 min. that we could get a free tour to Tulum ruins and Xel Ha. The 90 min. turned into 4 hours and lots of pressure towards the last 2 hours. They did honor the two tours even when we turned them down and for that we truely appreciate. The tours were very good and we got in for free but had to pay for our meals and activities. However, on the bus to these places the guide talked us into paying $30 for an all inclusive ticket for both places. We got it and even tho we did not need it at Tulum, we did use it for a meal, drink and snorkling gear at Xel Ha and that was a good deal . So take heed of those guys that get you scammed into going to a time share that is LOTS longer than stated but does have a great deal for tours, at the airport. As previously stated, Mayan Palace Resort is beautiful, very hospitable, and a wonderful place to stay.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kawhia,New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cJust returned Home\u201d", "Author": "oysterfiend", "ReviewID": "UR5323367", "Content": "stayed 27 May - 3rd june Best resort we have stayed at out of 4 we stayed in on our trip to the Yucatan.

This was our biggest concern with The Yucatan is that in Many restaurants people can still smoke. Beach somewhat rocky but they are working on an area which with swimming footware was lovely to swim in. Loved Mayan Palace much more than our week in Cancun. Would go Back To Player Del Carmen but never Cancun. Tulum and Beyond Trip with Playa Info Tours was absolutely Fabulous- We took a taxi into town to catch tour but even with $18 added expense it was excellent value. 2 other days we caught bus to town - no problem and only a dollar. shuttles to the main gate and pool from lobby - what are people complaining about? we walked to the pool each day and our room was near the lobby - quite a way away but not a major Laundry -wash and dry - large loads - only $8 for both We got our laundry done twice - first 2 loads $16 but 2 days later we just left it all there and the lady did it all - folded and packaged for only $3 more - 2 loads- washed and dried $19- dirt cheap and beautifully clean- they supply the powder too! We thought the resort was Top Notch and Much nicer than the other 3 resorts we stayed at. Security is a big issue and we felt absolutely catered for . Safe in our room was easy to use and very convenient.

To add to the confusion, all the reviews are accurate! It depends on your perspective, so I'll will start with mine to see if it interests you. It tends to be negative but don't let that deter you from having a good time. I will give you lots of information and (tips). Its just MY opinions here. I'm49, wife39, daughter2, and my mom21? :), May13-20 (not busy), RCI exchange, stayed in 2bdrm at the Golf and Grand, did presentation, rented car, family outings/snorkel, Tulum, Xel-ha, Xcaret, Yal-Ku Lagoon, La Buena Vida, groceries, no habla espanol, interested in unique experiences.. RIVIERA MAYA- We are from Florida so we were unimpressed with the area. It looked like ancient reef covered with mangrove and some trees. The cenotes and ocean were the best part (unique water). Its changing fast, more modern, crowds, new roads, resorts, stores (you will need an update) Things are not cheap anymore. There is lots of walking on hard surfaces (need good shoes). Some people are very aggressive in general and blunt about wanting money. This can be annoying. To quote a writer \"If you don't like Mexico don't go\" MAYAN PALACE- are 3 story buildings \"snaking\" away from pool to the golf course with a lobby in the middle. The Architecture/furnishings are plain but roomy. A 2bdrm= 1bdrm suite with a hotel lockoff. There is a walkway connecting the buildings down middle with a garden path on one side of buildings and cart path on other. Hallways are open to the outdoors without door jams or sweeps (bugs/noise). The A/C doesn't take the humidity out very well. The \"Pool\" side is closer, older, with few views, and noisier. The \"Golf\" side is still being built, farther away from things with better views and addressed some issues (softer beds/door sweeps) The Grand is horseshoe shaped with the Del Largo at the top and a lagoon in the middle. The architecture, grounds, views & rooms are \"GRANDER\" w/king beds, jacuzzi and soak pool. The car parking is way over here! The Layout is not good with unnecessary walking or cart rides. As a writer said \"its not just a hop to your room if you forget something\". The Pool was great like everyone said and we had no problems getting shady spots (not busy). The beach was sandy but the rock in the water was hard to walk on even with shoes. There is a huge man made reef just off shore (suggest high tide). We can eat better at home for these prices but the Balche wasn't bad. RCI- We got in on a promotion so we did the presentation. (It only REQUIRES 90min and they tell you this three times)(It is a \"right to use\" in Mexico, not a deed.) RENTING CAR- The no deductible insurance = the cost of the car! We were hit twice in parking lots, ran off the road by Funjet van, and hit bottom on speed bumps 6 times (take at a slight angle). You have to deal with cops (lots of them) and gas stations (both government). Suggestions for cops wanting a bribe (take ticket\"escribalo\", heard its cheaper, has his name \"numbre\", get to talk to his boss \"jeffe\", and make a big issue of it at the resort)(They take your license as coladeral and my my state ID looks like a license). Suggestions for gas stations (NEVER take your eyes off the pump)(gallon=3.75ltr) WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. Cars can take supplies (car seats) and can come-n-go anywhwere/anytime. TOUR buses and taxis are plentiful, cheaper than renting if not used liberally, and can go into resorts and parks. Buses & vans can't but are cheaper. (It can be a long way in heat) The roads were well marked (see PICS if you drive) XEL-HA (web site by same name)(best deal) all inclusive= orientation tour, alcohol, good food, gear, good variety of things. \"Pack your own\" or \"pay as you go\" good deal too. Huge fresh/saltwater lagoon, lots of fish, private nooks, and caves. (there was free fish food at the bridges, put it in a clear container to snorkel with)(tie on rafting sandals so you can get out wherever you want)(its fresh over salt water, turbulances mix the water and blur your vision) We were never hassled about sunscreen at any park. Yal-Ku Lagoon- Is a good \"off the beaten path\", fresh/saltwater, neighborhood, snorkel park thats not crowded with limited parking. Turtles are said to be there in morning (spring/summer) Not much shade with a refreshment hut and equipment rental. $7.50/each LA BUENA VIDA- is a locals \"sand\" bar on the way to Yal-Ku. On a beautiful bay (also boasts turtles) for a different type of snorkel. There are BAR SWINGS & CROWS NESTS (if you dare) happy hour 5-7 and food with nice seats on beach. Realy liked it (Again, thanks to the writer) TULUM- just because I heard about almost all my life. Nice cliff over beach XCARET- (has web site) the grounds and aquarium were nice but not worth $. (I suggest 1/2 day, snorkel UNDERGROUND RIVER to right, then if time float river to left or walk the grounds, then do the show at 7pm. You can get refreshments at the stadium. GROCERIES- MUCH cheaper in PDC. Resort has map and will show you familiar Walmart and new Sam's Club but would recommend CHEDRAUI (Walmart) or MEGA (Target) for something just a little different. Did not find refrigerated milk \"leche\" INFANT?- try Spring Tube by Swim Ways from YOUR local Walmart. Packs small, very stable, hard to crawl out of (especially with supplied lifejackets) and tie it toyou when snorkeling. Pet Leash by Goldbug also from Walmart if they are walking. about $12 CONCLUSION- For me it felt like a \"Tourist Trap\" and we had to watch what we ate, drank, cops, gas station attendants, other divers, always tipping, customs, ETC.. It was too much hassle and we will probably go to the Keys next time.

First, I think it's definitely worth it to arrange for transportation to and from the airport. It's $15 per person each way and it is charged to your room. If you email the concierge a few days before going, they arrange for it. The Cancun airport is pretty stressful, especially as you're walking out of it -- there are taxi drivers fighting for you. The actual resort has two \"parts\" from what I understood: The Mayan Palace and the Grand Mayan. I only see two differences -- the Grand Mayan is much closer to the pool (buildings 1-8) and it has hot tubs in the room. We were in Building 18 and really, it was quite a walk to the pool and beach - probably 15 minutes. We didn't mind the walk because it was good exercise but I can see how some people, especially those with disabilities or small children wouldn't like it. There is, however, a shuttle that takes you to and from the lobby every 15 minutes on the dot. We mostly ate in our room the entire time becuase the food was so expensive. We had 5 dinners in the room and breakfast every day in our room. The dinner we ate out was at Del Lago and the Balch\u00e9 poolside snackbar. Del Lago was pretty good but honestly, nothing spectacular. We didn't stay for the entertainment. The waiters and staff was very curteous, though. Oh, one thing: DON'T tip the waiters or waitresses. It is included in the bill. We tried to the first night but they explained that to us. Balch\u00e9 was okay food but kind of expensive for what it was. My favorite place at the resort was the Brio Health Center/Spa and Snack Bar. On our first day, we had a couples massage which was FABULOUS and I've had many many massages before. The prices were reasonable. It was one hour for about $140USD - two people. The room was actually quite and peaceful and it was great. After the massage, they let you go in their huge jacuzzi. I was in there by myself and they came to bring me fruit and iced tea. There is a steam shower and swiss shower and just plain old regular showers. There is also a sauna. You are able to use these facilities after a massage for as long as you want. To use these facilities without getting a massage is $30 for 3 hours. To use the gym, it's $10 per day or $40 for the week. The snack bar upstairs is FABULOUS. They serve fresh juices, smoothies, \"milkshakes\" (which are actually just yogurt/milk based smoothies as opposed to ice), sandwiches and muffins. The smoothies were awesome. This restaurant is upstairs with the gym and it is the only place that offers a nice view of the ocean. Some other little pieces of information you may find helpful: -The water and ice on the resort is purified so you don't have to worry about the ice cubes in your drink or the water in your drinks. The only place I wouldn't drink water from is the tap water in your room. Actually, most of the places we went to had purified water. -While tipping at restaurants is unnecessary, tips are NOT included if you go to the spa. The shuttle drivers also seem to expect tips which presented a problem at times since it is a cash-free resort, which I'll talk about in a bit. -There are shuttles from the further buildings to the lobby, from the lobby to the pool, the lobby to the front gate, the lobby to Del Lago and to the airport. -In the hotel lobby, you can change your money to pesos (but not back into USD). There is an ATM, a travel agency through which you can plan trips and excursions, a car rental place and the concierge. -There is a convenience store on-site but everything is extremely overpriced. We bought eggs and cheese and milk and bread for breakfast and some pasta for dinners. -There are two bars IN the pool that you can swim up to. Happy Hour is from 11-1 and drinks are very reasonably priced. There is also a waiter that will walk by to take your order. -The pool is AMAZING. There are some reviews that mention that it's extremely difficult to get a chair under the papalas but it really wasn't that hard. There are some chairs and some beds... the beds are impossible to get. But even if you don't get a chair in the shade, there are plenty all around the pool and the beach has chairs lined up on it too, so you don't need to lay on a towel or anything. -Speaking of towels, you can get them at the pool and as long as you return them by 9pm, there is no charge. The pool is open 24 hours by the way. -If you choose to do laundry, it is $8 per load. I didn't do it, of course. I only know because I asked. -There is a bus that passes by on the highway outside of the front gate. It goes to Playa del Carmen and Cancun. Since we didn't rent a car, we could do this or take taxis. The bus to Playa del Carmen is about $1 per person. It comes by every 15 minutes or so. Nothing in Mexico seemed \"fixed\" though - prices or times in particular. The bus to Cancun was about $2. We went both places. Playa del Carmen we enjoyed more than Cancun but we didn't really like either place. In PdC, you couldn't walk more than a foot without someone hassling you to buy their stuff or asking if you want to get high. I really couldn't enjoy myself with that constantly. Cancun... hmm. The bus dropped us off in front of a McDonalds and we really had no idea where to go and no one spoke English and we don't speak Spanish, so ... we just got the bus and went back after eating at McDonalds, haha. -At the resort, there is constant work and construction going on which at times, got annoying but it's understandable. Also, from 5-8pm there is fumigation to get rid of bugs and mosquitoes. It smells awful but it is supposedly harmless to your health. -The beds, at least in our building, were extremely uncomfortable. There were blankets in the closet and we piled them up on top of the mattress. -Oh, and if you have food allergies, be careful because they are not understanding of it at all.... I even wrote everything I was allergic to down in Spanish just to be safe and I'd ask if something had walnuts for example, in it... they'd say no, give it to me and what do you know? Walnuts. Luckily, I am careful because I worry about it all the time but just keep that in mind. -We went to Xcaret for a day. It costs $59 but if you book it through the resort and take their transporation, it costs $85. It is a pain in the butt to get there... you have to take a bus to Playa del Carmen and then transfer to a Tulum bus... and it's so not worth it in my opinion. I did write a review on Xcaret specifically though so I won't go into it too much here. Overall, the resort was nice but I wish it were closer to places so that you didn't have a huge hassle when trying to leave and see places. That's all I can think of at the moment. Have a good time and be careful.. Oh--the resort publishes a list of taxi fares right outside the front lobby.

Let me first say that I had wonderful time. Don\u2019t worry about any negative reviews because the good so outway the bad. I lived on this site 6 months prior to going so I had some information under my belt before I got there. It is definitely a good idea to arrange transportation pick-up from the Airport through the Mayan. All you have to do is email the Mayan your flight info and time and they will confirm by email that they will be waiting for you and the amout ($14) is just charged to your room. The airport is CRAZY, so this is a real stress reducer. We did get stopped before exiting the airport for a timeshare offer and we had decided in advance that we were going to do it for the comps. We went to the Westin, Regina presentation and it was very nice, professional and actually got a wonderful meal for 90 minutes of our time. We also got our two excursions paid for one to \u201cChichen Itiza\u201d (Pyramids) and one for \u201cXel Hai\u201d (Snorkeling plus more). Both worth it!! They were each worth $80 or more. Then we got to the Mayan to check in. I knew from reading to try and get upgraded to the Grand Mayan, but, I was told no rooms. It was not bad at the Mayan at all. The only difference was that the Mayan didn\u2019t have hot tubs in the rooms and I really wanted a hot tub in my room. I agreed to go to the Mayan Timeshare presentation because they gave us 15% off our bill for the whole stay and $100 cash, plus a meal for 90 minutes. Well, if I have only one bad thing to say about my stay it was the Mayan Timeshare Presentation. It was torturious. We were hearded around like cattle. So many people in one room you can hardly hear. Our \u201cguy\u201d asked if we wanted our meal before or after the presentation and we elected afterwards. This presentation was long, boring, overpriced and very very harassing. After we said no three time to three different people over three hours later, they told us to go over and stand in \u201cthat line\u201d to get your gifts. The line was another hour of waiting\u2026 I felt as though I had been kicked to the curb and then no one wanted to give us our meal voucher. Everyone kept saying \u201cwe don\u2019t give lunch vouchers here\u201d. It was a horrible experience and a waste of one of my days. Our room was very nice and very clean. The maids do come twice a day. We were on the second floor in Bldg. 11 which was right across the street from the lobby. Do not worry about the walking thing. This is a HUGE resort and of course they have transportation to and from everywhere on the property. They have these little train type vehicles that run through the property constantly. I never, and I mean never waited anywhere longer than 5 minutes for a ride. The pool is wonderful. HUGE!! The water was very pleasant and clean. I don\u2019t like cold water and this water I could just walk into without even having to adjust to the temp and it was open 24 hrs. My husband and I liked relaxing late in the evening. It was so nice. I actually liked the wristband thing. You use no money on the property, you just show your wristband and they charge your room. While at the pool waiters come by and get you drinks and have menus with Pizza, etc. that they will deliver right to your Palapa. Speaking of Palapas no matter what time we went to the pool we always got under one. Even if you didn\u2019t see one right away, just get another lounge have a seat and within minutes you see one come available. The one\u2019s with beds, maybe not because they are limited, but I didn\u2019t need a bed, the lounges were very nice and there is a million of those. The pool bar/restaurant is very nice and casual and at night they have live entertainment if you just want a very casual meal. The other restaurants \u2013 Del Lago, very nice for themed dinners, but they were buffets and I just never like buffets that well and it was very expensive. The other restaurant we went to on the property was Turmonto. If you want to have a very nice dinner one night, save it for this one. A little expensive, but so worth it. I think it is a Italian/Steak House. It was one of the best meals I had the whole time I was there. Friday night is Lobster night, so Friday is a good night to go. My husband got Lobster and I got steak (steak melted in my mouth). As a special treat I went to the Spa and got a massage. You get treated like a Queen there, very worth it. Our two excursions, 1st \u2013 Chichen Itza. This is where the history of Mexico and the Mayan pyramids are. The tour was great and very interesting, the only thing I didn\u2019t realize was that this was 3 hours away. Too long of a day. The other excursion was \u201cXel Hai\u201d. This was fun and if anyone offers you this for free \u2013 take it and make sure that they give you the \u201call inclusive package\u201d. It\u2019s a huge water park right in the ocean. You can go snorkeling, diving, cliff jumping, rafting, swimming with dolphins. Also there are many restaurants and snack bars and bars right there and with all inclusive you get all your food, drinks (alcohol included), lockers, snorkeling equipment, everything included!. This will take a day, but its fun and cool and only about 40 minutes from the resort. The snorkeling was my favorite, I did that almost the entire day. We also caught a city bus in front of the resort one day and went shopping in Playa Del Carmen for gifts. This was fun, but be prepared to have the store owners harass the crap out of you. If is almost too difficult to even shop because of it. It doesn\u2019t help that you are wearing that wristband from the resort because they know that is where you are from and think you have lots of money. Most place take either pasoes or dollars.

It was highly recommended and our expectatons were high. We stayed in a 2 bed 2 bath kitchen unit which was comfortable and well serviced. The pool is indeed huge and beautiful and the activities were fun, including black jack night (free chips and prizes), live music, ping pong tournaments, water aerobics, volleyball, kids surpervised play activities etc. The flora and fauna were wonderful. The units are perpendicular to the beach ( to minimize hurricane damage) therefore there are few ocean views. Our view unfortunately was of a flooded swampy garden area and the building topped by tennis courts. The deck was too tiny to sit out on. From 5-8 PM daily fogging was done on the grounds to control insects. Especailly on our list of not-so -wonderful experiences included allowing ourselves be talked into the promised 1/1/2 hour time share sales talk for the \"no obligation\" offereing of free breakfast, $50/room credit and 15% off at resort restaurants and activities/tours purchased at the resort activity desk. We really happened was, after 2 1/2 hours time spent we had yet to even learn the prices for the units and when we stated we were not interested in continuing, an argument ensued where my husband asked for a manager in order to get our promised perks. Not a pleasant experience! We later heard for another visitor at the pool that their experience took 4 hours! The kicker was when we went to book activities we were told we could not use the discount since we had a rental car and were only booking the activity and not the complete tour with transportation. We also found prices were cheaper by a few dollars in Playa Del Carmen from sidewalk vendors anyway. This, I think, was a tone that continued and unfortunately, soured the experience. Tennis court use was $10 - $15. Want to use the great gym? $10 each visit. Also be careful of your bill. We initially kept our pool towels until the next day (24 hour pool) but when we returned them, we were told \"no problem\" just to sign a log to avoid $60/towel late fee. In the end we had to get this charge removed from the final bill, anyway. Also, I bought a book in the store there to discover my husband had purchased the same book. I immediately exchanged it for another one and received a receipt which luckily I kept since charges for both books were on the final bill, as well. It seems a shame, but while we were there the huge well equiped gym was barely ever used (at most we saw 3-4 people using it max at one time but usually it was empty) and the tennis courts usually stood vacant. So, the resort was nice enough but we would not go back. The problem was some seriously poor customer relations.", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tallahassee,fl", "Title": "\u201cConsider hurricanes plans before making reservations\u201d", "Author": "szamp", "ReviewID": "UR5226312", "Content": "We spent a week at the Mayan palace. We had an enjoyable time and found it to be a good base for exploring the area. We had a room with kitchenette which was great. We did participate in the time share pitch which was a very negative experience. To tell the truth I was considering buying into the mayan time share but the hard sales pitch caused me to reconsider & ultimately say \"no\" for about 5 hours strait. We did truly save the money they promised on food and purchases without no hassle so i guess it was worth it. We cooked most breakfast in and had our own drinks. There was a blender in our room as well as toaster. The week stay was a gift and with the discount from the time share pitch we only paid 118 dollars at check out. We had several evening meals and lunches as well as a few drinks at the beach I am very glad we had a car though it was very expensive to rent one in Mexico because of the insurance issue. I was able to save a lot of money by purchasing rental car insurance seperately on line before we went. Because we had our own car we were able to visit xcaret & other area attractions first thing in the morning. We also were able to grocery shop hassle free. I am one who would rather spend money on souvenirs and touring than restraunt food unless it is a memorable meal. The meals at the Mayan Palace were far from memorable. The room services was great & we had no trouble finding a shady shelter spot on the beach. The beach was a little rocky but i don't see how that could be a problem. We wore our beach shoes. This part of the Riviera Maya is not as crowded as Cancun and Playa and long empty walks on the beach are still possible. The pool was fantastic and I loved being able to swim at night..nobody was in the pool then. Maybe it is just me but I have a hard time with swim up bars of which there are two here. Two margaritas have me in the banna 5 times. What is going on there in the water? So I avoided that part of the pool and it was easy to do as the pools are so big. They have a good plan for turning in beach/pool towels so you never see a lot of dirty towels laying around. We also saw staff scrubbing the lounge chairs & over all the complex is very clean A couple of days we saw the staff playing with the kids in the children's program which took place directly in front of our choosen spot on the beach. I was very impressed. About 10 school age kids, spoke 4 different languages but the staff had them all playing well together. This would be a great place for a family to vacation The building and rooms are all the same and frankly look like an office complex. There are no rooms with views unless you count looking over the jungle and construction a view. The buildings are perpendicular to the beach. This is to help preserve them during hurricanes. Living in Florida myself I do not think this is a bad thing. We were scheduled to go to the hotel about 1 week after Wilma hit Cancun. I had few hassles rescheduling. I asked at the time share presentation, check in clerk and our bell hop how they faired during the hurricane. I was told the location of the shelter on the hotel grounds and they never had to evacuate. This is something worth considering if you will be visiting during hurricane season. We have a plan for evacuation from our Florida home and if you are vacationing during hurricane season to vulnerable areas you should ask the same questions prior to making reservations.

It was a long walk to the pool, we were in the last building but once we figured out the van system it was a lot better, although the walking did us good, but everyone wants tips for everything. My husband was very impatient for the buses so he preferred to take a taxi, very expensive, and we even spent $80.00 one day to go into Cancun and back. My husband did not like having to wait at the side of a very busy road to get a bus. We visited 2 other palaces on our visit: The Moon Palace and the Adventura Palace (adults only). Overall we liked the Moon Palace because of it's beauty and the beach was great there. Adventura Palace is an adult-only resort. It was beautiful and an all-inclusive, but with the arrangement of the buildings there was very little air movement and seemed to be extremely hot. Also there were a few topless women which I am not comfortable with. The Mayan Palace had the best pool, by far. Although the resort was full, there was plenty of room anywhere around the pool. Also the beach was nice although you could not swim in the ocean water because of the rocks. It seemes much cooler at the Mayan Palace because of the wind blowing from the ocean. Because the rooms were behind the pool and ocean area, there was always a good breeze which kept you cool. It is my suggestion that if you want to shop and sight-see, you need to stay in Cancun. We saw a lot of very nice places such as the RIU, the Grand Oasis and the HIlton.

Upon arrival, we found a beautiful resort, We arrived very early (noon) and did have to wait until 3pm to check in. Bring a swimsuit in your carry on luggage to change into and hit the pool while you are waiting. The pool was AMAZING,,,the largest I have seen at any resort to date. The only negative point about the pool is that supposedly you are not allowed to sleep on the Palapa (hut outside with bed) but the entire time we were there people did which made it very difficult to get to use one...and unfair to the people who got out to the pool at 5:30am (like us) to get one. We did manage to get one right before we left. We stayed in the building right next to the lobby on the third floor...it was a studio. Room was nice but did not have a coffee maker or refrigerator which would have been nice. We brought a collapsible cooler and used it for wine and beverages to drink at the pool and n the room. The food at the poolside restaurant was the best as far as what you got for the money. Del Lago is the restaurant that only serves buffets, which changes to a different theme nightly. The Mexican Fiesta is on Thurs night and it fun but if you go to any of the other shows there during the week,,,it is basically the same shows combined with mexican outfits...so you seen one or more you have already seen the Fiesta. The buffet is $26 per person and the Fiesta is around $40 per person, which includes your \"mexican drinks\" from the bar as well for three hours. Be sure to take a bus NOT taxi into town...it will save you a TON of money. The bus (van type bus) will only cost you $1-$2 vs $18-$20 for a taxi. Playa Del Carmen is between $1-$2 per person for the bus. To go to cancun, you will need to take a bus (van type) to the bus stop and take the R1 bus into town (large bus) It is only about .50 cents per person. Cancun still has quite a bit of damage but a nice trip if you have never been there. Playa is a fun place to go, take the bus to the bus stop there and it will drop you close to the pier. This is the 5th Ave area which is the tourist area, lots of shopping but the vendors are annoying, especially if you try to ignore them,,,some are outright rude. Also a nice little mall area with a Harley Davidson store and some other places to buy cool gifts. There is a restaurant called Karen's on 5th Avenue,,,,FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE...cute little place, nothing fancy, but had the best food we had the entire trip! The water sports (diving and snorkeling) at the dive shop on the beach of the resort is very reasonable and the diving was much better than that over at Cozamel (which my boyfriend did on Mon) which he said was much more colorful...due to the damage the reef suffered from the hurricane (reefs are covered in sand and damaged). So take advantage of the reef area right by the resort. The shop also offers free scuba lessons in the pool every day...the dive masters are great! I dont swim at all,,,,and my boyfriend convinced me to do it and it was the best! They are very patient. I am actually looking forward to taking lessons at home and hoping to dive in the ocean with him on our next trip back~ Hope this helped a little...since I know when we were leaving there were many mixed reviews!", "Date": "May 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cMayan Reviera\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5045481", "Content": "My 4 friends and I have just returned from a weeklong trip to the Mayan Palace Resort between Cancun and Playa del Carmen(Rte 307) The Mayan Palace Resort was great .The staff could not be more accomodating. Everyone was very pleasant. The entire property was very well maintained and immaculately clean. There was no need to carry money around at the pool or beach area. You can sign for everything then settle up at the end of your stay. If you are in the buildings near the golf course,there are trams to take you to the beach,(The turnaround is about every 15 mins.) and seaside restaurants. All 3 restaurants prepared wonderful inexpensive meals The beach is beautiful but does not attract too many people because it ihas a very rocky bottom. You will need beach shoes, which can be purchased on the way to Playa del Carmen at Walmart,Mega,or Chedrau stores along with groceries and anything else you might need. You must stop at the bakery for delicious inexpensive breads , cookies and pastries There is a shoppng area in downtown Playa del Carmen near the Ferry to Cozumel($11.) The main tourist street is called 5th Street .Vendors are too aggressive about trying to get people to buy goods at tourist prices which are inflated so be sure to negotiate quite a bit. Some Americans have a hard time doing that hard negotiating. Be very aware of two problems we heard about and both happened to us. One problem is to make sure if you stop for gas the attendant clears the pump before he starts to fill your tank. We were scammed with that at the first Penmex gas station on Rte. 307. It is hard to avoid this gas station because the rental cars are handed over to you with almost empty gas tanks. The second problem is with the police on the highway. We were a group of 50-something and are not prone to speeding. The speed limit is 80km. The police stopped us claiming we were speeding. I think they are on the lookout for rental vehicles( easily identified as such) He took the driver's license and said he could only get it back at the police station after paying a fine or give him $ 50.00. He was speaking Spanish and was not happy that we were questiong him in our broken high school spanish. When I asked for his name and badge number,all he said was\"Jorge'. Do you know any police officer that tells you his first nameand nothing else ????? So we handed him $ 50. and when we were back at the resort made the complaint.

Prior to arrival we had requested rooms that were adjoining; we were traveling with two other couples. The front desk was unable to grant our request (made in January) and we had two rooms in very different parts of the resort. As we left the front desk we were approached by the Time Share reservationist who said it was odd we were so far away from one another. She gave our information to one of her co-workers and the next thing we knew we were upgraded to the Grand Mayan, with adjoining rooms and a cooling pool on the shared balcony. In addition, we were signed up to tour the resort the next morning in the time share presentation. As a group we had already calculated the pros and con\u2019s and decided that the 15% discount, $120 usd and upgrade in rooms were worth a few hours of timeshare. The timeshare was fine, we toured as a group, got a lot of good information and a tour of the resort. It\u2019s more than 90 minutes about 2 \u00bd hours, but breakfast was good, and when we said no, it wasn\u2019t a problem. The second phase was actually more frustrating (after you tell the salesperson \u2018no\u2019, you have to meet with someone else to get your gifts) She was RUDE, but it only took 15 more minutes and we were on our way. The resort is big, but we didn\u2019t mind the walking, it was fun to watch the crocodiles and iguanas. In my opinion the resort is so big that it\u2019s impersonal and could be anywhere\u2026 Miami, San Diego. I didn\u2019t feel there was any personal service; the best was in the Spa, which was wonderful. We only found it difficult to get a Palapa, we arrived at the pool/beach after 10 am, on one day. The other 2 we found something on the beach side, but it\u2019s just a short walk to the pool and pool bar. The happy hour is fun at the swim up bar, and a good deal. The rooms were fine, but this is not a special place, it is very over-crowded and expensive. The meals were nothing special, including the Italian restaurant. This is merely my opinion, but I like to learn about the culture and eat/shop with the locals when I travel and this resort was just too commercial for me. I have no desire to go back, the areas of Puerto Adventuras and Akumal seem to have a village feeling and while developed, I didn\u2019t feel trapped like I did at the Mayan Palace. We ordered wine glasses one night, never received them, were overcharged at one of the restaurants and it was a big deal to change it. Getting service on the beach wasn\u2019t easy or frequent, the gift shop was what you\u2019d expect... expensive, and the staff is nothing special, they do not go out of their way to help you. The internet caf\u00e9 is a great amenity. Our biggest mistake was not renting a car in advance and just driving to and from the airport. (we booked Jeromi Transfers for the airport roundtrip, fine on the way to the resort they met us with a cooler full of cold cervaza, then the driver told us $90 usd one way, I had it in writing it was $90usd round trip. When we left on Sunday the Mayan Palace wouldn\u2019t let the driver in the front gate because they\u2019d had so many complaints from guests. They said we had to take our stuff out to the front gates! Can you imagine? After very vocally complaining we were able to convince them to let the driver in). We were worried about getting familiar with the area, but there is no need, it\u2019s very easy to get from the airport to the resort and to the local attractions in a rental car. The car rental at the resort in MUCH more expensive and open only from 10am to 4 pm. We had to go to the resort next door to rent a car. Check around (rent ahead of time) because the same company rents cars for very different rates at different locations. We went to Xel-Ha, don\u2019t count on the ecologically friendly sun screen to protect you; most of our group burned, unless you reapplied several times. This is a very crowded, tourist area, beautiful and fun, but if you prefer nature; there are plenty of places you can go to enjoy a similar setting with out the crowds. We did the all inclusive, which was a very good deal with all food and drink included for the day. Playa has some great restaurants, wander a street or two off the beaten path and you can find them. More authentic and reasonable in price. This is the same for shopping. We rented a boat (42\u2019 Hatteras) from Tequila Sunrise out of the Puerto Adventuras Marina (----------), and had a wonderful time! Glen (owner) and Ricardo (manager) are very helpful and professional. We wanted to go fishing, but also wanted to do a little snorkeling and sight seeing. We were taken out near Cozumel and snorkeled on the reef, had a great lunch (sandwiches like Mom used to make) and caught some great big fish. We would highly recommend their company and we all bought \u201cSalty Hooker\u201d t-shirts when we got back (name of one of their boats\u2019). Puerto Adventuras is a really neat area and they have the dolphins there, we were able to watch them as we enjoyed drinks at Gringo Dave\u2019s after fishing. Another great adventure was when we went to Tulum. It get\u2019s very hot, even though you\u2019re on the water, so we were happy that we went early (arrived by 8:30, left Mayan Palace by 7:00 am). We hired a personal guide at Tulum, which was very beneficial because of all the additional information about the History of the Mayan\u2019s and their culture. This is where we met Ed and went on a personal/private tour with his company. ---------- is the place to schedule them before you visit. We had Gil (Happy Gilmore) as out personal guide, the guide rides with you in your car and shows you around. He took us to Akumal for snorkeling with the turtles; it was the most incredible snorkeling ever! He also introduced us to a local fisherman who took the guys out the next morning when they caught their Mahi Mahi. Then we went to a private beach (it is just like the\u2018Corona Commercial\u2019 beach) where we hung out and enjoyed exploring the cove (snorkeling or walking). Gil took us to a \u2018locals\u2019 Cenote, which was phenomenal! Clear and refreshing, a great place to rinse all the sand and salt off, with a cliff dive. Finally we went to dinner back in Akumal at La Buena Vida, a great restaurant and bar with swings suspended from the ceiling for bar chairs. It\u2019s an open air restaurant and a lot of fun. This is a great area; we never made it into Cancun. I would not stay at the resort again (we all agreed), but would like to further explore the area! If you have questions, feel free to email.

The Mayan Palace was awesome! When you first arrive you'll see large gold pillars out front. These hide a Mexican adventure just inside. The staff checks your name at the gate, and once inside, you'll notice the well manicured golf course that you are driving through. Of course, the course has ponds (pun intended), but it also boasts a very scenic pathway that winds around and through it. This is well suited for joggers and romantic folk. I suggest early morning or late at night. (We had to turn around because of the heat at midday!) The rooms are nicely furnished with beautiful views of the adjacent property which has not been built upon. That is, Mexican wilderness. The floor was made of beautiful marble; however, it echoed people\u2019s voices as they walked down the hall (We stuffed towels at the bottom of the door to minimize this!) The beautiful pool(s): AWESOME! When you walk to the back of the property, towards the ocean, your eyes widen to see what can be stated as either a very large pool or many pools tied together. The pools overlook the unnatural beautiful blue ocean. As you head towards the ocean, each plateau of pools is lower than the previous, so that you are standing at a height overlooking a vast area of sand, surf, people, and cool blue pools. The food: We enjoyed dinner twice at the Lagos (on the property). Every night we were entertained by a band or dancing or jokester, while dining all-you-can-eat buffet style. All this and seated on the edge of a tranquil pond (very romantic). The food was excellent! Different food and entertainment themes for different nights! Excursions: We rented a car and drove to Cancun, Playa de Carmen, and Tulum. Cancun offered much to the partying college types: Hard Rock caf\u00e9, Senor Frog, etc. Playa de Carmen was an orgy for the shop-aholics and restaurateurs. It hosts a very long strip to walk on for food, souvenirs, etc. I didn\u2019t fail to notice the Mexican police posted at various points strapped with Uzis (don\u2019t know why). On the next street over, is the oceanfront, the backside of many hotels, bars, etc. The beach made for a romantic walk at nighttime. Don\u2019t get lost however; trying to find this strip, we drove into an area that made the worst part of Detroit look inviting. At the north end of the strip in Playa de Carmen is the ferry to Cozumel. We splurged for the boat ride over (about $40 a person) and went over for lunch and to explore. With no transportation, we found ourselves trapped near the port areas. This is also where the cruise ships dock. Here, you find a lesser shopping experience than the Playa de Carmen strip. Oh, did I tell you, they like price haggling? My wife does. She bought a hat for $2. We also visited the Mayan ruins of Tulum. It was wonderful, because the Mayans built their dwellings on a cliff with the ocean behind them. Such amazing architecture with intricately cut stones! The park had a wooden stairway built behind the ruins that led to the ocean, and a lot of people went down them to get into the cool blue sea. (I saw somebody swimming naked down there!) So it became two events in one. Truly awesome trip! The stay at the Mayan palace was fabulous. Granted, it was the only resort we\u2019ve ever stayed at. We recommend it highly. However, two significant events occurred that will make us reconsider renting a car in Mexico again. The first was the concern for the vehicle\u2019s safety. We paid only $19 a day for the rental, BUT, and additional $30 a day for the full coverage insurance. Our American insurance wouldn\u2019t cover us there. The second, most humbling event that occurred was that on our way to Tulum, we were stopped by one of Mexico\u2019s finest for no reason. There was a vehicle directly ahead of us and to our left. I saw the police parked by the roadside and maintained my speed at 80 km/hr. He pulled us over and spoke in Spanish. He demanded that we give him $15 for speeding. We tried giving him pesos, but he didn\u2019t want them. My wife and I looked at each other. I had heard stories of police corruption in other countries, now it was happening to us! We didn\u2019t want to find out about any Mexican jail or Mexican justice, so we gave him a $20 bill. We expected change and a citation in Spanish. We didn\u2019t get either.

Overall, we had a nice time, so I will just touch on the positives and negatives that we had. Good: - We stayed in building three, so the walk to the pool or restaurants was minimal. I will note that after reading reviews about the walk, I was prepared for the worst. I walked around the lake for some exercise and found it took me all of 10 minutes, and it was at most 10 minutes from the pool to the main lobby, so I think the walking time might have been exaggerated. Plus, you have to walk off the food! - The pool is great, and even with tons of people there, the water never felt crowded, and we always found some lounge chairs, though not in the shade. That's okay, we were there to soak up some sun for a couple of hours, not all day. - The service is very good, and most of our waiters were very courteous and efficient and friendly. - The food at Balche was more to our liking, so we ate there most of the week. It was more reasonably priced, too. - No bugs. There was a moth or two in the hallways, but we didn't have one bug bite the entire week and never used the bug spray we got. - Timeshare - we were asked upon arrival if we wanted to see the presentation, and we declined. Never heard another word about it. We saw many tours/presentations during the week going on and were glad we weren't spending our vacation time listening to a high-pressure sales pitch. Not so good: - Paying $10 a day to use the gym (or $40 for the whole week) was excessive. Being that there is no one up there assisting you, and you work out on your own, we felt that the gym use should have been included. Most hotels everywhere you go don't charge you to use the gym. - No beach. We are beach lovers, and although you can lie in loungers on the beach, you can't get into the water or walk along the beach due to the rocks. That was a big bummer for us. And it's not really convenient to haul all your stuff down to Playa just to hit the beach, so if we went back to Riviera Maya, we'd find a place that has a beach. - The food is ridiculously expensive. At Del Lago, the big restaurant, you can pay a lot of money for a buffet. Breakfast is $18 a person, and you can only eat so much. We skipped lunch, but really, that is just a lot for breakfast. We ended up going to Balche after the first two days, and it was more reasonable. The Caribbean buffet wasn't that great and the bill was $75 for both of us, with one drink apiece! - If you're considering going to the Mexican Buffet, it's $45 a person. Again, you will not be able to eat that much! - We exchanged a unit from Orlando (10 mins from Disney) that had two bedrooms, two baths, kitchen, dining and living room, and that got us a hotel room, with two beds and a bathroom. Not impressed with the equality there at all. Don't bring a ton of clothes. We ended up running two loads of laundry at $8 each for some clean clothes mid-week. It was expensive, but helpful, since we changed about 2-3 times a day due to humidty/sweating/showers. We didn't bring any long pants to dress up in, since we were on vacation. To each his own, but really, we weren't trying to impress anyone! Nights are really nice, but still humid. We brought jackets but didn't need them once. We kept track of all our expenses (it's a cashless resort) and the bill came out to exactly what we had written down, so they didn't stick in some random stuff we didn't buy. I'm sure there is more on both sides of the coin. We did have a relaxing trip and for that, we were happy, but we thought the value wasn't there. If you go, hopefully you will read up on what to do and what not to do while there, as it did help us out. Next time we go down there, we'll find a place with beach access, even if we're not in a 5-star resort.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBEWARE OF TIMESHARE FRAUD\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5003267", "Content": "My wife and I feel we have been victims of a fraud and we wanted to let other Canadians and the rest of the world know about it. I will not be posting your typical traveller review as their are already many of them and that is not the point of this message. This is a warning for all tourists travelling to the Mayan Palace. this is our story: On February 5th of this year we stayed for one week at the Mayan Palace - Riviera Maya. During our stay we attended a 90 minute sales presentation. We had no intentions of purchasing anything but the sales person was very convincing and we ended up purchasing. We purchased because the sales person told us we would make money renting out our weeks, and that the timeshare would raise in value. We already had a timeshare in the Bahamas and we were convinced by the sales team that our timeshare would sell in 120 days. They provided us with brokers who were the same ones they consulted. Also, before signing the contract we were coached on how to respond to Quality Assurance. Where when we were asked if we were waiting on the sale of a timeshare to pay for this one we were told to say no even though that in fact was the case. When we arrived back home we contacted the brokers to sell our Bahamas timeshare and were told a very different story. Firstly, the timeshare is not easy to rent out and the timeframe for the sales of the timeshare is almost impossible to determine. We felt we were cheated and since we only signed the contract a week (with deposit of $3567 US) ago we still had 30 days to make up our mind. We quickly found out that we only had 5 days and those five days expired since we left Riviera Maya. I was outraged and called to complain and the response I got back was you signed the contract and you have to pay. I am challenging the legality of that agreement on the principle that we were taken advantage of and mislead. I was and still am on the verge of considering legal action against the Mayan Palace. It is very important this message gets out as we do not want to see other victims of this terrible scam.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumberland, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGreat family vacation spot!

There were 7 of us travelling which included a 3 year old, two 15 year old twin boys, my husband and myself (both in our 30's) as well as my parents. My parents rented a hotel unit and we had a 2 bedroom master suite. Check in was simple- the concierge gave us all bottled water while we were discussing the check in process. We were in and out in less than ten minutes. There were timeshare people but we had read other trip advisor reveiws and told them that we were not interested. A bell person took our luggage and brought it directly to our unit and was very helpful. He informed us about the shuttle to Playa del Carmen and was honest that although they had a store on site, the prices were much more reasonable with a shuttle trip just 15 minutes away at a cost of 10 pesos ($1). The room was very clean and spacious- not great views but I was aware of that before I arrived. The resort itself is gorgeous and the staff was meticulous in their cleaning. Just yesterday before we were leaving there was a staff woman who was on the side of a walkway scrubbing the concrete by hand on her knees and every afternoon the staff cleaned the floors by hand on the floor - super hard workers is all that I can say about that. Our room was cleaned two times each day with fresh towels left each time. Chocolates were left for everyone each evening. One the second day of our stay fresh fruit and a note from the hotel was left in all rooms. A very nice touch. I was surprised when we noticed that our kitchen did not include a stove or a full refridgerator but I simply called the front desk and they sent us and additional fridge at no charge. As far as happy hour...maybe it was just the week that we were there but Satuday and Sunday there were 2 for 1 drinks all day and the rest of the week from 11-2. A bottle of wine at their store was about $12.00- not high end but still good. Our family was treated extremely well by the staff- the staff there were courteuous, respectful and all spoke great English. To be honest..it was more like an American resort than anything else. The gym was great, they have pilates as well as yoga right on the beach as well as inside. As far as the size....yes...it is a large resort but it quickly becomes smaller once you learn where you are in reference to the pool, etc.. With my 3 year old son, who loves to see the flowers and geckos and gets easily side-tracked to getting from point a-to-b, it took us less than 3 minutes to get from building 3 to the pool. I did not think that was a long walk as I had read many times before. Buildings 1-5 are very close to the pool. The lobby is about a 7 minute walk ( with a group of 7 as I said) from the pool through beautiful parklike grounds. It honestly was never an issue after we got to the resort. We REALLY thought that we were going to be walking all the time and this definitely was not the case. The pool was amazing-the beach not so great but famlies were there playing in the sand and you could walk to the right slightly and take a dip - we preferred the pool and there were always plenty of chairs-even with it being school vacation week. We NEVER had an issue finding a space with shade. Then again we were always there by 9 am. One recommendation I have is to reserve airport transportation and groceries before you go so everything is less chaotic ( especially when travelling with a large family). I searched for quite a while and found a fantastic site (Cancun Valet) they gave us round trip transportation by private van for just $105 and I also ordered groceries from them which were delivered that afternoon after we checked in. They even had a car seat for my son which I was thankful for. I HIGHLY recommend them- they were fantastic and you save a ton of $$$ on breakfast, lunch as well as ssnakcs, drinks, etc. If you are looking for a Cancun partylike atmosphere this is not the place. It is a family resort - very safe and quiet at night which is exactly what our family was looking for. We would go back again without a thought. It will be amazing in a few months with the new fountains, lagoons and even better when the new pool is complete.", "Date": "April 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff but....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4983735", "Content": "Just returned from the Mayan Palace April 15, 2006. Being in the travel business for over 18 years I have stayed at many 5 star resorts all over the world including many in Mexico. The Mayan Palace in my estimation is not a 5 star property. Good points: The staff were wonderful - courteous, attentive, friendly, always trying to oblige in any manner. The food was very good in all restaurants. The gym was the best I have seen anywhere at a large resort. 9 treadmills, a spinning room, new equipment. A yoga room with huge beautiful windows overlooking the beach. The spa was wonderful. Next to the gym was the Brio restaurant/snack bar. The food was fresh, healthy: great juices/smoothies, salads, sandwiches, wraps. Incredible. Unfortunately most of the guests did not visit this restuarant but preferred the \"fast food\" dishes served poolside and at Balche. Tramonte restaurant was good, expensive and [on the second floor] of the central building housing a boutique, tuck shop and bar [also on 2nd floor opposite side]. Weird, awkward, inefficient layout. Drawbacks: Like the other reviews mentioned, you have to get up early to \"reserve\" your place by the pool or in the shaded areas, poolside and beach. The resort's layout is very poor. Try to stay in buildings 1-5. Any further back and you have to take the tram everywhere. I stayed in #3 and it was ok to walk to the pool, beach, restaurants but a LONG walk. The construction of the units is very poor. You can clearly hear the people/TV in the room next door and the noise in the hallway seems magnified so be prepared to hear children yelling, crying, people calling out to one another etc. all hours of the day and night. I found this extremely annoying having gone on a holiday to rest. You cannot swim in the water as there are rocks everywhere. You cannot wade in unless you have water shoes on.

Our thoughts: -No pressure for the timeshare--after all the comments we felt a little neglected:)! -great staff, everyone was courteous and polite. We tipped the maids each day and they were wonderful. -the 'crack of dawn' pool bed rush was entertainment in itself, I got up early (4:45) one morning to watch and it was comical if not a little sad. Again, if your goal is to lay/sleep all day in a bed then maybe a big resort might not be the best choice? Just my opinion. We headed to the pool after lunch and could usually get 3-4 chairs under a palapa, just had to do some rearranging. -#1 frustration as always is the layout of the resort--whoever designed this place is nuts. 2 shuttles--30 minutes--to the pool?? Don't even think about forgetting sunscreen. All in all we did figure out system and learned to have fun with it, never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a shuttle but we were surprised at how many people who had been there for a few days who had no idea what to do. It caused a lot of frustration that we heard about again and again. Our advice is to use the time to chat with the courteous drivers and learn Spanish!~ -kids' activities were fine but no 'kids club' where you could check kids in and out -accomodations themselves--aside from distance--were very nice, especially if you consider the choice of their beautiful units vs. a hotel room. We had 2 adults/three kids in a master suite--compare the value of what we got to 2 hotel rooms and the Mayan Palace was great. -Balche had great food/prices all day, ate there most afternoons and once at night and the food was excellent, $95 US for 5 people for a casual dinner with entertainment. -we did not partake of the pool bars as we packed a cooler with snacks and drinks for the pool each day, never had a hassle -shops are expensive and far apart, Tramonto restaurant and lounge are beautiful and not any more expensive than anyplace comparable in the states, did not eat at Del Lago but the people we met loved the buffets and shows there -beach is as they say--construction and otherwise desolate but what can you do...it's not as if Mayan Palace organized the hurricane. -Spa is gorgeous, pricey but beautiful. -We rented a car, no taxi info. -Shopped at Walmart and Mega (Mexican Target) and got good deals at both -no problems with checkout, our bill was very accurate and when we noted that we were charged for towels we did not have they immediately removed the charge.

But even though the booklet says that they do not allow saving loungers, and or pool beds, I found that everyday, they both would have a shoe or book on them for hours, with noone using them especially the ones in the shaded area. I laid out by the pool on one perticular day from 9 until about 5 and there were 4 chairs under the papilla that had been saved all day long. There are elderly people and couples with small children who would also enjoy being out by the pool, but require some kind of shade. But were not able to do so because they didn't want to move someone's belongings. How sad, that people would be so inconsiderate. But that's the way of the world for most I suppose. Maid service in the rooms was fair, we were there for a whole week and not once did they sweep or mop our rooms. Kind of made us wonder what else they may not have done.

We are owners at the Mayan Palace in Nuevo Vallarta, so we were excited to stay in this one between Cancun and Playa del Carmen. When we arrived, we were immediately approached about going to an owner's update/timeshare presentation which we agreed to do. Not only were the perks of $100, 15% off everything, and a free buffet breakfast appealing, we also wanted to hear what was new at the Mayan Palaces, so we agreed to go. More about that in a minute... There were a lot of good things happening at the resort. It's almost completely renovated now from hurricane Rita much to the credit of the hard workers who make 80 cents a day. The people who worked at the counter, the pool and the restaurants were all very nice and friendly. The three things I was NOT prepared for (and I've traveled a lot and usually do my homework before I go) were: 1. The isolation of the resort. It's cheap to ride the Playa Express to either Playa del Carmen ($1) or Cancun (a little more), but there is no cross walk to get from the property to the other side of the street, so wear running shoes. The traffic is crazy! A taxi is more expensive (around$18 for the cab) but sometimes you can catch a driver who is not busy and willing to take you for less. Maybe renting a car is the answer if you're brave enough to drive; otherwise, be prepared to hang out at the resort 24/7 because it is in the middle of nowhere. 2. The rough beach. The sand on the beach itself isn't too bad, but it's all coral and rocks in the water. The swimming is not good in the ocean. I was disappointed with that and surprised Mayan Palace didn't invest in a nicer location. 3. The cost of food and drinks and everything else at the resort. We had a kitchen and saved a little on food, but who wants to spend their vacation in the kitchen? EVERYTHING costs as much or more as you'd expect to pay in the states, so don't expect any good deals. The food is great! I just didn't expect it to be so expensive. A cup of coffee in the morning will cost you $2.50. There are water toys if you don't mind paying $70 to ride a jet ski for 40 minutes. They had some beautiful swimming suits for around $250 in the boutique. Oh, that's dollars, not pesos! The prices were a little out of our budget since we're both teachers. There is no money exchanged at the resort. Everything is charged to your room and you pay when you check out like you do on a cruise. The last thing I'll share is the timeshare pitch. When we went to the owner's update, we were told it was a 90 minute presentation after about 30 minutes of questions and answers. To make a long story short, we were told that the sales lady did not want to waste our time if we weren't interested in upgrading to the Grand Mayan, and she \"certainly didn't want to waste her time!\" All the perks were withdrawn, but after informing her boss that we were misled when we registered, he apologized and offered us the 15% discount which he was going to take care of right away! We accepted his offer for our lost time and frustration and bought our own buffet breakfast. We should have gotten the promise of a 15% discount in writing because when we checked out, there was no record of us recieving the discount. Once we worked it out with the desk manager, she had to enter every charge from the entire week into the computer again, and we discovered the discount did not apply to everything as we were told. At that point, it was impossible to verify the accuracy of anything, so we paid up before the van back to airport left us. Mexico is a beautiful place especially in the spring. You can't beat the warm, sunny weather or the beautiful, blue water or the cheerful, friendly people, but I think the days of finding \"a good deal\" in Mexico are a thing of the past.

Yes there is construction going on, but give them a break they just went through a hurricane. I would like to see if we would recover any faster in the states. I wonder if New Orleans is totally up and running and all things back to normal. The ones complaining about the construction should of never vacationed there to begin with. Lets get realistic. The construction did not go on that late at night and never started actual work before 7:00 - 8:00 in the morning. The biggest construction going on is the development of an enclosed swimming pool. Right now they have the largest swimming pool in Latin America. This new construction is just another effort to make sure our vacations are great if the bad weather does arrive at the same time we are vacationing. The only bad note on the construction is one of their restauarants was destroyed by the hurricane and that is not rebuilt yet. This did make for noise by the beach. If you are irritated by it you are able to move to the opposite end of the beach and you will not hear a thing. The pool there is great. No other words for it. It has 2 swim up bars and the pool itself is on 3 idfferent levels. There were having problem with a heater and the pool was a bit cool. By mid week the great weather had warmed up the pools and it was wonderful. I agree with the posts about the people totally occupying the beds. It was a problem. But on the other hand I am not about to spend my time occupying a bed at the pool. There are plenty of chairs by the pool and at the beach. If you want one with a palapa you need to get there by about 8:00. If you go earlier yet you will have a bonus as you watch a tremendous sunrise out of the ocean. Check it was great. I always rent a car. When I drove up a person immediately greeted me and asked for the keys to the car. He then unloaded my car, brought all luggage to our room, and then parked the car for us. When we left the same was done in reverse. Within 10 minutes of my calliing the front desk to have someone pick up my luggage he was there. He took our luggage and our car keys and was gone. By the time we got to the desk and checked out, he was at the front door with our car loaded and engine running waiting for us. We could not believe he could find our car and load it in that short amount of time. It blew me away. When you call the desk for anything they answer the phone with, \"hello Mr. Foss what can I do to help you\". And everyone always had a smile on their face. I requested 6 more hangars and ice cube trays and within 10 minutes they were there. Their attention to detail is about the best I have had anywhere. \"We travel alot\" The food was a little pricey. But it was good. On the other hand the food in Playa Del Carmen was also pricey. I was last there 5 years ago and today there are not cheap meals in Mexico anywhere. We don't do the McDonalds and fast food thing. But if you want them they are there. Playa is a blast. We actually got in on a Tequila expo. complete with free samples from about 30 manufacturers. It is definitely the place to go. If I had to complain about one thing it would be the entry into the water at the resort. It is rocky. But on the other hand you can walk as far as you want to go both left and right when facing the ocean. Walk to the left and there is a great spot to enter the water. There is also some nice shells to be found. You can walk about 2 - 3 miles to the left. If you go to the right you will get to some nice beaches with easy water entry about 10 minutes down the beach. They did do the spraying for bugs at night. But we were also informed about it and told the hours of spraying. We were also informed not to have our window open between about 5:00pm and 8:00pm because of it. Try to get a room in buildiings 1 - 8. These are closer to the beach. I also ask for a room on the top floor. It helps to eliminate noise from anywhere. We do this at every resort we travel to. We had maid service 2-3 times a day, complete with turn your covers down for you at night and place a chocolate on your pillow. I am an owner at the Mayan Palace. I bought in Playa when there was 2 wheel barrows and a dump truck on the site. This is the first time I have been there since I bought. Prior to this I have been to other Mayan Palace locations. I bought because I wanted to not because of a timeshare shark. Actually I was so impressed with what they have done I asked a sales rep. to contact me and as a result purchased another week. I now have 4 weeks at the Mayan Palace and am anxious to get back there.

CHECK IN- was no problem no sales pitch went very smooth ROOMS- first floor excellent clean spacious full kitchen (which we did not use except for making coffee twice and Margaritas twice) robes waiting for us on our beds (a nice touch) maids came in twice a day and made up beds and turned them down with kisses on the pillow at night clean towels twice a day excellent service we generally tip the ladies each day a couple of bucks and they left us a thank you on the counter! FOOD- I love breakfast so we headed everyday to the Buffet and it was wonderful you could not ask for more at all lots of choices, its about 15.00 p/p but I feel worth it. Lunch at poolside was great the burgers are awesome and the nachos! Dinner food you have a number of choices at this time there are 3, buffet at Del Lago, Balche (pool), and Tramonto (Italian) we ate at all three and everyone was great. They all have menues out if you want to check them out before hand to see if you like. POOL- unbelieveable!!!!! the water is a bit cool for a second when you get in but the air temp was in the high 80's and sunny so you want to feel refreshed there is a huge jacuzzi in the middle for about 30 people the pool has 3 levels all connected walk in the water from one end to the other to see it all 2 swim up bars Happy hour 11-12 a drink special everyday 2 for 1 all day lots of activities by the end of the pool where the Balche restaurant and swim up bar is they do a lot of fun and crazy stuff so get involved if not at least go and watch its a hoot! GROUNDS- are beautiful and they are working at it everyday they did get hit by a Hurricanne so need to replace greenery but it is a walk to things but a beautiful one at that and they do have a shuttle to get you where you need to go, Pool Chairs- we went at all times of the morning and we always managed to get 6 loungers if they are gone walk a couple of steps and grab some off of the beach no big deal at all the beds under the Palapas are gone early but its not that big of a deal to lay in a bed at the pool to me! We did bring a soft sided cooler with us and filled it with ice and had extra coronas in there and some snacks they don't mind but don't bring glass containers by the pool or beach which is normal any where you go! THE SALES PEOPLE- are not that bad we went on the tour to see if we wanted to upgrade and we actually had to ask them for the tour Ha when does that happen! They will treat to you breakfast or lunch and give you 15% off of your total bill and 100.00 per room I can tell you we own at the Grand Mayan and we love it our value has increased a lot! its worth checking out if not just tell them no! Last but not least the staff any where at the Mayan are great if you have any thing that you are not happy with you go the the concierge and talk to them and I will tell you they will address it right away treat them with the respect that they deserve and they will treat you the same you are on vacation and they know that so they want you to be happy be patient we have traveled many times to Mexico and have never had a bad experience and if something isn't right we talked to someone and it is made right!

At least thats what i thought as well as the other people in my party. But after staying there i can definatly say that this resort is everything it is said to be and more. We flew in on a sunday, later at night so the check in wasn't all that busy and we got our room right away. After reading the reviews we were expecting a hell of a long walk to find out room. We were lucky enough to be staying in lot number 5 out of 20. We were about a 15 minute walk from the pool which really wasn't very much. The walk actually did us all very good we came back a few pounds lighter, not something you really expect from a vacation. The pool was amazing, its not heated but after sitting in the sun and baking yourself for a few hours its the most rewarding thing to get into. The only thing that is true about many of the reviews other people have left is that there aren't enough palapas around the pool or on the beach. Most people get up at 5 to be able to get one, which on one side sucked but on the other you got to experience one of the most amazing sunrises. The food issue wasn't all that bad. We ate at the pool side snack bar every. Not only was the food good but it was cheap. We really only ate one meal a day which was dinner. Take snakes with you and maybe some cereal for breakfast but you really don't need that much. We never went to walmart or any of the stores in town because the one onsite is good enough.

I would rate it a solid 3 stars, certainly no more. Check in was easy, no problems here. They were fast and efficient. Although people have written positive comments about this being a \"cash-less\" resort, I found this as an annoyance and problematic. Sure, if you don't want to HAVE to use cash, it's great, but it should be your choice, when and if you decide to do this. This is a requirement here, not a choice. If you have teenagers on the trip with you, it's a major inconvenience, especially if they aren't your kids. Most teenageers aren't going to use their own CC, so they are free to charge on yours. It took me countless times and great frustration to communicate to the front desk that I needed some kind of \"limit\" on charging so that I wasn't faced with a surprise bill at the end of my stay. I took my teenage daughter and 2 of her friends and almost every day I was faced with having to sort through my bill and correcting any problems. Setting up 5 accounts (I took a good friend of mine as well to chaperone) was a huge pain! I felt like I was fighting the system and it deflated the joy I felt about \"vacationing\", having to review money issues constantly. I could have waited until check-out but this would have just doubled the stress at check out. COMMUNICATION: This was another major problem at this hotel. Unless you are fluent in Spanish, be prepared to be utterly frustrated with trying to communicate with staffers about anything other than basic needs. I only meet a few people on staff who were truly bi-lingual (English as second language). I am amazed that a resort that touts themselves as international, does not have staff that is able to effectively communicate with its patrons about simple daily needs and concerns in the international language. By the second day, I simply gave up trying. The PHONE SYSTEM was another big problem during our stay. Using a phone card or credit card is, at best, hit or miss. I wasn't able to make contact with my family back home in the U.S. until a couple of days after my arrival. We had problems throughout our stay with the phone system. The operators, both in the hotel and outside, were rude and unhelpful when trying to navigate. Surcharges were added on to my bill even when we were not able to successfully place a call. I received many bills that the teenagers in my room racked up, even though they were supposed to be charged to them (once again, the seperate account problem) I had to attempt to communicate this problem with staff who did not speak fluent English, in the main lobby. Finally, it was worked out, only after finding a staffer who was from Texas and re-located to Mexico. To their credit, in the end, we were not charged for calls that were not legitimately placed and successful. FOOD: The food at the hotel was average. Not great, but not bad. The cost is fairly similar to other carribean/island resorts I have stayed at: overpriced. That's part of how they make their money. You just know this going into it. The food at the Italian restaraunt was the highest quality although our waiter was not over-the-top happy to be doing his job. Part of having a tip already included in the service (which they do at this hotel) is the possibility that you are not going to receive excellent service--because the incentive to earn a good tip is gone. Still, the atmosphere and decor in this restaurant is nice. I do reccommend it. The presentation of the food is beautiful. The salmon meal is wonderuful. As disappointing as this was to me (I love nice wine with a great meal) do not expect to find any really nice WINE at restaurants in this hotel or at any in Playa--they simply cannot afford to import really fine wines. Settle for mediocre or simply choose other drinks. CONVENIENCE: This has been stated in many reviews, but it is true: things are not convenient at this hotel. The pool can be far away, as well as restaurants. If you expect to roll out of bed, take a quick ride down to the main lobby and get breakfast, coffe or juice and take it back up to your room to enjoy--forget it! You have come to the wrong place. This involves taking the shuttle across the grounds waiting patiently in line. . . etc. . . also BE AWARE: you are not going to find coffee in the morning at this hotel unless you go all the way to the restaurants. There are no coffee bars around here. Unlike most up-scale hotels that serve free coffee in its lobby, the only thing you will find here is a cheesy coffe machine that only accepts pesos and pumps out cheap cardboard tasting over-priced coffee. Finding out how to get a freshly brewed cup on my first morning from the staff was like pulling teeth! And unless you know the spanish word for cream or half-n-half (which I do recommend, if you use it), good luck receiving some. Yes, there are coffee machines in the rooms, but unless you bring or buy coffee, there isn't any there to brew! And you will not find Starbucks, Seattles' Best . . . ect. . . in any stores there so BRING your own! (already ground) Here's my BEST tip if you really need your coffee in the morning (or any other time of day, like me!) and you aren't brewing your own--go to the spa/health club--on the second floor--there is a juice bar, they serve fresh coffee and you can find fresh cream there as well. The cream in Mexico is tan/brownish, not white like ours, but it is very tasty! This juice bar serves some very healthy, light meals as well--including granola/bran cereal and fruit, yogurt, muffins, ect. . . You can sit and look at the ocean on one side or the pool/resort on the other. It's a nice, relaxing spot that not everyone knows about (because it is located off of the gym!!). SPA/GYM: This is one area I can freely boost about. It is easy to get an appointment and it is a full service spa. They really do it right, here. The spa staff is first-class. They are very attentive, professional and calming. The spa surroundings are classy and very clean with modern lines. The robes they provide are ultra soft and heavy. The facilites are plush. They have a private waitng area with fresh fruit, lemon and fruit water, and comfy couches. They also have a nice locker room--which you can lock if need be, a hot sauna, a steam bath/shower, multiple showers and changing rooms, and a wonderful swedish shower--which I highly recommend using! There is a staffer or two there constantly to assist you--yet they are very aware of your need for privacy. An hour before or after your treatment you can use the spa hot or cool tub which is located just outside their door, open-air. This is only available to those who are using a spa service. They do have a package for the week, for those who want to use the facilities including the spa--and a massage is included. I felt the prices were very reasonable for the quality. You should definately use the spa! The GYM is also a well-run place. There is a cardio area with treadmills and they have a few other cardio machines. They have numerous weight machines (only a few freee weights for arms) and a beautiful yoga/stretching room which over-looks the ocean. I worked out a couple of times and there was always staff there and it was well kept. There was always fresh water available (grapefuit) and towels. The staff was not fluent in English, but there isn't much need for that. There are also locker/bathrooms there. They offer spinning classes near the pool every morning as well as stretching--these are free. POOL: yes, getting a great spot or numerous spots was difficult, but this was not my priority, so I never had difficulty. Whenever I needed a spot, I found one. There was always room on the beach by the ocean. The pool area itself is gorgeous! and the pools are warm and inviting. The pool bars were very lively and fun. I never had trouble getting fairly prompt service, and I felt the amount of alcohol in the drinks was adequate for the price. You can always get a drink during happy hour (I think 11-1 pm and again around 4) and get 2 for one mixed drinks. The service for gettign drinks if you are lounging by the pool is completely hit or miss: Sometimes they come by, sometimes they don't. The restaurant by the pool can have extemely SLOW serive--be prepared to be overly-patient! There is a buffett with the same food as the restaurant on the other side of the pool each day as well. The ROOMS: We stayed in a double suite (2 bedrooms with a main room in the middle) and found it adequate. The bedroom I stayed in was a bit spartan--white walls and older furniture. The floors are in stone--I'm sure due to neccessity--salt water from the beach, etc. ..but they were sticky most of the time. The humidity levels in the rooms were not at all well controlled. One of the doors on our cupboards in the kitchen literally fell off of it's hinges. If they took some time to update the rooms to make them more cozy (say painting the walls a bright carribean color and a few other decorating details) it would go a long way. I felt a little bit like I was staying in a dorm, not an expensive hotel. The beds were VERY uncomfortable. Do not expect to get a good nights' sleep if a soft, cozy bed is what you need. They really need to invest in new mattresses and bedding if they intend to keep what clientele they have. There is a safe in every room, so you can keep your valuables there with your own code. MAID SERVICE: they are great! Reliable and very accomadating and do a wonderful, very detailed job. Couldn't ask for more. ACTIVITIES: I was not there with my young children--but I do have a 4 and a 2 year old and did notice that there was quite a bit of effort to entertain the kids. They have an entire covered area outside for kid activites (paddle ball, fooseball, tv/movie area, kid sized tables and chairs. They always had at least 2 or more child-directors on staff who seemed very pleased with what they did. The baby pool was quite large and very warm, they often had kid activities going on for the kids in the pool. If I had taken my yound children with me, I think there would have been quite a bit for them to do. One word of caution, however: There were some pretty adult activites going on close to the baby pool--rap music with tequila swigging contests and such, including all the extras--I'm not sure if this was because I was there during spring break or not--but I would be somewhat cautious if I were there with my kids and they were out during some of that very adult activity. Off-site activites: I did go on an all day trip to the Cenote, Chi chen Itzan ruins which included a great tour guide and a brief shopping trip. It also included a lucch buffet (this was okay) which has local dancers. I took advantage of the shopping and bought two Mayan hyrogliphic silver necklaces for myself and daugther. It was interesting watching the locals make this right in front of me. The other shopping inside the building is a bit cheesy--but I understand our guides loyalty in trying to support the local Mayan population. Playa Del Carmen is a fun town to spend time doing up-scale shopping and dining or just window shopping or sight-seeing. Also, a stop to WAL-MART is a great idea at the beginning of the week. If you are very tired however, you may not want to take the local bus there--because is does NOT drop you off right in front--you do have to walk a ways and the trip there is pretty long due to weaving in and out for various stops. If this is annoying to you--just take the taxi--it will be worth the extra money!! Our BEST MEAL and NIGHT: This happened quite by accident, as my friend and I noticed a restaurant on our way to Playa Del Carmen called The Piano Cafe---we decied to stop one night and were very pleased. This was the best service, meal and entertainment we had on the whole trip. There was live music--jazzy, a local singer and pianist and incredible food. If you are used to recieving top-quality service, go to this place. The service we recieved was first class, very attentive. The atmosphere was great, full of energy. Try the Mayan Coffee after your meal and one of the waiters can bring this flambe drink to your table. If you decide to go out--an adult evening( the crowd was between the ages of late 20's to late 50's)--don't miss this spot!! It was wonderful. I admit that I have traveled fairly extensivley, so my review comes from that perspective--I have stayed at my share of 4 and 5 star resorts/hotels. If you are used to a 4-5 star kind of attention to detail, customer service and quality, you are not going to find it here, and will be disappointed. Personally, I would never even briefly consider a time-share at this hotel.The quality on too many fronts is just not there. In my opinion, the Carribean (Bahamas, virgin and British Islands) are a far superior choice--they really know how to treat foreigners. If you are just expecting a great ocean front property, good pool and fun, a crazy city such as Cancun, then you will be pleased. Just know what it is you expect before you decide to book here.

So that was a relief. Went to the spa twice, both massages were wonderful, and overall it was a nice atmosphere and environment. Loved the big jacuzzis -- too bad they were segregated by sex and only available to those who had paid for a spa service just before or after. They were part of the \"spa experience\", not a place you could just hang out. We played golf 3 times. It's a par 3 course, which is all that we're good enough for! We enjoyed it and had good service. We had a hotel room. It was bland and basic, but clean - no bugs and nothing broken. There was no mini fridge, though, which seemed sub-par. Often housekeeping didn't arrive until 2-5 pm, and the turndown service came as late as 10 pm. The balcony was too narrow to sit out on, but there was no view to enjoy anyway. We rented a car and were away from the resort most of the day. (Diving in Cozumel, snorkeling in Akumel, visiting Tulum and Playa del Carmen, etc). We ate at the poolside restaurant a couple of times -- food was OK, service was so-so, prices were not cheap but not appalling. Much better to eat off-site, though. The water in the pool was ice cold and there were no jacuzzis. There was a decent white sand beach, but the ocean in front of the resort is barely swimmable. (To be honest, if you're looking for gorgeous beaches and lovely ocean to swim in, the Riviera Maya is not the place -- it's not just the bit of ocean occupied by the Mayan Palace). Several times we found ourselves by the pool area around 7 in the morning, and we saw the craziest behavior every time: people appeared to have spent the night in the palapas with the bed-like loungers under them -- they were sound asleep, tucked in with quilts. Other people were streaming in, each loaded down by beach towels, using them to \"reserve\" 4, 6, 8 or more (!) of the chaise lounges. I think it's safe to say that by 8 am there is not a beach chair to be had in the pool area, and it appeared that that is where the majority of the quests spent their entire day -- just plopped out by the swimming pool. Overall we did not find the atmosphere to be tranquil or relaxing -- it was crowded and artificial, very far removed from the natural environment and local culture. And it's certainly not luxurious (not that we were expecting it to be).

Go to the Mayan Palace\u201d", "Author": "Explorer2003", "ReviewID": "UR4724349", "Content": "The Mayan Palace was overall a really nice upscale resort. There are three main complexes to the resort, you have the Grand Mayan, Mayan Palace, and the Mayan Golf. We stayed in the Mayan Golf, which was really nice. I hear that there isn't a difference between the three complexes. We stayed in a hotel room which accommodated 2 guests. The hotel room was a nice size. The rooms were clean, nicely furnished, and had a balcony. The only thing that took me by surprise with the Mayan Palace is that it's so large. What I mean by large is you have to use a shuttle to get from your hotel room to the lobby. And if you want to go for breakfast, you have to take a shuttle from your room to the lobby and from the lobby you have to take a shuttle to the restaurant. So my advice is don't forget something in your room, it's not a hop, skip, and a jump to your room. In regards to the restaurants, we only had breakfast at the Del Lago, which was nice. It's a buffet breakfast that cost $17.00 US per person. The price may be a little steep but the meal can hold you over until late afternoon. The breakfast is really nice. You have the choice of fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt, pastries, fresh pancakes, waffles, crepes, omelets made to order, breakfast meats, chilaquiles (try them if you never had them), and much more. We never tried any of the other restaurants. We did over room service on several occasions, which was delicious and somewhat affordable. Let's talk about the pools, they were huge. It was like a never ending pool, really nice. It was particularly nice for me since I can't swim that well. The depth never extended past 4 \u00bd feet to 5 feet. Just a warning regarding transportation: If you desire to go to Playa (5th Avenue-where you many tourist walk the boardwalk. You can purchase sterling sliver, souvenirs, etc.) you can either take a taxi for $18.00 US one way for the entire group (not exceeding 4 people). Another option to consider is taking the shuttle that will pick you up at the lobby of the Mayan Palace and will drop you off at the main entrance for zero dollars. You will have to walk across the freeway (don't be alarmed, traffic is light) and wait for either a van going to Playa which will cost $2.50 per person or you can wait for the two buses going to Playa which are the Mayab or the Playa Express, the total cost is $1.00 per person. Many times we took the bus because we weren't in a rush and it saved us some dough. Another important reason we took this option is because it was just me and my mother, two women traveling alone. So we didn't feel comfortable being alone with a taxi cab driver. One place you must visit it Xel-Ha. We did go to Xcaret which was really nice. But it was just too expensive for what you got. If you decide to go to Xel-Ha get the all inclusive package. With this package you receive admission, breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), snorkeling equipment (you will need your hotel keycard, ID, or cash as a deposit for the snorkeling gear). It was a really nice park to visit especially if you have children. The reason I suggest you opt to get the all inclusive package is because we overheard one couple reading their breakfast bill which amounted to $100.00 for the just the two. So it's in your best interest to pay $59.00/adult per person. Xcaret was nice for the Spectacular show which took place at night, but that's about all. Riveria Maya, Mexico is a nice place to visit. Overall we had a good time. Just one piece of advice, be cautious about what you eat and where you eat. You've probably already been briefed about not drinking the tap water or ice. I became very sick the last day of our trip, and to this day I don\u2019t know why.

We went in mid March and the weather was gorgeous! The room and the entire resort was spotless and incredibly clean and well maintained. Staff was very helpful, especially the conceige. Food was great, especially Balches (pool restaurant) which had a variety of food that was prepared and presented well. Price for an entre ranged from $7-26 USHad nightly music outside the pool which made for a nice dining atmosphere. Recommend getting yummy smoothies from the cafe near the gym (which is great if you want to work out)The pool is amazing and is great to lounge around. You can bring your own snacks and drinks to the pool which can help cut costs because the poolside drinks can be pricey (about 5 US)The beach is nice but very rocky, so if you wish to go swimming bring water shoes. Overall we would highly recommend this resort and I would definately go back. Some points to note: - Request to be in buildings 1-8. Closest to the pool area. It can be quite a walk if you are in buildings 9-20. Building 1 is closest to the pool but building 8 is right beside the lobby which is convenient. - phone service is terrible...don't count on making too many phone calls. You need to buy a card which is 10 US and goes VERY quick - Email is much better there, use the \"cyber cafe\" it has fast access and the cost is 4 US for half an hour. - Go into Playa Del Carmen and hit 5th Ave. Lots of interesting restaurants and shops. You can barter with the some shops but others won't - Snorkeling is great there. Don't book through the hotel..more $, do a web search and there will be plenty of tours where you can book direct. I would recommend going to Cozumel to snorkel though. I did the Reef Experience in the Mayan Riveria that left from a cute fishing village (Puerto Morelos) but the reef was nothing special. Next time I would do the snorkeling from Cozumel. - To get to Playa Del Carmen, go outside the front gates, cross the road and just wait and there are lots of buses or vans that will pick you up and give you a ride for $1-2US . It was not sketchy at all and felt safe (we are 4 young girls) - If you want to get groceries then go into Walmart at Playa Del Carmen. Good selection and if you take a cab back to the hotel it is around $18US..don't pay much more. - Is very humid there so put wet clothes on the balcony to dry over night otherwise it won't dry completely. - Get to the pool early (9-9:30 am) if you want a decent spot at the pool...I reccomend walking the distance to the far side by the beach so that you get some breeze...otherwise it can get very hot. if you want a Palapa (tiki hut) with a bed..which are bery nice you need to get there VERY early. They were all gone by 8am every morning. - Lots of free activities....aquabics, dance lessons, bingo, crafts, games, volleyball...all fun - The only negative thing I have to say is that the beds are VERY hard. Overall, this is a great place to stay...clean, comfortable, reasonably priced, great staff!

We have to say that we had the best vacation of the last 10 years! While some people are strongly against how far from Cancun it is we found it to be tranquil. It was the best of both worlds; you could stay at the resort and be pampered by the world class cuisine, or a massage at the spa or treat yourself to any number of excellent restaurants or you could catch a (Mayab) or Mexican Express bus for $2.00 USD. We found this to be an excellent bargain to spend an afternoon or the entire day out seeking different restaurants and beaches. People who complain about it's remoteness usually are the younger 20 something singles who are traveling to enjoy the party atmosphere. There was so much to do in either Cancun or Playa Del Carmen that you never felt as though you were left without an option. Our first day into the resort we arrived at the airport at about 4pm. Normally we would catch a red eye but this flight was actually nicer because the resort has a later check-in time of 5pm. If you fly in earlier we had heard that if your rooms is ready of course they allow early check in to accomidate your every need. We took a shuttle from the airport provided by The Mayan Palace that was $15.00 a person. Later we found out that you can take a taxi for about $27.00 USD. Don't be fooled however by taxi drivers promising low rates because often times they will say one thing and charge you twice as much as they quoted you before. Always make sure to pay in advance it helps in the \"No Comprende\" you misunderstood cases! Once we arrived at the resort we were overwhelmed by it's size. We couldn't believe how large this resort was and growing. They are currently in the works to add a gigantic indoor pool and sushi bar and I believe a activity area to include an arcade, pool tables and such to entice more families to bring their 15-19 year olds who are too young to venture out of the resort looking for evening activities. One problem with the resort is the evening activities for children and young adults. Because everything is catured to the drinking/partying type crowd at night the bars and restaurants are usually the only thing to do. In Mexico your young adults may drink alcohol with written consent after the age of 16 as long as they are with you. The Mayan Palace is a great resort to come to if you enjoy more of a remote type of destination. One of the most stand out factors in this property is it's family atmosphere. While we stayed we found everyone to be friendly and outgoing. Once we checked in to our hotel we were asked to tour the property by the Timeshare reps. While I usually say no to such a thing I made arrangements to tour it the last day on my way out. They offer you 15% off of your bill and an addition $50.00USD to see the property. Worth every penny because included in it is a breakfast at Del Lago restaurant which is a buffet style dinning restaurant. Usually the cost is $17.95 USD per person not including any drinks. If you figure the cost savings for you on a vacation spent eating and drinking high-end food it's so worth it. On average you spend about 90 minutes. Once you see all that they have to offer most people end up buying after seeing everything it has to offer. If you are a person who enjoys traveling a lot you can really benefit from their programs. Even if you do go and see what they have and respectfully decline no one will ever bother you again. This is brought on by their high sales volumes and motto that each guest is sacred and cannot be forced into a desision they are not ready to make. During our check in we were welcomed by smiling faces and knowledgable staff members. One major plus is if you are staying at this resort as a gift from an owner they will 95% of the time upgrade you to the Grand Mayan, their latest hotel rooms. This is what happened to us and let me tell you they are the NICEST rooms we have ever stayed in hands down. From the Marble everything to the view that's absolutely the most beautiful you will feel incredibly greatful for being upgraded. They will ask you for a credit card to use as a form of payment during your stay. This is a cash-less resort meaning that everything is by your room key and number. The Tips/Gratuaties are 15% extra and are automatically charged to each pop/beer/sweet/dinner/trinkett you purchase at the resort. We felt it was a shame because there were evenings at our dinner and shows that we would have loved to give more than 15% and didn't have the change to. In Mexico at this resort it's all encumbasing. Day Two: We took the Mayab to Playa Del Carmen for the day. When we arrived at the bus station if you can call it that ( More of a back-alley weird stop that you almost don't know if it's right place). After our first time we knew what we were getting ourselves into so not a problem. The bus takes you right to 2nd ave which is 2 blocks over from 5th, the main drag to find great shopping. Note to self bring your swimsuit. One of the best parts of Playa Del Carmen is the beach. It's way easier to access than The Mayan Palace, though not for long. Currently the Mayan Palace is renovating it's beach and removing the rocky bed keeping people from swimming there. We found the beach to be too hard to swim at due to the rocky bottom. Each day we were out there though there were 3 or 4 workers with wheel-barrows taking out rocks load by load. They said that the project should be completed in about the next 8 months or so. In Playa Del Carmen all the restaurants serve food cooked with Bottled water and ice that has been make the same way from bottled water. The food there is excellent and so is the service. While most of Playa is bargain central, all the restaurants have set prices so don't attempt to haggle them down. Usually the best deal you will find is from 11-12 everyday during happy hour. Mexican happy hour is this:Buy one and get one free. This is usually great right to share! Wrong, buy one get one free is per person and it's brought to you at the same time so unless you drink quickly your corona will be warm by the time you drink it down. Day Three: We took the Mayab to Cancun's pier. Once there we took a water taxi to Isla Mujerez. I have to say that this had the best beaches i've ever seen anywhere in the world. Pink Sand, Turq water and no one of the beach unlike Cancun. Beer usually runs about 1 dollar USD there so great place to drink up. Anywhere you go there are several little bars along the beach ready to serve you. This island is clothing optional which was an interesting concept. We only saw a few women nude, mostly the tourists. The rest of our vacation we traveled in the afternoon and evenings. During the mornings and afternoons we spend time at the resort. The pools is one of the largest in Latin America and likely the most beautiful as well. If you enjoy laying in a beach chair get up early as they will be gone or held onto by a beach-towel by 8 in the morning. A lot of people get up early and grab a towel then hold their spot and don't return to later in the afternoon which we felt was fairly unfair. Don't even think about a Palapa unless you are prepared to sleep there over-night which is what people do to have them for the next day. One morning we even got up early at 4am to obtain one but by then everyone of them were taken. They go too fast to even bother unless you have a willing participant who's gonna sleep outside all night....not a bad way to sleep with the ocean breeze on the face though. During the afternoon they have several games going on, and activites such a aqua aerobics, or bingo. Lots of stuff for the kids to do in the morning and afternoon to keep them busy. In fact they have several people who are employeed there just to keep your children happy, and you happy enjoying some r and r from the evening before. During the hours of 11-12 in the morning and at night there is happy hour buy 1 get 1 free going on. Also there is a pool bar and pool bar stands offering snack food such as Nachos, Guacamole, BLT's, Sandwiches and such. I will review prices for most things if you are interested at the bottom of this review. The biggest thing I never heard in reviews were actual prices so I'll leave them so you can have an idea as to what to expect. The evening entertainment usually consists of Dinner and a show. This is a must do. Every single restaurant in this entire resort serves excellent food and drinks. We hope that you enjoy coming to the Mayan Palace and enjoying a fun-filled and relaxing vacation. The following a prices as of March 2006 at the Mayan Palace. These are averages and the resort has the right to change these prices at any time: Del Lago Restaurant Mon-Wed evenings $27.99 pp. Drinks not included. Drinks usually run Pop/soda $2.75 each Water $1.75-$2.00 Beer/Cervesa $7.00 Mixed drinks $8.00 Doubles $12-15.00 each Thursdays $49.99 each Friday's-Saturday $49.99 each Breakfasts $17.95 each. Drinks not included. All of these include a free show that changes like there menues each evening. Balche' Pool Bar Guacamole $6.00 BLT-Club $11.95 Fruit Platter $10.00 Steak$20.00 Seafood $30.00 I would say on average we spent about 120-150 just on the evening meal which was 2 of us and 2 drinks each. During the days we usually spent about $20.00 on breakfast for 2 cups of coffee, a bagel and an apple each. Afternoon usually ran about $40-50 for a sandwich and two sodas each. We spent about 100 every afternoon on drinks by the pool, even with happy hour! Too hot. Suggest going to the convience store inside the resort. Pop by the 1 liter is only 2.50, vs 1 8oz glass of pop for 2.75 each. They have ice and cups everywhere so don't worry about them getting warm. We would also suggest bringing at least a small cooler with you for beer, soda water to have by your side at the pool. You never have any idea of how much you are spending until you get the bill. Mayab-buses 2.00 usd Taxi's $18.00-40.00 usd to Playa Del Carmen or Cancun Best deals: Secrets you find out during your stay. Every day on Friday-Sunday fresh apples are available for you in the lobby at no cost. Regularly they cost 2.00 each in the spa where you can buy them. Mayabs-Buses- Save you so much money. Don't waste your money of renting a car, it will literally sit in the parking lot the whole time. If you do rent a car GET insurance. Mexican drivers are crazy, and I don't know if I would feel comfortable driving the confusing street systems. Buying Soda/Beer/Water cheapest! There is a mexican supermarket two blocks down right next to the bus terminal off 1st avenue. Corona's $.70 each Superior $1.00 each Coke/Diet Coke $.70 each Water $1.00 for a 3 liter bottle Candy-chips and anything else you could dream of. Walmart in Playa. The walmart is off 10th avenue. It's not that far walking distance from the bus depot, though if you are planning on buying a bunch of stuff you might want to take a taxi back to the resort. Taxi's are leaving from there every 2 minutes, there's always one there. Water-taxi's They run about 4-5 each way pp", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hennepin, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cA great vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4603749", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews of the Mayan Palace, I really didn't know what to expect. Some people were so negative and others loved it, so there was quite a range of opinions. Here is mine: We're a married couple in our early 50's and this was our first visit to Mexico other than the border towns. The hotel was wonderful and the hotel grounds and pool area was beautiful, very meticulously manicured. It was quite a walk to the pool from our room, but I'm not complaining as I figured I could use the walk and if I didn't feel like walking, there was always a tram available. I looked forward to happy hour at the pool every morning at 11:00 a.m. The drinks were delicious and it was also a good way to meet other people. The first couple of days we were there, the water was too cold for me to sit at the swim up bar, but by the end of the week, it warmed up considerably. If you wanted a palapas, you had to get to the pool before 8:00 a.m. or they were all taken. I'm a sun worshiper, but the sun is quite intense and I sat in the shade for a few days myself. We went into Playa del Carmen a few times for shopping/dinner and the first night for a run to Walmart. We took a bus into town the first time, but the other times we went across the highway and got a cab. You can deal on a cab into Playa ($1.00-$2.00 ea.) as the drivers don't want to go back into town empty. It's only on the way back to the Mayan that it cost anywhere from $15.00 to $18.00. Twice, we took a bus back to the Mayan from the bus station on 5th Ave. for $1.00 each. Their buses are like Greyhounds, not the kind of city buses I was expecting. One night we ate at the Alux, an underground cave in the middle of the city. If I had it to do over again, I would have a drink at the Alux and walk around and see the place, but I would not eat there. Way overpriced for what you get. On Thursday night we went to the Mexican Night Buffet. It was $48.00 per person, the ladies received a small shall and the men received a straw cowboy hat upon entering. The food was good but I was disappointed they had no fajitas or burritos on the buffet. The entertainment was just okay, but it was colorful. The other restaurants on the premises had good food too, but I kind of enjoyed going into Playa a few times in the evening to eat just to get away from the hotel. For lunches, we went to the store on the premises and picked up a loaf of bread, lunch meat and cheese and had a sandwich at the pool. One way to save a couple of bucks !!! I was very glad they had a cyber cafe for the guests to use. It was $7.00 for an hour (you could accumulate your time) or $4.00 for 1/2 hour. This was a great as we could communicate as many times a day as needed with anyone back home. This cafe was located in the building with the gift shop and it was a popular spot. When your time ran out, you just purchased another card. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Mayan Palace. The maid service was excellent, our room was very nice and the staff always had a smile on their face and said hello, no matter what they were doing when you walked past them.

It's nice - large but not overwhelming. We were in building 6, between the lobby & the pool. A reasonable walk to the pool & beach - hey - the weather was awesome, & the exercise was great (perhaps those who complain should lighten up a bit & walk a bit more). The pool met our \"Mayan Palace\" expectations - awesome - large - 2 swim up bars where we enjoyed the Picasso's. Beach was great for walking (both to the left & to the right of the resort) & poor for swimming. Plenty of sand, palapas & lounge chairs. Pool has lots of lounge chairs & could use more palapas for shade. The large \"bed loungers\" were neat, always taken, but not something that was worth getting upset about! Rooms were large, VERY clean (twice daily) & very comfortable for 4 adults (2 bedroom unit). Absolutely no complaints. The buffets & Mexican Fiesta are good value (a little pricey but good fresh food & good variety). The days of $1 meals in Mexico are gone!! Good entertainment. Went into Playa del Carmen daily - bus $1 & taxi back ($18 - split between 2 couples was reasonable). Its a quick trip. Could have rented a car, but no one wanted to drive - remember - then the driver can't see the sights & we are all on holiday. Ate at ALUX in Playa - the setting in the cave is awesome - food was not memorable at all, very overpriced & service the weakest we can remember in Mexico. Hint - go for a cocktail to see the caves & then leave. A better choice to eat is Palapa Hemingway - the flambees are awesome, good food & decent prices. Trip to Cozumel was OK. XCaret is a full day - really enjoyed the Mayan Ball game & the night show. Saw Playa del Carmen's carnival festival our final night - talk about lots of people - everyone having fun - we were made to feel welcome & enjoyed it as well.

The resort is nice, but we stayed at the Mayan Palace in Puerto Vallarta last year and had an ocean and pool view that was \"breathtaking\". Here, because of hurricanes they have to place the condo buildings away from the ocean. THe ones in between the lobby and the pool are not so bad. But if you get one across from the lobby going the other way (away from the pools and ocean) which we had, it is a very long walk to the pool. Granted they have golf carts pick you up, but there's alot of waiting sometimes. The pools are very nice and clean provided you can find a spot. Pool bars -happy hour 11:00 am every day for 1-2 hours. Drinks are about $6-8.00. The ocean was great for swimming. I cannot understand why anyone thinks otherwise. They have a little beach roped off and its great. Playa Del Carmen is quite a ways away. You can bus it there, we did a few times for $1.00 but we always took a cab back for $15.00 or 150 pesos. You ask them how much, if they say $18 you walk away, then they will yell back and lower the price. We took a tour to Isle Mohares (sp?). Don't do it. It was not worth the $70 each. Old boat, snorkling not very good, and really not much to see. We took a golf cart tour around the island and my bottom still hurts from the ride. Now I wish we would have done the Xel-ha tour instead for $90. But we ran out of money. My husband spent it on diving. If diving go to the far end of the pool. When facing the ocean its way on the right. Kind of close to the restroom on that end. Walk towards the ocean and there is a little hut. Them guys are who you sign up with to go diving. Do not go upstairs from the lobby to sign up for diving - you have to get to town on your own on their trip. THe guys from the hut, you leave right from there, well its a little walk around to the left of the resort. Make sure you do the cave diving at Cenotes my husband really enjoyed that. $65.00 for one dive (not the caves), then $130 for 2 dives in the caves. Well worth it he thought, and he has done several dives. All in all its a nice place, but next time I'd go back to \"Mayan Palace Nuevo Vallarta\" in a heart beat -not the Mayan Palace Puerto Vallarta (Marina location)-(there are 2 Mayan Palaces in Puerto Vallarta, Nuevo and the Marina).

I think the hardest thing to let go of is the American \"I want it right now\" People in Mexico know how to groove to another rhythm. It makes the experience super relaxing.

Great deal if you like to do lots of activities and eat and drink. Watch out for the sun in the early day on the tubes on the river..we all got a good burn ( suntan lotion can only be bio-degradable to protect the fishes) We saw so many large fish..parrot fish and one with teeth, but they are all vegetarian fish so don't worry. Playa del carmen is super. Media Luna is a terrific place to eat 5 stars for the food. They don't ask you to leave when your done so remember to ask for the check or you'll be sitting there for a while. Not bad because you realize how in the States you pretty much have your bill before you've finished eating! Also we shopped on 5th like New York's china town but mexican. Good treasures if you want anything from basic souveniers to high quality home and clothing. I could go on and on, but basically if you are staying at the Mayan Palace you are staying at the BEST. That is why we are owners. My sister and I even went to the sales pitch again this time to see the offers. Great deals, especially if you talk to Jonathan and the manager Carlos.

We traveled from 12/12/06 to 12/19/06. Without rehashing a lot of things other people said, here are some points we found important. Groceries: While I found parking at the Wal-Mart and walking to the downtown area to be excellent advice, I would not suggest grocery shopping there! We had a much better experience at the Chedraui grocery store. (Just a little farter down the highway). The store was cleaner, more well stocked, less crowded and the food fresher than at the Wal-Mart. Walking at the Hotel:Yes it's a long walk from the time share area to the pool and beach. We traveled with teenagers, and it really didn't seem like a big deal to us. If you had small children, I could see where it would be more difficult. If you're willing to wait, there are trams running from the beach, to the hotel and down to the time share. The walkways are pleasant and well lit. The hotel and it's staff were wonderful. Our rooms were cleaned two times a day and the bedding changed daily. The asked us how many people were sleeping on the trundle beds and those beds were also made up every evening and put back together into couches in the morning. We had excellent service! The staff was helpful with all questions (though not always correct with directions) and we had an excellent experience there. Car rental: We rented a large van on line. It had large multiple dents and scratches that we videotaped before we left the site. We had no problem turning the van back in. Driving is pretty scary, not for the faint of heart. The scary twist we had was my 15 year old son had an appendicitis attack one day after we arrived. After being sick for a day we took him to the Dr. on site at the resort. He was very helpful, spoke excellent english and referred us to a hospital for tests to confirm the diagnosis. The hospital in called Hospiten, and there are others located throughout Mexico. The cater to tourists and work with your insurance company. It was difficult to find, only because it was not well lit and it was late at night. While it was a very scary experience to have our sons appendix removed in Mexico, I have to say the experience overall was a positive one. They allowed me to sleep in the (large) room with him and fed me three meals a day. The language was somewhat of a problem with some of the nursing staff, but we managed to get by. The public relations person they assigned to us was very helpful in dealing (long-distance) with our insurance company. You don't leave the hospital until your bill is either totally paid by you via credit card or you they have a guarantee of payment from your insurance company. While I wouldn't suggest having surgery in Mexico, the whole experience worked out o.k. We did the X-Caret experience, fun for the kids and worth the price. We also snorkeled at Ya-Kul Lagoon, which is in Akumul. It's a little difficult to find, but a great lagoon ($3 to enter) with a ton of fish to see. They don't allow sunscreen to be worn, so wear a t-shirt if you burn easilly.

Nothing is ever perfect! This place is what we were hoping it would be plus more. The scenery is breathtaking, like a postcard. The service was great and everyone was very pleasant. As someone mentioned in an earlier post, the service is a little slower in Mexico and you just have to be patient. We went to the Italian restaurant which was outstanding. All the restaurant were very nice. We also went to Mexican Night on Thursday and that was very entertaining and worth the money. It cost $48 a person and 1/2 price for kids 12 years old and under. All you can eat buffet and all you can drink as well as entertainment. I would suggest to take the time out and ask for a building closer to the pool area. We were located somewhere between the pool and the lobby which worked out very nice for us. This is a great place for kids, seniors and honeymooners. The beach area is very nice to relax or play volleyball and other games. It is a nice sandy beach. However, it is not a great beach for swimming, but we did not care anyway because the pool was really awesome. They always had entertainment at the pool like swim aroebics, salsa dance lessons and other activities. We went to Xcaret, Xel-Ha and Tulum. They all had something different to offer and we had a great time at each place. Xcaret has an underground river you snorkel down which takes 40 minutes to get to the other side which is the beach area. We also did sea trek and I hear there are only eight in the world. You walk on the bottom of the sea and beautiful fish swim around you. You wear a helmet that looks like an astronaut helmet. Xel-Ha was a great place for snorkeling. We saw some beautiful fish, some small and some big. Tulum was interesting learning about the Mayan history. You can take a shuttle to the road and catch a bus to Playa Del Carmen. When we first got there, we did take the bus to Playa Del Carmen and went to Walmart. We stocked up on some food and then took a taxi back. The bus cost $1 a person and the taxi cost $18. The taxi price is a set price and you really can't bargain them down. The reason why we took a taxi is because we would not have been able to fit our grocery bags on the bus. You can take the bus to and from Playa Del Carmen and the bus runs every 15 minutes or so. We ate a few times in Playa Del Carmen and shopped. What a nice place and I hear it is the fatest growing city in Mexico. You just have to be careful when you take the shuttle to the road. You have to cross the highway to catch the bus. I hope you found this helpful! We loved it so much that we would like to go back again. I have included a few photos of the pool, Xcaret, Xel-ha and Tulum.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Breckenridge, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "rlv", "ReviewID": "UR4550778", "Content": "We just returned from staying at the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya. It was a wonderful resort and I was impressed. It is a huge place, so there is quite a walk to the pool from some of the rooms. All you need to do is start walking and the shuttle will come by within 2-3 minutes. We chose to walk most of the time from the lobby to the pool and it was a nice walk \u2013 very beautiful. We had 2 couples in a one bedroom with 2 couches. We had thought that the couches were going to be sofa beds, but it turned out they weren\u2019t so we pushed the couches together to make a bed. It wasn\u2019t the most comfortable sleep, but wasn\u2019t too bad. The room was decorated very attractively. The pool & swim up bars were awesome on hot days, but the pool was way too cold on 70-75 degree days. We met a bunch of nice people at the Happy Hour at the Tramonto Lounge. Most nights the lounge had great service, but one night they were way understaffed and it took 25 minutes to get our order in. At the pool bars & the Tramonto, the drinks had plenty of alcohol, even a little burnt. The frozen drinks were really good. I really loved the \u201cno money\u201d system. All you do is sign your name & room number. You don\u2019t ever need to carry anything along. We kept track of our charges and were pleased to find out that the bill was exactly correct when we checked out. It was windy while we were there, so we didn\u2019t spend much time on the beach, but we did bring a cooler down there and have a little party on the beach on the last night we were there to clean out our fridge. The beach wasn\u2019t too rocky, but the swimming area was. My husband enjoyed the fitness center. We were never even asked about a time-share. Maybe because we were using someone\u2019s time share and were considered \u201cmembers\u201d? Don\u2019t know. We did have a problem with our key cards. Several times two would work and two wouldn\u2019t and then we asked for 2 new ones and the two previously good ones wouldn\u2019t work. We finally asked for 4 new ones and after 2 tries we got four working ones. The cleaning staff was great. If something was spilled, they would show up ASAP and clean it right up. The maid was also really great. She even did our dishes, which we were told that we were supposed to do. One day we went in to Playa Del Carmen, bought beer at a little store on 5th Ave for $0.80 each and walked around shopping & drinking beer all afternoon. My husband thought it was great to be able to drink beer while shopping, so I was able to shop a little longer than I would have been able to otherwise! We thought it was a great resort!", "Date": "February 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgetown, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for honeymooners, Families, and seniors.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4500030", "Content": "I work in the hospitality industry, and on vacation I sure like to get treated like my business is apprecieated. That is the service we recieved at the Mayan Palace. We got treated like they were happy we were there, hats off to the management for providing a work envrionment that promotes that kind of service. We had no problem with the time share part, here was the trick. When you check in, a person will be waiting for you with a clip board to escort you out to the bell stand. That is the person who will sign you up for the time share meeting. We simply said Oh, we are not married. They stopped and said thank you and that was the last we heard of it. It is a bit of a walk to the pool, but goodness what beautiful grounds to walk through, Quite a change from the snow in the Rocky Mountains. The pool really is great, My only problem was the drinks they make are really weak, and I'm not much of a drinker, but at the prices they charge it would be nice to have a little alcohol. However they have no problem with you bringing your oun dirnks to the pool area. We also rented a car through Hertz. Hertz accepted our credit card insurance, so the total cost for a week with 2 drivers was about 270$. The thing you need to watch really close is the gas station attendents. We had heard about the warnings to make sure they reset the pumps to zero befor pumping, but the first time we got gas they got us another way. They work it in teams of 2. The first one pumps the gas and the second one physically blocks the driver in the car and blocks their view of the pump. My passenger had to use the restroom and was not able to watch. So I'm in the car, being blocked. I heard some beeps, when I was able to see the pump the display that shows liters showed nothing and the price was 255 pesos. The next time we got gas it cost 144 pesos for the same amount of gas. With the electronic pumps they have the ability to push a button to bump up the price, so our tips. Do not open the gas cover until you are able to have someone standing at the pump staring at the display the whole time. Don't let the second person distract you from that mission, or you can plan on then adding an extra 10 dollars or so to your bill. Playa Del Carmen Nightlife really is non existant, prices are ridiculous, it cost 10$ for a cocktail with cuban rum sugar and mint. Come on 3$ for a local beer, I don't pay that much in the resort areas in Colorado. Ok, it was vacation so we payed. To me it sems that they try to hard to be the upscale fancy area. We really enjoyed Cozumel much better. The shopping and bargaining in Cozumel was much more like you expect when you visit Mexico. The example I have is this. In Playa, I found a stuffed frog, The shop keeper wanted 25$ and would not go down at all, in Cozumel I purchased the exact same thing for 7$. The place in Playa to shop is definately Wal Mart. You have got to get some pastries at their shop, get your vanilla there also. Finally there is one place that you have got to see in Playa Del Carmen. It is called ALUX. An underground resturant and cenote, Oh it is the coolest place ever. It really feels like you are on a James Bond set. Enjoying a cocktail in your private cubbyhole surrounded by stalagmites is the best. There are walkways going through the system of caverns and flowing water. Oh hey no cover charge. This is the place I don't mind paying premiun prices cause WOW. Do make the trip to Tulum, it is so beautiful. Finially it was a great first trip to the Yucatan. I would probably not go back to this area. In fairness this is only because I like to party a little harder while on vacation, and would choose Cancun, or Cozumel the next time.", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PEORIA, IL", "Title": "\u201cNO COMPLAINTS (SOME GOOD TIPS)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4476944", "Content": "My husband and I went to the Mayan Palace this last week (feb 12th - feb 19th) and has a good time.

This resort has nice grounds but is a long ways from a 5 star hotel. The rooms were not as good as the 3 star Hotel we stayed at in Cuba in 2005. We did during our trip visit 2 other resorts that were fantastic the Real in Playa Del Carmen and stayed one night at the Moon Palace just outside Cancun both of which are true 5 star hotels that are far superior to the place. Despite what they might tell you the Moon Palace has an even better pool and a great Beach! The First room we were given was in the end of the resort that is the farthest from the beach (yes it is a very long walk to the beach) The use a shuttle van to move you from the lobby to you room. The rooms air conditioning was not working except to blow out warm musty air through a very noisy fan. The hair dryer was not working, there was no fridge, coffee maker or other amenities in the room. The beds of course are hard as a rock. We decide to live with this for the night as it had been a long day and wanted to get out and see the resort. We went to the Bar and were told it was closed even though there were people inside and it was only 10:00 so we went to the pool bar and a had a drink there. The second day we asked to be moved in the morning as the room was not acceptable do the smell, they did move us after telling us they had never had a complaint before! ( Reading the reviews here this is not true) The new room did not smell as bad unless you turned the A/C on and was much closer to the beach. We decide to just leave the A/C off and the door open as we did not want to go through the 2+ hour ordeal of moving again. We did however bring our concerns up with the Concierge including, Towels not being change, the A/C smell the lack of services at the hotel, and of course the terrible treatment at the time share presentations (2 \u00bd hours of lies and a very ruse woman). WE had asked for the Manager but were told he was too busy to speak with us. The concierge was concerned and offered to buy us breakfast the next day which would be removed from our bill\u2026.of course they failed to follow through on that! The area is fantastic this is just not the place to stay find a nice resort, if you are getting it for bargain price then stay here as it is a nice 3 or maybe 4 star resort.

We are RCI members and time share owners in the Bahamas and were there from Feb 5 - 13th. We arrived EARLY at 2:30pm and to our surprise our room was ready for us. We were very pleased with the room and found it a considerable upgrade from our home resort. I will not cover the Cancun airport as most others have already done a great job at explaining the process. We had a room in the 1200's which if you have been there you will know is one of the farthest rooms from the pool/beach arera. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the walk to the pool even though we only did two beach days while we were there the rest of the time we spent exploring the area and making money (I'll explain later). From the looks of things some people there could certainly have used the walk! Cathing the bus to Playa is a piece of cake and is really cheap at 10 pesos as others have mentioned. I would strongly recommend taking the Playa express if you want to get to Playa Del Carmen. Once there check out 5th avenue and if you don't want to be harassed by vendors trying to sell you everything just don't show any interest or make eye contact and say a polite but stern \"not interested\" and they will leave you alone. They are hard working honest people who are just trying to make a living so remember that while you are walking around. When it comes to restaurants they are IMO pretty pricey so don't go to the first one you see, actually if you walk further down 5th avenue you'll find a pizza place which sells individual slices for 16 pesos! You can eat pretty cheap if you want to. Of course if you like spending money as well then that will not be a problem ;) We went to a couple good places with reasonable prices and I would recommend Agua Vios and La Parella both on 5th Avenue. Earlier I said we found a way to make money which is to do as many presentations as you can. Also, DO NOT take the free tours with the presentation as this is the first offer the tour guys on the street and airport will make you. Bargain with them and you can get paid $150 US per presentation! We unfortunately only learned this the last day but we did have all our excurssions (Tulum-Xel-Ha, and Chichen-Nizza) paid for. In fact, we were kicked out of the last presentation because we showed no interest in anything they had to show us. We were kurt with our responses and killed any hope of a sale, so when the \"Closer\" came in he had nothing to work with and told us \"There's the door get out and get your prices\". Which were $150 US, a 50 spa certificate, and a 3 night 4 day stay in a 5 star resort in Cozumel valid for the full year. Well worth it!! I would also like to say the Mayan presentation was the most professional one we had ever seen and while we had no intention of buying anything we did end up buying because the deal made sense and we are very happy with it. If you ever get Miguel as your sales rep you will be very surprised at how proffessional and ethical he is. Very good guy and his manager was as well. I would also like to confirm that getting the Palapas with beds underneath is very difficult but well worth it! We got one for the full day but had to ge there at 4:30am to secure it and to our surprise people really did spend the night there. The staff at the resort are world class and we were treated very well.

They also give men hats and woman scarves , I enjoyed the buffet on Asian and Italian nights better, these nights did not include the drinks and were about $18 per person. We took the shuttle from the airport, if you call ahead to Mayan Palace they will arrange pick-up for $15 per person one way. The bus into Playa del Carmen was about 10 peso's ($1.00 USA) 20 peso's to Cancun ($2.00) no problem with the bus, very safe.. The beach is small and the water had alot of rock's, also when we were there the surf was very strong (no-one was swimming..was not at all impressed with the beach area... We were asked on arrival about doing the Time Share, we said no way and we were never bothered again, they had our room ready early and our friends room ready an hour later. Guess it all depends on occupancy... and time of arrival In my earlier review, I forgot to mention the Pirate Cruise we also attended, we had a great time. They have you singing and dancing , a really fun evening. The lobster and steak dinner is just ok..that cruise also leaves from Cancun. You can check out some of the tours on the net and get an idea of prices. They have a Travel Agency off the lobby and upstairs. Prices are about the same maybe a little cheaper on the net, but by booking them there you know you will get picked up..I think if I remember correctly tours do have to be paid there.. There isn't any money exchanged at the Resort. You sign for everything..check your bill carefully when leaving and try to keep a record...we were double charged and they immediately took it off...they have safe's for your personal belongings...

I must say that after reading the reviews in travel advisor before going I was bracing myself for some shortfalls in pretty much every category- but we were pleasantly surprised at how good his place was. It is pretty much a 5 star in the areas that count....service, accomodation and attention to detail. Here are some observations that may help you avoid some of the challenges that previous posts talked about: Airport/Arrival: The Cancun airport works at a very slow pace ( as does most of mexico). Relax, take your time and have something cold to drink while you wait for the luggage that seems to be delivered one bag at a time. One handler to actually pick up a case and 4 or 5 to watch. Don't use the machines for food or drink as it is very expensive. Once you have you cases, pass all the shysters waiving at you and arrange for a taxi at the desk just before the exit. Rates are fixed by zone and are posted. Our ride was $60 for the 4 of us. There are only two companies licensed to service the airport - if you take one of the offers from the shifty looking types be prepared for the time share lines. \"Your ride can be free amigos if you only promise to visit this (whatever) hotel for a presentation...\" We asked our driver to stop at a small store so we could pick up a few items for the room. The driver actually came in to make sure this went smoothly. There was no extra charge but we also tipped him well . Tips: Tipping was not expected but certainly appreciated. We saw no drop in service quality if we did not tip but given the avg mos. income for the staff at the resort is 1,500 pesos or $150 US they are grateful for anything extra. A tip of around 10 pesos is generous. Check-In: You can't check in before 5 pm although if the room is ready they will make allowances. The front desk staff are very professional and worked efficiently. The resort is cashless, everything is billed to your room and they take a visa imprint. Once they have processed you ( yes, you have to wear one of those stupid wrist bands), you are then handed over to the orientation folks( read time share people). We had already decided we would not participate in the \"presentation\" and expected to run the gauntlet to avoid this.......however, it was a non-issue as she pleasantly accepted our decline. She did outline the $60 credit and 15% discount but was not pushy. This became a $65 credit for all 4 of us. Rooms: we initially stayed in the Mayan Palace ( there are two resorts here with the other called the Grand Mayan - much more up-scale). The room was very good. Lots of space and very clean. We were there on a time share from another resort and this was a significant improvement over what we had bought. The room was almost directly across from the reception area - very convienient but I could see where some guests might be unhappy if they were shuffled off to the end buildings. I suggest you take some time with the front staff to try and make certain you get as close to the beach as possible. The first 3 buildings ( they run perpendicular to the beach to handle hurricanes better) still have some storm damaage and are are not yet open. Although our room was good the neighbours were not - a very loud and large family. The building is concrete but sound really travels. we asked to change rooms and were told that the only thing available was farther out and ground floor - not too good - but, amazingly, if we took advantage of the presentation, we could upgrade to the Grand Mayan. Ok, we were hooked by the offer and decided to dive in as long as it only tok the promised 90 minutes. we were told to wear a watch as they guaranteed this would be all it took. we upgraded immediately and put off the presentation for a couple of days. The Grand Mayan is as nice as promised. Two full bedrooms, full kitchen, tons of room, huge soaker tubs, massive balcony with a jacuzzi. Only problem was the jacuzzi's were not working as the elctrical was not fully repaired. We figured the time share spiel must be worth it. The Presentation: we dutifully arrived at the grandiose \"business centre\". Lining up to be processed, you need id and a credit card. First comes the pre-screening with your new best friend. we had George who actually turned out to be a decent sort of guy who claims a kill ratio ( ok, I should say closing ratio) of 40%. we did not help his stats. You and your new best friend then go to breakfast as part of the bonding process where you compare photos of your kids ( I'm not kidding , they pull out all the stops), then a short tour of the rooms and back to the presentation centre which now has been set up for your return and ultimate purchase. Its a classic closing routine where they start you out at $149,900 and eventually end up at around $7,000. Once you decline this you are ot free as Mr Good Cop arrives to let you know that they can still satisfy you by getting rid of those nasty maintenance fees for only $5900 ( cdn in this case). Its actually not a bad deal if you can take 22 weeks in 5 years at one of their 6 resorts. At the two hour mark we got up and left having completed our end of the commitment. It was not really that big a deal and we ended up with a credit for $125 ( two couples) and 15% off everything, including spas. Our savings ended up in the $100's of dollars. The Resort: The layout is expansive but there are always shuttles. We never waited much more than 5 minutes so the complaints about distance really are not worthwhile. There is still some hurricane damage. The beach restaurant is not open and there are small construction projects on the go everywhere. You hardly noticed them though. The pool area is amazing. 3 levels with many chairs available. No problems with getting one of these. There is a problem getting a Palapa ( thatched roof with either lounge chairs or a bed). These are high demand and you have to be there by 4am to nab one - if you are lucky. There are a number of people who sleep in the beds through the night ( of course, they are woken up at 5am when the sheets are changed). They are really comfortable but not sure if they are worth the effort. The rule is that you can't leave these things unattended for more than an hour - but the hotel does not enforce this and many people just throw down a few personal items and disappear for a few hours. They have these official looking types walking around taking notes about the use of the Palapas - looks good, means nothing. Beach: The beach is the only average part of the resort. They are trying to improve it by building artificial reefs and forcing more sand to the rocky areas - they have a long way to go. There is still a lot of storm damage to the north and south but it does make for interesting walks. The beach outside of the resort does have a lot of garbage but this seems fairly typical anywhwere n Mexico. To the North , about a half hour walk, is a great place to look for shells. To the South is Iberostar resort which has a far superior beach. I suggest if you want a sandy beach and water that you can play in that you walk there and use theirs. All beaches in Mexico are public and no one will try and stop you. Bugs: Not one bite. Not an issue. Shows: we only took in a couple. The Mexican Party night ( Thursday) was good and quite popular for $48 all-in for buffet and open bar. The show was very good and quite professinal compared to other resorts we have been to. Restaurants: There are 3 and all are very good. In fact the food was above average ( we were most recently in Cuba and this was a refreshing reminder of what a 5 star should be serving). the Italian restaurant was exceptional - wonderful atmosphere, live music that was more background than in your face, top-notch service and food. Great burgers at the pool restaurant. Two for one Happy Hours are at different times in different restaurants so check this out in the guides when you arive. Pool 11am-Noon, Cocktail Bar is 7pm-8pm etc. Playa del Carmen: Playa is a good spot to visit. Caters to tourists and has the usual trinkets and trash but fun to bargain for this anyway. Silver did seem to be the best deal. The beach is quite nice and we enjoyed a dip in the ocean. Getting there is easy. Shuttle to the front gate, walk across the highway and wait for the local bus. 10 pesos each. Great value for a dollar and you can take the same route back. Alternatively, you can accept the offers of the taxi drivers returning from the resort to Playa. They will take you for $2 each or even $5 for a carload as this off-sets there return cost where they would be going back empty. A cab from Playa to the resort is $18 from Wall-Mart - fixed tariff and no negotiating. take the bus. We stocked up on food for the room at wall mart but ended up not using it all as the prices are really quite good in the resort. Similar to prices in town. Trips: we only took the one to Xcaret ( ish-ca-ret). Its a huge complex that usually sees 5000 visitors a day but is now at around 2000 due to people staying away due to storm damage. we saw none to speak of. Great snorkling down an underground river, nice restaurants, aquarium, zoo etc. Avoid Mondays and Thursdays when the cruise ships are in. We booked at the hotel as they were cheaper than in town ( of course we got the 15% discount from the presentation). About $80 pp including a full buffet lunch, transportation and snorkling equip for the day. Return trip to airport: Don't use the shuttle at $15 pp. Ask the bell man to order a cab at a flat rate of $27. Much simpler and only takes 15 minutes for it to be there. Check-Out: Keep your receipts for what you signed for and match them up to your bill. They do make mistakes but are good at correcting them however if you don't have your copies you'll never remember. This is a very good hotel, well run and focused on keeping you happy. Get rid of the rocks on the beach, crank up the heat in the jacuzzis in the balcony and you have an exceptional place to spend some time. The people are great - we didn't find a negative one among all the ones we dealt with and I suggest some of the people who were overly critical in earlier posts are probably the same wherever they go. Too bad for them but don't let their negative approach to life affect your decision. Take the presentation as well. its not high pressure and the credit and 15% are worth it.

There were 4 couples all around 50 years old. 2 couples stayed in the Mayan Palace building 1 and 2 couples stayed in the Grand Mayan building 5 from Jan. 22- Jan. 29. Here are some hints: 1. Email the Mayan Palace Concierge and arrange for them to pick you up at the airport. It costs $15 each but you have someone waiting for you rather than having to run the gauntlet of taxi drivers when you exist the Cancun airport. 2. Try to get a room on the second floor of whatever building you are in. The ground floors of the buildings near the ocean you can tell had water from the hurricane. They smell moldy but are livable. 3. We tried taking the bus one day and after a 30 minute wait without a bus in sight we took a taxi. it costs $18 each way to Playa Del Carmen or Cancun so plan on spending some money to get around. 4. The shopping was very basic touristy stuff in Playa and Cozumel so don't plan on stocking up with jewelry. 5. The food was excellent at the resort including the snack bar restaurant. Try the tuna and of course the guacamole. We ate at the buffet once for the Mexican Festival. $48 per person for all the food and drink. It was fun but I'm not sure it was worth the $48. The only restaurant still closed is Tumtah and it was on the beach. The other three are open. Also check out the Tramonto Bar. It's a little like a martini bar in the building wiht the shops. 6. The restaurants in Playa were great. They give you the impression you are eating indoors but are really outside. Just enjoy. 7. We made a run to Walmart while in Playa for bottled water, beer, and margarita mixings. It was nice to have these in the room whenever we wanted them. 8. The beach at the resort is sandy but you can't stand in the water or swim. It is too rocky. This didn't bother us much since the pools are great. The beaches in Playa are nice. If you go to Cozumel most of the beaches are still closed. There sis apublic beach called paradise Beach that has a nice beach, a bar, a bathroom to change it so we spent some time there. 9. We took two tours: One day tour was to Xel Ha and Tulum combined. We got to Xel Ha and thought hey let's just float down the river on tubes and relax. How were we to know that the tide was coming in and with the wind against us it was a major accomplishment to make it back to the main buildings. If I was you I'd get a life jacket, snorkel, and just enjoy the water in the calmer bay. Then we took off to Tulum for a couple of hours. It was nice to see some ruins and they are impressive because they are right on the ocean. But they are much smaller than Chitzen Itzen. This tour included transportation and all the food and drink for the day. Second tour was to Isla Mujeres off Cancun. 90% of the hotels in Cancun are still closed so we decided to head to Isla. This was a blast. $70 for the entire day, transportation, food, drink etc. Isla has been damaged but their beaches are still great. Go there and enjoy. 10. Happy Hour in the pool bar is from 11-12 AM. I know its early but just do it. You will meet a lot of nice people and it's a blast. I had no problem with the longer walks around the resort but could see if you were in your late 60s-70s you may have some problem with the distances. We spent a lot of money getting to and from Playa with taxis so they sort of have you at the resort but it's worth getting away a few times. Overall I'd say it was a nice vacation and we enjoyed the resort. The staff was excellent with super clean rooms etc. Oh and the time share pitch: it was mentioned to us at check-in to attend a breakfast buffet for a 15% discount. We didn't feel like sitting through a hard-sell on vacation so we said we weren't interested. We had one more message left on our phone that week and we didn't respond. No one bothered us the entire week.

We are going back in May 2006 with several family members...and learned a few things from our previous trip. 1) Pack coffee. When we got there, the on-grounds store was out of coffee. We got a pot of coffee at one of the restaurants - and then went shopping that morning. If you pack it, then you'll have it that first morning before the shopping trip! 2) Pack granola bars, crackers - any snack that doesn't take up a lot of room in your luggage. This too will help that first morning before the shopping trip. We plan on packing some of those individually wrapped variety cerials...you can get milk at the store on-ground. 3) Pack at least 2-3 swimming suits! Since it's so humid, your suit will take some time to dry - and putting on a wet and cold suit is no fun! 4) Don't pack a lot of clothes. (We took far too many...) You don't need them. A few pairs of shorts and tops, your swimming suits, PJs and one nice outfit (for dinner at the Italian restaurant-which is excellent) is all you need. 5) DON'T go to the buffets at the pool (Saturday and Sunday nights). They are VERY expensive and not that good. They hook you in by starting them when everyone is checking in and hungry. Those were the MOST expensive meals we had on the grounds. 6) If you like to drink, figure out when the happy hours are (going on several times a day) and plan most of your drinking around those times. 7) By all means - if they offer you a sales pitch with a discount for all services - take it. It's about an hour of your time, generally a free breakfast and all you have to do is tell them NO. 8) Go shopping in Playa and Cancun...great deals.

At that time there was just the pool, the lobby and the appartments inbetween the lobby and the pool. The parking was in front of the lobby (where there are now new appartments). Like then we had a one bedroom appartment. I did not recognize much difference, just that the sofas were different and a little bit less comfortable. The resort has grown much in a few years, and seems still not finished. I remember finding the distance from the room to the pool a bit disturbing last time. Now we were even further away then the lobby from the pool and now we did not find it that much of a trouble. Mainly because there are small cars that transport you from where you are to where you want to be (basically). The amount of restaurants has grown (from one to now 3) and the quality is good. You can stay in the resort for the whole time if you like. The new parking place is really terrible and too far away (no transport from or to it). You especially notice this when you want to park in the evening (when you come back from Playa del Carmen or Cancun). People park not too great (far from each other, but not far enough to fit your own car). One night it rained, we could not find a spot to park. Then we wanted to park near the lobby (like another car seemed to have done also, later they said that car was broken... sure, at exactly that point. The day later it was gone to reappear later that week... probably again broken at exactly the same point). Employees said we could not park there and we should park at a parking even further away (not even on the map of the hotel). I refused to do so. I went to my room, went to bed, woke up an hour later to check the car and drove to the parking lot... still no space and a lot of rain. So I parked near the lobby. I did not want to walk 20 minutes in the rain because the design of the parking lot is so bad. Now for a positive remark: the hotel know maid service in the room, twice a day. From cleaning in the morning/day to finalizing the beds (for sleeping) in the evening. Then a new thing compared to 3 years ago: the animation. Good was that there were games and a movie. Not so great was the animation near the pool. It was basically loud and a bit vulgar (not 5 star). The guy that presents the whole stuff had a high factor of irritation. The 19 year old boy thought he was God's gift to women (and men) and found himself so great that he had to talk all the time to be the center of attention (\"ello m-ay f-whend. Lets dowit whan mo t-ay-me. Sea you lay-tewr elly-gay-tewr\"). The pool is immense and (much better then 3 years ago) it is heated. On the other hand, the pool is not very clean (you can not see that far away and there is lots of stuff present at the bottom of the pool, like leafs and sand). The food at the pool is good and reasonably priced. The main amount of tourists seems to come from: the USA, Mexico and Argentina. The beach looked better then 3 years ago, but not great. (Maybe because of the recent hurricane). The garden is nice, the scenics are nice. Because this is a resort of grand scale it has not highrise buildings, which makes the atmosphere better for relaxing (if the boy from animation would stop shouting in the microphone).", "Date": "January 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnetonka, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe the Negative Reviews, know the tricks\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4384767", "Content": "Stayed at the Mayan Palace Jan 13, 2006 - Jan 20, 2006.

Although we did frequent the happy hours at the resort, because there were 2 for 1's and the bar was hopping with people. I highly reccommend the 11 am happy hour at the pool bar. A great way to start the day. And for those that worry about the timeshare sales people, you should. I saw them in action. But when they called my room I was jumping at the chance to go sit through the pitch, mainly for a lesson in pressure sales, but when they discovered I was only 26 years old, the were quick to end the conversation. I guess they figure a 26 year old cannot afford a timeshare, well what if I was some millionaire trust fund baby, which I am not. They would of missed out. Not a big fan of Playa itself, so we stayed at the resort, because eating there was the same cost as eating in playa, and the food was just fine.

The competition for palapas is fierce, so get there early. The grounds are well-kept and are being repaired from the hurricane. Housekeeping is fairly good, though not entirely clean especially in the kitchens. The gym and spa both are excellent. Unfortunately, the most prominent building in the best location is the timeshare sales temple. Not much in the way of views from your unit unless you get one facing the lagoon. For us, the timeshare hustle at check-in was easy to wave off. Playa has many restaurant choices that are cheaper and tastier. Buy groceries at Chedrau, not Wall-mart - more local color and better choices. The complaints about long walks are exaggerations.

After the first sales inquiry was met with a firm \"we are not interested\" we were never approached a second time. Yes, there was some construction, but some of that was obviously still residual clean-up from hurricane damage. The lay-out of the hotel is unusual (units are lined up moving away from the beach into the golf course, reportedly to minimize potential hurricane damage), and it is true that there is a lot of walking, but for most Americans this should be a good thing. It was a big plus to have our own rental car. We left the hotel daily to sight-see and shop. We prepared most of our breakfasts and drinks in the room, using the very functional microwave, stove, and refrigerator. We greatly enjoyed hanging out in Playa del Carmen, with its pedestrian-friendly, low-rise architecture and great restaurants.

I have just returned from a 5-day vacation there and as a timeshare owner of the Mayan Palace Nuevo Vallarta, I was expecting the same level of service, luxury, and beauty as the Vallarta property. Unfortunately, Mayan Palace Riviera Maya doesn't even come close to its sister property for several reasons. First, and most importantly, is the beach. The reef in front of this resort is so full of rocks and seaweed that the water is completely inaccessible. Although the hotel has recently roped off a very small part of the beach for swimming, I saw only one or two people swimming in the water the entire week I was there. Most guests simply resign themselves to the fact that they will have to leave the resort to find a suitable beach. What's more, the view from the beach is of construction. Anywhere you look you will see construction, construction, and more construction! This is in stark contrast to the beach in Nuevo Vallarta which is absolutely stunning. If you care at all about swimming in the ocean on your vacation, DO NOT stay at this resort. Second, the layout of the resort is absurd. Since all of the buildings are built perpendicular to the coast, none of the units have views of the ocean. On one side you have a view of construction and on the other you see only weeds (which they call jungle). Even worse, there are over two dozen buildings which go so far back as to almost reach the highway. If you aren't fortunate, you could find yourself in one of these buildings which would mean either a 30 minute walk to the beach or having to ride the unreliable resort shuttle. Third, the overall feeling of this resort is one of chaos not relaxation. The design of this resort (unlike the one in Vallarta) has no charm or natural beauty. The bland architecture of the buildings (which seem to work in Vallarta)stands out like a sore thumb. The hospital like facades could not be more out of place in this beautiful part of the world. Talk about someone getting it wrong. Furthermore, the golf course is a disorganized mess. While there, we saw a couple demanding their money back. Finally, the pool. Sure the pool is huge, but it is so cold I could only stay in the water for a few minutes. In fact, there were so many kids and teenagers running around this place, I was hoping to get back to New York City where I could relax! The only, and I do mean only, saving grace to this resort is the spa. Their spa is simply the best. Between the jacuzzi, the massages, and its overall ambiance, I finally found a place within the resort where I could relax. If only the person who had designed the spa would have designed the entire resort! Suggestion: Since Mayan Palace Riviera Maya is such a bomb, here are some tips: stay in Playa del Carmen or Tulum. Playa del Carmen has several amazing hotels directly in front of beautiful beaches with white sand and clear water. The kind you'd expect from the Caribbean! Playa del Carmen also has smaller hip hotels, great restaurants, and a hot, sophisticated nightlife (the anti-Cancun)! The beaches are very much like those in the South of France with private beach clubs, waiter service, and lively crowds. For the best beaches in the area, you have to drive down the coast to Tulum. The beach is absolutely breathtaking. The rocky coastline, the enormous palm trees, the incredibly white soft sand, and the wonderful clear water make this the best beach I have ever seen! Tulum is perfect for couples wanting a romantic getaway. I would definitely recommend a trip to this part of Mexico, but NOT the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya!!!!!", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, IL", "Title": "\u201cExpensive-Excruciating Wait to Check-In\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4333099", "Content": "Not Good: Check-In Process, We waited 40 minutes in line and another 40 minutes with the staff member trying to find us a room.

The rooms were spacious, but ants had invaded the cabinets and were all over the dishes. They sent someone up to spray. Never cleaned out the cabinet. The next day, the ants were all over the microwave. They sent someone up to spray. I don't kow how someone could spend only $695 for a week stay. We paid $1750 for the master suite, plus food and drink for 5 nights. Buildings 16,17, 18 are a 1/2 mile from the pool or beach. Shuttles run but fill up fast, you have to wait for that shuttle to drop off guests and come back. The wait time is 10 to 15 minutes. Staff does nothing to prevent guests from reserving lounge chairs. At 9am the pool area is empty, yet all the lounge chairs have personal belongings on them. Lounge Chairs do open up by 3 pm. I wouldn't stay at this resort again. Good: We rented a car. With 5 people it made it convenient to get around. We planned day trips everyday with the exception of one day.

The material we read before leaving on the trip indicated that the police will pull you over to try and get some cash from you. We didn't experience any problems with this. Another problem cited that we didn't experience was buying gas. The attendant not clearing the previous sale. My husband always got out of the car. They cleared the pump each time.

(There is a 'golf-cart trolley' that will pick you up at the lobby and drop you off at the pool/restaurants.) I loved the walk. It is a nice winding path filled with vegetation and geckos. Walking combined with stretching class in the morning caused me to loose a few pounds on the trip. Coming back to the USA tan and thinner: An added bonus! Room: The rooms were nice. We left the maid a tip each morning and evening. They did a great job cleaning the room, and would leave us nice bonuses like a rose or some sort of candy. Also, upon entering our room we realized our microwave did not work. We called the front desk and we had a new microwave in less than 5 minutes. Service: It was amazing. Waiters knew our names after the first day. The staff would make you laugh and always had a fun story to share with our group. It was so wonderful to relax and have a friendly face ready to grab you a drink or take your order. I cannot think of a resort that has been so deeply concerned with customer satisfaction as the Mayan Palace. Trips: TALK TO THE TRAVEL AGENCY! 2nd floor of the lobby. They will plan everything. We took a day trip to The Isle of Mujerles (? not sure how to spell it) everything was planned out for us. We went snorkeling, a tour of the island on a golf cart, and to a Tequila Boat Party. We also took a taxi to Playa del Carmen. If you don't mind being at the mercy of a scheduled event, you don't need a rented car. The resort will make sure you get anywhere you want to go! Suggestions: The food at Del Largo is wonderful. We ate the steak/shrimp dinner while watching a show they call The Best of The Best. We also went to the Mexican Party. The Mexican Party is a great way to end the week. The food is wonderful and the service is superb. The show is cute and geared towards all levels from parents with young children, young couples (in their late 20's like us), to people celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. Also there is a grocery store on site with a small but nice selection of food. Products that are not imported are very inexpensive. Hurricane Info: 2 out of the 4 rest/bars were open as of the 23rd. It looked liked the 3rd rest/bar was opening very soon. The construction was hardly noticeable. Compared to the hotels in Cancun, the Mayan Palace was virtually unharmed. Maybe it was the fact that I had a week off from graduate school and work, or that is was spending an uninterrupted week with my husband and best friend... what ever it was, we all agreed heaven must be like laying in the sun with a drink in your hand at the Mayan Palace.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaver Dam, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cDon't go near it!\u201d", "Author": "Hilltraveler", "ReviewID": "UR4314737", "Content": "Well, I guess we are the biggest \"suckers\" of all time. We actually paid $250 for the priviledge of wasting 5 hours of our 5 day vacation at this disgusting place. We were asked at the airport what hotel we were staying at and then directed to Jesus for what we thought would be a taxi ride to the hotel. Instead he told us that this hotel in Playa del Carmen just \"wanted to get the word out\" since Playa is less well known than Cozumel. So if we just \"gave them 90 minutes of our time\" they would give us brunch and drinks just to tell our friends about the place. Also we could get a deal on the trip to Chichen Itza - $250 for 5 people, plus a free rental car for a day and the boat tickets to Playa. It sounded like a good deal to me, so we paid Jesus $250! We did get the jeep for a day and had a terrific time driving around the island and spending the day on the beach. My recommendation: bypass the guys at the airport; they are \"rip-off\" artists. Go straight to the taxis outside. Rent yourself a car and go nowhere near the \"Mayan Palace.\" It's a 1/2 hour taxi ride from anything; you are stuck way out in the country.

The cost of buying into the Mayan Palace resorts was $78,000, plus $630/year for maintenance, plus the cost of totally redecorating our suite every 3 years (he never said what that would cost, plus $149 - $189/week to stay in the hotels around the world that we could trade for our Mayan Palace time share.

It was our first stay after purchasing a time share two years ago. I actually remembered little about the place as it was under the first stages of construction when I purchased. We went with three teenagers and three adults. We found it to be very enjoyable overall. I usually despise having my room far from the ocean but here it was so pleasant, I didn't mind it at all. The walk, while extensive, was also almost enjoyable. The shuttles to and from the beach area and pool were frequent and we never waited longer than 5 minutes. My only complaint was no clocks anywhere! I never knew the time of day morning or night! Not such a terrible thing while on vacation but I missed activites and such since I did not have a watch. Wished we did more site seeing but relaxing was too appealing each day. Did visit Tulum. Had a excellent tour guide but without him it would have been a waste of time. He was well worth the $35 we paid for his expertise. Be sure to wear your swim suits if you do go to Tulum, as there is great swimming on the premises. I do love to swim in the ocean but the tide here is too rough and very rocky. I would definetly bring water shoes next time. The staff were more than accomodating and always always very pleasant. The people here are what we should strive to be like, always smiling, and seemingly content with life. Spent most evenings in Playa. Loved it there! We are all looking forward to returning and though the time share for us works I can definetly understand the turn off.

I took my wife, and my parents (ages 66 & 76). The resort is located about 40 minutes from Cancun, and about 15 minutes from playa Del Carmen, and is set on about 700+ acres, including three seperate blocks of rooms, two restaurants, pool, spa, and a golf course. The Good: The pool is marvelous, huge, and has two swim up bars. There is also poolside food and drink service from roving waiters. There are palapas around the pool, and some of them have queen size mattresses under them. Lying on your bed looking out over the pool while a waiter brings you a maitai is the height of hedonistic luxury! The spa is marvelous, very relaxing, and offers a wide assortment of services for both men and women, including a complete gym. The golf course is first rate as well. There is a good activities director, and plenty of planned activities for kids(and childlike adults). The staff was (with a few exceptions)absolutely marvelous, and incredibly accomodating. The first night, we ate at Del Lago, the nicer of the two restaurants. It was buffet steak and shrimp night, and I have to say that it was one of the top five meals I have ever eaten in my life so far! The (not so) bad: The rooms are acceptable, generic hotel room Quality Inn style, with two queen beds, bathroom, and balcony. Because of the way the resort is built, there are no oceanfront rooms, and our balcony faced a dirt road, a mud puddle, and then several miles of scrub jungle. Also, the balconies are too small to put a chair on. Due to the recent hurricane, there was a lot of reconstruction ongoing while we were there, but they seemed to be working as fast as they could to rebuild the grounds. There were three restaurants, but the hurricane took one. The other restaurant, Balche' was an acceptable place to eat, by the pool(stay away from the so called asian dishes). The beach will be wonderful when they pump the sand back onto it, for now, it is coral and lava, bring your swim shoes. The Ugly: The resort is ENORMOUS! you walk, and walk, and walk. My parents had a horrible time getting from one part of the resort to another. There is a shuttle, but it is sporadic, and only goes from the lobby to the rooms, or the lobby to the main gate. If you want to eat,go to the pool,spa,beach,boutiques,etc. you will walk, and walk, and walk... Did I mention that you do a lot of walking? ok, next. The resort is far enough away from town that you will need to take taxis(expensive:$18us to Playa, and $52us to Cancun) or rent a car(dangerous, they all think it's a NASCAR race, and they're drafting!)so most of your time(and money) is spent at the resort, and they take full advantage. I said earlier that the food and service at Del Lago is truly wonderful, and I didn't mind paying for it at all, I think $32us/each is good value for the money. What really ticks me off is paying $2.50us for a small bottle of water, or $3us for a can of coke, never mind $8 for a burger, or $30/day to use the gym and jacuzzi. It gives me the feeling that I'm a stupid gringo, a sucker, and I hate that most of all. By being budget conscious, we were able to limit our room tab to about $450/person for the week, but you could easily top a grand/person if you went full tilt. The resort is a time share, and they really hound you to go to their presentation. While we were at the presentation, one woman was so upset by the pressure of the sales pitch that she burst into tears, and had to leave the room. Pathetic.

We knew exactlly what to expect. The reviews on the Mayan Palace were extremely helpful and most of them accurate. My wife and I went there for our 10 year anniversary about 4 weeks after Hurricane Emily. The resort was in great shape considering what had happened. I was extremely happy with the resort and service. Here are the positives: top notch rooms; safe in room with lock; pool and pool bar food; helpful staff; plenfy of privacy; beautiful grounds; great food but read the negatives too. Here are the negatives: don't stay around resrot at night, not much to do and mosquitoes will get you; they spray for mosquitoes which is a good thing, but you'll still need some spray on if you don't want bites; eat in Playa del Carmen (no mosquitoes to deal with); all restaurants at resort our open air except for one which means more mosquito bites; big resort so getting to the front gate takes 15 minutes. Things to know: take buses or express vans to Playa or Cancun. Just go to the front gate and catch one on the main road, very cheap and clean and safe. Cancun is worth going to for a full day but don't do more than one day b/c the trip is a long one. Playa is the best place to go for food and shopping and swimming and snorkeling trips. The chichen itza ruins are not worth the trip. The actual ruins are great to see but the trip is too long and the bus only stops once for non-native shopping. We saw some cool, little authentic towns on the way that could have really used our tourist money on some \"real\" shopping, but the tour bus only stops at a shopping zone designated for tourists so it was not real shopping. We went to Playa or Cancun 5 out of the 7 nights and 3 out of the 7 days. The resort pool staff is a lot of fun with the games and dancing stuff. Apply sunscreen about every hour or you'll get fried. I still got plenty dark with lots of sunscreen. The beach at the resort is great for lounging and looking for shells and fossils but don't try to swim, too rocky. Timeshare sales: One thing I knew not to do was go to the timeshare sales pitch. Every review I read was telling me not to do it, but guess what. My wife wanted to upgrade to a bigger room so we did it ... and it wasn't bad. It will take about 2-3 hours of a morning but it was worth the upgrade and the 15% discount for the week. It was high pressure but as long as you are nice they will be nice. We just kept saying no and after about 4 different sales people, we were out of there.

Our \"90 minute\" presentation took over four hours, and as many times as we said \"no,\" they kept sending us to one other person who would just \"fill out some paperwork\" and let us resume our vacation. But \"one other person\" kept turning into more and more people who kept making more and more offers. Their marketing techniques were carefully scripted and very clever. We finally succumbed to what seemed like a pretty good offer, but still had nagging doubts afterward. Fortunately, we went on the Internet back at our hotel and saw all the comments from people who had been scammed. We reread our contract and realized we had a five day period to cancel everything. We actually managed to do this, but it was a time-consuming, frustrating ordeal, filled with unreturned phone calls and suddenly unfriendly people. I could go on with more ugly details, but just take my word for it, AVOID THE TIME-SHARE PEOPLE AT THE MAYAN PALACE. Oh, by the way, that free trip to the Mayan ruins?

In spite of the recent hurricane that devestated the area, the Mayan Palace has bounced back admireably. The rooms at the Mayan Palace are large and well-appointed. We stayed in a 1 bedroom unit (1179). The MP units are spread out from the beachfront to the end of the golf course, as Mexican laws governing the Riviera forbid buildings over three stories outside of Cancun. It's a bit of a walk to the beach and pool, but it's a pleasant one. There are shuttles that run continuously from the lobby, so you can cut the walk in half if you wish. The rooms are equipped with a kitchenette (no oven, but they do have cooktops, small fridge, microwave, blender, utensils, pots pans and plates, cups and glasses.) The bathroom is large, with private commode, double sinks, large shower/tub, and another sink for makeup outside the bathroom. The bedroom is large with walk-out viewing balcony, TV, large closet and dresser. The bed is king-sized, and comfy, if a bit firm. The living room has to sofas that double as single beds. The TV is flat screen plasma. No DVD player, but there are numerous cable channels. The units that are open have been renovated since the storm, and virtually all remnants of the destruction have been erased. Outside the room, however, the jungle is still recovering. What once was probably a pleasant view of greensward is now a little wilder-looking. The grounds are being renovated continuously, with many new palm trees being planted in place of the destroyed plants. While we were there, we saw at least two dozen new trees planted (with great effort by the staff - those trees are huge!) Two restaurants were open during our stay - El Lago and Balanche. Tumtah was wiped out by the storm and will take some time to rebuild. Brio was also destroyed, but is being renovated quickly. The bar that was located in the same building as Brio is also closed. The convenience store is open (but the prices are pretty high, so advise going in to town for any serious grocery shopping). We ate at both restauants several times. Balanche is great for less extravagant dining - mostly sandwiches, wraps, and salads. El Lago is a large buffet with several stations for freshly prepared pasta or Mexican fare - depending on the night's theme. Watched a fun fiesta show there one night. Bring a sweater - it can get a bit breezy in the open air restaurant. The pool is fully functional, and as of this writing, most of the palapas should be rethatched. For kids, the pool and beach are the place to be, with tons of activities - water aerobics, games, dance lessons, yoga, crafts, and just goofing around with new friends. For adults, the pool is big enough that you can relax with your frozen Pina Colada and not worry about whether the kids are bored. The beach is divided into a rocky section and a sandy section. The sandy part is huge, but a little further down. The dive shop had just reopened during our stay, so we had to go into town for our dives (got a little expensive with the taxis - about $18/one way). Speaking of town, Playa del Carmen seems relatively unscathed by the storm, except for some of the resorts that fronted directly on the beach. Even that damage is sporadic - one resort with a collapsed clubhouse borders another with virtually no discernable damage. Go figger. Service at the Mayan Palace was impeccable - twice daily maid service, front desk staff, concierge, etc. were all helpful and efficient. Besides the hurricane renovation, the MP is also constructing a new main entrance that promises to match the magnificence of its other properties. Fortunately, the construction site suffered little damage from the storm. Overall, if you've prepared for a vacation and are wondering if you should still go - don't hesitate!

Do this beforetime if possible from U.S. Note on local Playa del Carmen policia- We were singled out from a line of traffic all doing the same speed about 3 miles north of Playa--AVIS sticker??-- cop tried to keep my license and tried to convince me that it would cost me $100 US. to get it back from the police station the next day, but was willing to settle for a $50 bribe. We settled at that price but I was later told 1)do not tell the cop that you are from any of the upscale hotels 2)do not let the cop see your wallet and inform him that $10 is all you have. Somewhere between $10 to $20 should suffice. Note on Pemex at Puerto Morelos- Overcharged for gas not actually pumped. Reset the pump so I was not able to verify the amount pumped. Paid $10 too much. Extra items to bring from home-soft cooler and ice paks,ziploc bags,flashlight,umbrella,favorite seasonings,teflon frying pan,butter(do not like the Mexican varieties),snorkel and fishing equip. Food/Booze shopping-in Cancun Walmart,Sams Club,Costco,Chedraui supermarket in Playa Sams Club and Chedraui (both at extreme south end of town) Other places to eat- 5Th Ave in Playa, also had excellent meals at Porto Bello (Italian) in Puerto Morelos and also the Asian restaurant there. The owner Andrew at Porto Bello fixed my own caught fish and it was excellent. Also the Tumtuh rest. at the Mayan Palace will do the same-compliments to both. Other comments- If you are in to fishing, small bucktail jigs tipped with shrimp fished from the beaches will catch you dinner;also caught tarpon, ladyfish, and jacks. Buffet meals were $26-$30pp and because one of us eats lightly was not a good value. Free excellent nightly entertainment with 2 for 1 drinks afterwards. Water in the room is potable but we were advised to drink bottled water. Purchased 10 litre bottles from Walmart for $1.25 and refilled smaller ones as needed. How you are treated by the sales agents depends on the individuality of the agent, but the free buffet breakfast, 15% off the entire bill, and whatever else you may bargain for to listen to their spiel may prove worth it. The Del Lago buffet was worth $17pp. Still a problem with inconsiderate guests hogging the beds and shaded palapas all day;management is trying to control this but it is proving to be a difficult task. Nicer,sandy beach walking past the point to the south towards Iberostar resort. Other nice areas to visit- Puerto Adventuras,Akumal for nice beach and fantastic snorkeling from the beach plus beachside restaurants, Pirate Assault or Captain Hook pirate ships in Cancun, daytrip to Cozumel or to Isla Mujeres(take the ferry from Pto.Juarez for a $7 round trip) The suites have small refrig.,toaster,blender,coffee maker,pots,dishes,etc. Useful if staying for more than a week or if looking to cut down costs overall. Hurricane Wilma assessment- Winds exceeding 165mph and torrential rain took its toll on all aspects of the resort,including destruction of Tumtuh and Del Lago,int.sales bldg.,most rooms and buildings with different severity of wind and water damage due to complete deastruction of palapas and flooding of hallways into the rooms and seepage of water from above into ceilings and walls below, severe black mold problem,limited electricity and water from generator power, loss of lots of sand from the beaches,pool inundated with debris,total destruction of all landscaping,pieces of buildings missing,etc. On the positive note- We were treated like VIP's during and after the hurricane by management and the entire staff. Under a Cat 5 hurricane, we always felt very safe. Mayan Palace was the place to be; they even provided us with 3 hot meals and snacks a day, free transportation via busses when int. flights became available, free rooms when they were worked on and cleaned and became safe once we were able to get out of the shelter. and even a small band and an accordian player to elevate our moods.

First let me say, we had a wonderful time. We have been to NV and love the Grand Mayan there. We stayed in the Grand Mayan building 6 which is closer to the pool area. Of course all of the Grand Mayan rooms are the same. We found it very clean and wonderful. We were in room 2495. The resort is very large. Much larger than we had expected. You will do alot of walking at this resort. But you will have a beautiful walk. You must wear bug spray at night or they will eat you up. We saw plenty of iganas(spelling) during our stay.The pool area is very nice. It is the largest pool I have ever been too. Bigger than NV. They have the huts around the pool which are nice. It is very hard to get one of the beds under the huts. I even got out to the pool area around 7:15 and almost all were already gone.But we did find a hut with a table and chairs under it and we got this spot in between the pool and the beach. That was the perfect spot for us as we all like to look and sea the ocean. The beach was nice but as you enter the beach it is very rockie.They are within the next few months going to put much sand on the beach. When it is finished it will be very nice. If you walk to the right for a short piece you can enter without all of the rocks. Wear water shoes. They have their own coral reef just out in the ocean. It makes it nice to just go from the pool and go out and snorkel. We had our own equipment but you can rent it at the shack if needed. The landscaping all around the resort is pretty. There is a small market at the resort. High prices. We went into PDC to do our grocery shopping. Walmart will be open very soon there. Food--It was all good. We ate breakfast in our rooms most mornings. We went to the buffet one morning. $15.00 per person. Very good but I don't eat that much. Room service is very good and at good prices. Pizza was good. Balache is very good. It is around the pool. We also ate at Tumtah. Excellent food. Reasonable prices. You can eat cheaper in PDC but this is a resort. The walk never bothered any of us, neither did the fumigation for the bugs. Remember you are sitting in the middle of the jungle at this resort. The shopping places at the resort are nice but expenive. They are finishing an indoor pool and 2 more places to eat. They are moving all of the shops around the indoor pool. They are turning the shops and the market into a large grocery store. This will be very handy. The activities guys were great. (Jonathon, Jonathon, Carlos and there were 2 more.) Just look for the guys in the yellow shorts. Our girls really liked them. Always something going on at the pool. Music, crazy games, games on the beach, bike rides, exercises. Something for everyone. They are also beginning to build the water park. I have been to them before at other Mayan Resorts. They are nice. If you need transportation just call 4188. They will be right over. They are not finished with all of the transportation yet either. If you go into PDC take the Playa Express. You can go for one dollar (usd) and two $ back. Much cheaper than a taxi. You can also take the public bus. Both are very safe. Us girls went into PDC one night by ourselves and were not scared or bothered. I didn't like Cancun. You have to go see the ruins. Chichen-Itza was great. I climbed it but didn't think I would make it down. Very scary. Had a great time. Very relaxing. Will return again in a few years when everything is finished.

We stayed at the Mayan Palace in Acapulco and in Nuevo Vallarta last year and they were much nicer. Had we not stayed at the other resorts, we probably would have liked the Mayan Palace PDC better. The resort is beautiful, but not the nicest we've seen. The layout is pretty bad, as you have to walk 15 minutes to get the the pool or restaurants, which can be a real pain. We did have a long walk (our unit was even past the lobby) but our room was newer and nicer than the units closer to the pool. We did have an electricity problem one night, but I suppose it could happen anywhere, so I won't hold the resort responsible. We spent pretty much every day at the pool, which is beautiful. We had fun at the swim up bar and had some pretty good lunches from Balche. Granted, as other people have mentioend, the food is not cheap, but it's resort priced and you get decent sized portions. We ordered room service alot and found most of the food to be pretty good, with a few exceptions. We had one dinner at Tramontos that was excellent. We weren't overly hungry so we split an appetizer (portobello mushrooms coated and fried with polenta), an excellent salald with mushrooms and artichokes, and the pasta with seafood. I also had a cup of minetsrone soup. Everything was really tasty. We went with the hotel into Cancun one night to La Boom. We had a great time and the place was $35pp open bar. They have a hip hop room on one side and another room that plays great house music. The only thing that stinks is the $40, 40 minute cab ride back to the resort. We only went into Playa once, but wished we had gone more. The town is so cute with tons of bars and restaurants to choose from. We had a fabulous surf and turf dinner, 2 ceasar salads and a decent bottle of wine and after dinner drinks for about $120. The bars there are also A LOT cheaper than the resort. A round of a margherita and Captain and coke was like $6. You will pay about that for one drink at the resort. So overall, the trip was very nice and relaxing.

The resort grounds and pools are absolutely beautiful. I must admit I was a little concerned when I read some of the other reviewer\u2019s comments regarding the resort, they are not true this place is great. Our room was located in the Grand Mayan, only a 4 minute walk to the pool and beach. The pool is enormous. It is actually three pools that cascade into one another. We spent a great deal of our time in, and lounging around, the pool. The pool temp was about 88 degrees, which was about the same temp and the Caribbean Sea this time of year. The swim-up bars, there are two, were a hoot. We made sure to get our topical fu-fu drinks every day at the swim up bar from 11:00\u201312:00 during happy hour, they are two-for-one priced. The restaurants were also very good and reasonably priced for what you get. We especially enjoyed Taramoto\u2019s. We mentioned to Maiter De that it was our ninth wedding anniversary and they really made us feel special. We took 3 day-trips during our stay. We spend one entire day in Cozumel and loved it. We rented motor scooters and toured the island, stopping along the way to eat at a lovely beach side restaurant, where we dipped our toes in sea as we sipped on some cold drinks. We then proceeded on to Playa Corona beach were we spent the afternoon snorkeling. We spent another day touring the Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza, you have to see this, it was amazing. We also took an afternoon drive into the city of Cancun. We were not very impressed with Cancun proper. It\u2019s a big city with one strip of American hotels. Cancun is not a very clean city, we saw a lot of trash on the street and it was noisy.

The lay out of this resort is very strange you have to walk quite a ways to get to anything especially if you have a room close to the entrance of the resort(I have attached a photo of the lay out) The beach is at one end and the golf course is at the other and the rooms are in the middle with no views of either. The resort explanation of the rooms being so far back from and not facing the beech is hurricane and storm protection they did not want to incur high cost for repairs in case of storms but atleast they can put a resturant closer to the rooms instead of making guest walk almost to the beach. The rooms are nice but its marble through out and gives off a cold steril noncomfortable feeling. The hallways are marble also and with the humidity there was always wet floor signs posted. They spray for bugs every evening and since I had a room on the 1st flr it constantly smelled of bug spray so if you go buy incense or candles. The resturants have a limited menus and please make reservations for the feista early cause it sells out quick. The only activities there are some pool games anything else you have to pay for including the gym, I have never been to a resort where you have to pay to use the gym I'm not talking about special classes like spinning or aerobics but you have to pay just to walk on the treadmill of lift a hand weight. Only one resturant serves breakfast and it is the furthest one so you can get your morning workout walking to get your food. Finaly this is one of the most expensive resorts I have been to they marked up some items as much as 40% over what I have seen in town so buy your gifts elsewhere. The staff was great that is the only thing I found to be excllent about this resort everyone was nice with smiles and was eager to help but all were also looking for tips we receive a envelope from the day and the night house keepers asking to fill out the enclosed comment card but no cards were in the envelopes and hand written on each were requests asking for tips. I will never goto this resort ever again I went to a timeshare tour and they were so rude when I told them I did not want to buy that they turned me off to all Mayan Palce resorts.

(we were there the week of 9/25....it was NOT busy). We were willing to pay for a reasonable upgrade. My husband & I had to sleep in 2 separate full size beds during the week. #5 - during the week, when asked if we could get a mini refrigerator - front desk said none were available. #6 - in room safe malfunctioned 5x during the first 4 days of our stay. each person who came to 'fix' the problem was very helpful, however it was never really fixed. Finally - the entire safe was replaced. Only after discussing our unhappiness, did the manager allow us a free breakfast ($30 US - we were just 2 people). #7 - there is a much advertised 2 for 1 drinks at their special bar (martini's seemed the specialty) - when we arrived, we were told that the 2 for 1 drinks applied only for 'well drinks' only. I did however order the $9 martini (that does not include the mandatory 10% tip which is added to ALL purchases) - & the drink was only 3/4 filled in the glass! FYI - In the AM, two coffee's to-go cost $7.50 US w/tip. #8 - expect the A/C units to cool - but not to remove the humidity (not unlike most of the resorts we've been to in the Yucatan). #9 - HUGE pool - great beach. Just expect the beach to be rocky (as much of the Yucatan is) - so be prepared & bring your foot gear. #10 - yes, there is construction going on - but I don't see how that would disrupt your vacation. Most is going on away from the pool areas. #11 - before you even have a chance to put your bags down, during the check-in process, your will be presented with an RCI time-share sales pitch. If you say no (as we did - you will be left alone). If you say yes, they will upgrade your room to the Mayan Palace - just expect your room to be even further away from the pools, beach, restaurants etc). #12 - Food in the restaurants was very good. Property was very clean. #13 - I'm sure that mayan palace will be 'under construction' for at least another year - there is great vision for what it can be. #14 - don't miss Xcaret when you visit the mayan riviera!

My husband and I stayed there the week of September 11-18 for our honeymoon (we used an RCI week). After we'd booked (it was the only Mayan Riviera that RCI had when we booked months before) I came on Trip Advisor and was shocked by the negative reviews. However, we decided to make the most of it...and the Mayan Palace was a really nice place. Okay, so it's a big concrete hotel like all of the resort hotels there (not our usual speed), but we didn't expect anything else as that is the nature of resorts. We were only bothered once by the timeshare people at check-in. In the end, we were promised a 15% discount on all hotel purchases (food, drinks, tours), a $30 credit toward our bill, and a room upgrade (and free breakfast) in exchange for 90 minutes of our time. We told them we weren't buying and they said it was fine. When we went, we got lucky enough to have a new salesperson who wasn't very aggressive. In the end, we stayed for two hours (another guest warned us they took four hours!), mainly only because we asked questions. If you don't ask any questions and say, \"NO\" then I'm sure you can be out in less than two hours. Anyway, after the presentation, we were not asked again about timeshares. Doing the presentation was good because we saved quite a bit on the food and tours we took. The main disappointing thing was that there isn't a Mexican, Mayan, or Yucatan restaurant on the premises! The Italian place, Tremonto, was very good (even my Milanese husband liked it), as was the Balche Bar evening buffet. There was one night when the Vista del Lago restaurant had a Mexican buffet, supposedly for Mexican Independence Day. For our ticket price, we got unlimited drinks, a fantastic buffet, and entertainment. (Oh, and some small souvenirs.) It was fun. The cheapest on-premises food option, believe it or not, is room service (there's a regular menu or a pizzeria that delivers decent pizza). We booked two tours at the hotel: Chichen Itza and Tulum. Chichen Itza was great; we got lucky and most of the guests were from our hotel (only one other hotel had guests on board), and everyone spoke English (so we didn't have to listen to a tour in three or four languages). After a stop at a tourist trap spot (ostensibly for a bathroom break), we took a brief stop at a cenote for a swim, then had a buffet lunch. We got to Chichen Itza in the afternoons and it was great. The Tulum trip was awful. Rent a car! We were gone for nearly eight hours, only a couple of which were spent actually at Tulum (which is beautiful). The tour guide was really bad. Other than the tours and a couple of trips into Playa del Carmen (we braved the dash across the four lane highway and took public transportation...only a dollar each, but running across the highway was scary and the buses were crowded) we stayed at the hotel. It was slightly off season so the pools were not crowded. We did find the coral beach hard to swim in, though we wore our \"shower shoes\" one day and did go in. We were rewarded when we found ourselves swimming with a sea turtle! While others complained about hiking through the jungle to get to the pools, we found our walk from the Grand Mayan (the new hotel) pleasant...the path is wide, well-lit, and well-cared for. If you're lucky, you'll catch glimpses of the resident crocodiles or iguanas as you walk. And the main reason the hotel rooms are set so far back is for hurricane safety, by the way! We asked! The pool itself is gorgeous. Yes, it is shallow, but hotel pools usually are. All of the staff were very friendly and polite. The service was excellent, the room great (jacuzzi bath!) and the air conditioning in the rooms was fine (except when it went off for 24 hours after a tropical storm).

After a very arduous ten hour flight from the UK we were met by our pre booked mini bus. After checking in we were met by the expected time share sales woman, too tired to listen we agreed to talk later by telephone. The first hurdle was quickly over on entering our room, a superb one bedded apartment with kitchen the air con was fine and very welcome. As it was dark we had no idea of our prospective view. We did comment that if anyone on a budget needed to use the cooking facilities it may be limited; however for us it was no problem. We rose with the sun and our second hurdle was mounted, a magnificent view over the second green of the golf course and the jungle beyond. The first visit too the pool did not disappoint the biggest and best we have had the pleasure to sit around. Yes it is a fair walk from some accommodation and the main reception but it is fair to say that we Brits have a tendency to walk more than our Trans Atlantic cousins and the walk through the gardens was a delight. There is regular transport to the pool, restaurants and main gate for the less able but be patient you are on vacation. The beach area was much better than we expected the sand in front of the resort is fine with sun beds and hammocks. It is possible to enter the sea which was very warm as we did many days just don\u2019t expect to swim long stretches. It is possible to walk a good distance in both directions and as it borders the jungle we found plenty of strange wild life. With evidence of recently hatchet turtles having found some which did not make it. The food on the resort is top class we ate on the resort most evenings, the Tramonto (Italian) restaurant is in a class of its own just go and try it. The best value is the Largo buffet breakfast from served from 7-12am. The staff were excellent working through into the night constantly cleaning and whole resort. From the concierge to the night maid all were very friendly and not the \u201chave a nice day friendly\u201d but a genuine greeting which helped make our holiday a special one.

There is nothing negative we could say about our two weeks even the tropical storms we had we enjoyed. The mosquitoes like crows we didn\u2019t see; yes we were bitten but no worse than our holidays in Europe. We visited Chichen Itza, swam with dolphins at Xel Ha and spent days in Playa del Carmen.

When we checked in was the only time we were bothered by time share people at the resort and the subject was never brought up again during our stay. Our room was only a 2 minute walk from the pool area, and despite what others have said only a 5 or 6 minute walk from the front desk. I guess most people are so lazy the thought of walking a few minutes really turns them off,true the weather was hot and humid during our stay, but the walk was not that bad. The only bad thing I can say was that at Playa Del Carmen the timeshare people were really nasty.My wife and I looked foward to a nice peaceful day there only to be totally irratated by these individuals who refused to leave us alone.One of these guys started to yell at me because I did not speak Spanish,he asked if I was Mexican and I said yes,then he proceded to scream at me because I was not fluent in Spanish. The thing that really got me off was these people all worked for the Mayan Palace and we told them we were staying there and showed them our wristbands, but they refused to leave us alone to shop around in town. We ended our day early at Playa and went back to Mayan Palace to relax by the pool. We did take a handful of trips during our stay and buyer beware,pay the extra price and purchase the trips through the hotel.We bought a trip from a timeshare person and got lied to and basically ripped off from this guy.He talked us into purchasing a trip with him,he said he would save us 40 dollars per person and we would have the same trip the hotel offers only with a Mexican company, later on we discovered thet the savings was only 10 dollars per person. The next morning we were out in front of the resort waiting for the tour bus,that we were told would pick us up at 7am with 5 other people who got talked into this trip, only to be picked up at 8am and were driven to Playa Del Carmen. When we got there we were met by 3 or 4 people who worked for this company who promptly asked for the balance we owed on our trip. After we paid the balance these people scattered like cockroaches,we never saw them again and another person showed up and told us to follow him to a bus stop. He left us there and said a bus would arrive soon to take us to Tulum and then to Xel-Ha for the day.He too never came back,and we all stood there like fools until one of us asked another person when the bus would coming,he told us the bus had left and that was the only one going to our destination.We looked at one another and figured we got took,a couple of us went looking for someone from this company and found a person who we voiced our displeasure to and he got us a driver and took us to Tulum. This boy ended up being a 17 yr old Mayan ,who this company stuck us with to be our guide for the day. We never caught up with the group we were supposed to be with and our trip to Tulum and Xel-Ha was cut short because these guys wanted to get back before the traffic got too heavy. My wife and I were lucky because she is fluent in Spanish,but one of the couples with us was not so they looked to us to translate for them to find out what was going on.So be careful who you plan trips with. All the other excursions we took were great...we spent the day at Isla Mujeres which was fantastic, all you can drink and eat at a private beach for 60 dollars a person,which was beautiful and relaxing,and for 12 dollars more we snorkled at a beautiful area just a short boat ride away.We also went to Xcaret ,where we snorkled and explored the park for the entire day.If you go there dont miss the show at night it was an awesome sight and something I'll not soon forget. We took the ferry to Cozumel and stayed at Mr. Sancho's beach for the day where we both got a great massage and had a bite to eat.Great afternoon!! The Mayan Palace was a beautiful resort and the employees were very kind and helpful,everywhere I looked someone was cleaning or sweeping to make this place look nice and tidy. The pool bar was a nice place to hang out and waste the day away,Franklin was alot of fun and a great bartender also,he remembered our names after only one day there. We went to the Mexican show and had a wonderful time there...the food was great and the show was entertaining. We ate at the breakfast buffet one day and I have to say it was one of the best brunches I've ever had. It had a lil of everything and it was all good and fresh. We also ordered room service every day and for the price it was a bargin, hot coffee and pan dulce for around 10 dollars,and you cant beat that. One morning we had breakfast in our room and for about 5 dollars a plate we had a nice hot meal the was well worth the price. I would love to go back to stay here...true it was a distance away from everything but we didnt mind the cost of the taxis or the time it took to get into town. The grounds were beautiful and it was away from the hustle and bustle of the cities, which we enjoyed.

This was our third time at this resort, first time without our children and other family. Upon checkin everything was perfect, we asked for a room on the third floor but received one on the second floor, it was great anyway. We did not bring bug spray and only got a couple of bites, wasn't that bad at all. Just make sure your windows and doors are closed when they are fumigating. We drove to Chichen Itza, we rented a car for the day and did this so we could go very early. It was fantastic, hardly anyone was there yet. We didn't really get bothered by bugs there either. We spent some time in Playa, just tooks taxis, it was fun as well. My take on this resort is, if you are going to Mexico to see Mexico and relax, this is the place for you. I am very overweight and had no problem with the walking we had to do to go to the pool each day. We are also early risers, so we got a bed by the pool everyday and we didn't just throw our stuff on the bed and go away, we stayed. We used the services at the pool quite often. We also used the spa (Brio), it was absolutely incredible. My husband got 3 massages, I got a facial and manicure and a pedicure. I fell asleep when getting the facial, so I was pretty relaxed. The beach isn't as good as other places, but I love the Mayan Riviera so this didn't bother me. I knew what it would look like. As for the construction it did bother me at one point during the day, there was a backhoe on the beach moving sand, the next day we just moved to a different part of the pool and we didn't hear a thing. Seems like the simplest thing to adjust a little to enjoy your time more. We had a fantastic time. This timeshare is owned by one of our parents and still we were not even approached by a timeshare rep. Someday I would like to own our own, we love it in Mexico and I enjoy the Mayan Palace resorts. So to all of you people that have them and don't want them, perhaps you should find us people that want them.

The Grand Mayan 2 bedroom was the best timeshare unit we have experienced. Luxurious, large and a dipping pool right on the enormous balcony. Yes, the resort is big, but exercise is good for everyone. The majority of timeshare resorts are situated this way. We will definately go back when they are finished with the resort.

In July I reserved a week at the Mayan Palace, trading a timeshare week we had banked with RCI (we own a timeshare in St. Maarten). Then Hurricane Emily hit the Cancun area which made me nervous. Worse yet, in August I discovered tripadvisor and read some pretty horrible reviews about the resort in which guests complained about everything from the views to the food to the lack of air conditioning in the hallways to the unusable beach to the 3.5-ft. depth of the pool to the \"crow\" mosquitos to the timeshare sales vultures, etc., ad nauseum. Without telling my wife, I booked a back-up hotel in Playa del Carmen in case we found the Mayan Palace as dreadful as some of those who have reviewed it did. Here's what I have to say after having just returned from a week. The Mayan Palace is world class in every way, a gem. We would go back in a heartbeat. Yes, the resort is spread out over many acres. Those who want to be directly on a beach should rent a room in a Cancun high-rise hotel. But, if you like to go out on your balcony and see wild parrots nesting in the treetops of the jungle a few feet away -- a thrilling sight--the Mayan Palace is for you. Yes, the pool is no more than 3.5 ft. in depth. But, it's spread out over six acres -- six pools interconnected by waterfalls and fountains, looking out over a turquoise beach. It's the most spectacular pool I've seen anywhere. The hallways aren't air-conditioned because the architect didn't design them to be hermetically sealed -- there are open doorways, Caribbean-style, at either end to allow the breeze. (But the individual units, which are beautifully furnished in lime-green and orange with granite kitchens and marble baths, are perfectly air-conditioned.) My wife is severely allergic to mosquito bites. She had no problems becuase she applied repellent. I didn't even bother and received one bite as a result. Lunch is great at both the pool and beach restaurants (you can, if you wish, have a waiter bring your lunch from the restaurant to your chaise lounge by the pool or on the beach) and the Italian restaurant (the name escapes me) is extremely elegant (and oddly decorated in in an \"Indiana Jones\" motif) and the food is beautifully prepared and presented (and not even that expensive -- dinner for two with appetizers, entrees a $40 bottle of wine, tax and tip came to $90). Service overall is oustanding -- employees greet you in the (open air) hallways with an \"hola,\" service in the restaurants and at the front desk is impeccable. A word about the timeshare salespeople: When you check in, you will be greeted by attractive people (mostly American) holding clipboards who will ask your name and check it off a list. Though they hope to give the illusion that they are facilitating your check-in, they are NOT with the hotel, they are timeshare salespeople (e.g. \"vultures\"). After you check in, they will come up to you, hand you information about things to see and do around the area, casually announce they are having a free breakfast and ask which of two mornings you plan to attend as if it's a requirement that you do. Say \"neither\" firmly. Tell them you are on vacation, you refuse to sit through a presentation and have no interest in buying a timeshare, and be on your way. That's the last you'll hear from them. Now, if you have read this far, you know what I think: The Mayan Palace is a find. Go without hesitation, don't expect to be on the beach (which, I must admit, the resort's detractors are right about -- it's beautiful but the reef renders it unswimmable), enjoy the nature surrounding you and the friendly helpful staff and relax. (My wife enjoyed a spa treatment she said was world-class, for far less than she would pay in the U.S.) My last piece of advice is this: Rent a car. The Mayan Palace is 15 minutes north of Playa del Carmen. A car frees you to drive into town to Fifth Avenida and partake of its great restaurants every night as we did (except for the night we enjoyed the Italian restaurant at the hotel.) You might otherwise feel stir-crazy after the first three or four days. Hope you enjoy yourselves as much as we did.

We spent everyday at the pool and did not find it to be a problem. They are still adding thatched shaded areas, a huge activities area with another pool, and other things. In other word, IT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Although the negative reviews acknowleded this, they did not seem to give it any credence in their experiences. I was not bothered around the pool anymore than I would have been anywhere else. The pool was kept clean. Several days, I saw a guy in the pool with the cleaning net. I read a lot of the negative reviews before I went and decided that the complainers are either 1) complainers about everything no matter where they are, 2) not very well traveled, 3) given a week for FREE by someone , or 4) have very unrealistic expectations from somewhere. The staff was falling all over themselves to help anytime I asked. Maybe some people have a chip that shows through when they ask for things - I don't know. We sometimes create our own problems. I would bet that these people have the same problems everywhere they go. I have been to the Mayan Palace at Acapulco and Puerta Vallarta. This one is as good if not better than they are. I am sure that there are some legitimate problems that some people have experienced. N0 place is perfect. However, I find it strange that most people who write negative reviews, have all the problems, all at once. Just unlucky I guess. The timeshare presentation was not a problem. I always go to those for the discounts. It is true that there is not a real good beach here, but I am not a wading on the beach kind of guy. Acapulco has the best beach of the ones that I have visited. There are a couple of buildings that are close to the pool and restaurants, contrary to what I have read. The bugs were not a problem at all. The spraying probably helps. Those who complain about the bugs complain about the spraying - What do you want?? I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice laid back vacation to get away from it all. You do not have to leave the resort unless you just want to.

If you come to the Carribean to swim in the beautiful water - forget about it here. As everyone has commented, the beach is extremely rocky and unswimmable. They do have a wide sandy beach that you can sit on and dig in - but you need to go to the pool to cool off. Bring a bag for the pool at check in - you can have an extremely long wait for a clean room. We had much the same experience as others - but we held out for the room closest to the pool although it was a 4 hour wait. They did let us go to the restaurants and pool during the wait, but we did not plan for this and had to dig through suitcases to pull stuff out. Just plan to have a wait and bring stuff in a seperate bag. One major complaint that we had that I have not seen commented on by others was the quality of the airconditioning. The room was plenty cool, but the a/c system did not get the humidity out. The tile floors were actually wet in some places and our bathing suits did not dry. They do not allow you to hang stuff on the balcony - so we were constantly putting on extremely wet bathing suits days after using them last. The transportation they provide is extremely limited, but we had heard this and rented a car at the airport. Taxis and/or buses are not convenient, so the car was a lifesaver since we went to PdC, Cozumel, and Xcaret, as well as grocery shopping.

I had read all the reviews and pretty much knew what to expect. On the one hand, the rooms were much better than I expected. We were in a building on the far side of the lobby, which means it was a good long walk to the pool, BUT it was a brand new building. Spacious living room, kitchenette, bedroom and bathroom all in pristine condition. No mildew smell, but I suspect it won't be that way for long because there was an almost constant drip from the vents of the central air conditioning. (As we walked through the other buildings on the way to the pool, we could smell the mildew in the hallways.) On the other hand, we were horrified by the resort as a whole. It is so big, so impersonal, so NOT Mexico. Not the type of place we would normally choose. We were there only because friends had given us their time share for a week, which enabled us to extend our Yucatan vacation by an extra week. We paid less than $350 for the week, and for that price I had no complaints. The beach was worse than I expected. I suppose it may not be so bad in the winter, when the weather isn't so hot and you might be able to sit out there and not go in the water; in August that was impossible. My kids went on the jet skis one day and enjoyed it; other than that we stayed away from the beach. We spent most of our time by the pool. It's not easy to find a place in the shade--you have to either get there before 10am or after 2, when people start to leave. We managed to get a palapa bed most of the days we were there, at around 10am, but they were in a far corner of the pool. We actually liked it there much better. There were fewer people in the pool in that far corner and it was cleaner. The area near the swim-up bar by the snack bar was disgustingly dirty--lots of scum along the edges. Gross. I found that the water got warmer as the day went on, probably because of the heat. The water was enjoyable nevertheless. The service was decent overall. The margaritas were weak weak weak, but refreshing. Food was less than spectacular. The snack bar by the pool wasn't bad, but the restaurant down on the beach was pretty awful. Didn't try any of the other restaurants; we had a car and went into Playa del Carmen most evenings. We went to the supermarket in Playa and found that the prices in the market at the resort were exactly double what they were in Playa. If you plan on having any meals in your room, definitely shop in Playa del Carmen. We had breakfast and some lunches in the room. We didn't try the spa, we didn't go to any of the all-you-can eat buffets or the nightly entertainment, so I can't comment on any of that. The walk to the pool from our room was a good solid 10 minutes, which isn't terrible except in 100 degree heat. We took the shuttles when we could or walked through the buildings. In the evenings we walked on the garden path. Definitely bring insect repellent; we got a few bites when we forgot to put it on, despite the nightly fumigation. We felt fortunate to have had a week in Akumal before coming to the Maya Palace. Akumal is incredible. Beautiful beach, great swimming and snorkeling, and lots of good food. We had the best meal of our vacation at the Lol Ha restaurant at the Hotel Club Akumal Caribe. Highly recommended. The hotel is not fancy, but comfortable and relaxing. If a big fancy resort isn't for you, I would try this hotel. In sum, I wouldn't choose the Mayan Palace, but for what we paid it was quite nice. Don't expect an ocean view, or a quiet intimate vacation if you go there. And if you don't ever leave the resort, well, you might as well be in Las Vegas or Miami Beach. But if all you want to be treated well, lie around a big pool, drink watery margeritas and eat overpriced unremarkable food, then this is the place for you.", "Date": "September 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troy,NY", "Title": "\u201cMayan Palace Riviera Mayan Beware\u201d", "Author": "travelqeen", "ReviewID": "UR3899415", "Content": "We have just returned from a week at the Mayan Palace Riviera Mayan,09-04-05 thru 09-11-05, and have serveal comments for you. First of all, don't make the same mistake I did. Listen to these reviews, people are 100% accurate on this property. I initially thought oh it cant be that bad. Wrong! Let me explain. The hotel itself is nice. The rooms in the Grand Mayan are very nice in fact this was one of the best things about the hotel. But just how much time do you spend in the room? Our room, which was a 1 bdrm, was on the 2nd flr of bldg 5 in the Grand Mayan. The room was very spacious and all furniture was new. It had a very large bathroom with two sinks and a great whirlpool tub. The room was excellent. The only downside was that the king size bed was like cardboard! Very hard but yet we never woke up with any aches or pains. It had a small kitchen area which was not set up for cooking large meals, but we didn;t intend on using anyway. We don't cook anything on vacation, so that was fine for us. We initially booked a 1bdrm at the Mayan Palace but were approached by the timeshare sales staff upon arrival. Which we were expecting and had already decided that we were going to take the tour if it was worth it.( Plan ahead for this and have your decision made about buying before you get there. This makes the tour enjoyable and pressure free. Just stand your ground . They were the most professional and easy going timeshare staff we have ever encountered. It really was a pleasure.) We were given the opportunity to check out our regular room before commiting to the time share pitch. We did so and decided that we would take 2 hours the following morning and listen to the pitch. It was just that too, no longer. For us it was worth it. We travel quite a bit and in fact own a time share so we knew what we were getting into. We never had any intentions on purchasing and it was worth the upgrade and the 15% off your entire bill for the length of your stay. I have to say I did feel bad receiving these bonuses as the staff was so pleasant and professional, but I would never purchase a place at this resort. 1. Beach- Beware! This is where my biggest disappointment was. I go to Mexico for the beauty and the beach. This hotel is directly in front of a large coral reef and and swimming is out of the question. The beach was horrible. You can't see the turquoise water and there is no surf. The first time I saw the beach I almost cried. I was so looking forward to swimming in the beautiful waters and was so disappointed I didn't plan on staying at this hotel all week. 2. Be prepared to walk Everywhere! Breakfast 10-15 mins each way, literally. To the pool 15- 20 mins, further if your in the bldgs beyond the lobby.I was so annoyed by this , not that I don't enjoy walking but in the 100 degree weather and to go everywhere was a little annoying. They do have shuttles that will pick you up at the lobby or in front of your bldg, but these can be a hassle too. The upside is that I lost 8 pounds there!! In all fairness, I do have to say that although this hotel was huge and in my opinion poorly situated on the ocean, overall it was nice. The staff was exceptional and the food was very good. Like everyone else, Tramonto's was very nice and a surprise getaway from the resort feel. It was first class and cozy. OH the pool was great as well, very large and clean. But I didn't travel 2500 miles to sit by a pool:( The activities staff was great. We did enjoy getting involved in the adult activites. Hardly any children at this time of year which was very nice, in fact the hotel felt empty. It was low season and you could tell, but for us this was great we didn't have our children with us. I would only give this resort 3 stars I think the 5 star rating is inaccurate. If you do decide to go to Mexico you have to visit the town of Playa Del Carmen and Isla Muejres. These are wonderful old world Mexico locations and are simply beautiful. Isla is my favorite as you can travel the entire Island by golf cart do not miss this, it is a hidden treasure! Two more things,I wouldn't recommend the Westin in Cancun, as it is old and run down. The rooms haven't been redone in many years and the property is old and dated. We wanted to escape the Mayan Palace for a few days and stayed at the Westin in Cancun as it is right on the beach. Well after one night we left and went back to the Mayan.- However, while in Cancun we stumbled upon the MOST INCREDIABLE restaurant in La Isla Plaza, LaMadonna.I can't say enough about this restaurant. Something you would find in mid-town Manhattan or Beverly Hills. 6 star! I had the 6 course meal and it was fabulous. I leave the rest for you to try. Do not miss this place. $$$$$ but worth every penny!!! In conclusion, I have been to this area 4 times and will return every year. Maybe not to the Mayan palce but the cancun-playa area. Its beauty and people are unsurpassed. I would recommend reading many reviews on the Mayan Palace as you will find all the compaints are the same. Have a great trip!

From the moment we started checking in we should have known how awful the resort would be. First, I should say that this week was a wedding gift from my inlaws...it was our official honeymoon. So, we did not have to pay for the room but I know what it cost them (they are timeshare owners) and if I had paid for it I would be really mad. Checkin: We arrived before checkin time which is not until 3 pm, the clerk said they had a room for us.....which was probably the room furthest from anything. (Note that there are NO rooms close to the pool area/restaurants,etc). So, I asked for a diff room, he said there were none yet, but when we said we would wait...magically more rooms poped up. He said he would put us in building four and then said \"oh wait, that room is still being cleaned but there is another room in the same building.\" After signing for a safe and authorizing delivery of a newspaper to our room each day (which I later found out they don't do anymore anyway, if you want a paper you have to walk to the conceirge desk to get one). Then we were escorted to our room...which was not afterall in building 4 but in was in building 7. Even further from everything, as soon as we got to the room we called the same clerk at the desk---he said \"oh no there isn't another room available until tomorrow, come here tomorrow and we will move you closer\". Well the next day they flat out refused to move us and lied saying there were no more rooms (they were only at 65% occupancy with many people leaving on Sundays so I know there were more rooms). Lesson here: Get the room you want right away, be ready to fight for it. Once you get to a room you are stuck there. The Pool: Yep, there is a big pool, a series of conected pools. They aren't very clean. There are lots of bugs floating around and scum on the tiles. The water is warm. There is construction going on near the pool area..they are building a whole to new complex...so to relax by the pool was not an option as they are banging away, welding, etc. All of the time. And then there are the crazy games in the pool area....a guy on a microphone shouting, maybe 10 people interested in playing the games, and bad loud rap music stopping an starting. There is one happy hour and it is from 11 to noon. Make sure you ask if your order makes it within that time period b/c as we found out one minute late with the waiter submitting your order and then two for one drinks are charged as four drinks. Nice. The pool area futon beds. Some people I guess get up at the crack of dawn to get them. Unless you do this you won't get one. They do not enforce the rule that you can't reserve your beds by placing your stuff there. There is a lack of umbrella shaded areas so people fight over these also. The Food: Depends on what you eat. I can say that as a vegan there were no options. We did eat at the nicer Italian restaurant on site and had overcooked overpriced pasta and a snooty waiter. That was fun. Timeshare: Oddly they never bothered us with timeshare offers. Constant sales people: As you try to relax by the loud pool, you will be interupted every 15 minutes by someone from the resort who wants you buy a ticket to their dinner and show, someone who wants you get your picture taken with a monkey, snake, bird. , some who wants you to spend money on a day trip. Constantly each day the same thing. Pretending to sleep or read doesn't stop these people. By the way nothing is free. The literature that they give you saying you get free snorkel equip,etc well that isn't free..you just get to use it if you purchase a trip. Employees: Walking around slowly, everywhere all the time, once in a while sweeping around the pool area, scooping a bug or two out of the pool. Mostly just loitering around. They really like to sweep around and push their carts right in the area where you sitting, sleeping, reading. We did end up having to make a trip to the medical clinic on site...and they I can say were great. Smart, honest, quick, and willing to share information. Bugs: Yep there are bugs. It is a jungle. Doesn't bother me really, put on bug spray if you don't want to get bitten I guess. But, they spray the whole resort outdoors with a fogger and this stuff is poison. The guy that sprays it wears a ventilated mask...you will wish you had one if they spray around you..which they will if you are waiting for any number of minutes for their shuttle to get you to/from the main gate. The highlight of the resort was a very friendly stray cat that wandered about in the evenings. Outside of the resort: Playa Del Carmen is a quick bus trip. The city is poverty stricken, lots of garbage, stray dogs, is is really sad. The tourist strip has a lot of locals selling all of the same junk...and they harrass you as you walk past to try to get you to look at their store area. There are many resort reps downtown that will hound you as well to try to get you to purchase day trips. Xel Ha is an ecopark. Not very eco-friendly. The snorkeling was just OK...we had much better snorkeling around the Big Island of Hawaii. There were lots of people smoking and throwing their cigarettes around, you can see them on the ocean floor while you snorkel. They sell you their own brand of eco-friendly sunscreen which you must use (17 USD a bottle) and once you get in the water it all just floats right off in an oily cloud. Final Word: Don't waste your time or money here. This is not a highend resort, however, there are some in the area. I would never go back here. At good resorts they should work to make you comfortable, they should not constantly interrupt your time with sales pitches,etc.", "Date": "September 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cA great week at the Mayan Palace\u201d", "Author": "bogieman", "ReviewID": "UR3897093", "Content": "My wife and visited the Mayan Palace for her birthday the week of Sept 2nd through the 9th. After reading some reviews prior to going I was a little hesitant about what we would find. Let me first say we are both in our 50's and have traveled extensively. When we got to the resort we did not find long lines as the resort was only 60% occupied. We asked if we could get in a building by the pool and got into the first buiding. Our suite was very large and nicely appointed. Yes, the bed could have been a little softer, but we both slept well. There was a mini market on site that allowed you to purchase breakfast items and many other food items for your suite. Bring some zip lock bags to store left over food. They also had clothing and an internet cafe. The pool area is HUGE! In fact, it is the largest pool in Latin America ( 234 YARDS long ) by my best estimate. There are two pool bars and the drinks and food were just great. They have an excellent health club and spa. It does cost $10 per day to use the health club, but you can save 15% if you just talk to the desk at the spa. There are 3 main restaurants---Del Lago where they have a buffet breakfast , another one down by the beach that serves lunch and dinner, and my favorite, Tramonto that serves great Italian. The timeshare people asked us at check in if we were interested and after declining, we were never bothered again. They spray for bugs outside every evening and the time is posted in you room. It is not that bad and we did not get bothered by the mosquitos at all. To be safe, take some bug spray. The people at the resort were very friendly and courteous. The resort has a new addition, an activity center, with more pools and shops etc., being built that will only make this resort better. The construction was not noisy. Workers are always cleaning the place...I was at the pool one morning to watch the sun rise and they were at work already at 6:00 a.m. These folks work hard for very little money so please tip for their services...they appreciate it!

My parents purchased the timeshare in Puerto Vallarta and gave me and three friends a week in Cancun. None of us had ever been there. OUr first couple days were in the Hotel Zone which was fun, and we enjoyed partying. But then we went to the Mayan Palace. Yes, it was still under construction, but I never even noticed. The week was fabuous!! The rooms were great, the service was great. Yes, they do encourage you to listen to their timeshare speal. You can say NO. We didn't, and yes, 90 minutes took a couple of hours, and we almost got conned into buying. I'm a salesperson, so I thought I was invincible. But, I said no, got my 15% off, and went on my way. The pool and swim up bars were a ton of fun. The bartenders were just as fun as well. Not to mention the twice a day Happy Hour!! We didn't rent a car. Instead we took a couple of tours, spent time lounging around the pool, or took the bus to Playa Del Carmen. I think it was only a couple bucks. You take the golf cart to the main entrance and across the street you pick up the bus to Playa Del Carmen. There you can eat, shop, visit the beach, or take a ferry to Cozumel. Which we did. Cozumel was a fun trip, but if you get sea sick, make sure you take something. The ride was very turbulent and I rarely get sea sick, but this almost did me in. I had such a great time, I am going back to The Mayan Palace next month with my fiance. Hopefully some more of the construction will be completed, if not, we'll be back!!! FYI.....we ate at the hotel often, charged our drinks, sometimes ate in Playa, and cooked in the room. OUr tab at the end was only a few hundred bucks each when we checked out. I thought it would be worse, and if you saw how much we drank, you would too!!", "Date": "September 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cDo not buy at over-priced, ripoff Mayan Palace!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3840336", "Content": "Whatever you do, don't buy a timeshare here. Or as they like to call it. membership in a \"vacation club\". We were in Playa on our honeymoon at an all-inclusive resort and went on their \"2-hour\" presentation for the $300 they promised us. I have to give them credit for their sales prowess. It's a well-oiled, well-rehearsed machine that sucks in even people like me, and I consider myself pretty saavy, having been a commission-only salesman for 18 years. Once they have your money, however, their whole attitude toward you changes. I knew we were in trouble when we got finished with the sales blitz (almost 4 hours later), and went down to the pool restaurant to get something to eat. We split a club sandwich and a bag of chips and had 2 bottled waters.....for $16.00! The next morning, after the buyer's remorse had really set in, I called them and told them I wanted to meet to cancel my purchase, but guess what? They said I had bought a \"re-sell\" that someone had traded in on an upgrade, and since it wasn't a new sale, according to \"Mexican Law\", the 5 day cooling-off period didn't apply! They were really rude and cold once I told them I wasn't happy and wanted my money back. After a couple of hours of arguing in a back room, which they whisked us to in order to keep the new suckers in the main sales room from hearing, they finally agreed to allow us to go from a $17,000 package to a $6,500 one. That's money down the toilet, because once I discovered that the $200 a year maintenance fees go up about $150 every year, I could see where this train wreck was headed, and decided to cut my losses. I stopped paying the maintenance fee, because I will never go to this place EVER. They won't get another dime of my money. Don't ever buy a timeshare. When someone has you locked in for a long period of time for a lot of money that you've already paid, they have no incentive to treat you right so that you'll come back. They couldn't care less if you come back...you will have already paid for several trips, so it doesn't matter what they do! Stick with the all-inclusive deals, at least for your first trip or two to Mexico. In the long run it's way cheaper, the people are friendlier and do more to make you happy so you'll come back.

Apart from lots of rebuilding of the palapas and huts on the beach and pool area, we didn't detect much damage from the hurricane. They did a fantastic job cleaning up so quickly. The concierge service kept us up-to-date with the clean up before we left. All restaurants and the pool were in operation again by the beginning of August, and we were there from August 13-20. I can't imagine the work involved in filtering the sand out of the pool by hand, as they did. We had a 2-bedroom suite in the Grand Mayan. The rooms were luxurious, and the dipping pool on the balcony is a welcome addition. The maid staff stocks the tub with mini bottles of bath oil, bath salts, and bubble bath, and the complementary bottles of lotion and shampoo in the bathroom were larger than I usually see in other hotel rooms. We were overwhelmed at first by the service because it seemed like everyone wanted to help us with our bags (and therefore get a tip), but it didn't take long to say \"No thanks. We can handle it.\" We were never harassed or offered any drugs. On the contrary, we usually greeted everyone we saw (staff and guests as well) with a smile and an \"Hola\" and were greeted in kind. We didn't sit through the time share presentation, but I may consider doing it next time we go. The service there is top-notch. Every request we had was quickly fulfilled with a friendly smile. The food can be pricy, but it's amazing and worth the splurge. After all, this is a resort. The all-you-can-eat Steak and Shrimp dinner by the pool was out of this world. The dinner changes every day, so you won't get bored. Also, Tum Tah can be pricy, but it can also be affordable. It all depends on what you order. Don't bother ordering the Caesar salad with shrimp. You only get 3 shrimp, some romaine lettuce, and Caesar dressing. I went back anyway, because the shrimp and scallop satay and dessert (apple/pear crumble with cinnamon ice cream) were really good the first time. My friend ordered a hamburger, which wasn't on the menu, and they happily made it to her specifications. It was $9. My pizza was $11 and I took half of it with me for breakfast the next day. The view of the moon over the water was worth every penny. If you stock up on groceries the first day you can easily eat in your room. We had lots of tiny little bugs at one point, but if you keep everything in the fridge you shouldn't have any problems. Like everyone else, I enjoyed the pool very much. We had to search for it, but we could generally find a shady place by the pool for the chaise lounges. Then again, we were usually there later in the day. The pool could have been deeper in some areas, but with so many young children around I understand why they made it shallow. I loved the swim up bars. I ordered a drink or two every day and never had a complaint. They also serve non-alcoholic drinks, so if you don't drink alcohol don't be afraid to take advantage of it. If you like papaya, be sure to try the Mayan Dream. Thanks to the warnings on this site, I brought a pair of Shoremate shoes with me and had no problems navigating on the beach with the rocks and coral. The spa services are absolutely outstanding. Definitely get there a half hour early to enjoy the hydrotherapy area (Swedish shower, sauna, steam bath, and cool and hot jacuzzis). The massage therapist was excellent and knowledgeable, and the technician who did my sunburn wrap the day after Xcaret was soothing and friendly. I walked out of there both days very relaxed. However, unlike everywhere else in the resort they do not include the tip in the bill!!! I was embarrassed when, while preparing to check out, I realized that I hadn't tipped them (it stated on the receipt that tip wasn't included but I hadn't looked closely at it). I suggested they change the policy or inform guests when making an appointment. We'll see if they do. As for the \"crows,\" sure we got a few mosquito bites, but the mosquitos aren't any bigger than they are anywhere else. If you use insect repellent you'll be ok. It isn't called the tropics for nothing... We also enjoyed the tours we booked through the resort. The tour to Chichen Itza was well-organized, and we enjoyed having a bit of free time to roam after the tour. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable. I took a tour to Xcaret as well. Lunch was included with both (I upgraded to the Xcaret Plus tour for the snorkle gear). Warning: at Xcaret they do not allow sunscreen or sunblock if it isn't biodegradeable. If you plan on taking a trip to this gorgeous ecological park, either bring biodegradeable sunscreen with you or pay $10 for it at the park. I got really sunburned that day. If you plan to go snorkling or snuba diving, you might want to bring an underwater camera with you. They are $20-28 at the park - and mine leaked. Also, bring Immodium - and don't buy the generic brand. Despite being careful, I came home with a touch of La Tourista. Still, it didn't detract from the best vacation I have ever experienced.

This is a huge drink, served in a huge coconut at only $10 (Virgin drinks are $5, but they'll put the alcohol from one into another for a double - so plan on that!). The pool(s) are amazing, warm and a swim up bar is fun! The staff are readily available and everyone is very nice and accomodating - likely because the tip is included in all of your orders.

I was very reluctant to take the trip after the hurricane. I called several times to the hotel and got varying answers as to the amount to damage. I was sure that I would not hear the truth. I had arranged transportation to the hotel from the airport though the hotel. When we arrived at the airport, I was immediately approached by someone asking if I was looking for transportation to my hotel. Of course I was but within a couple of minutes it was obvious that he was selling a time share. We just left him and found our transportion. The fee was supposed to be $15 US per person. What I didn't know was that it was going to be charged to my room. We were told that the van was for only us to go to the hotel. As it turned out, this wasn't exactally true. After they loaded our luggage, we drove to another terminal and picked up 4 other passengers. This wasn't really a problem it just wasn't what I was initially told. At the end of the week, my bill reflected a charge more around $45 US for the four of us. When we arrived at our hotel, much to my surprise, the lobby was not air conditioned and it was HOT. The did have ceiling fans but it really didn't help much. We arrived around 1:00 and our room was not ready yet. I asked which building we were staying in and she said #4. I had read about the long walks to the pool so I requested something closer. She said there was nothing available. I then asked if something would be available later in the day if we waited. She then suddenly found a room in building #2 but it would not be ready until 2:30 to 3:00. We left our luggage and took a golf cart trip to the pool area and ate lunch. It was soooo hot. The food was good and it was charged to our room. The prices were what I had read - reasonably priced. The pool was so impressive. We checked back at the lobby at 2:30 but we still had to wait another 30 min. until it was ready. This is still 2 hrs earlier than the 5:00 checkin. A bell boy took our luggage and we walked through 4 buildings to get to ours. What little airconditioning that seaps under the doors into the 1st floor hallways felt great. I quickly realized I would always walk through the buildings. When we arrived at our room we were on the second floor with a balcony that overlooked a road. As reported there isn't much of a view. But I didn't expect one. The room was nice. We had a 1 bedroom, kitchenette / dining, den, and bathroom. It was not as nice as some places I have traded for, but again I knew what to expect. The air conditioner worked great, so I loved the place. Our party consisted of 2 children (11,12) and us, their parents. We figured the kids would sleep on the sleeper sofa. But as I had read the couches were very firm and definitely something for the kids. The master bedroom was lacking in drawers for all the clothers. One of the kids pretty much just kept his clothes in his luggage for the week. We found the pool was huge. It has 3 levels cascading one into the other. We found out that the happy hour started everyday from 11 - 12. So we took advantage at the pool bar #2. It got to be a routine for us. They would ring a bell when it was about to start. And we would make our way to the pool bar for a couple of Pina Colada and a couple of virgin strawberry drinks. We ordered lunch at the pool bar a couple of days. The chicken enchaladas were really good and so were the hamburgers. We ate at Tum-Tah at the beach for breakfast and dinner a couple of days. I thought the prices were ok for the breakfast but high for the dinners. But it is high everywhere in Cancun. The food was really good though. I usually woke up earlier than the rest and I would go the the pool to get a palapa. I didn't get the ones with the beds as I couldn't really see much use for it. But there was only 1 day when I could have gotten one if I wanted one. As reported, they go quickly. My goal was to get some shade near pool bar #2 and I got the same ones everyday without much trouble. There were several palapas that were under construction that I assumed were blown down by the hurricane. It will be nice when they are completed. The pool staff is trying to keep people from reserving the chairs and come around on the hour to note which reserved chairs are occupied. I never did see them enforcing this 1 hour rule though. My daughter had her hair braided at the pool for $60 US. I had heard that it was cheaper at Playa but we weren't sure when we would go there. We scheduled the snorkeling trip at the Sports Hut on the beach at $45 US per person. This was not a good trip. We had to get our gear, and walk 15 minutes down the beach, and wade out waist deep to a boat. Our boat ride was about 15 minutes and we stopped to snorkel in a coral reef that did not get much tourist and was really good. Not so. The snorkeling was not good. Not much to see. My kids as well as alot of others quit snorkeling early and got back on the boat. They took us to another spot that wasn't much better. Then the walk back with all the gear. It didn't help much that part of the walk was across coral. The hotel really needs to drop this tour as it feels like a real rip off. I had read several things about where to snorkel but I listened to the guys at the Sports Hut. We went to Play del Carmen for 2 trips during our stay - both times by taxi. The first night was just for dinner as we were to beat to shop much. Our taxi driver suggested Casa del Auga. It was great. It has good food and great atmosphere. We had Mahi-Mahi, tuna, coconut shrimp, and chicken fingers. All were really good. I called the consierge several times and found them quiet helpful. However on one occasion I called to try arrange a trip to Xcaret without going on the hotel arranged tour bus. The consierge passed me along to the travel agent who wasn't the least bit interested in helping me since I wasn't going to take the tour bus. I didn't want to spend the whole day there, they were leaving at 9 AM and I had heard that they were about 70% open due to the hurricane damage. Due to the damage, they were limiting the number of visitors per day. You pretty much had to reserve your ticket or you could get there and find out that the place was sold out. The consierge was nice enough to call and reserve tickets under my credit card. We arrived around mid afternoon, snorkeled in the underground river, ate the buffet, saw the ball game and the Mexico show. The snorkeling was refreshing (62F), but not much to look at, the buffet was pretty good, but the flys on the food was a little bit much ( this would be closed down in the US), the ball game was really good, and the Mexican show was fantastic. I had heard that it was something you shouldn't miss and I agree 100%. We caught a cab back with no problems, they are waiting at the gate. Me and my son arranged a 1/2 day fishing trip with Captain Ricks at Puerto Aventurous. The fishing was not that good. We trolled for 1.5 hours without a bite, bottom fished and caught several yellow tail snappers and fer Jack something. On our return we trolled and caught 3 barracuda. We had fun but the fishing has been a little slower since the hurricane. Puerto Aventurous caught the eye of the hurricane and the damage is evident. There wasn't 1 tree that was complete. There were a couple of local resorts that were going to be closed for 2-3 months due to the damage. We ate lunch at Gringo Daves and had the best tacos. The fish tacos were fabulous. This was a neat town that I wanted to visit another day. Our taxi driver back to the hotel was Nacho. He spoke English well and had a good personality. He offered a special price of $120 for an all day fee. We had previously met another taxi driver that offered the same for $100. We ate at the Carribean buttet at the hotel and the food, atmosphere, and music was great. The price was high, but this is vacation and we loved it all. We had grouper, steak, BBQ, beef & shrimp kabobs, salad, corn, beans, rice, dessers, drinks. It really was good. We did all go down the beach to do the parasailing. This was fun but so expensive. I don't remember spending $240 in 1/2 hour before. But we know before we went. We had wanted to go to Tulum and do it at our own time. The all day taxi was really sounding like this is what we should do. I couldn't find the business card of the first taxi driver that offered the $100 day so I called Nacho. He required a full days notice so he could arrange it. We were set to meet him at the lobby at 8:00 AM. At 8:15 he still hadn't arrived so I called his mobil number. He was waiting outside the gate and said that they wouldn't let him come in. Apparently, he worked for a taxi service that was a competator to the one that services the hotel. I spoke with the head bell boy and he said that he would send him in when he asked for me. I told him he was at the gate now. I called Nacho back and told him to tell the gate security to call the head bell boy. Well, 1/2 hour later they finally gave into letting him come in for a pickup. The had tried to talk me into getting one of the taxis at the hotel. I stuck my ground and our trip was the best day we had. As it turned out Nacho was great. It was like having our own personal guide. He told us of alot of interesting things about local life. We arrived at Tulum and arranged to meet him at the parking lot whenever we got back. We took the tram to the entrance and were approached by a guide service. I was sure that there would be so much more to learn if we had someone telling us - so we signed up for $35. This guy was great, his English and vocabulary was something else. He really had a true interest in the history of the Mayans and made our tour really good. On our way back to the parking lot we stopped at the open market for a few items. We met Nacho and decided it was time to move on and find a place for lunch. I wanted to go back to Puerto Aventurous and take the rest of the family to Gringo Daves. Nacho suggested another resturant and said that if we looked at it and decided we didn't want to eat there we would move on to Gringo Daves. Nacho pulled off the highway down a dirt road that was filled with pot holes you could almost loose a car in. This road went on for at least 2 miles. I was beginning to wonder what we were doing when we arrived at the end and I could see the water. The name of the resturant was Oscar y Laco. This place was like a little piece of heaven on the beach. It was beautiful. There were palm trees, hammocks, blue water. What a place. The food was good and not very expensive. They even had hammocks in the resturant. We ate outside under a palm tree about 15ft from the water. What a treat - this is a must see. There are only a few private residences near by. The do get some visitors from local resort trips. There was a small group that had been on a 4 Wheel Drive trip in the \"jungle\". The restaurant has kayaks free for use for people that eat there. If it weren't for Nacho we would never have gone to this place. There were a few people at the open market at Tulum that were handing out info on the restaurant. But even if I had received some info and decided to go there, if I were driving, I would have given up and turned around before I got to the end of that terrible pot holed road. The restaurant was located and the end of a cove. It was like it was the only thing around - almost deserted. Nothing else was in site. The waves were maybe 4 inches high. I can't say enough about this place. Next on our trip back, we wanted to snorkel at Akumal. The consierge at the hotel told me that this was her favorite place because it wasn't frequented so much by tourists. Nacho knew the place and recommended that we snorkel in the river rather than the ocean. He took us to the entrance of a park where you pay and get your gear. After we paid and changed clothes this grumpy old man that ran the place said that they were out of snorkels and asked if that would be ok. I said no and demanded my money back. We then decided to try the beach. The dive shop we went to were out of flippers. This just wasn't going to work out!!. The owner suggested that we walk down the beach to the other dive shop. On the way down the beach, Nacho spoke to some of the people on a small boat and the proposed to take us out on their boat to snorkel. The price for the gear was $10 and $5 more for a trip on their boat. This sounded like a great plan. We got in their boat and went just outside the reef. One of the workers on the boat was our guide. He reviewed in a book the types of coral and fish that he was going to show us. This trip was really good. We first saw the unusual coral on the ocean side of the reef and then saw all the fish on the beach side. We swam with thousands of fish in a school, we sall all kinds of beautiful colorful fish. Some small, some larger. We saw several large barracuda. The school of fish would scatter and you would be face to face with this toothy fish. This was a real thrill. We then snorkeled over to a grassy area where 2 fairly large sea turtles were. We would smim with them and they would surface and be within 3 feet of your face. This was truly awsome. What a trip. Hiring a taxi driver for the day was the best idea ever. We could do what ever we wanted to do and at our pace. I looked into renting a car for the week and priced what the taxi was going to cost us for all the places we wanted to go. We would have saved a little money if we had rented a car. But I was concerned a little about their driving, and what happens if you are in a wreck and someone gets hurt. As it turned out, I think the way we did it is the way to go. When you stay in the Riveria Maya, you are going to have to deal with travel. We would have gotten tired of eating at the resort every meal - so just be prepared for the travel, whether you decide to take a bus, taxi, or rent a car. We did eat one breakfast buffet at Del Lago. The food was good, but it was so hot. Not being on the beach and having a few fans made it too hot. We ate at Tramontos and the atmosphere and food was great. Once again it was expensive. We typically spent (for 2 adults & 2 kids) $30-35 for breakfast, $40-50 for lunch, and $75-115 for dinner. We bought milk and corn flakes to eat for several breakfasts. As far as on site fun, the family got into the daily water arobics, my daughter got her hair braided and painted a ceramic turtle, I got a massage. At the end of the week, we had a bill of a little over $1100. It was expensive, but what is vacation for. We had a 12:20 departure, and the night before I wanted to arrange the shuttle to the airport. The consierge said that they company (Royal Tours) was not answering their phone and that she would have to tell me in the morning how they would shuttle us to the airport. She said that she had around 30 people that were leaving around the same time and they may send a large bus. I checked in the morning and it was going to be a large bus. We were supposed to be at the airport 2 hours before departure and the bus was going to leave at 10:00. If all worked out fine this would work. Well, the bus did arrive a few minutes late, but was not prepared for the amount of luggage. This was the most rediculous site. A company that is in the business of taking people to the airport and did not expect the luggage. They had completely loaded the bottom of the bus with luggage and werer just standing outside the bus stairing at the luggage like they were waiting for the rest to disappear. It was now 10:20 and I was getting worried. Me and others talked to the driver and all he would say is \"no problem\". Well, they finally got a brainstorm and loaded the luggage in the bus an finally, off we went. They then told us that the first stop would be for the charter flights and they would have to take off the luggage to find their luggage, and then we would go to the regular flights. Of the 30+ people, there were only about 4 that were on charter flights. He finally, decided to go to the regular flights first. We arrived at the airport, and got through customs very quickly and actually had time on our hands. Our, vacations was coming to an end. In summary, we loved our stay at the Mayan Palace. Thanks to TripAdvisor, we were prepared for the no beach, needing a taxi, cost of food, warm swimming pool water, etc. The staff was very good and helpful in all ways. The travel agent and the trouble getting my taxi driver in to pick me up were the only things I had that were a little negative. An onsite show on TV reflected the Mayan Palace other sites and future plans at the Riveria Maya and it is evident that these people are taking timeshare resorts to a new lever. The construction on site is not something you want to see, but it is necessary for such a large scale operation. It is unfortunate that the land they are developing has a coral beach. I doubt that their plan for the sand to cover the coral will ever happen. Would I ever stay that this site again. I doubt that I will, but not because I didn't like it, but because we rarely go to the same place twice. Actually, of the places we have traded for, this is the nicest.

We have exchanged for years and have stayed at many different resorts. Some old, some new. Our opinion of the Mayan: Pro's: new, very big units (we had a 2 bdrm). The private dipping pool more of a novelty than of real use. Very very clean and the service at the resort is outstanding. They make every effort to make your stay pleasant. No problem with timeshare selling ( we did go for a morning presentation and got $40 to use plus a great breakfast buffet). Pool is great and very warm and kids loved it also. No problem with getting chairs or your own space. The walk to the pool was no big deal. Typical of large sprawled out resorts. The music/bands/entertainment around the pool and restaurants were great and went every night to watch and listen for free. Cons: Although it was 3 weeks after the hurricane, place was not \"quickly\" cleaned up especially the beach. Horrible beach and didn't go in the water at all. Do not stay here if you want a beach resort...there are many others elsewhere that are much much better. We stayed 2 nights at the casa magna in cancun and the beach and water was incredible (and we are from florida!). But not at the mayan. Tried to rent a catamaran but both were \"broke\" and waiting for parts...mmmhhh. Mosquitoes everywhere including your room especially from 5 to 9. Note: if leaving the pool after 5 pm bring bug spray or you can get eaten alive. tips: Kitchens are very very limited (worst we have ever seen and very cheap plates and glasses...definitely not world class). Bring wine glasses, plastic cups etc... no dishwasher (unheard of) and no oven (kids and no oven...come on get real). Went to XelHa. Very cool place but unless you all like to eat alot just bring a small cooler or 2 with drinks and food and save $25/pp on the on inclusive. Not worth it. Most of the time is spent in the water and not eating. Get there very early (before 9!). Finally, do NOT drive in Cancun. I'm very experienced driving internationally but oh my! never again! Also, rented a car at Avis for 2 days and got ripped off...still trying to get monies back! Overall: resort will be much nicer when construction is done and waterpark is finished (hope they don't plan to charge people to use the waterpark but I bet they will!). But with no ocean views, lousy beach, out in the middle of nowhere (need a car or get used to taking a bus plus walking 1/2 mile to the resort front or wait alot for the shuttle bus to the front plus wait alot for a bus to arrive), this is not a beach resort. Would not pay per night for this resort. Better off in Cancun hotel zone. Personally, cancun area is not very nice (typical poor conditions) and although we live in Florida believe most would enjoy Florida beaches/area with alot less hassles, no bug bites and alot cheaper! Cancun area was nice to go to the cenotes, jungle tours etc.. and if you love to snorkel or dive.

Now for the bad points. No Beach, rooms are so far away it will take you 20 minutes to get to where you can take a buggy to get you to the pool. Usually another 10 minutes to wait for that buggy and a 10 minute drive. So make sure you don't forget a thing. The entertainment is stale at best, the nightly shows are stale and laking originality. You will need a car to leave the resort (30 minutes from Cancun and 20 minutes from Playa del Carmen). In conclution, if you like walking, this is your hotel.

We were their from Aug 7 -14. We were a little worried about staying here because of the hurricane and all the negative reviews read from this site. I should have changed it but took the risk. Here is our expereince: The hotel is beautiful and the staff was wonderful, but the hotel lacks alot of that relaxing tropical vacation feeling. First of all the pool is very far! You either walk and get bitten by huge black mosqitos or take a little golf car that takes you to the pool site (The golf car can take anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes). The golf cart will also take you to the front gate, shopping area within the hotel and pool. The pool is huge and is about 3 1/2 deep. They have many lounge chairs and never had a problem getting one. However, getting the twin size beds under the cabana right by the pool is a problem. If you want one of those you actually need to spend the night on one of them or get up at 4:00 am to reserve one. By 7:00 am these beds were all taken. Drinks by the pool were very pricey, but any other hotel like this one will probably run you about the same. The rooms have no view of the beach especially if you are staying near the golf course. Their is still alot of construction going on. The hotel is building more rooms so monday-friday you will see construction workers. If you are going on vacation to relax then what is the point of staying at a hotel that is not completely finished. Even in the hallways, we saw workers painting and putting up the room numbers. The walls are too thin and can hear many sounds coming from the other guest rooms. We were very disappointed with the beach area. The beach is too rocky to swim. And if you are going with kids, then you might as well just stay at the pool. However, when reading about this on this website, somone said that if you walk about 15 minutes down the beach you will find a nice swimming area. Well unfortunaely this was not the case. Next to the resort their is construction going on and the beach next to it is very rocky and filthy. I think this was due to the hurriane. The next hotel is Irebostar which is about 25 minutes away walking. The beach is better, but private and only for Iberstar guest(we still snuck in and took a 1/2 swim no one noticed and if they did they did not say anything.) The Spa area at the Mayan Palace is clean and the staff people very friendly. The massage was great, but the outside area where the jacuzzi is has no privacy. At one point a male employee walked in through this side door! Their is no conditioner in the spa showers only shampoo. The Italian restuarant was very pricey. We paid $200.00 for just four people and two were kids. The restaraunt that is on the beach is a little less expensive. I ordered the Salmon with veggies and that was great! They also have a live band and a kids menu. We also tried the Buffet which is right by the pool and starts at 6:30 to 9:00pm. The buffet in my opinion was pricey at $40 per person and kids pay half of that. Not all that. If you are not a buffet person, but if you are you might enjoy it. I was not impressed with Cancun and will never go back. Before visiting cancun I had this image of beautiful sandy white beaches, but finding a nice beach like this was very difficult unless you stay at a resort that offers a beach to swim and if you are going to cancun and stay at a resort like the Mayan Palace then what is the point. We tried Playas del Carmen but the beach that day was very overcrowed and very hot! (about 110 degrees!) Tulum was the only positive adveture from this trip. It has the most beautiful beach to swim in, be sure to take your swimming shorts and towel because this is worth paying for. We rented a car so did not do any of the bus tours. I think renting car is a must in CANCUN. Unless you enjoy waiting around for the tour buses, taxis and waiting for everyone else. I think we saved alot of time and some money. We did tulum, puerto morelos and went shopping in one day. Puerto Morelos is not what I expected, according to the website it states that it has many restuarants but we did not see too many. The one we did see was right by the port overlooking the ocean, but the service was so bad that we walked out. Their were 10 waiters and not one came over during our 20 minute wait to offer a menu or drinks. My son had to get up and get the menus for us. It was ridiculous so we walked out! Hotelara Cancun, is this long strip of fancy hotels. Towards the end of the strip you will find shopping centers and restarants. The Isla shopping center has a very good restarant called Margaritas. It was very inexpensive and the food and drinks were delicious. Xcaret- we went here because everyone kept telling us how fun t is for kids. First of all it is sooo expensive. And not worth it for us. We paid to do the snorkeling and for the lunch buffet. The snorkeling was ok for the kids but unfortunaely you dont see any fish. Its only an unerground river that strectes about 1 mile. My son dropped his snorkeling goggles and reported to the staff who wanted to charge us 15.00 for it. The buffet was ok but not the greatest. They do have a swimming area with inflatable floaties and activities that was fun. The aquarium was ok. We did not stay for the show, so cannot comment on that. Overall to see no fish and eat a buffet of beans, cheese, carnitas, lettuce, tortillas and desserts with flies on them cost us about $220.00 for the four of us. Playa Maroma Beach Activity At playa maroma, they have packages or you might be able to book throught the hotel. They have all day activities such as snorkeling, ATV's, Jet Skis, lunch and drinks. We paid 230.00 for four of us and did the snorkeling from 9-1pm then lunch followed by the jet skis. Drinking all day was also included in this package. Drinks included beer, soda, mixed drinks. TIme Share people are everywhere in Cancun during our stay we only got asked 4 times but told them that we were leaving that day and didnot have time to do the buffets. Playas del Carmen is about 20 minutes away from the Mayan Palace. Tulum is about an hour, hoteleara cancun is about 40 minues. Airport about 20. Mayan Palace timeshare belongs to a friend who gave us a week at the Mayan Palace. We still had to pay maintence fee and peak season fee which came out to about 550. for a week.

We arrived one day after the hurricane hit to no electricity or air conditioning, but after spending the night at an evacuation site in Cancun we took it in stride. The staff at the Mayan were wonderful and went above and beyond to get things back to normal as soon as possible. Those of you who thought the staff were not competent should have spoken to people who stayed at other resorts. You might change your mind. The Mayan pool is spectacular, the ocean view from the pool is lovely. The rooms may not have direct views of the ocean, but this is due to codes for construction in hurricane zones. Thank goodness for this or we may not have been able to have had a holiday at all. The hurricane shelter may have been crowded but the hotel accepted tourists from other hotels that didn't have hurricane shelters, they also took in people off of the highway. We didn't encounter one rude staff member, or one tacky timeshare salesperson, although we saw plenty of people taking the timeshare tour. If you don't want to be pressured, don't agree to go on these timeshare tours. We were asked once, we declined, and weren't asked again for the entire two week stay. I might have had to pay for all of the tours that we chose to go on, but I this was in my planned budget anyway.We booked a few tours through the travel agency at the resort to Chichen Itza and Xel Ha. Both were very enjoyable and smoothly run. We went into Playa by collectivo several times and also took a taxi a couple of times. We didn't have any trouble taking the collectivo, for 10 pesos per person, from the highway. The collectivo takes you dierctly downtown to fifth avenue.The longest we had to wait was 10 minutes. Don't let anyone charge you more than 180 pesos for one way cab fare to Playa. We were able to negotiate this price down to 140 pesos twice and once a cab charged us only 20 pesos per passenger to go into town, rather than drive back empty! You are in Mexico, you might as well get out there and experience some of it the way the locals do. If you don't want to have some experiences of your own, or you want the resort to do everything for you, you might as well stay at a resort in the United States. Food and drinks are relatively expensive, but you are staying at a five star resort, so be prepared for this before you come. To keep costs down, we bought groceries in Playa, cooked our own breakfast and/ or lunch and just ate out for supper. The grill by the pool is very good and reasonably priced, the restaurant that is right on the beach is also excellent and surprisingly well priced for what you get. I had a tuna salad for $7 or $8.00 that was absolutely delicious. We enjoyed shopping, eating and the beach in Playa. We ate at Ajuo's. Food and drinks were great, fairly priced and the waiters were incredible! Very entertaining and a lot of fun. We also ate at Karen's on fifth avenue. Two for one drinks all night (though not the cheapest rate in town), really good food and a live band. A great time was had by all. There is some contruction going on at the resort, but it didn't bother us at all.

Two friends, my mom and her boyfriend, and I went down there and had an amazing time. I've read some reviews that say it is best for couples or families, but as a teen, I was very impressed. We were outgoing and met tons of people and made friends with all the bartenders and entertainment staff. They all new us by name after only a few days. I would recommend the poolside bars, tramonto bar, and the nightly shows were fun. We got up on stage and danced. The pool is so warm with the heater and at first it almost hot, but it actually feels quite good. The pool is huge, I couldn't have dreamed it that big. We stayed in the mayan palace as opposed to to the grand mayan and loved it because it was sooo much closer to the pool and everything. We didnt want to have to walk for ten minutes. Ask for a room close to the pool, because ours was and was about a three to five minute walk to the lobby, but we didnt go down there too often. We did visit playa del carmen, but not cancun. Playa was fun. The beach was pretty rocky but beautiful and the mosquitos are absolutely awful down there. The jet ski/snorkel excursion is a lot of fun as well. It rained two nights and one day but fortunately the pool was still warm enough to swim in and was open all night so we would just stay out swimming. The maids and personel are very nice and helpful so remember to tip. In fact, everyone was very nice. On tuesday nights there is a trip with the hotel that takes you on a bus into Playa to Senor Frog's with open bar for 33 dollars which was a good deal. It was a lot of fun. And on thursday nights there is a three bar open-bar tour for around 50 or 60 dollars. Food is kind of expensive down there so I would recommend buying groceries in town. Also drinks can really run up your bill, but you can pay in cash or charge it to your hotel room. Also if you make friends with people they are likely to buy you a few drinks:) Everyday the entertainment staff is poolside with games, dance lessons, and often free drink tastings and demonstrations. They are a lot of fun, but some of the games are weird. You can lay out all over the pool, with an excess of chairs and such. Also, there are places all over inside the pool where your can lay out submerged in a few inches of water. And we drank the water down there just fine, had no problem with the tap water because it is filtered or whatever at the resort. The bottled water is kind of expensive. Pesos run about 10 for every American dollar and you can exchange them in the lobby for the best exchange rate or there is an ATM where you can use your bankcard and get up to $300 (3000 pesos) for a small fee(less than 5$) that it will charge you. Also be very careful making phone calls back home, bc most (if not all) phone cards wont work and so my friend made a few calls using her bankcard and it ended up costing her about 400 dollars with many overdraft fees. And if you have any questions about the weather, the hotel, or the cities, or whatever else, just ring up the concierge and they can answer most questions, just ask for english. They are a good source of information. Well, I hope this helped, and I hope you enjoy your trip.

We just got back from our vacation 7-16 to 7-23 at the Mayan Palace-Riveria Mayan and what a nightmare it was!!! First off we called prior to our arrival to see if the hotel/resort was well prepared for the arrival of Hurricane Emily and we were assured they were highly trained and prepared. Off we went like trusting fools to the airport. On our arrival we were told that they hadn't had a Hurricane hit since 1988, (how I ask you can employees under the age 30 be prepared for something they have never experienced?) We were taken to our suite that we purchased the previous year on our vacation to Playa del Carmen. Turns out it didn't sleep 10 as told and shown to us in their presentation. Luckily there were only three of us, my husband, my father & myself. We were told no problem, the sofa converts to a sleeper. Turns out the conversion was a drawer that rolls out from the bottom of the couch with a thin mattress. Poor dad had to sleep in what we called \"the drawer\". I was never so embarrassed! He tried the couch too, but it was harder than the bed in the next room. We arrived on Sat. & my hubby & dad we eager to hit their awesome golf course. They were told \"NO\" it is being closed down for the arrival of the hurricane. I'm no Tiger Woods, but what does it take to pull out the flags? Maybe a half hour?? So no golf was allowed that day! Off we went to check out the pool, which is huge and awesome, despite the fact it is only 3-1/2 feet deep or less all over???? The following day was Sun. and we didn't see much hurrying & scurrying being done for a category 5 hurricane due to hit in less than 24hrs. We ate breakfast, pricey but a good buffet and headed to the pool, we were ran out of there by noon, it had to be closed for the coming hurricane too! Back in our room the phone rang at 2:00 pm. informing us to pack a small bag with a change of clothes and to bring our pillows down to the lobby so we could be bused to the cyclone shelter. We were taken to a building (still on the same resort property) that was closer to the water than our hotel room was and they were packing (some 1500 plus people) into a building that was approved at 11:00am that day by the Mexican govt. to be called a cyclone shelter. Up the stairs we went like sardines to find a building that appeared to be a warehouse of some kind with many seperate rooms, no air conditioning and only a couple of fans. We were then placed in folding chairs with our knees touching a wall and told this would be our seats for the next 12 hrs. or more. NO WAY!!! You couldn't even get out of your row to use the restroom! We refused when we were told there was one exit and that it would be sealed and boarded shut once everyone was inside. Felt like a huge coffin to us! Off we went on foot back to our room where we made it as hurricane proof as possible by doing some fancy rearranging of furniture. Two other families followed suit with our idea! We then spent the night in the bathroom (the safest place to be) and at least we could use the potty and stretch out to get some sleep! Emily came through Mexico with a good fight but we won and I am happy to say the room withstood the high winds and flying debris from construction and breaking trees! What an experience! The next morning (Mon.) people were coming back to their rooms at daylight after being encrypted for some 14+ hrs. The resort lost power during the storm which meant all restaurants in the resort were closed. They opened a buffet for everyone in a half constructed building and then proceeded to try to charge $13.00 USD per person for a buffet of literally scrambled eggs, refried beans, yogurt, fresh fruit, coffee, milk & juice. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!! Needless to say we refused to pay for the only thing they could offer! (Well prepared my foot!) Although we had a rental car and there are taxis that only cost you an arm & leg, we were not allowed to leave the resort due to roads being closed from debris on them. We were told by a manager that if we didn't like it to go to Cancun and eat! WE DID!!! They had us where they wanted us and jacked the prices up! THE NERVE! Power was not restored until 3 days later at 10:30pm. During this time we had running water to shower but only lights in the hallways and a one watt bulb above the table! We were offered no candles or flashlights or anything for the rooms. Luckily we brought our own candles (just in case) so that we could see to use the restroom & shower! There was one ice machine for three floors in our building that of course could not make ice fast enough to accomodate everyone. No power meant no air conditioning which meant sleeping with the sliding glass doors of the balcony open and sweating to death. I awoke on Tues. morning to some 30+ mosquito bites and I looked like I had the chicken pox. Another guest that had the pox too, told me they would come up to spray our room for us, the resort failed to mention this service and neccessity. Oh, and did I mention that for a cup of coffee they wanted $3.00. PLEASE! Even Motel 6 gives you complimentary coffee! There was absolutely nothing to do at the resort at this point, the pool was closed due to half the so called beach being in it and no electric for filtration. The golf course was not opened for guests until Thurs. as we were repeatedly told it was too dangerous to play on! Then they had the audacity to charge you full price to play on it! Thank goodness Playa del Carmen got their s__t together quickly so we could eat and half way enjoy ourselves during the rest of our stay! At check out when we demanded some kind of reimburesment for their inconvenience, we were offered a FREE week at some other time during the next year for the low cost of $495.00 maintenance fee!!!! HOW IS THAT FREE???? Overall this resort is the pits, the staff was rude, not willing to accomodate in an emergency and in general very poorly managed!!!! The food and immenities are grossly over priced, you walk till you get a side ache to get to anything in the resort, the furnishings are low grade and uncomfortable and the walls are paper thin to sound (we know we must of had bored honeymooners next to us...or perhaps they were moaning from all those mosquito bites...who knows?) We definately regret buying a timeshare at this out of the way inconvenient resort...hurricane or not! Anyone interested in purchasing our red week cheap let me know, we won't be using them at the Riveria Mayan that's for certain! TWO THUMBS DOWN & ONE FINGER UP!

The maid service was outstanding, especially Rosa, she was a doll! Supplied everything we asked for quickly and always had a smile. The resort staff were great and always pleasant. The pool was amazing. It was warm and we never had a problem finding chaises in the shade. Securing the beds however, were a different story as most of those were taken early in the morning. Honestly, I think the people got up at 4AM to stake their claim on one. The pool service was good and happy hour was from 11 to 12 and 7-8 at the bar in Tramonto. Husband played golf twice and the course was in great shape. Price was $55 for all you can play including cart and clubs. In season, its $150 to play eighteen. Beach was as everyone mentioned not really swimable, but still lovely with hammocks and lounges. The rentals for jet skis, and sail boats were quite reasonable. Think it was 75 for jet skis, and 45 for sail boats. It costs more at the Jersey shore. The only observations not really complaints we had were the restaurants prices, the lack of direct free transportation from the resort to Playa del Carmen or Cancun, and the lack of adult activities in the evening. The restaurant prices were okay if you were a couple, but there were many families at this resort, with very young children who did not expect the incredibly high prices, also the resort is a distance from the nearest town, Playa del Carmen, which has grocery stores but the resort supplied no FREE. (the key is Free) transportation for them to travel on in order to purchase the groceries. We really felt that it would benefit the resort if they offered a free shuttle from the lobby to Playa for these services. Also, it would be great if they had a club for us night owls who like to dance and have a good time after 11PM. Yes, they had shows, bingo, a casino night, but everything was over around 11, and again getting to and from Playa or Cancun at 1AM can be a hassle. It would have been great if they had a shuttle running until then, we would have paid the 5 bucks for the ride. To sum it up, we had a good time.

We paid over $50 for two chicken sandwiches, 3 alcohol drinks and ice water. Paid over $30 for breakfast each morning. The room we stayed in had no coffee maker, no refrigerator and the worst view. We left 4 days early and spent over $400 to have our airplane tickets changed...which actually saved us money because for the 3 1/2 days we were there cost us over $1000 charged to our room. On the way home we started a journal of our experience and so far have 3 pages of a legal pad full and that\u2019s only through the 2nd day.

I have owned @ Mayan Resorts for over 5 years. It just gets better and better. 3 years ago when we visited this resort which was very much under construction, we were assured that we would love the finished product. It's still not finished, but it is impressive and beautiful. I can never say enough about the Mexican hospitality. I travel to Mexico 2-3 times a year to fish. This year we chartered a 53' Hatteras out of Puerto Adventuras, about 35 minutes south of the resort. Caught and released 2 sailfish, and caught 2 large Dorado, (Mahi-Mahi). Brought the fish back to the resort where we were staying in 3 grand Mayan suites with 19 other family members. Took the fish to the Tumtah resturant right on the beach, and for 12.00 usd a person they prepared the fish 3 different ways and served it with rice and vegetables. Absolutley first class. I have traveled all over the world, and the Mayan Resorts are truly 5 star offerings. Great Food, priced reasonalbly for the quality and presentation, Clean, comfortable, stylish rooms with great kitchenettes. Hospitality is unsurpassed. For those who write in poor reviews of the resort based on getting a gift for going to a time share presentation.....you get what you pay for. If you just want the freebie and have no interest in buying....they are sharks and will devour you. If you truly are looking for a top notch time share holding, then look at this place real seriously. They are getting ready to open in Cabo San Lucas, Buenas Aires, and Costa Rica. We have been to their resorts in Nuevo Vallarta and Acapulco. Aa far as the mosquito spraying...welcome to the tropics folks. Believe me, the alternative is worse than a good case of the measles. I will be back in December for some more relaxation and great weather. By the way, the concierge and their staff are great. The pool is wonderful, and despite other reviews I have read, there is plenty of shade available around the pool and on the beach. The Spa and Gym are of the same quality I have been to in Beverly Hills and the famous Bacarra Resort in Santa Barbara. This is a far better place to stay then along hotel row in Cancun....Like Miami Beach on Steroids.

I would consider myself to be a well traveled indivisual considering I am living in a hotel 2-3 weeks a month for work. I generally always stay at Starwood Hotels (Westin, St. Regis, Shearton, etc.); however, for this trip we decided to take a chance with the Grand Mayan. As a point of reference, the hotel is a \"dual\" property, which mean the property houses the \"Mayan Palace Hotel\" & \"Grand Mayan\". The difference is the \"Mayan Palace Hotel\" is considered to be the \"lower-end\" hotel facility in comparison to the \"Grand Mayan\". Most of the folks who stay at the \"Grand Mayan\" are timeshare owners. However, one could also pay per night, like a hotel, to stay in the \"Grand Mayan\". Our group worked out a deal with a timeshare owner and purchased their week from them, which was very cost effective. Hotel Review: The Grand Mayan is fantasic, rooms are very large with all high-end fixtures including two hot tubs in the bathroom areas and a \"cooling pool\" on the balcony. All marble flooring and stone counter tops. The hotel sits on a large piece of land and there will be considerable walking involved to move between your building and the lobby, pool and dinning areas; however, the walking would not be any more to a 5-10 minute walk at most. Pool: If I had to put a number on it, I would say 95% of the people who ultimately choose to stay at the this resort are doing so for the pool. It is the largest pool in Mexico and Central America. Personnally, having traveled to many \"water-themed hotels\" (e.g. Atlantis, Disney World, etc.) this pool is considerably larger than any I have seen elsewhere. Dinning: The hotel had good food by the pool for lunch, reasonably priced ($7-10 USD) for burgers, wraps, hot dogs, etc. The other rest. are good too; however, we found the one \"high-end\" rest. in the main building to be the best for steaks and pasta dishes. The \"high-end\" rest. was on average $30 USD a plate. Similar food you'd find at a nice steakhouse in the states. Timeshare: To be honest, every third review people post on this website regarding this hotel have to do with a \"horrible\" experience they had when they were suckered into the Mayan time share presentations. The first point I'd like to make is that \"ANY\" timeshare presentation, regardless if it's in Mexico is going to be a high-stress sales pitch. If those folks who complain on this site haven't figured it out, it's the timeshare sales people's job to sell you a product, they did not intend for you to get your free tickets and walk-out without trying every means of selling you on the property. For those who were suckered into the presentation and walked away with a sour taste in their mouth for the Mayan properties, I understand your fustration; however, the treatment you received from the independent time share sales folks in NO WAY represents the vacation experience someone would have at the hotel. My group was never approached by anyone from the timeshare sales teams. This is probably because we didn't give those people the time of day during the hotel check-in process. If you're straight and upfront at the start of our holiday vacation to not sit through the presentation you'll have a wonderful vacation. However, if you're trying to \"get something for nothing\", like 95% of the people who went to the presentation and wrote up a bad review subsequently, then you probably had the hassle coming to you for the \"free gift\". Nothing in life is free and if you would expect to get \"free tickets, upgrades, etc.\" without having to go through some pain first, then you're kidding yourself.

We had a great time but wish I had known or been mentally prepared for a few things. First of all, people aren't joking about the fumigation around 5:00. We arrived at that time, got gassed out and couldn't breathe in the lobby. The hotel is just huge. We were lucky enough to stay right by the pool. The pool was awesome - not too hot - my kids and I loved it. But the beach basically does suck because you can't really swim. Make sure you visit some of the gorgeous beaches down the way to get the real Riviera Mayan experience. So how come no one mentioned that when they mean rainy season in June, it's no joke. Pretty much stormed every day which wasn't so bad as it kept things cooler. But I wish I would have known. You can buy rain ponchos at the ecoparks, by the way. Show at Xcaret was fabulous!!! Driving down there was great once you got used to it. But I don't know why everyone recommends the free roads. We took the toll road to Chichen Itza, basically had the two lane, one way highway to ourselves and it only took 2 1/2 hours. On the way back, we took the free way, got stuck behind Mexican trucks, had to risk our lives passing, and it took four hours. You choose. So that's the scoop. The beaches are unbelievable and the Mayan ruins can't be beat. Highly recommend spending the night at Chichen Itza so you can see it before the crowds and heat.

All the bad things these people are saying in the reviews are absolutely the truth! First let me say we did not stay here, we were lored here under false pretenses. We had read all the warnings about time share people at the Cancun airport and we had no intention of gettig involved with any of them. We stayed at the Iberastar Paraiso Maya (and it was wonderful). We were intercepted at the airport by an airport employee who asked which hotel we were going to and he took us to a booth for our transportation. The representative there told us he worked for Olympus and they provide the transportation to Iberastar and he directed us to our van. He asked if we were planning any day trips during our stay. We said we planned to go to Tullum and he said we needed to make those arrangements through him. Then he told us they were opening a new hotel right next door to our hotel. Since there are 4 hotels in the Iberastar complex, we believed him. He went on to say if we'd come look at their new property they'd give us 3 tickets to Tullum and we'd just have to pay $93 for the 4th ticket. He said they'd transport us from our hotel at 9AM the next day and they'd have us back at the hotel by 10:30 and we could use our tickets to Tullum any day we wanted. We point blank asked if it was a time share pitch and he looked us in the eye and said no. So we agreed to look at the hotel. That night we got a confirmation call. Before they hung up they said to be outside the hotel because they weren't supposed to park there and please don't tell anyone where we were going because the hotel is jealous. Of course this raised a big red flag. The driver was parked at the lobby door the next morning but we hesitated to go because we were the only ones. We asked the doorman about it and he said something to the driver in Spanish and then told us that it was safe to go. We were taken next door to the Mayan Palace which was obviously under construction. There were many people already staying there. It took less than a second with the rep to know that we had been lied to. Once again we asked if it was a time share and we were told that it was an ownership. We said we were lied to and absolutely not interested. Another rep came out with a pitch and we agreed to just look at the property. It all appeared to be very nice but we could see loop holes and things between the line at every turn. We were eventually taken to a room filled with other victims talking to reps. The rep working on us was a very nice young man. It makes me sad to think he's gotten involved with that bunch of vultures all for the sake of a job. When he told us the price I told him it was absurd. That got him upset and another rep came along. This one was rude and obnoxious and started yelling at us about wasting their time. I yelled back that we had been misled and tricked into coming. I was very close to walking through the room telling everyone there that these people were nothing more than con men and liars. One rep told my husband that I need to learn that I can't say whatever I please in their country. Yeah, and they need to learn that no means NO! We realized after the fact that Mexico is a very chauvanistic country, the women never talk back so this guy didn't like me telling him off. Tough. I told him he had just made up my mind, we would NEVER buy 2 cents worth of anything from someone like him. He yelled for another guy to give us our money back and get us out of there. He said we were wasting his time because all we came there for was the free gift. I reminded him that we paid for one of those tickets and they were the ones who misrepresented themselves, we listened to their speel so we earned those tickets. This took us to another rep doing a questionnaire. It was going nowhere. My husband kept telling all of them that we would never buy anything on the spur of the moment, we had to have our accountant and lawyer look over the deal, we need to see it in writing. They kept putting numbers on paper and circling them hoping to confuse us and wear us down. I finally said that they were ruining our vacation, it was our first day there and we hadn't even been in the pool yet, they said we'd be back at the hotel by 10:30 and by then it was noon. We stood up to leave and they seperated us. One guy took me to get my tickets while a 7th guy tried to work my husband over. My husband watched and when we had the tickets in hand we bolted for the door. We were sure they were going to make us walk back to our hotel but they didn't. We shared a van with 6 others who were all outraged that this had happened. We were also sure our tickets to Tullum/ Xel-Ha were going to be worthless but they weren't. We held our breath until the bus pulled away from the hotel, though. One good thing about all of this, our daughters witnessed it and learned a valuable lesson that morning. Just stay away. We never did see the crocodille they claim they have in the lake but the sharks inside the hotel are much more dangerous! That's an elaborate set up, from the airport employees on down, all in cahoots. Even the hotel security guards were being paid off because they never questioned it when they opened the gate and they seemed to know the driver.

If you are looking for luxury, then the mayan palace certainly has it! We were booked in as a guest and originally had one week in the mayan palace and the second week in the grand mayan. Upon arrival we were greeted and asked if we were interested in up grading to the grand mayan for the full 2 weeks and accepting a 15 percent discount off all our bills, in return for going to a 90 minute timeshare talk. We had been to a talk last year so we knew what were letting ourselfs in for and agreed. The timeshare talk did last only 90 minutes as we told them right from the start we had no intension of purchasing and we were only interested in the upgrade and the 15 discount, which they accepted after a short period of time and allowed us to go after breakfast. this left us 2 weeks to enjoy our holiday. The Mayan palace has a no cash policy which means everything you purchase is placed against your room number and you sign a ticket, which is great as it makes you feel like you are on an all inclusive!! The Grand Mayan was spectacular, you could not fault the cleaniness or the cleaning staff, the maid cleans the room twice a day and at night turns down the bed and leaves little chocloates on the bed and the lamps on. The resturants are excellent quality and about average price for a good meal, you can eat on a cheaper budget by ordering pizzas etc, but do try the Tramonto resturant, its the italian resturant with lovely choice and an opportunity to purchase a good bottle of wine with your meal. The waiting staff are very good, and call you by your name on arrival. Be aware of the mossiqutto's they are everywhere, as the resort is surrounded by water. The swimming pool is fantasic, we didnt find it too warm which people have said in previous reports, however it was a bit dirty which did suprise us for the standard rating of the resort. There are always available sunbeds, however you will be lucky to get the luxury chasis lounge, as people reserve these at 6am, you are not suposed to reserve these and the security guard will offer them to you if he has not seen anyone return to the reserved beds within an hour, so make sure you find the security guard and ask him which one is available! We never wanted to use these but saw many people fighting to so called reserve them!! which was quite amusing! The beach is lovely however it is difficult to swim in the sea due to the coral reef, however if you walk to the right of the hotel and continue for about 10 minute you will reach a lovely golden sandy part of the beach with sandy swimming area and hardy anyone around. The sea was lovely and warm. Overall we had a lovely stay and could not fault the quality of the resort, however the resturants did get a bit 'the same' i think they could do with more variety, but i guess they will when the building work has been completed.

The people for friendly enough but did not speak a lot of english. The maids did a ok job of cleaning, they didn't throw away empty bottles which was kind of irratating and we only got turn down one night which was upsetting as well but the night we did was great, that did towel swans, one had veil made of toilet paper! and we also got a bottle of champagne from the hotel. There is a lot of construction going on but was not noticable to the ears anyway. And we had trouble with our door getting the lock to unlock and had trouble getting someone to come and look at it. They drinks and bartenders were awesome! The drinks sometimes were on the strong side but they were all good, ask for the menu, they have a list of specialties. All the food was yummy and beautifly presented but suprising enough they don't have a mexican food place for dinner! Also don't expect any custom made dishes. I asked for ice cream, which is served during the day, but they wouldn't serve it at dinner...Also take the advice of others about the beach, would not swim there, I thought it would be fine since I'm not a big swimmer and swim shoes are for sissys but wait and go to play del carmen. I cut my foot when swimming at the resort. The resort seemed to be more for a family vacation, several kids were about and on your honeymoon thats the last thing you want to be around, some kid splashing next to the swim-up bar. If we were to go again we definetly would go to playa and stay there, we found hotels that were a 50-100 a night that were perfect to just spend the day on the beach. We went to playa 4days out of the week that we stayed and hug out at \"The Blue Parrot\" a beach resturant that had awesome fish tacos. We also ate at the italian place on the resort and the food was not the best if you were comparing it to a 5star gourmet resturant but the 3 ice cream dessert in a chocolate box is to DIE for!!!

They act as resort hosts, telling you where to find your room; restaurants, etc. Then they make the pitch for the presentation. They make the deal sound very sweet, which I'm sure they have to in oder to get people to go. Just say no! ROOMS Upgrade to the Grand Mayan if you can. The non-suite rooms at the Mayan Riviera have two double beds; the Grand has a king, the rooms are bigger and have nicer bathrooms. At check-in, I asked if any king rooms were available and we got the upgrade. By contrast, friends we were traveling with asked for an upgrade outright and were told the'd have to pay $150/night or go to the time share presentation. Might depend on who you ask, might be how you ask - but we were very happy to get the upgrade. The bed was a bit hard, but comfortable. The bathroom was gorgeous and included a spa tub, though the water pressure as it filled was horrible. POOL It is a 10 minute walk to the pool/beach, but it's a scenic journey (ours passed a small lagoon - the home of a live crocodile!). If you're going to spend your day lounging in a beach chair, a pretty 10 minute walk tolerable. And the pool is awesome! We never had trouble finding four chairs together. Though the palapas go quickly, there is shade to be found under numberous palm trees. And 2 for 1 drinks from 11-12 daily! FOOD We found the food on the resort to be excellent and priced fairly for the quality and portions. The spa (which is beautiful) has a snack bar with fresh smoothies, muffins and sandwhiches. You don't have to pay the gym/spa-use fee to eat at snack bar. There is only one other cheap dining option - room service - and the quality is mediocre. Our favorite meal was Carribean buffet at Balche. No matter how hot it is, try the clam chowder -YUM! Thursday's Mexican fiesta was ok - a great deal if you're a drinker because it's all inclusive. We did not particularly care for the show. SITE SEEING Playa is an easy, fun trip. The bus is $1, but it makes frequent stops. The snorkling at Xel-Ha was amazing.

We arrived and were greeted with more staff than we could have imagined and even though there were alot of people arriving at the same time, we were checking in within in minutes and advised that our room was ready and within 1/2 hour we were given our room key. The room was more than we expected. As my husband and I were travelling with our two children, daughter 16 and son 13, we had a room with one bedroom and kitchen. The bedroom was large and plenty of living space. Kitchen was well equiped (toaster, blender, coffee maker, all utensils and fridge). The staff was so helpful, that if you were missing anything, they would be more than accommodating. I did bring along ziploc bags for storage for any leftovers for the fridge and storing open food. Most of any essential are available on site at the convenience store and we found the prices to be reasonable. We found that buying water and milk was almost the same price as Playa Del Carmen and we did not have to cart all the heavy items back with us if we were in Playa. The kids enjoyed use of the computers to keep in touch with home ($7.00 for 1 hour or $4.00 for 1/2 but cheaper than phoning). As far as time share presentation, we were asked once and when we declined we did not hear from them again. The staff were amazing. The maid service twice a day with turn down in the evening with chocolates was very nice touch. We made sure we tipped the maid each day. The pool activities directors were great and kept our kids busy every day and got to know them on first name basis. Lots of fun for the kids, they enjoyed the pool so much that a couple of days we decided to spend just by the pool. As far as the pool goes, it was the most amazing pool I have ever seen, it is huge. The swim up bars are fun with the bartenders sending a joke or two. You can bring your own coolers to the pool area with your own drinks and they do not mind (bring plastic cups or travell mugs to keep drinks cool) We did spend time at the ocean it is not the greatest for swimming as there is coral so it would not be for small children. We did do snorkelling on site and well as kayaking. The snorkelling was fun and plenty of varieties of fish to see. As far as the beach, it was very nice. Many times we would spend evenings watching the cruise ships go by with their lights on or go for a swim at the pool. This resort is very clean and the most friendly staff than could not do enough for all of us. Bringing children to this resort is no problem and in fact, go out of their way for the kids. We found that the restaurants were fairly good. The kids enjoyed the restaurants by the pool were they could get a good variety of foods from hamburgers to salads. The breakfast buffet is very good $14.00/person and we would take advantage of this buffet if we were planning on going off the resort for the day. I would suggest to get most of your groceries in Playa Del Carmen and we did take a taxi the first time ($20.00 each way) but we then took the bus Mayab which runs on the hour and you can get picked up right outside the resort gate and dropped off on your return home. The resort will then give you a ride from the front gate to the lobby. Our kids did go para sailing and we found it was cheaper in Playa Del Carmen than on the resort. We also took a day and went on the ferry to Cozumel - very pretty. We found a cab driver and gave him $50.00 and he gave us a tour around the island and showed us some great local spots which was one our memorable days. It is nice to see the real Cozumel outside the tourist area. We did find eating in Cozumel a little more expensive than Playa. The ferry ride can get a little rough so be aware. In regards to the hotel, we had read reviews about all the construction, but it did not bother us at all. Our hotel room was the close to the lobby so it was the the far to the pool and we also read reviews that their was a lot of walking to the pool. This was not an issue for us or our kids, walking along the pathway to the pool was beautiful with the lovely gardens they have growing and if you did not want to walk, then you could get a ride by the hotel in one of their carts. For the very elderly this may be an issue but for us, we were on holidays and with the great food and drinks we had all we, we enjoyed the stroll! The evening shows which are free were quite nice. Only the Mexican night is not free as it is a dinner show. We found that our bill for the entire week was reasonable - $898.00 for all our food, internet, groceries on site, snorkelling and kayak on site and this was for all 4 of us.

Check-in and check-out: both were easy and quick. Rooms: We had a 2 room suite in the Grand Mayan for the 6 of us which was very nice; stove top but no oven; microwave; plenty of dishes and silverware; dull cutting knife. Good housekeeping. One of the rooms had a jacuzzi which was wonderful and relaxing after a long, hot day sight seeing or just lazing by the nice pool. Resort: fumigation for mosquitoes and bugs occurs between 5-8pm so keep your doors closed. Beautifully manicured grounds; can see lots of birds, iguanas, a deer, and crocodiles. Small grocery store has basic items. Everything is charged to room so you don't have to deal with Visa or cash. Water/ice is purified and acceptable to drink. Staff: every was very nice and helpful. Majority of staff speaks at least a little English to help out. Transportation: Mayan Palace is about 30 minutes from Cancun and 20 minutes from Playa del Carmen. You can take the Mayab (big bus) or Playa Express (smaller 18-20 person bus) for $1 US each way per person; can catch a ride to main gate, then CAREFULLY cross the street and wait off the road for either bus to pick you up. You pay as you get off the bus. Bus station in Playa is by Juarez and 5th Ave and we didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes for a bus (except for one day we waited an hour due to a bus breakdown). Did not take a taxi as they were expensive. If you have an early morning flight (like we did) and have lots of luggage (as we did), suggest you let the hotel arrange for transportation from resort to Cancun airport (approx. $15 US per person) as the transportation is very dependable and efficient. Food and drink: tasty but overpriced; drinks expensive (abouty $7 US per drink) and watered down. Happy hours while we were there was from 11-noon at the pool and 7-8pm at the restaurant above the grocery store. There is a Sam's Club about 30 minutes from the resort, or a grocery store in Playa (more expensive on meats than in Phoenix); be aware of timeshare folks who scour the grocery store for people with resort bracelets on. Timeshare presentations: we own 2 timeshares but did participate in a 2 hour timeshare presentation (included a very nice breakfast for all 6 of us; kids (19-25 years old) stayed at the resort (Fisherman) or on the beach. We received a bottle of tequila, $33/pp tickets to C. Izen pyramids, and free admission to Xhe-Ha. To us it was well worth the 2 hours as we knew we would not purchase and no hassle when we said no. Fisherman is a beautiful resort and they do have a nice package. Climate: about 94 degrees F and humid; light sprinkles 2 of the evenings. Security: we didn't have any trouble, but the girls went to a club (resort sponsored) and one girl had her wallet stolen from her back pocket. You have to be aware of safety wherever you go; even in the states. Playa del Carmen: Nice beach at Mamitas (beware if you take small children of topless sun bathing mainly by the Europeans).

After returning to Isla Mujeres, I confronted the Mayan Palace agents who sent me down there and they told me that they don't tell people that it's a timeshre presentation because it scares them away. These timeshare folks are everywhere and they lie to unsuspecting tourists to get them to presentations which last 4 to 5 hours. I had to hire a Mexican lawyer to cancel my cantract.

We exchanged through RCI and stayed in a one-bedroom suite. There is construction going on but we were never bothered by the noise and our room was near the work. We were on the ground floor looking out to beautiful gardens. The grounds on the entire resort are lovely, there are always many workers caring for them. We found the facilities to be very clean and the staff helpful. As for the timeshare sales, we were asked once upon check-in and never again. We did inform the representative that we had read many negative reviews of the tactics used and she actually wrote down the tripadvisor web address!!! They do offer free excursions, a 15% reduction on resort charges and an upgrade to the Palace, but none of that was worth the vacation time we would miss, so we declined. The pool is a distance from most rooms but we enjoyed the winding path through the gardens, or chose to walk the inside hallways during the heat of the day. The shade around the pool is limited and guests do reserve the palapa beds and chairs very early. I am an early riser so we were able to get a bed on most days we stayed at the resort (by 6:00 AM at the latest). Bring a blanket from the room and enjoy the sunrise, then nap.There is an employee passing out flyers discouraging the practice of reserving chairs and beds with personal belongings. The funny thing is, he was handing them to those of us physically occupying the chairs, and never left the notes on those reserved with towels or suntan lotion! Despite the written warning that belongings left unattended longer than an hour would be removed, they never once enforced it. The pool is fantastic and we enjoyed the swim up bars! The new spa and gym is great. If you are an owner, the use of the equipment is free. Others must pay a $10 per day charge (kind of steep for a run on a treadmill)! Many walkers and runners do laps around the grounds and lagoon in the cool of the morning. We brought some groceries with us such as bagels, lunch items and snacks (leaving room in luggage on the return trip for gifts), and ate other meals onsite.We also packed a small softside cooler and icepack for pool trips. Although the groceries in the store are a little on the high side, we did buy a few things there rather than lug food back from PDC. They say the room water is purified, but still recommend drinking bottled water. We bought the large bottlles in the store, rather than the smaller ones available for a fee in the rooms. The restaurant meals were good. We especially liked the huge breakfast buffet at Lago for $14. We would eat late and skip lunch. We enjoyed the atmosphere at Tumtah right on the beach, and had a couple of meals there. We found the meal prices very comparable to those at home and the tips are figured into the total bill. 2 for 1 happy hour takes place at poolside from 11-12 each day; we ordered cans of beer and a bucket of ice to \"keep us cool\"! We only spent about $500 on food and beverages at the resort. Due to construction, the resort is issuing notices warning guests not to cross the highway to get transportation south to PDC. We did notice some guests doing, so. We traveled to Xel Ha on public transportation - taxi to PDC, collectivo to Xel Ha. We also used the Mayabus back to the resort form PDC one evening. The highlight of our trip was the Mayan Encounter Tour through Altournative. This was a trip to Coba, a visit to a Mayan Village, zipline, canoe, and rapel into a cenote. What a day! I highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure, looking for an alternative to the usual tourist trips. We loved the Mayan Palace and will eagerly return should the opportunity arise. Just heed the numerous pervious posts and say no to the orientation/timeshare sales presentation, unless you are willing to give up most of a day of your vacation! The upgrade to the Grand Mayan was tempting, but as the week went by, we found we spent very little time in our lovely room at the Palace as it was!

I did my homework and read the many reviews before going so I pretty much knew what to expect so there were few surprises. We arrived early so our rooms were not ready but we were at the pool within 15 minutes of our arrival. They do not have a changing area so they offered us the bathrooms off of the lobby to change in, which were small and cramped for changing. Let me begin by saying I am not an owner, I paid the maintenance transfer fee's required in a trade since my parents are owners at another Myan Resort. This being the case we were tagged (red wristband) differently than owners (beige wristband). If you are an owner and your room is not ready I strongly suggest you go to the spa near the pool to change where they have lovely locker rooms, showers for you to use at no charge. They charge guests to use the spa facility 100 pesos a day vs nothing for owners. Even if you are not an owner you can try this but I'm not sure you'll get through. If not you can change in one of the bathrooms by the pool. Another hint if you are going to the pool after working out bring your clothes with you to the gym and shower there. It is really nice and they have everything you will need so you won't have to trek all the way back to your room. For transportation we mainly used the public services. The hotel has a very good shuttle service to the main gate where you can go North to Cancun via the bus for 25 pesos pp or cross the highway to go South to Playa del Carmen for 10 pesos by bus, 20 pesos if a van stops. I found this service very efficient and never waited more than 5 minutes for a hotel shuttle. You pay one price no matter where you get picked up or dropped off at depending on what direction you go in. Just get off at the last stop for both and you will be in either downtown Cancun or Playa depending on your direction. The same cabs from the lobby will charge you 1/2 price to go wherever you want to go if you get them from the street vs the hotel (probably has to do with some kind of kickback?) and definitely barter. We have gotten them down to $2 pp from the street or $6 for two for a ride to wherever we wanted to go in Playa. RE: bus stations. If you go to Cancun the express buses for 25 pesos directly back to the Myan are located outside of the bus terminal. Look for the white vans. In Playa for your return always go to the bus station again out side the station you will see a line of taxis waiting to take you wherever. Go past them to the white vans and simply say \"Myan Palace\" and they will direct you to the correct van. It will cost you 20 pesos per person to return via the van but I highly recommend this service for night travel. Very easy, and reasonable and safe. Be on guard that they will not leave until the van is completely full and you will be traveling with the locals. If you do not want to wait (which is not very long) the going rate would be about $15 per cab for the return + tip (faster just a little more costly). Our teenage children (16+) took the vans without us and never had a problem either, that is how safe we believed it to be. One other note, if you get the resort transfers from the airport to the resort. Get your luggage and proceed directly outside to the vans, taxis and buses. You will see a booth that says \"Myan Palace\" and they will quickly get you to the correct van/bus. Do not stop anywhere right outside the first set of doors once you pass through customs. These are the timeshare people, ignore them and just go to the next set of doors to the outside. Trust me on this one, I realized their scam right away when they said Myan Palace over here, I listened for 30 seconds than realized these people were scamers. You're tired, and if it is your first time you can easily look for help in all the wrong places. RE: Spa/gym. Very nice. Spinning almost everyday at 8:30. Lots of new equipment and never crowded. Owners can use it for free, guests (red wristband for 100 pesos a day). Since I enjoy a good workout everyday I got them to give me a 20% discount so I paid 480 pesos for 6 days. In retrospect 5 days would have been plenty because you do get a lot of exercise walking around all day. We had two seperate bedrooms not a suite and we were in the building closest to the lobby so we had the furthest walk but we actually enjoyed it. The walk is very scenic and nice. RE: snorkeling/beach. I read a lot of reviews about there being no beach. WRONG. I live at the beach in NJ so I can assure you it is fine. There was plenty of sand, chairs, shadded spots, hammocks. Never was there any problem finding a spot to lay in. I will say swimming in the water is tricky because of the rocks. I highly recommend that you buy reef shoes prior to going if you want to snorkel/swim at this beach. Not advisable for young children. I had no problems at all, besides the shoes for snorkeling I recommend gloves also. Nobody and I mean nobody suggested we snorkel from their beach but it was excellent. They have set up an artificial reef right off of the beach. They call them bells and you can see the tops of a couple from the beach. They are loaded with tropical fish. Since it is usually very windy the gloves will help you to hold on when a wave crashes down on you while you are in the reef area. I learned the hard way.......go in the early morning when there is less wind for the best snorkeling and you will have a very good time, it was in the afternoon when I really needed the gloves. My boyfriend and I also snorkeled in the Island off of Cancun. We took the ferry over and hired a local boat for $50 for one hour. We got there late around 3:30 in the afternoon so tours were not an option for us. The dive people we used were on the North beach close to the ferry so it was very convient and very fun. We also tried Cozumel but on the day we went it was very stormy and the company we hired in advance was late so we cancelled on them. They actually left us on the dock saying the boat was late and they'd be right back, we figured they would not come back until the boat was back so we left. We complained upon returning back to the Myan and they refunded us the money on our credit card, so word to the wise book your tours thru the Myan even if you find the company on the internet which is what we did. The local companies value the Myan's business very much. Also if you take the ferry be forwarned that if it's windy the boat will rock. Three of the four of us felt very ill upon arriving in Cozumel. The ride back was much better. Don't do what we did, eat before going. Wait until you get to the other side. RE: Food-the children we were with ate at the breakfast buffet and enjoyed it, besides that we had their pizza several times, club sandwhich, fish sandwhich, and a few other snacks. The breakfast buffet was pricey but other than that the lunch menu items were reasonable-$8 to $10 range. I would recommend splitting something first if you are not starving or a big eater because the portions are huge. If you order from table service they will always give you a free appetizer. You need not tip because they add 20% gratuity to everything automatically. To save money buy your drinks-juices, beer, sodas in town. We did not have a refrigerator so we brought collapsable coolers which worked out perfectly for us to keep things cool. Ice machines are everywhere so ice is not a problem. In the evenings we ate in Playa Del Carmen-La Parilla is excellent in both Cancun and Playa, plus we ate at this place called Aqua Casa (the name might be a tad off but it's close), it is on a busy corner a couple of blocks south of the bus station if you're looking at the water on 5th Ave. It is a very romantic place for couples to enjoy a fabulous dinner, we had lobster, and mahi mahi + a nice bottle of wine for about $110.00 US. The key here is the restaurant is on the second level. The best Cuban food for anyone who likes it is to the right of the bus station to the north if you're facing the water. Go to where the street ends/curves than 1/2 block on your left and you will see it. Ask anybody for directions because it is the only Cuban restaurant in Playa. Tons of places to eat in Playa, just read the reviews-breakfast buffet on 5th is good for around $5. Drinks are plentiful everywhere, silver is cheap and don't pay full price for anything unless it is food in a convenience store. The shop at the Myan is very limited so you will want to travel for supplies. RE: Time Share presentations. I never had a problem at all at the Myan. They invited us when we checked in to go for a free breakfast and we declined and that was the end of it. We had two rooms and never once did we receive a phone call to attend anything. In town everyone treated us like royality when they saw we were staying at the Myan. The timeshare people in Playa were very good sources of information for us when we were looking for anything in town. In life nothing is free, so when you are offered something be forwarned you WILL have to spend your vacation time listening to a presentation in order to get your gift. Transfers: I booked my return via the hotel both ways. My boyfriend and two children left via a cab. Cost $15 pp if the resort books, $27 for a cab to the airport if you do it on your own. They have some station wagon cabs for people with luggage. My only disappointment was a major scare upon leaving. You must check out of your room by 10 a.m. Since my transfer was not until 11 a.m. I left my luggage with the bellman at the front enterance. I showed them my transfer voucher and they assured me it was okay to leave it. When I returned at 10:55 they could not find my luggage. We frantically looked through hundreds of pieces and could not find it. I did not freak out but I was feeling stressed because they did not speak good English and they had no idea how to help me. Luckily, another bellman came by and told me he had moved my luggage to a side entrance because that was where the bus was going to park to load us up for the airport. Nobody and I mean nobody out of at least a half a dozen bellman could relay this information to me. Luckily the ending was good, I got to the bus and got to the airport without further adue. RE: Pools-very nice. We are beach people so we did not spend any time by the pools but we could see there was amble space for everyone. There were activities daily that we just never had time to participate in. Towel service is by the pool. You must return your towels every evening before 9 p.m. or they will charge you. This happened to us because the children lost their towel card but we had the 600 pesos charge removed the next day without any hassels. Just read your bill every few days if you charge a lot to ensure you're not being billed for something you did not do or eat. I hope this information is helpful. I know I valued the reviews before my trip. One last bit, if you are going in the very near future they began road construction in front of the hotel the day before we left. They will discourage you from using public transportation. We ignored them, the buses still stopped and we still got to Playa with no problem but I cannot say for any certainty that it will be as easy getting to Playa with the construction. Returning is the same, just pick up the van at the bus station. I could never figure out how to get the 10 pesos bus back and did not want to because the van service was very easy.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cNice place, but buyer beware - here are the facts....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3376956", "Content": "On a recent 7 day stay here is what you can count on.. The Hotel - The place is very nice (Grand Mayan, not the smaller older buildings which are like a standard Holiday Inn room). So insist on staying in the Grand Mayan. Staff are pleasant and helpful. Yes they do spray for bugs so keep your balcony doors closed when not there, but not a problem if you do. The pools are vast and nice to look at, but lack character...expansive and only three ft. deep isn't good for much more than the occassional dip to cool off. Be on the lookout for the guys who blare loud disco music most of the day and position yourself far away if you want quiet. Shady spots are challenging to find at mid-day, but you can often find two spots in the morning, or try the few on the beach which many overlook. The Timeshare Stuff - They pitch you the moment you enter the lobby. If you say no, you might get stuck in the lesser property. Our room was so poor a trade for our HI timeshare we decided to brave the presentation so we could get the upgrade. They say 90 min., but they don't count the buffet breakfast (which adds an hour) so skip the breakfast to get through quickly. A Some guy said to just keep saying no and I agree. This is Amway all over again. Hard sell to be sure. Lots of drawings of boxes and numbers flying all over which you'd need an accountant to verify to make sense. When the first person senses you're not biting they pass you off to another \"team\" which they told us would simply complete a short survey. Turned out to be a second last ditch pitch with \"better\" offers to bait you. Bottom Line - any reputable upscale property (or any comodity for that matter) never has to resort to the high pressure, intrusive and predictable \"used car sales\" pitch tactics they use here. Despite their making good on the discounts they promised us, we will NEVER subject ourselves to it again. Run, don't walk. Transportation - The cab fare of $18 into Playa is a ripoff. You can catch the Playa Express van (12 seater with many locals but its no issue) outside the front entrance for $1 US per person. You pay about $3 per person to ride in a large, air cond. Greyhound style bus back to the entrance (bus depot is right on 5th St.). The hotel has a pickup dropoff shuttle to the lobby every 5 minutes. Playa - Its about a 15 min. ride to central Playa (which is pretty much just 5th St. unless you're fond of poverty and filth). You will tire of the people bugging you so be ready to ignore them - your best defense. Mostly T-shirts, corona paraphenalia and other junk. And most disappointing - prices have gone sky high! Mexico is no longer a bargain anywhere, especially the food. The days of the $8 surf and turf have been replaced with the $32 price tag, so don't expect any deals. We kept commenting how we pay just as much in Hawaii!! One or two days in Playa is enough. Cozumel is no better, but at least you can rent a scooter for two and circle the island for $35 and see more beach and catch a nice breeze. Beach - At the hotel, worthless - too rocky. Wandering up and down a bit better. In Playa its nicer but an equal mix of sand and cigarette butts makes it challenging to enjoy. Surprisingly, we found the best beach to be at the ruins at Tulum. Yes - bring your suits and go down the wood steps to a small but very clean and pure white sand beach! Tulum Ruins - they need to close this place down for a few months and clean it up. Garbage strewn about, landscaping refuse piled up, poor facilities. Unless your and archeaology buff, I wouldn't go out of my way... Xcaret Water Park - A complete and utter waste of money ($52 US per person). If the thrill of snorkeling through a \"river\" that more resembles a NY sewer is your bag - have fun. Less fish than Band-aids on the bottom... Cancun - The South of the Border Arkansas. Mullets, incessant smoking, drunks, NASCAR shirts, beer bellies and tattoos everywhere. Nuff' said. Summary - This place is OK but we won't be going back, more because of how pricey yet filty Mexico has become and remains. If we're going to spend this much, we'd rather be on a Carribean island without all the junk stores, aggressive street hawkers and depressing poverty.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington ON, Can", "Title": "\u201cWe had an awesome family holiday\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3374544", "Content": "We went to the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya from April 2nd to April 9th and had an awsome time. Two adults and two kids 11 and 9. We were looking for a relaxing vacation and found it here. The staff were great whether it was in the resaurant overlooking the ocean or in the store in need of some quick supplies. The pool was unbelievable it was huge with many different areas for playing with the kids and swimming calmly on our own. For three days I got up early and went down (6:00am) to reserve a palapa (with the mattress). Unlike some of the others we did not elect to simply come down drop our stuff and then come back in 2 or 3 hours (which I imagine was annoying for others). It was great to lay down and watch the sun come up and then read for a few hours until the rest came down. The days we didn't have it were great but getting one was decadent. We did not stay in the Grand Mayan but were in building 2 of the Riviera Maya which was a minute from the pool and the room was clean, bright and very comfortable. We spent 6 of the 7 days at the resort (Xelha on the other) and it was amazing. The organized events around the pool were fun and the kids loved the ceramic painting, foozeball, ping pong and henna tattoos. We rented a car right from Budget on the resort to go to Xelha (total of about $80US including gas). The drive was not exciting but it allowed us to keep our own schedule and the cost compared to the tours was significantly less. We also stopped at the grocery store (right off 307) in Playa Del Carmen to pick up supplies for the week. We used the pick-up service from the hotel concierge when we arrived. It was a little more expensive than a cab (not at all if you only have 2) but it was nice to have something prearranged. Note if you do this you can skip all of the local tourist \"help\" in the airport. Once you grab your bag you just walk right by the \"welcomers\" go out the door and look for the Royal stand.

I got the golf, clubs, and cart for two for $40.00 total. Considering how much golf costs in Mexico, it was a heck of a deal. The golf was very nice. No one else was on the course from Noon to 5:00 pm when we were there. I saw one other couple and that was it the whole time. The people there said they have almost no one on the course Thursday through Saturday. The course is a tough little par 3 (water everywhere - which explains the five hour play for us).

The trick to timeshare presentations is to use your DARE (Drug Awareness and Resistance Education for those of you who haven't been to public school in awhile) skills. Particularly, \"broken record\". If you don't like the product, just say \"I'm not interested\" and not a word more. It rattles even the smarmiest salesperson. I said it literally 14 times in a row. Next, when the 90 minutes is up and they show no intention of stopping, stand up. That shifts the power and makes it clear to the other 70 couples in the room that something is going on. Stay on your message of not interested, raising the volume a little every time. When they say you are rude, you say \"And I'm not interested\". When they tell your husband he is not a real man because he just caves to you, say \"We're not interested.\" When they try to literally stare you down, stare back and say \"I'm not interested.\" You get the idea, it's kind of fun when you recognize the absurdity of the whole thing. At one point, I turned to my husband and said, quite loud, \"Oh my God, I think they're scamming us! They never intended this to go only 90 minutes and they won't give us the gift! I can't believe I fell for this!\" We were done in 10 minutes from there. This may be a nice place, but it is known as one of the hardest and least truthful of the hard sells - even among timeshare industry people. They use classic, illegal tactics like conning you into waiving a cooling off period, lying about equity, and misrepresenting costs and re-sale options. Even if I could afford it, I wouldn't give money to people who work with these sheisters. If you go here, you may be laying down in a lovely place, but you are lying with dogs.", "Date": "April 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201ca beach vacation without a view of the beach\u201d", "Author": "roseluvs2travel", "ReviewID": "UR3329348", "Content": "Imagine booking a beach vacation at an upper end resort where the average walk to the beach/pool area is 10-15 minutes.

Far cry from the 85/Sunny temps & perfect weather in Mexico the week of 3/26 - 4/2. My husband and I brought our 18 & 19 yr old kids and a couple of their friends on this trip. We stayed at the Mayan Palace and had 2 rooms with a kitchen/Living Room area with sofas- turn sleepers. The rooms were more than spacious and the staff at Mayan were very cleaniness oriented. We had our beds turned down each night with chocolates provided. Very nice touch that I was not expecting. Our first day we took a trip into Playa Del Carmen and went to the grocery store. This was an experience for us since neither one of us speaks spanish. Most of the packaging was in spanish and their Milk/Orange Juice is not refridgerated so it took us a while to find it sitting on an shelf. This was weird, however once refridgerated it was better than our milk/OJ in the states. We went to Chedraui's, very similiar to a Meijer's. It was fun and interesting. We bought beer, breakfast, lunch, & snack food to try to keep our expenses at the Palace minimal. We spent $85.00 dollars at the grocery which was enought to last us through the week. We only ate a couple dinners at the Palace and they were average. The kids ate a times at the snack hut by the pool and they said the food was good. Average lunch was $20.00 for two of them. Overall, for six of us, our charges for food, boutique & drinks ran under $800.00. Which I think is pretty good. Since everything got charged to our credit card, it provided us the ability to monitor if our kids were charging alcoholic drinks... this was kind of a bummer for them because they thought they would be able to use their own money for drinking...but they would not accept any cash or other credit cards. The boys bused it up to Cancun a couple nights on their own and they returned safely both times - no problems. We was worried about sending them out on their own intially but it worked out. We did not allow the girls (17 & 18) to venture off on their own. There was not much to do at the Palace for the age group of 16 - 21 in the evenings which made for a boring evening for them. We went into Play del Carmen 4 nights. The daytime activities were fun, they had beach volleyball, water aerobics, competition games which involved all ages. Ceaser & Ilam played music and kept everyone entertained most of the afternoon. We did hear that you don't want to be out on the beach after dark and noticed that the armed guards walked the beach in the mornings. I always felt safe at the facility. We found out that the Playa Shuttles are the best way to travel to/from Playa. It cost a $1.00 there and $1.00 - $2.00 for the return trip. You can catch them at the front of the facility. You can also get bus transportation, however don't get on the buses that don't look 'official. We got on a tour bus that looked like it was independently owned (red velvet curtains) and they packed us on. The official buses have MAYAB or ALDO written on them and you see them all over. We only used a taxi once and that was when we returned from the grocery store, the return trip was $17.00. You had to cross a 6 lane freeway in front of the Palace to catch the bus to Playa which is a downfall. Cars speed by at what seems like 100mph, if I had younger kids...this would have made me very nervous. We went to Cancun's Hotel Zone one day on a bus. The trip there took us about 1 hour / 15 min. The longest part was getting from the bus station in Cancun to the Hotel Zone as it made several stops along the way. It was nice and worth the trip. We also took the ferry over to Cozemel one day and went snorkeling. The ferry ride was $9.00 one way and took about 35 minutes. I decided to shop while the others went snorkeling. I had a nice time strolling the streets and felt safe doing so and they had a nice time snorkeling. We had a great time and I would definately go again and stay at Mayan Palace. The first night we got there they mentioned that someone would call us about saving 15% on our bill and I asked if it was related to time-share and she said yes. I politely said that we already belonged to a vacation club and was not interested in the timeshare information. Never heard from anyone the rest of the trip. You do have to beware of people trying to suck you into things starting at your arrival at the airport and as you walk through Play del Carmen. My recommendation is that you research and know what you're looking for when you get there so you don't trapped into anything you are not ready for. We had read about the construction at the Mayan so we were prepared for that, it would have been nice if it was not under construction but we were not disappointed since we had read about it first. We were right next to the site and some mornings were were woke up by bull dozers beeping, but it was not at an unreasonable hour and we spend most of our days away from our rooms so it wasn't that big of a deal. We attended their Mexian Fiesta at the Mayan which is a buffet/open bar/ entertainment for the evening. The cost was $44.00 a person/ $17.00 for kids. It was something different to do and the facility they have it at is very, very cool. I would recommend it if you can eat/drink enough to cover the $44.00 bucks. As long as you research your trips, you won't be disappointed. I know I spend probably 8 hours reading trip advisor and researching various websites about Mexico and it paid off.

Honestly, the sample rooms we were shown looked lovely but the good feelings end there. You are pretty well trapped there. So far from civilization that, if you don't rent a car, it is all you will see on your vacation. Much of it is under construction and not all that appealing to the eye--fairly institutional, if you will. The pool is large but overrun with so many guest I felt like I was right back at home in NYC! The ocean was rough and the beach was under construction. We did eat a meal in the main restaurant as part of our visit so I can comment on the food: our 3 star hotel in Cancun blew it away. The food was a big disappointment (for what is rated a 5-star resort) but be prepared to pay up for it becuase, that's right, you can't go anywhere else. If you've already bought in then you might as well make the best of it. You've already been taken for $79,000, or $44,000, or $18,500, or $9,000, or $5,000 including a cruise, or perhaps just $3,600 if you held out or, wait...$2,600 but no golf--and that's our final offer!

We stayed at the Mayan Palace on the Riveria Maya, just outside of Cancun. Researched through this site and was a little worried about what we were going to get once we got there. Our worries were never more than that. Once we arrived, which we arranged online with the concierge, via taxi transport we were greeted with smiles and wonderful service. The taxi driver even stopped so we could get some cold drinks to start our vacation at the pool while we waited for our room. We were approached at check-in to do a tour presentation. This, we were told, was to upgrade to the Grand Mayan, 15% off our entire bill, and a breakfast buffet. We opted to pass and were never approached again. We were given bracelets to wear the week and noticed the \"owners\" of the Mayan resorts got a different color. They may have received services different than ours, we didn't notice any. This was the only thing I didn't care for. We too are owners at another resort, 5 star also, and there is no separation of guests. We spent the afternoon poolside, our baggage safely stored with the bellboys, until our rooms were ready. We got to our room at 5pm which is check-in time and were pleasantly surprised when we opened our doors... We had a 2 bdr suite, partial kitchen (no oven, just 2 stovetop burners and microwave), dining area and living room...all comparible to our home resort. There was no view of the ocean but the back of the resort was nicely landscaped and the breeze was awesome when the windows were opened. We had a view of the tennis courts, near the front lobby. We did notice a musty odor every time we entered, but I think that had to do with the humidity in the air. When we opened the doors or put the air on it disappeared. We also brought fragrant candles that really helped alot. The rooms are nicely decorated in bright greens and blues and marble floors throughout. Maid service twice daily was included with turn down at night with chocolate on the pillows. We ate at the Asain buffet the first night, Italian another night, and the food was excellent, though a bit pricey. We had inquired about an AI program which they denied existed, although I read that some people have had it offered..so go figure. The breakfast ala carte at Tumtah was really good, with the ocean view and breeze a wonderful way to start the day. We planned on going to shop for groceries, went into Playa del Carmen, to shop at Chedraui, but never got there. When we went into town, which was many times, mostly for dinner and happy hours, we took the bus or taxi from the street in front of the main gate and that took us into Playa. ($1-3 usd/pp) The Chedraui and Sam's Club were a short taxi ride from there, about a 1/2 mile and were told not a good area to walk to at night. During the day we were going to send the guys on the shopping trip with a short list, since we brought plenty from home to get us through the week, but we always were busy on a day trip, snorkeling, or laying by the pool. Regardless, I was glad we brought small meals to prepare in our room. I found a package of linguine, spaghetti sauce mix, some tomato paste made a great late night meal. Also brought a couple cans of tuna and packs of mayonnaise that didn't need refrigeration to make a dip for crackers or a spread on a bagel. We had Bloody Mary's one morning happy hour (11a-12p) and saved the celery for the tuna salad... When we needed beer or liquor, we just got them in Playa del Carmen. It was cheaper than the grocery store on the resort, we had a small collapsible cooler for the pool and the frig was big enough for a 6 pack or two. It saved us money at the bars/restraurants too. The pool area was totally awesome, huge! 3 cascading pools, one warmer than the next. 2 pool bars with 2x1 happy hours twice a day..11-12 and 4-5. Beach was better than I thought it would be from the info on this site. Although it is rocky and we didn't go into the water, the sand is beautiful and wide. We did take the snorkeling tour that was available with Steve from England, right off the beach. To get to their boat, we walked north about 10min and the swimming was a lot nicer. The waves were huge several days and the red flags were posted most of the time we were there. I enjoyed the pool, no sand! The waiters were very attentive and the show at the Del Lago was a must see, at least one night. We always wanted to try the breakfast buffet at the Del Lago, but were never hungry enough to pay the $16 pp and all you can eat. People we talked to said it was awesome. It was very easy to get into Playa del Carmen and that is were we ate the majority of our meals at great restaurants. We found several in the Fodors review of Cancun, Cozumel and the Mayan coast book. It was our little bible and we took it everywhere. La Parilla, Blue Parrot, and Lapapa Hemingway's were just a couple of our favorites for food, music and fun both day and night. Big Lobster had a very friendly and helpful staff.

It's still under construction and a staff member who we talked with said that it is the worse of all of the Mayan resorts, AT THIS TIME. It's still a work in progress and the main entry area is still having the foundation put in. Not to worry however, the construction won't detour you from a very nice time. The facilities are beautiful and spacious. The site is BIG and they've just purchase a couple hundred acres next door. Down the road a few years this should be a real show piece. The construction noise is off in the distance and won't bother you at all. The staff is great and very helpful. One problem was with one of the couples we were with.

This could have been a serious medical condition and we were quite concerned about quality medical help. One call to the front desk and a doctor was there within 5 minutes.

As much as I hated to rush out to the pool at 5:30 am it is so beautiful at that time of the day.

Granted, timeshare presentations are always high pressured and you hope that they do not stretch the truth too much. You do not expect them to outright lie about any of the features and benefits they offer. But even worse in this case, I believe they are criminally fraudulent when they make people waive their right to the \u201ccool down\u201d contract rescission period, especially when Mexican law does not allow this right to be waived. They do not give you a copy of the waiver so you are only left with your initials on a clause that said you had five days to cancel. This is not an isolated incident, see -------tug2 BBS system, Renting section and search on Please Help or Timeshare Fraud, or visit these great sites of information; ww---------------- or ww---------------- Please pass on these 3 points to all travelers to Mexico. 1. Be aware that Mexico laws require a 5 day \u201ccool down\u201d contract rescission period for timeshares purchases, and this right cannot be waived. 2. Timeshare values do not increase, aftermarket prices are a great value and at least 50% discounted. (Check Ebay and Google) 3.

We bought at the Mayan last year while vacationing at another resort so we were first timers at the Mayan. This was however, our 9th trip to Mexico. The people were great and the hotel was clean. The rooms were cleaned and stocked twice daily. We would go again and do the same as we did this time. What worked for us: 1. Rented a car online (National) and picked it up at the airport (total $187 plus $24.00 gas). The hotel charges $15 pp one way to the airport . 2. After we checked in to the hotel (with no problems) and had spent 2 hours in the pool, we drove to Playa del Carmen (20km from hotel) and bought breakfast and lunch foods including milk, pop, beer, tequila, juices, fruit and snacks and stocked the fridge. Spent $110 US at the Chedraui grocery store. (A Sam's Club was also nearby). 3. Had breakfast everyday in the room and an occasional lunch as well. We brought our own drinks to the pool in purchased cooler cups. We only ordered drinks at the pool during their happy hours (2 for 1). 4. The first night we ate at the hotel (Tumtah) which was good and ran us around 65$ including drinks. The boys each had their own pizza( $11-$14) which they couldn't finish so the waiter wrapped it for them to take with them. 5. Every evening around 6:00 we drove 20km (20mins) to Playa del Carmen and walked the beautiful 'pedestrian only' street. There are hundreds of shops and outdoor restaurants, displaying menus and food items. Every night we chose a different restaurant and usually spent $50-$70 including tips for the four of us. La Parilla Restaurant - lobster tail, caribbean salad and drink $15. Senior Frogs - Tequila fish and grilled vegetables $10. 6. We did eat one night at the Tramonto at the hotel which was okay. Rolandi's in Playa del Carmen is better with more selections. The hotel buffets were $20 - $24pp plus drinks and gratuity. We were told the food was very good. The Mexican Night Gala on Thursday was $44 pp including food/drink/and a theatre show. We missed it. 7. Drove once to Tulum, less than 1 hour south of hotel and arrived by 9am. We beat the crowds and tour busses and were back at the pool by 1:00 for lunch. We had been to Xel-Ha before so we passed this year. 8. We ordered lunch at the pool a few times, large pizza $17, club sandwich $8, turkey gyro $7, guacamole $5, hamburg $8. We spent about $30 pp per day for food/drink which we thought was pretty reasonable. The pool was wonderful and warm - three levels and three temperatures. Perfect for small children as well. We were never bothered once by sales staff. DRAWBACKS: 1. The beach is not yet a swimming beach but their working on it. It was too windy while we were there to snorkel but would have been great. 2. Nothing really for teens to do at night at the hotel. No game room or activities. 3. People would put towels on chairs 6:30am to reserve and not return until early afternoon. A few people complained and staff immediately corrected the situation. 4. Bed was firm but when I mentioned it to the maid, she immediately brought a convoluted foam topper.

(four of our friends were scheduled for a later flight that day due to arrive cancun mx at 9:20 pm) we had a connection in philly with 1 1/2 hours layover. perfect. we grabbed a bite at mcdonalds and boarded the plane for cancun.we arrived in cancun mx after a very smooth flight. pretty much breezed thru customs. denise needed a cigarette real bad and had a meltdown over a lost imigration form and a pen! poor ed almost got a broken shoulder when she slugged him with her purse:) after a few shed tears and the go ahead from the imigrations officer she dashed outside for a butt (2) and was ready for vacation again. all that behind us we we made our way thru the timeshare people and shuttle sales people and headed for the door. we had booked the airport transfer thru playa.info. just a promised the driver was holding a sign with my name on it. we got to the mayan palace at around 1:30 ish mexico time and rushed the check in counter. there were 3 families and we wanted to be together. this did cause some confusion. we should have let them do their jobs. i had contacted them 2 days in advance to request our room be next to each other. they had already had it under controll. pushy americans we are we barged right up there all 10 of us at once and this of course slowed things down. be got it worked out though after about 15 minute. the staff asked if we were interested in a tour for a 15% discount wich we declined and were on our way. we were anxious to see the pool and being it was too early and our rooms were not ready yet we chose to leave our bags, grab our suits, towels and sunscreen and head for the water. wow was it beautiful. the kids ran and jumped right in. i tested the water with my toe. it was so warm. just the way i like it. the adults decided it was time for a beverage and a snack so we sat at the pool side resturaunt. the food was not that great but ok in my opinion. i had chicken wings that were good the pizza was on sliced white bread and soggy. the chicken sandwiches were great. cesar salad ok. but nothing spectacular. we ordered miami vices wich the kids were hooked on (non alcoholic) in aruba last year and i of course decided that when in mexico have a margurita yummy. my drink of choice the rest of the week and if those are to plenty a switch to corona will do fine. while we were eating the sky opened up and it poured for about 10 minutes. after that it was over with and nice but over cast again. the kids swam for a while and it was happy hour so we hung out at the pool resturant. at 5pm we headed back to the lobby grabbed our keys and luggage and headed for our home away from home. we got what we asked for 3 rooms together and lucky for us ground floor second building from the pool. we rented a 2 bedroom wich was huge. the only thing i would complain about was there is no oven and the fridge is only a half size. but i can make do with a cooler and a camp stove if i have to so not a problem. we unpacked and got the room comfy. we had packed tuna, mac and cheese, packaged mexican rice, mustard mayo catsup coffee, spices, creamer, beefaroni, box of spaghetti and a jar of ragu, parmasan cheese,bagels, microwave pop corn,...... we were ready for anything. we had already planned to go to chedraui in playa del carmen on saturday so we had plenty for tonight. we made tuna and went to bed. we had a long day and the marguritas were making me sleepy. i had a dream that my friends were finally here and came to visit. i sat up in bed and said \"hey guys\" before it dawned on me that they were really hear and standing in my bed room at 11pm!!! too funny. the confusion at the front desk had mixed up who was in wich rooms. they were supposed to be down the hall where the grand mother and mother were already check in. the poor bell man couldnt appologize enough and we laughed about it for the whole week. the good part is that our bills were all straight though. no mix up there. so back to sleep for a few more hours. as i had read in other posts, the bed was very firm. i am used to a water bed so i didnt sleep well. this was ok though because it got me out early in the morning to reserve one of those nice soft cushy palapa beds. i went down and got one just about dawn and slept till about 7am in them. i left my towel and book and stuff there and went back to the room to get coffee. i went back to lay in the bed to read my book and drink my coffee and before long my kids made their way down. they layed around with me for a while before heading back for some breakfast and their suits. not far behind them were the rest of our friends and their children. some of them went down to the tum tah (i think) resturant on the beach for breakfast and others hit the pool. it was a little cloudy and cool and we were worried. no matter though by 10 am it was clear and sunny and warm. we hung around the pool until after the first happy hour, went to our rooms for lunch and headed for pdc to check out 5 ave and grocery shop. it was probably about 1:30 ish saturday after noon and we waited on the side of the highway for about 20 minutes. several cabs stopped but we wanted to wait for the bus (not knowing the schedule) finally we caved in to the cabbies and got them to flag 3 cabs down for $14 per cab. they brought us to 5th ave where we walked around for a while. what a neat place. we found a taco stand that looked pretty good so we got tacos for a snack. we also found a guy making fried bananas. after poking around for a while we decided it was time to go to the chedraui. what a wild place. as big as a super walmart with more stuff and pretty decent choices. i got hamburg chicken porkchops steak a fresh pinapple melon burger rolls limes avacado cereal poptarts water ..... i gave them a $50. american bill and got a couple of bucks back. good deal!!! the fresh veggies were pretty picked over and the quality wasnt good so i only got a couple peppers and onions and other things. it was after dark when we arrived back to the mayan palace. the shuttle took us and our food right to our rooms. we put the food away took a shower grabbed a tuna sandwich and went to bed. sunday i didnt get up early enough to get a bed but saved chairs for everyone. we had planned to watch the daytona 500 that morning but got board waiting my family went back to playa del carmen. we went down to the highway and almost immedietly a mayab bus stopped. $1.00 per person. we ate more tacos and some pics with the monkey and mccaws and then fruit down by the water a purchase of tequilla and vanilla. we decided to make another trip to the chedraui for a case of beer and more veggie selections and $28 later we headed back to the mp for the race. be aware that all people are not your friends. a guy posing as a helpful chedraui worker tried to hook us up with at timeshare tour i think at fishermans but not sure. we thanked him and left. doug and codi had decided to play golf and had a great time there. they thought the course even though a par 3 was very challangeing. both are very good golfers. after watching some old race footage we dedided to gather up our friends to watch the race. only to find that the fox sports network was showing a soccer game. i decided that i was done waiting for the race and would head to the pool and wait for happy hour instead. jim and doug decided it would be a good idea to go to the inernet lounge and check nascar.com for the updates. this only lasted about half the race before some kind of water leak in the building made them shut the place down. the fate of the daytona 500 would not be known for 2 days. there was a lot of anticipation on the outcome because we all have a small friendly wager on the race. alas jodie won the money (dale jr) and we would be home for next weeks race anyways. we had more happy hour and back to the room for pork chops mexican rice and funky canned peas. our bellys full we watched a movie had a few beers and went to bed. we had planned to go to coba on monday. we got to the budget renal office up stairs in the hotel lobby and rented our vehicles. we were on our way by 11am. (later than i wanted to be but we couldnt get motivated yesterday to get the process going.) i got directions on this playa.info site wich were pretty easy to follow. only thing is at the end they tell you to stay straight on the tar road and your there. well not so. the entrance is not in english and there is only a small gate shack and parking lot area with purple signs with yellow mexican writing. we went about a half a mile past and turned around to go back. we had thought that was it and turned out it was. it cost 15 pesos to park and 38 pesos to get in. the kids under 12 were free. we hired mario as our guide for 500 pesos for 1 1/2 hour. it was such a great choice for us because of the shade. there was not much breeze that day and the jungle was very welcome protection from the sun. we had an age range from 74 thru 7 years old. it was so amazing and interesting. i got chills when i saw the big structure. the kids couldnt contain themselves and scrambled to the top before marion was done explaining. before long mario was done and the faint of heart waited behind in the shade while the rest of us climbed higher and higher. wow what a view. it took a wile for my heart to stop pounding and my knees to stop shaking before i relaxed at the top for a wile before the trip down. i made jim stay in front of me while i went down on my butt. i had just started to slide onto the first step down when denise finally made it up yeah denise. she felt like rocky when she made it back to the bottom. we were both glad we made the trip and both happy we had survived. lol. del and mem hitched a ride on a bike trike and we met them in the gift shops. we bought some things and chips and headed back. we had planned on stopping at the grand cenote on the way home. word of advice when driving in mexico the rear view is importand as the front view. while headed home we were overtaken by a big big big tourismo tour bus who decided that he had enough room to pass us. to our surprise and dismay he wacked the driver side mirror. we were not sure at the time about any body damage to the vehicle but decided to chase him down to get at least his license plate number. in the mean time we realized that the mirror could easily be swiveled back in to position and things would be ok. no damage. the grand cenote was closed at 5:30pm when we went by so we carefully went back to the resort. it is amazing how such a laid back people drive so fast and crazily!!! that night we had steak, mashed potatoes and tomatos and cukes in good season italian dressing. we had a few beers a shower and went to bed. tuesday we headed to the highway to catch a ride. we got a small van that took us to pdc where we got a cab to xcaret. we had already booked our trip from home. we were not wicked excited about xcaret. not very good snorkeling. we did enjoy hanging out in our tubes over by the dolphins though and watching them from under water with our snorkels and masks. we saw the animals and a couple of shows then went to dinner. we had a good meal there before we watched the night show. we only stayed for part of it. we left after the mayans accepted the spanish and christianity. our friends who stayed said it was a little draggedout but very colorful. we love watching the ball game recreated and the fireball hocky game though. especially after having seen the ball court at coba. we went back to the mp i cooked up the peppers and onions then added fajita mix to the left over sliced steak and porkchops for lunch the next day, showered and a few beers and went to bed. the kids decided to hang out by the pool and the internet cafe for a while but were back soon. early mornings and long days tired every one out. nothing planned for wednesday so i got up early. i headed for the pool early and saved a bed and some chairs for my friends. shortly after i got their denise and ed showed up and claimed the bed i saved for them. we drank coffee and talked for a while, i had a little nap and was woken around 9 am by denise having words with a woman who thought she could just move things and take any chairs she wanted. denise was nicely explaining that our friends had gone to breakfast and would be back soon. the woman walked over to my spot and started moving my things. i explained that if she wanted to be sure to get a certain spot she need to get up at 5am just like the rest of us. there are 14 people in my group and that takes up a lot of chairs in a row. after a while she was off moving some one elses stuff and complaining that people leave their stuff and don't show up till noon!! ( its now about 9:35am mind you) i enjoyed getting up early and snoozing by the pool listening to the breeze blow thru the palms. we laid around and read and swam all day. after the first happy hour i ordered chips and guacamole and jim brought the fajita fixins down and we ate by the pool. snooze swim read drink fake tatoo and back to the room for spaghetti with hamburg sauce. all the boys came back to the room to eat and play video games (we had to bring the play station aaagggghhhh) and everyone went home by 8 and went to bed. the girls went to the internet cafe. we got up and ready and down to the curb for the mayab bus at 8:30 to go to xel-ha. it only cost 180 pesos for my family of four. i booked the all inclusive tickets from home. this was the best day. we had a good time. and such a great deal for the money. we got there early and had breakfast. ok food not great. got our snorkels and headed for the water the fish were amazing, the river float ride was fun, rope swing, eat drink swim drink eat drink swim jump off the cliff loose your locker key and be the last ones to leave!!! lol the life guard was very helpful though. he went down and found it the first try. oops. at least ed jumped. jodie del kianna and marissa swam with the dolphins and loved it. the food in the mexican lindo was ok but just because we could we got a burger on the way out. we had been there so late that we took a cab because it was dark and we didn't think there would be anymore busses on the road. this was the worst ride and we didn't tip the driver. he had his cd player on track 3 over and over and over and over all the way back to the mp. we asked him to change it or shut it off and he just dismissed us. lets get retarted lets get retarted in her lets get retarted lets get retarted in here...... he just kept taking to he other cabbie that my friends were with and laughing. that was the only rude person we encountered the whole week. we finally got back home and took showers and headed to bed. we had a pick up scheduled at 9:30 am friday morning for the trip home. we cleaned up the room, thru out the extra fridge food and made tuna sandwiches, 2 bags of microwave pop corn and poptarts for the trip. packed a good book and headed for the airport. it was raining in mexico and the sky looked black with lots of clouds. we had heard that there had been bad weather back home in new england all week but didn't consider the ramifications. my friends flight was scheduled to take off at 12:10 but was delayed till about 2. my flight was scheduled for 1:45 and didnt leave till 4:30/5pm. i knew before we left cancun we had missed our 7:30 connection in philly. we encountered the worst turbulance ever for about the first hour of our flight. scarry. we finally arrived in philly at 8:45 our friends who left first were supposed to be on the second leg of their flight with us but were also delayed even though they left ahead of us. as it turns out they got split up husband and son go to boston to get the car and drive to manchester nh to meet the wife and daughter. denise had another melt down. our friends doug and jodie and family had a scheduled 9:30 connection and complained all week about a 2 1/2 hour lay over are the only ones who made their flight in a reasonable time frame. mean while my family of 4 and the 2 old ladies spent the night at the horrible holiday inn stadium in philly. do not reccomend it for any reason. after we were re ticketed we were given vouchers for rooms and food and told to call for a shuttle and wait on the curb under the green post. thats what we did along with about 10 others. the empty shuttle goes by once then twice. now a nice shuttle bus driver stopped and asked if we wanted to wait in his bus where it was warm. we thanked him. the shuttle bus drove by empty yet again. people were now calling on their cell phones to complain to the hotel. finally rick the nice bus driver offered us a ride. we thanked him and took a collection. finally at 11:10 we were standing at the counter of the horrible holiday inn stadium in philly being informed that there was no food available due to the fact the the shuttle bus driver made us wait on the curb while he drove by us empty 3 times and the kitchen closes at 11pm. we headed up to the run down rooms and ordered pizza wich didnt come till 12:45am. ate slept went down to the buffet breakfast to use the vouchers for breakfast. took the food to go and fought for a shuttle back to the airport at 8am for our 10:38 flight. the airline was looking for 4 passangers to give up their seats in exchange for airline tickets. we would have done this but we had the old ladies who were counting on us for a ride. our flight took off at around 11am and we got home the rest of the way with no further excitement. all in all it was a great trip. we were not asked except for the days in playa for any timeshare trours and we politely said no thank you and kept walking. the mayan palace was wonderful with no surprises 1.", "Date": "March 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful upscale resort\u201d", "Author": "LenaCa", "ReviewID": "UR3238698", "Content": "We just came back from the 1-week stay in Mayan Resort (20-27 Februry).

We lived in the Grand Mayan since they ran out of Mayan rooms and they offered us Grand without any additional pay. The rooms were great, all new and clean. The beds were just fine for us, no odors, the only thing that bothered me were too loud slamming doors. Food was great, we didn't always ate out, actually we had breakfast in the room. But whatever we ate out, was excellent and not much more expensive then we used to in the States. Of course, we enjoyed the pool, the gym and the nightly shows.

We bought last year while staying in Puerto Vallarta and as most of you know who have bought, after spending the money, the question is \"What have we done?\" Well now we know. We have time to spend any way we like at a choice of resorts in Mexico or we can trade to other locations. WOW! We have a two bedroom lockout so chose to stay in the master room the first week and then use the 1 bedroom suite the second week. This way we can save our Bonus week to use another time. We were welcomed from the moment we arrived at the airport and found the Royale driver. We did have to fend off a few other drivers who wanted to take our bags but we had gotten a good description of the uniform to look for so not a problem. We arrived at reception and were checked in quickly and were upgraded to the Grand Mayan (we were hoping because we had read so many reviews that had been). Great room with a jacuzzi the first week and an even better situation the second week with the suite. Even the move between the rooms on the Saturday was smooth! The resort is beautiful and for those that complain about the walk......what is wrong with a 5-10 minute walk to the BEACH, POOL, or A 5 STAR Restaurant. I have a 5 minute walk to my office twice a day for work in -30 degree C temps and don't complain much!! The first week we ate in the restaurants at least twice a day because we did not have a kitchen, also used room service. The prices are on par with any good restaurant we would frequent in Edmonton and that is Canadian money. IF we wanted to spend or eat less we had a pizza at Tumtah or a pasta dish at Tramonto. Tramonto is our favourite (Christian was our waiter twice and is very sweet). The lasagna was wonderful and the prime rib was very good even if it was not Alberta beef! The second week we went to Chedraui to buy some groceries for breakfast and lunch and drinks and probably spent half of what we did the first week in the restaurants. The pool is wonderful and the beach is a beach. There are some rocks and stuff but it is still great to lay under the sun on a lounger with a good book!! If you want a lovely day on your own on a beach walk 15 minutes north (wear water shoes) and there is a beautiful stretch with less rocks. There was one other group of folks on the beach with us and that was it! We went on some tours to Tulum and Chichen Itza and both were educational and well run. We felt a little too regimented at Chichen Itza so will probably return on our own next time. We also took a day tour to Isla Mujeres and had a great time. Met some great people and will return there again as well. We spent a day in Puerto Morelos and several trips to Playa Del Carmen. Took the shuttle once and the Playa Express the rest of the time. Service was impeccable where ever we went and the Hola's were hard to stop once we got home. We are counting the days til we return to our next stay at the Mayan Palace.

While it is not as \"eye-catching\" as the one in Acapulco it is still a great place to stay. We were in the Grand Mayan about as far as you could be from the beach and the pool area. It took about 5 minutes to walk there (maybe 10 if you are a slow walker). If you are the person who circles the mall parking lot trying to get in the very first row so as not to walk two steps more than you have to, don't go to the Mayan Palace unless it doesn't bother you to wait 5 or 10 minutes for a shuttle. Otherwise you will be fine. My husband and I even walked to the front gate with no problem. By the way, if you don't rent a car and don't want to take the bus to Playa, the Mayan Palace will take you there at 10:00 and pick you up at 4:00 Monday through Friday for $7.50 per person. If someone approaches you at the airport and says they want to give you a map and make sure you don't get lost, ignore them and walk out the doors. These are people trying to get you to attend a time share presentation (maybe at the Mayan Palace, maybe elsewhere). We talked with them long enough to get a map and when they started talking about \"giving\" us tours, we just walked away. When we got to the resort, the first person we spoke with said that they were going to get someone else for us to talk to. I spoke up immediately and said \"Is this going to be a timeshare spiel? We are not interested\". The lady said no but then came back without this other person and basically said I have to tell you this even though you are not interested and gave us about a 2 minute shortened version of the spiel (about the free breakfast and the discount). We said no and that was the last we heard. If you go to Playa Del Carmen or Cozumel you will be approached by timeshare people from the Mayan Palace as well as other resorts. Ignore them and keep walking. Rude? Maybe. But effective. Yes, the matresses are very firm. We found them to be very comfortable but then we sleep on a firm mattress at home. We took a couple of tours and spent the rest of the time on the beach. I personally don't go in the water but love to bask in the sun so I had no problem with the beach, although if you walk away from the resort it does become very rocky. We were quite content on the beach since the majority of the guests gravitate to the pool and we prefer to have some elbow room. It was great. I found the staff to be pleasant and helpful although I did not think they were quite as fluent in English as those we encountered in Acapulco. We ate at the Tumtah for breakfast and dinner. We normally don't eat lunch. Breakfast is about the same price as we pay in the U.S. Dinner was on the expensive side but good. If you eat dinner early, say about 4 or 5 o'clock you get the lunch menu which includes some of the dinner entrees but also some lower priced lunch items like sandwiches or you can order room service anytime and get those items. So if you eat dinner in your room you can eat cheaper even after the 15% service charge. We had a waiter for breakfast at Tumtah who, after the first day, remembered our names, our room number and even that he should give the bill to me instead of my husband who can't see to sign it without his glasses on! He would even stop to speak with us when he wasn't assigned to our table. The resort is truly \"cashless\". You either make a cash deposit when you check in or give them a credit card and everything gets charged to your room. You can settle up when you leave or you can leave it on your credit card to pay when you get home. The Boutique is very expensive for clothing. At least $225.00 for a bathing suit seems high to me. We had a one bedroom suite in the Grand Mayan and it was very spacious and clean. Nicely decorated also, although the colors were not ones I would have chosen. There was a slight odor in the room when we arrived. We turned on the air conditioner and that seemed to help but it was back the next day. We concluded that it was something that they were using to clean the room. Not an overpowering odor but one of those things you notice when you walk in the door but become used to and no longer notice after you are inside for a while. The bedroom and the living area had their own separate thermostats so we were able to adjust the temperature to our liking. I heard a few doors slamming the first night. Probably people arriving. After that the nights were very quiet. There is still a small amount of construction going on but it was not a problem. And yes, they do spray for mosquitoes between 5:30 and 8:00 in the evening. I never saw them spray near the food and the spraying never bothered me although they do recommend that you keep your balcony or patio door shut while they are spraying. One thing that I missed was that they do not have a laundry service where you can have them do your laundry for you and return it to you the next day. They do have washers and dryers that you can buy tokens for and do your own laundry but they are only available from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. I didn't want to waste my valuable vacation time doing laundry so we wound up bringing our dirty clothes home and washing them here. In other places we have been there was 24 hour access to the machines and we could do our laundry in the wee hours of the morning so as not to cut into our beach time. And in Acapulco we just had them do it for us. I woud not hesitate to stay at the Mayan Palace again but there are so many places to go and so many things to see that we probably will not be back there for a long time. One other thing, the nights can get quite chilly so be sure to bring a jacket or at least a long sleeved shirt and long pants.

We don't own a time share with them but bought a week from a friend of ours that does own with them and has visitied many of the Mayan Palace's and loved them. Upon arrival we were told at check in that we only had one room reserved which was a basic room in Mayan Palace. We had a confirmation for a room and a suite. Luckily, I had my confirmation..........(so don't forget it).....with us and they ended up having to give us two rooms at Grand Mayan instead. Very nice. The rooms were immaculate, about a 5 minute or less walk to the pool....seems funny that people complain about walking. Anyway, excellent maid service. We only ate at Tramonto and Del Gado.....both excellent. We enjoyed a karoke show and went to the mexican night, both at Del Gado. The mexican night buffet was 44 dollars.....but well worth it. That included your meal, which is awesome, all drinks and the show. Worth it. We did not rent a car so were left to take a bus or cab into town. We would walk to the lobby and take a mayan palace bus out to the main gate and be dropped off to wait there for a bus or taxi. We were able to get some taxis for 1 per person to Playa Del Carmen, if we just told the driver we were waiting for the bus. So, that worked out well....just don't settle for their asking price and they always would come down. We mostly just enjoyed the pool bars all day long.....but we did take a ferry over to Cozumel and snorkel with the glass bottom boats....very nice! I had a great time. I highly recommend a massage if you enjoy that kind of thing. It was 53 pesos...so around 50 dollars for 60 minutes. I couldn't get an hour message back here for that cheap. It was high class. And for everyone worrying about the time share presentation......I was definatley worried after reading all these horror stories on here......we were not asked one single time to do a presentation. I was very shocked. We did see other people, obviously picked up from town, on presentations but certainly were not bothered by it. So, don't let that scare you. The only time we were really pestered was in the airport, some guy from a different hotel, not mayan palace, tried getting us to do a free breakfest and what not.......just said no about 15 times and walked away, he was not happy but I'm SURE it's not the first or last time that's happened to him so not worried. Bottom line, I will definatley visit a mayan palace again....maybe next time Acapulco. We have stayed there before and would like to go back but to Mayan Palace.

Anyone who has travelled to Mexico knows that one has to agree to participate in a time share presentation. They do not drag you by the hair. Usually, most do it because they have been offered free excursions, money, or other incentives. They do this, tequila aside, of their own free will and with the own tongues saying \"yes, pick us up for the presentation.\". Perhaps this timeshare presentation is worse than most.... so don't go. We spent 7 days in the Grand Mayan. We were asked at check-in if we were interested... we said no.... there was not one call, one person asking at the pool.... nothing.... now onto the purpose of this site.... to rate resorts..... I went to a presentation at another hotel... by my choice... it was annoying... but I agreed to go.... 2)The Resort- a)Accomodation- we stayed in a two bedroom Grand Mayan- beautiful unit with stone floors, huge kingsize beds, a full size jacuzzi on one side (not just a tub, but a jacuzzi) and a full size tub on the other, along with an outdoor sitting pool. Brand new kitchen with everything.... comfortable couches... etc. etc. 2)Service- The safe jammed... technician there in 10 minutes... fixed. Wake up calls ... always with a backup to make sure by a real person. Pickups.... on time with a smile. laundry....4 hours.... smelled better than at home.... great help at the bell desk with travel and taxi plans. 3)Food- I've read some complaints about it being overpriced. A large pizza delivered to our room on the 1st nite.... 20 bucks. Everything else.... what you'd expect at a large resort. We went into Playa and loaded up with booze and groceries.... we ate at the restaurants twice.... very good... at resort prices. 4)Location- 10 minutes from Playa del Carmen, 25 from Cancun. For us, perfect. Wanted the nightlife of Cancun and a day or two on those great beaches... wanted the character and charm of playa. Close to both. 18 bucks for a cab to play, 35 to cancun... four in a cab.... very reasonable. When we wanted quiet we had it... when we wanted loud... we went to it.... very pleased overall with the location. 5)Beach- in front of hotel... very rocky. Walk three minutes right as you face the water.... beautiful sandy beach great for swimming.... complete with palapas and very few people.... Overall, great for couples (very private), great for friends.... comfortable and close to the party.... and (don't have any yet) but family friendly (although not very many kids). Excellent.

I just want to get it all in. We just returned from an unforgettable trip to the Mayan Palace ( 1/31/05-2/6/05) the weather was beautiful when we were there, nights get a little chilly so bring a sweater. We had no complaints at all. We had read all the reviews before going so we knew to stay away from the time share presentations. You see these people walking all over all day long and had heard the horror stories about being there anywhere from 3-5 hours instead of the 90 minutes they say it takes. They offer alot of \"perks\", but we were there to enjoy ourselves, not to spend a day being harrassed to buy a time share we didnt want anyway. Note to anyone who is interested...hold out as long as you can, the deals get better and better. We had no problems with check-in, they were fairly quick...we arrived quite late (11pm) and our room (Grand Mayan) was beautiful and very clean with maid service 2x's a day. We had a kitchen unit and groceries were available at the gift shop for very reasonable prices...everything seemed reasonably priced there actually. There is a walk to get to the pool, beach, restaurants, lobby etc, but its not overwhelming and after eating the great food, you'll be glad you get the exercise. The pool is amazing and warm and the activities staff and wonderful, they always have something going on. The food was good, they have a big buffet for breakfast every morning.we only ate there once, it was kinda pricey for the amount that we actually ate, so we went to the ocean restaurant everyday.... they have the best pancakes! The buffet at the pool restaurant at night was OK, the change the theme everynight... Italian, Carribean, Steak & Shrimp etc The Tramonto Italian restaurant above the gift shop is amazing! We truly enjoyed our dinner there..be sure to make reservations early because you might not get in, we were able to get in without one night (only because it was the night of the Fiesta...which is $44 USD each and we spent $72 USD including dessert) but could not get in again before we left. We traveled to Playa..which is awesome and really gives you the Mexican village feel that you dont get in Cancun and at the resort. Take the (free) shuttle from the lobby to the front gate and cross the street...taxis and shuttles will stop and offer rides or wait for the bus, we paid about $2 US. Ask around for taxi prices on the return, our first trip was $17, the 2nd we took a shuttle by the bus stop for $4. We also did Isla Mejueres (booked thru the resort) and Cozumel...the island was great..its absolutely beautiful, Cozumel was dirty along the pier, but its the place to go if you want jewlery, you can get some great pieces for great prices. We took the fast ferry for $33 US roundtrip for 2. Try to save all your receipts so you can match it up to your bill at the end, we found that they charged us for towels from the pool that we had returned...and you dont realize how much you actually charge, there is no cash accepted..its all charged to your room.

I have travelled all over the world and I can say without hesitation that the Mayan Palace is one the best.

That meant finding a low key destination where there was enough to do without being too close to the all too tempting glitz and overcrowding of many mainstream destinations. We felt we would be within convenient driving distance of enough activities to fill a full week if the kids couldn't stand being at the resort all day long. For these reasons, we chose the Grand Mayan Resort (adjoining the Mayan Palace) on the Mayan Riviera. Our trip was chocked full of experiences and leaves us with many funny stories, but I'll try to limit my review to what will help others. It is true that the distance from the entrance to the lobby and the accomodations is a good walk. If you don't have a car, catching a bus from the entrance involves perhaps a 600 yard walk to the bus stop. Given the number of complaints this detraction recieves, the management should consider running a shuttle between the man gate at the entrance and the lobby to assist so many of the vacationers without cars. We felt quite fortunate to have rented one (more on this later). Check-in was rapid, the accomodations were high end, the housekeeping was impeccable and the staff was courteous. In our 6/4 unit there was a small kitchen outfitted for cooking most fast meals (microwave/small fridge), 2 full baths, 2 king beds and a pullout sofa, a living and dining area and a generous deck with small \"lounging pool\". Our deck faced an unflattering utility building, but we didn't plan to spend any time there and did not care much. We had housekeeping service twice daily and the maids were quite accomodating. The pool is just as described in other reviews, immense with 2 pool bars, stepping stones across it in several places so that one didn't have to walk 5 minutes around to get to the other side (no, I don't think I'm exaggerating), and palapas on all sides. From 9:00 - 4:00 everyday, the gregarious entertainment staff solicits participants in the various activities, beach volleyball, kayak racing, beaded jewellery making, painting, water volleball, horseshoes and so much more. Believe me when I tell you my kids were not bored at the resort. We didn't need to take them anywhere else, but that's not why we went to Mexico. The beach at the resort is as described in most other reviews, lots of hard-on-the-foot coral. The resort is presently bringing in loads of fine sand to transform this beach into a good match for the rest of the facilities. We decided to alternate pool/beach days with day trips to other sites. Those included Xcaret, the caverns at Aktun Chen and the ruins at Tulum, which noone should miss. Xcaret is a lush, ecology conscious, educational playland about 20 minutes from the resort. The whole family loved it for various different reasons. None of us got to see everything, which leads me to believe that one might actually need 2 days there to feel like nothing was missed. If I recall correctly, basic admission was $49 for adults and $24.50 for kids, with extra charges for higher end activities, and was therefore expensive, but well worth it. Aktun Chen is a cave tour, roughly 1 hour from the resort, and cost us $17 per adult and $10 for our youngest daughter. Be advised that it is a 3 mile dirt access road to the attraction from the highway, and it may not be negotiable if it has rained that morning. Before entering the cave, we were entertained by \"Joe\" the young angel monkey, who hangs and swings from anyone who will let him, and by the myriad other creatures in the area. We saw wild turkey, deer, peccaries, grey fox, anteaters, more monkeys, many snakes (yes, in appropriate cages) and an ocelot. Inside the cave, the formations are quite impressive, with lots of lighting and photo ops. We probably walked a half mile underground and took an hour doing so. Our guide, Victor, was very knowledgeable and gave a great tour, both above and below ground. You might think to tip him on your way out of the cave - he does his job very well. Tulum is across the highway from Aktun Chen and is my favorite of the 3 attractions. There is a cheap shuttle for hire to take one from the front gate to the ruins and back, but the ruins are only about 600 yards away and we enjoyed the walk. Once inside walls, the ruins are numerous, crumbling, weather beaten and leaning, amplifying my appreciation for the power of mother nature. What really struck me about this place however was the natural beauty of the surroundings. There is a small beach to either side of the promontory on which the main temple sets. The southern of these beaches is indelibly etched in my mind, as I may not see a more attractive place in my lifetime. I'm sure that the Mayan priests felt the same way when they decided Tulum would be the site of their temple. We ate on the cheap by shopping for breakfast, lunch and snack foods at the Chedraui supermarket in Playa Del Carmen (PDC). Most days, we made lunch and snacks and took them with us. If we were at the pool, our own food and beverage were not welcome, which is understandable, and we wandered off down the beach to picnic when the time came. A little inconvenient, but worth it on our modest budget. As for dinners, we paid attention to other reviews and dined multiple times at both Tum Tah at the resort and at La Parilla in PDC. The prices were reasonable, and the food and service were excellent at both locations. On our first trip into the center of PDC we were stopped by a local police officer for a traffic violation which we had obviously not committed. He asked for my license and, once he had it, told me I had broken the law by going the wrong way and then requested $45. I winced, then sighed, and he promptly dropped the requirement to $20. This let me know that he was working for himself and not the city. Well, to get my license back and avoid time in the local hoosegow, I grudgingly paid him and he told me there would be no ticket, and to simply move on. $20 American dollars in 5 minutes . . . I bet he lives in a palace! While in PDC we spent a lot of time souvenier hunting and enjoyed dickering and converting currencies. There were lots of fun shops with mostly handcrafted goods such as maracas, sombreros, ponchos, blankets, silver jewelry, etcetera and then the typical assortement of painted and embroidered t-shirts. Definitely buy souveniers in this environment instead of the duty free shops. It's far more fun. Believe it or not, I've left out all of the funny and personal stories, so you know we have more than our fair share of memories from this venture. As previously indicated, we felt quite fortunate to have rented a car. As it turns out, we were extremely lucky, but for a different reason. Upon our return from Mexico, we were admonished by several friends and co-workers for having rented a car. Both my wife and I were told endless horror stories of people losing a lot more than $20 to the Mandida (that traffic violation scam run by the local police), or being hauled off to jail for an extended stay after a traffic accident, and having the Mexican authorities attempt to seize ownership of stateside assets in that particular case. How much of what we were told was embellished, I don't know, but I can tell you from personal experience that the local police are most definitely corrupt. We'll count our blessings and, when we return, we'll likely use cabs and buses instead.

The construction is done on the beach however swimming in the ocean is diffluent to swim in directaly in front of the resort. You can walk up or down the beach to some great swim sites. As for the pool, I would have to say it is the best pool I have ever been to or have heard about. It is HUGE!!!! A hint, try to get a spot picked out by the pool before 10am. Happy hour is from 11-12am and 4-5pm in the pool bars (buy one get one free)!!! The construction overall is minimal, I was not inconvenienced at all on my last trip a few weeks ago. In my opinion, renting a car would not be the best idea. The people drive nuts and thats coming from a guy that drives in a big city daily. You can get from the airport from $5 to $20usd depending on type of travel. If you want to bus it, you can take the Riveara (spelling???) bus for $4-$6usd per person. You will see their stand when after you go through customs and walk outside. A taxi will run you around $20 and you will get there faster. I never even talk to anyone that is trying to sell me a ride inside the airport; the best prices are right outside the airport and remember you can always backtrack to get a better price. The Mayan Palace also offers a van for $15usd per person. From the main gate to the rooms is about mile. There is a van that goes from the main gate to the road about every 5-7 min(free). From the road you can go to Cancun or cross over to get to Playa. Price wise, if you go to Cancun and a bus stops, the normal price is $2usd or a cab for $2-5usd per person. Playa will run you $1 on the bus and $2 if a cab stop ps. The trick is knowing that if the cabs dont pick you up, they will have an empty cab back to Playa. If you catch a cab at the lobby of the hotel, it will run you $30 to Cancun and $15 to Playa. At the bus station in Playa, it will cost you 70 cents to get back to the Resort. A trick I learned, next to the bus stop, you will see 10 15 cabs all lined up. Next to these cabs are vans. These vans will take you back to Mayan Palace from $2usd. If you decide to take a cab, I have gotten them down to as little as $10usd I went on a snookering tour at Shell Ha, it was fun and I would recommend it. I went on a Lobster Cruse in Cancun and my girlfriend and I both had a good time as well. Other then that, I recommend walking around downtown Playa and trying different restaurants. The food at the resort is very good, and the prices are ok. The pizza at the ocean Restaurant is very good and goes for about $11. Everything else is typical, a meal will run you maybe $15-20 with a drink per person. The restaurant above the gift shop I have never been to but I know it is very cold up there. The bar up there has a happy hour form 7-8pm and that can be a lot of fun. Try the restaurant called Restaurant La Tarraya in Playa To get there, go north from the bus station downtown (across the street from the McDonalds u will be going north) up one block and take a right towards the ocean. If you cannot find it ask for it because the fish is to die for and the beers are only a dollar!!!

We rented a car which was easy to park in Playa Del Carmen, which is a very nice town for restaurants, strolling and shopping. Our room keys never worked tho we changed them 3 times. Fortunately the room that we connected with had a working key, but this was a bit of an inconvenience.

We were impressed as soon as we pulled up to the entrance of the resort. You are welcomed by a huge rock wall and travel down a beautiful driveway that leads to the front lobby. The grounds of the resort are well taken care of, and the scenery is wonderful. We stayed on the first floor so we were unable to use our balcony very often because of the bugs and other guests being able to look right into our room. We stayed in a studio room with 2 full size beds and a bathroom. If you are staying in this type of room - you may want to pack a collapsable cooler so you can have cold drinks in your room. We rented a car and went into Playa Del Carmen a few nights for supper. We realized that you don't eat much cheaper in town than you do at the resort. We would order a light meal from the Pool Restaurant, Balche, about everyday. You could eat lunch for under $15 (the pizza, quesedillas, nachos and burgers are great). We would order our drinks from the swim up bar or have them delivered to our lounge chair during happy hour from 11 - 12 and 4 -5. I love the Pina Coladas and the Miami Vices. They charge about $5 per drink and during that time you get 2 for 1. We ate breakfast at Tum Tah for around $15 or at the large buffet for about $34. We ate supper at the Pool Restaurant 2 nights. They have a different theme each night. We spent about $45 -50 each time. We spent all of our time laying by the pool - and it is a sight to see. It took my husband and I about an hour to swim all around each pool. We also took a walk down the beach about a 1/2 mile and went swimming in the ocean. The beach at the resort is unswimmable. We have stayed at 2 other Mayan Palace resorts and this one is just as nice as the others. We did not mind the walking - it's good exercisce. Overall we do not have any complaints - except for the beach. If you have stayed at other Mayan Palaces you may notice that the studio rooms do not have the huge, nice marble showers like the other resorts. The staff is great and fun. We played a lot of games around the pool and won a few t-shirts. You should get involved with the games, it makes for great memories. We attended Casino Night on Wednesday and had so much fun! I would recommend going! The resort has a very nice gym with brand new equipment. I believe it was opened for the first week while we were there. Also, you can use the internet in the gift shop for only $4/30 mins. My husband went golfing one morning and it cost about $35 for club rental and $75 for 18 holes and a cart. The hotel has no cash policy - you have to charge everything to your room and then pay the bill at the end of the week. At least you don't have to worry about carrying your wallet with you everywhere. We had a great vacaction and would recommend the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya to anyone.

Traveling to these places will take some work, but it is worth the effort. There is the option to take a cab ($18 to PdC or $35 to Cancun), but I recommend taking the Mayab buses ($1 to PdC and $3 to Cancun). The only problem is that the Palace doesn't allow the buses to come onto their property. To catch the buses, you must wait on the side of the highway. Also, to catch the bus to PdC, you must cross the four lane highway first to get to the bus stop. Beach - A little disappointing in that the beach area is really rocky. Walking from the beach into the ocean isn't really possible unless you have some \"sea shoes\". I thought the beaches in PdC were much better although quite a bit crowded. Food - Pricey for what you get. I enjoyed eating in PdC and in Cancun much better. I only ate at the hotel when it was a matter of convenience. I really enjoyed the buffet breakfast though. Sales pitch - when I got there I was asked to attend a sales presentation. You get a free buffet, 15% off your bill, and a $30 certificate. I told the lady when I got in that I was too tired to set up an appt. After that, I never heard from them again. Towards the end of the trip, I figured that I would only save about $45 if I attended the session. It wasn't worth my time (4 hours or so), so I didn't make the appt. You have to decide on your own if wasting a morning is worth a $16 buffet and 15% off your bill. For couples and families, the cost may be worth it. A few others at the resort did listen to the presentation. A good way to say \"no\" is to tell them that you own several timeshares (be prepared with names). That's makes you a much less \"favorable\" target. Tours - There was a travel agency on the property that sets up the tours to most of the popular attractions. I highly recommend going to Chitchen Itza and Xcaret. Both are 12 hour tours though, but they offer plenty of food, drink, and rest stops. When I wasn't feeling well on the morning of the Xcaret tour, the tour company let me go the next day without any penalties. They were top notch and flexible. Room - I paid $500 on an auction site for my room. For a week in the Yucatan for a single person, I was extremely pleased. The room was a basic studio - two double beds, TV, bath, no kitchenette and no clock of any kind. That was the one thing that bothered me the most - no clock radio. I had to rely on the front desk for wake up calls. (No hitches there...) I kept my valuables in an in-room safe. The safe was large enough to hold my camera, money, passport, and receipts, with plenty of room left over. The use of the safe was free. The mattresses on the bed were very firm so be forewarned. Service - The cleaning service was pretty good - although I don't think they replace used glassware with fresh ones. The concierge answered all my questions and was pleasant to deal with. The wait staff was very slow at times. Also, they automatically put a 15% tip on your food and drink bills. Room service was very slow and the food wasn't that great. Was there anything about this trip that I would change? No, except for bringing a watch. I felt safe and comfortable. The price was right. However, now that I'm familiar with the area, I may stay in PdC next time.

Housekeeping does a very good job even organizing our haphazard piles of brochures and folding any clothing that was lying about.

The palapas by the pool, particularly those with beds, are in short supply, but the weather was so beautiful that we didn't feel the need for shade too often. Occasionally the pool entertainment was too loud. We politely complained but decided that seating location away from the microphone and loudspeaker and proper timing mostly solves the problem.

Re. the MP: First of all, to avoid the timeshare presentations, you only have to say three words (No, thank you) after you receive your welcome package. In my opinion, a three-four hour sales pitch is not worth a free buffet breakfast (eaten in the company of a stranger who wants your money) and a measly 10% off the hotel bill. The first night we were given a below avg. (3 star at best), but clean room in the MP section of the resort. The next day after making a complaint with the front desk, we were upgraded to the Grand Mayan section at no cost. What an improvement! The room was beautifully appointed (4.5 star) and maid service was great. Yes, the food at MP is expensive and not up to gourmet standards. Because of our late arrival on the first night, we ate at Tum Tah restaurant. Can you believe the MP resort doesn't have a Mexican restaurant? I do not want to eat Italian or Asian when I travel to Mexico. Tum Tah was chosen because it had \"Mexican Pizza\" on the menu. My margarita was horrible and the pizza was so-so. After our experience, we decided that we would limit our dinners at MP. We wanted to explore PDC and Cancun anyways. We found that the food in the hotel zone of Cancun is overall expensive; however, compared to the UK, Japan, NYC, etc., the food was still very reasonable. Our favorite restaurant on our trip to Cancun was La Distilleria in the hotel zone. This restaurant had great drinks, Mexican food, live music, and service. The MP pools were gorgeous and we found plenty of shade & lounge chairs when we needed them. The happy hour was also great and the food at the snack shack restaurant was inexpensive and decent. We found that the MP staff was like most Mexican people: courteous, warm and helpful. They always had smiles on their faces. I was grateful for the nightly mosquito spraying. Even though I brought and used a Deet product, the mosquitos still got me about three times. I can't help but give the MP a 5 rating because of the clean facilities, good service, and the fact that our daily room rate was only $50. My list of must haves and do's are: rental car, bring your own snorkel equipment and snorkel La Isla Mujeres, Cozumel, Dos Ojos cenotes, play golf at Playacar GC, see Tulum, X-Caret (snorkeled with Sea Turtles in the ocean), eat at La Distilleria, relax between the pool and the ocean at MP, and absolutely enjoy the happy hours at MP with chips, salsa and guacamole at the snack shack.

As other reviews note, the pool is huge, with plenty of beach chairs and pool area. The suite rooms in the Grand Mayan are large, well appointed and have a kitchenette and 2 person soaking tub in the bathroom with a separate, large shower. There is a separate lock-off that can either be a hotel room or part of a two-bedroom suite. We arrived and mentioned that we were celebrating our 1 year honeymoon, having been married at the Mayan Palace in Nuevo Vallarta the previous year. The receptionist made a note and on our anniversary, there was a complementary bottle of champagne cooled in an ice bucket next to the whirlpool tub in the bathroom. A very nice touch. About the only complaint that I could possibly think of about the room is that the beds are very firm. That wasn't a problem for us, they were still comfortable, but if you're used to pillowtop mattresses, this may be a bit of a change. Food was not cheap for Mexico, but it was reasonable for eating out in the US, given the quality of the meals we had. We didn't eat in the restaurants the entire time, we rented a car to go to Playa Carmen and other places and we often ate there. We also went to the supermarket on the main highway in Playa Carmen and bought groceries, beer and other beverages for breakfasts, lunches and happy hour times, spending about $100 for the week for 4 people. That definitely was one of the reasons that it was worth it to stay there. At a regular hotel, you're either eating all-inclusive buffets or you're eating every meal out. The beach is nice, but the near-shore ocean is mostly rock/coral, making it difficult to swim in the ocean right at the resort, but making the snorkeling very rewarding. Also, watersports rentals are additional and definitely not cheap. It was $40 to rent a small cat for 1.5 hours, making a catamaran sailing expensive compared to an all inclusive where sail boats are part of the package price. The Nicklaus designed resort golf course is challenging and expensive for an executive course, meaning all par 3s. It is extremely well maintained and designed with lots of hazards so bring extra balls unless you're a 5 handicap. $35 for club rental and $60-110 to play a round, depending on the day and if there are any specials running. The resort restaurants are all very nice, we never had a bad meal, but expect to pay about $20 or so for dinner and $7-11 for lunch. The Fiesta show they do on Thursdays was fun and well-produced, but $44 for dinner, all inclusive drinks and the show seemed like a lot for Mexico, but we did have fun. If you're going to Playa or Cancun, you can use the taxis at the resort or walk out beyond the front gate and negotiate a much better rate. You can also catch the Playa Express for 10 pesos (a buck) but they're often pretty busy during the peak hours (8-10 AM and 8-10 PM) The PE doesn't run past 10:00 PM, so if you're in Playa Carmen late, you'll have to get a taxi home. We went into Playa Carmen a lot for shopping and dining, often driving our rental car back and forth and also used it to visit the Tulum ruins. The ruins are pretty cool, and they now keep people on paths so they can't walk on the major buildings to preserve them. We also went over on the fast ferry to Cozumel to do some scuba diving. That was probably the best part, diving on the reefs of Cozumel at Plancar and the reefs at the south end of Playa Carmen, right near Xcaret. I had 4 pretty amazing dives with up close encounters with turtles, eagle rays, stingrays, big groupers, barracuda, lobsters, eels and tons of reef fish. I used two dive outfits, Aldora Divers on Cozumel was a real treat and Tank Ha was good from Playa Carmen. Negatives: The resort is huge, so be prepared to walk 1/4 mile from the room to the pool or to a restaurant. Food at the resort is not cheap. The pool-edge palapas are usually taken by early risers. If you plan to sleep in, don't expect to find a near pool-shaded spot. The fitness room and massage area was near the end of construction, so we didn't have a place to maintain our work outs other than runs and swims. Positives: The staff was friendly and helpful everywhere we were. The pool waitstaff was not intrusive, but instead very friendly but would respect your privacy if you were sleeping or didn't want a drink. At the Nuevo Vallarta resort, we were asked every 15 minutes if we wanted a drink. That makes taking a nap hard and got annoying quick. Huge, warm pool that included a place you could swim laps. The food was fresh and terrific. Drinks were plenty strong. All said, the resort is 5 star and a great place to stay if you are looking for a place that you don't mind using the kitchenette in. If you're looking to always dine on the buffet, and drink all day as part of your all-inclusive package, are a scuba-dive nut or want to walk to the nightlife in Playa Carmen or Cancun, this isn't the place for you.", "Date": "December 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cMayan Palace - they're liars!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2897529", "Content": "As soon as my husband and I passed Customs at Cancun Airport, we approached a counter to ask about shuttle service. This counter looked like one of those \"Information\" counters they have stationed at airports. His name was Joe and he was extremely friendly and showed us where to go. He also gave us a map to take along, even giving us tips on where to exchange money, buy souvenirs, etc. We thought, wow, the hospitality of Mexicans is wonderful. But then, he asked us if we were interested in any tours in Cancun. We told him we were thinking of the Chitchen Itza tour. He said that they were currently running a promotion in which they will give us free tickets to go on that tour and get 50% off any other tours. All we have to do is go to the \"Mayan Palace\" and go on a 90 minute tour of the hotel. He explained that the hotel is doing this because they want to show us what a beautiful hotel it is and that we would consider it the next time we vacation in Cancun. They will provide transportation to and from our hotel. All we have to do is deposit $40, but we were assured that we'd get all of it back at the end of the hotel tour. A great deal, we thought. We asked him if he worked for the hotel and he told me, \"no, I work for the Airport.\" Can you believe that? We totally believed him since he was stationed at the airport with a counter and all. But that was a lie. We cannot believe the Mexican government would let these scoundrels operate their scams at the airport. Anyway, so we gave him the $40 and left for our hotel. Once there, we asked BestDay (who provided us with the shuttle service) if we had done the right thing. They shook their head knowingly and told us if we go on the hotel tour, we could be kept there for 4-5 hrs and pressured relentlessly to buy timeshare. We couldn't believe it! We were so mad at losing out the $40 since we had no intention of going now. But after reading the previous reviews from people who suffered by actually going to Mayan Palace, I am relieved. $40 is not worth a waste of half a day.

We spent most of our time at the resort. We shopped for groceries in Playa and Tulum--prices were reasonable. We used the kitchen in our unit for Breakfast and most lunches. We ate at all four of the resturants and found the staff and food excellent. If you think the price is too much, don't you ever eat at a fine resturant? We preferred the quiet of being away from Cancun and Playa del Carmen. We were there to relax not to party or get into the Cancun rat race. Yes, the mattress was firm, but we slept great on our King Size bed. We also really enjoyed the large deck that our unit had. Construction--how are they supposed to improve the services without doing construction? The noise never bothered us. We were never bothered by bugs or mosquitos. They sprayed nightly and all you had to do was get out of the way when they came. You could hear them coming. A little spraying was a lot better than being bit by mosquitos.

The stay was a gift from my husband's brother who is an RCI member. We stayed at the Grand Mayan, which is the newer part of the Mayan Palace. I had read about the time share presentations on this site so I knew not to get fooled by the sales sharks. Opon check-in we were asked whether we were interesed in a discount on our bill and we immediately said no. We got one more phone call by a sales representative a day later and after confirming that we are not interested they left us alone. We had a basic hotel room - no kitchen, no refrigerator. The room was very nice and we felt very comfortable. The only downside is that there is a connecting door between two units and we had a faminly with children staying next to us and it was simply immpossible to sleep while there had a conversation or the TV on. Whoever designed this did a very poor job. The pool was simply spectacular. We enjoyed the happy hours at the pool bar. The drinks were very good. We also ate at the pool snack bar BALACHE. Food wasn't very good. We had to wait a long time for our order and even found a hair in the quesadilla we ordered. After pointing it out to our waiter the manager apologised and we didn't have to pay for anything. If you want to get a palapa you have to come around 6:30 in the morning. Don't leave your things unattended for over one hour. Mayan Palace employees will remove your things. We saw two very angry arguments between MP employees and two different parties who claimed the palapa for themselves. I don't think it is worth all the hassle....there are so many loungers and after all one wants to enjoy the holiday! We also ordered room service a couple of times. The food was good. We had pizza (which I would recommend), cheeseburger and breakfast. We also had the breakfast buffet at the restaurant by the lake once. It is $16 and the food was average. Most of the time we ate out or bought food in PDC. We rented a car which I would strongly recommend. We saw many people waiting for transportation in the 90 degree heat.

It was less than 24 hours long. We had exchanged into the Mayan Palace (Riviera Maya) through RCI. I foolishly walked into the Mayan Palace wearing three beautiful rings (including my wedding ring - all worth a total of in excess of $20,000). The hotel lobby and the Grand Mayan suite we were given after our RCI unit was changed was beautiful. All the employees were gracious and helpful. \"M\" checked us into the hotel. She and a colleague admired my rings. I appreciated \"M\" changing the unit we had been assigned, to the Grand Mayan, a beautiful suite on the ground floor. I tipped the bell boys (who held our luggage while we checked in and then reloaded us into a shuttle van to take us to our unit) from a travel folder which contained more than 50 $1.00 bills. I also tipped \"B\" who carried our bags into the Mayan unit from the same folder. We had checked in between 5 and 6 p.m. and went to bed between 11 and midnight. The sliding doors and main door were locked (security lock). I placed my rings on the nightstand next to my bed and my purse on the floor next to my side of the bed. We fell asleep with the tv on in the background. As we slept, someone came into our bedroom, took my rings which were inches from where I lay and took my purse to the living room. They went through my purse, took some cash from my wallet and the over 50 $1.00 bills from the folder from which I had tipped various employees. (I had taken documents from the folder at the checkin counter and the $1.00 bills were noticeable as they were under a clear plastic. ) The robber did not touch my watch (an expensve sapphire watch by H Stern) which was a few inches from my rings but may have been hidden by a tissue; nor did he/they take my husband's watch, his wallet or money pouch, all of which were on his nightstand. Nor did they take our credit cards or passports. The next morning \"M\" who had checked us in denied having seen my rings and showed no surprise or emotion when told we had been robbed of money and jewelry worth over $20,000 while we slept. Security came and searched our unit and our personal belongings. The room manager expressed disbelief that I wore rings all the time as my fingers did not have white bands where the rings would have been. I had to remind him that unlike Cancun, Alaskans do not necessarily have sun tans around their jewelry fingers or wrists. My ring fingers had indentations where the rings rested. Only Veronica (an extremely professional security officer from Argentina and her associate, Max, both from security), showed real empathy for my loss and distress. They accompanied us to the police station where a report was made before we left for the airport. Nowhere in the report did they include the names of the persons I believed should be viewed as suspects. I had provided four names. Their explanation was that they would investigate. Veronica and Max are good people but work for a problem ridden hotel. They are undoubtedly required to protect the Mayan Palace's reputation. I don't have an explanation for their non-disclosure of the suspects names. They acted as translators of the report which was all in Spanish. I believe the theft was an inside job. I suspect that I was targetted as soon as I arrived and checked in. My rings which were unique were often commented upon throughout my travels (25 years) and I had worn them wthout problems all over the world, including in third world countries and other cities in Mexico and throughout South America. The Mayan was the calibre of hotel where fine jewelry would be worn. That was a major mistake. That this incident could have ended in our death is finally dawning on me. Whoever took our money and my rings had to have been prepared to deal with us in some violent manner had we awakened. It takes unusual brass for a thief to come into a bedroom to steal with people asleep in the room. I believe that the Mayan Palace is a dangerous place for tourists if they have anything of value. You are not secure in your condos. I noticed one of the reviewers to Trip Advisor (I read this site's reviews of the Mayan Palace before traveling there) stated that he found strange charges on his credit cards after a stay at the Cancun Mayan Palace. On my return home the same day we were robbed, I discovered a charge of $272 on my Visa card which I had not authorized. I paid my hotel bill of $17 in cash on checking out a little over 12 hours after we had checked in. I had read the reviews about the Mayan Palace before going to Cancun and thought I was safe at this hotel so long as I avoided time share presentations. I was deadly mistaken and realize we could have been killed or hurt badly had we awakened and tried to stop the thieves. It was a costly mistake which I hope all readers will not make themselves. I had a great deal of difficulty getting a phone number for the police and American Consolate from the hotel operator. She didn't want to give me the numbers and it took several tries and some threats to get the phone numbers. My advice is don't go near the Mayan Palace until they clean up all of their problems. The unauthorized charge on our VISA (I had authorized a hold of $100 for any extra's) shows that the problems of this hotel are pervasive from the top down.

The resort was absolutely wonderful and the pool was definitely the highlight of the resort. Check-in was a breeze and we lucked out by getting one of the best rooms in the resort. We had a great view of the ocean and pool. Of course we were asked to attend the presentation, but they easily accepted our decline and there was no further pressure. I will say that I sort of felt like we saw half the presentation anyway because it seemed wherever we walked or were sitting there were at least 5 or 6 ongoing presentations passing us by. There is construction going on but it was never a bother. In fact the room, grounds and any and all public areas were immaculant! It's obvious the upkeep on a place this large would always be ongoing so those complaining about construction aren't being too realistic. They were actually painting in our hallways for several days during our stay and they made an extraordinary effort to stay clear of the guests and maintain a safe walking area. All the service we received at the resort was excellent. From our great maid service, Veronica & Co., to the bellmen, frontdesk, shuttle drivers, and last but certainly not least, Francisco, the bartender.....all were fantastic! The food ranged from above average to excellent....I highly recommend you try the Pizza and Coconut Shrimp from Tumtah! Even the grilled ham & cheese w/homemade bread and turkey gyro...it was all good. We ate at the breakfast buffet \"Del Lago\" once...it was ok, but some of the basics you shouldn't have to ask for like bacon or butter/margarine, you had to make a special request to the waiter. The staff at Del Lago was not that attentive either, but they were concentrating on those going through the presentation. Best thing at Del Lago...the Passion Fruit juice was excellent! The rest of the time we used our kitchenette which was well stocked with plates, utensils, cups, pots & pans, blender, coffee maker, toaster, refrigerator, microwave, and two-burner stove. We rented a car and did our shopping at Chedraui which is about 20 minutes down the 307, next to McDonalds, in Playa del Carmen. I would recommend renting a car...we used it everyday but one...we visited Tulum, Playa del Carmen twice, Xel Ha, Akumal, Paamul, Puerto Moreles, etc. The only downfall in renting a car is the location of the MP parking lot, but the shuttle is very reliable. If you go to PDC, you must eat at Don Emilione's...everything is excellent...including Luis the waiter! I can vouch for other reviews in that the beds are very firm, but oddly enough, my husband and I slept better. You should also know the resort operator places a follow up call to your requested wake up call...just in case you fall back asleep. Again, I must say the pool is outrageous! Three levels, warmer water being on the top level...the hot waterfalls replace even the best massage therapist. This pool is large enough you would have to make an effort to bump into someone else. We chose a different part of the pool to go to each day...the swim up bar in the lower end is the best, but we always ended up back in the warmer water. We never got up early enough to get one the palapa beds, but they are easily available at night....the pool is open 24 hours. It wasn't too difficult to find a chair though...there was only one day I noticed almost every chair was claimed in one way or another. Being pool owners ourselves, we did test the water..the chemicals were on the low end. With a lot of little ones running around, MP should probably kick up the chlorine level a bit. Speaking of little ones...it was nerve-racking watching them run across the large tanning circles in the pool..some parents were paying attention, others weren't. We also witnessed one little girl who nearly drowned...she should have had floaties or something. My husband was ready to jump in and pull her up from under the water as she was crying for help, but her brother (same size, but could swim) rescued her quickly. Parents...bring floaties...it's a gigantic pool, even for the experienced swimmer. The beach was nice, but not too swimmable. It has hammocks, chairs, palapas, etc. It's true, you need watershoes to swim or walk the beach....rocky in some areas, but great shell and coral hunting. You can walk in either direction for easier access for swimming. So with all this said and still keeping in mind we had a great time and will return, we did have a couple of issues/complaints of concern. We did experience the previously-mentioned overwhelming moldy smell in our room for several days.....we thought it might have permeated our clothing & suitcases but it eventually disappeared....we discovered it was coming from the A/C. We shut the A/C off and opened the windows....that helped dramatically. Next concern....the sprinkler system at night...we wanted to open our window and hear the waterfalls but it smelled like they were spraying sewer water. It smelled awful! Needless to say, we were never able to enjoy the waterfall sounds at night. We also noticed that during the day, they were watering the same area with hoses...probably because the timeshare model on the sales tour was directly above our room. They certainly couldn't get any sales with the odor from the automated sprinkler system. Our last and final complaint....the bug spraying that occurs everynight ~5:00pm...if you hear what sounds like a weedeater motor coming....run...seek shelter! Otherwise you will be overcome by thick fog which consists of deet and kerosene. They tell you not to worry...it's harmless....yea, right! I've lived in areas during the 60's where this was common practice....it's not safe and is a hazard to your health...I don't care what they tell you. I know several folks who have battled cancer and are missing some reproductive body parts after overexposure to these toxins. What was the most shocking was that the fogger guy (w/no mask I might add) was spraying while the dinner people were setting up the outside theme buffet for the evening...hello??? Yes, if there's a breeze it blows by eventually, but it also settles everywhere, including the buffet & pool. MP should be spraying much later at night...when less people are around vs. when they are eating or swimming in the pool. On some nights you could smell the insecticide for over an hour after the fogger guy came by. I will say....never saw or felt a mosquito anywhere, but there should be more safety precautions taken. Like I said, despite our few complaints, we had a great time and will definitely return. The MP location is great for venturing out and discovering the Riviera Maya and all it has to offer. Also, I want to say a special hello to Bernie & Lynn from MA as well as the folks from Cincinnati.....we met a lot of friendly people while at MP. One last suggestion...when in PDC...go to Club Alux (pronounced \"Alu-shis\"). It's in a beautiful cave you're free to explore...there's a bar and they serve appetizers and dinner too. They also provide free entertainment. If you take 307 south to PDC, turn right on Juarez.....it's a couple of blocks up Juarez on the left side of the street.

Registration is at the Mayan buildings which is temporary I understand as they are consructing a whole new registration building and water park. As well the new Spa/Gym building is almost finished which is down on the beach. It sounds like it will be spectacular. We had a two bedroom unit that was probably the best timeshare resort I have ever stayed in. It had two separate bedrooms each with King size beds, separate Master baths each with marble showers. Just beautiful. Between each Master bedroom was the Kitchen/Living Room area. It had a refrigerator, microwave, cooktop, coffee maker. Pretty well all you needed to make some light meals. Both couches in the living room had trundle beds as well in the Master bedroom so you could easily sleep 10 people if you had families with children. The rooms were spotless and maid service came twice a day. Not usually a service you get with timehsare. All the staff at the resort were so friendly and willing to help at any time. If you show them you are trying to speak their language they enjoy that and are very helpful. They are very happy people. We were on the main floor of a 3 storey building. Our unit faced out towards the parking area but because we were on the main floor we could not see it because they had landscaped nicely to block the view of it. On the lanai it had loungers and chairs and your own private little pool for cooling off. Quite something. People have complained about the distance to the pool from the rooms. Sure the rooms are not right outside the pool but as far as being too far away I don't know what people are complaining about. Its a nice walk to the pool and beach. Your on a vacation and you have all the time in the world and the exercise does you good especially when you are going to sit by the pool all day eating and drinking. We found the walk to the pool not to be an issue and the gounds are lovely. Enjoy the exercise and the surroundings. The pool is breathtaking!! It is extremely large and only 4 feet deep all around. It is in three levels and each level flows into the next. What is so beautiful is when you are sitting at the pool looking out at the ocean it looks like the pool flows right into the ocean. We never had a problem getting a place to sit. There are lots of loungers and I had no problem finding enough shade. I burn easily so I don't like to sit in the sun too long. The palapas get taken very early in the morning but I didn't really care. I don't want to be laying on a bed under a palapa all day long. If you want a palapa you probably have to get down there first thing in the morning. This is not an all-inclusive resort and I feel that is the better way to go. There are two main dining restaurants on the resort. The Tramonto which they say is Italian but I feel it was more International. We ate there 3 nights and had the most fabulous meals. We had Chateaubriand for 2 one night and it was out of this world, as well as Lobster on Friday night. As well each night they had a musician playing at each restaurant. At Tramonto they had a violinist and at Tum Tah they are a sax player who was phenominal. All this added to the ambiance of the restaurants. The food quality was excellent and the presentation beautiful. The other dining restaurant is the Tum Tah which has an Asian flavour to it. Once again excecellent food. I highly recommend the Cajan Salmon salad and the Coconut Shrimp. We had dinner there one night and lunch 3 days. Loved the food. The pool side restaurant is the Balche. Once again food was good, recommend the fruit salad. We preferred to eat in the TumTah it was nice to take a break from the pool and have a nice lunch with a drink with good service. I would rate the food at the Mayan as excellent. We all eat out a lot back home at fine restaurants and found the dining here as good or better. The quality of the food was always fresh and the price was excellent. The four of us ate everynight with 1 or 2 bottles of wine and dinner sometimes dessert for an average of 1750 pesos or around $175 U.S. That works out less than $l00 a couple. For fine dining I think that is excellent. We never ate at any of the breakfast buffets we had room service a couple of time for breakfast and it was good and we bought a few groceries in Playa to make our own breakfast in our room. As well we went into Playa del Carmen for dinner three nights. This is the advantage to not being at an all inclusive. You can get a change from being at the resort all day. Its a fun little town. The main street is 5th which is closed off to traffic so all the shops and restaurants are along this street. We rented a car for the week which I recommend. In closing all I can say is a holiday is what you make it. You can always find something to complain about. I think you would really have to work had to find something to complain about at the Mayan. When I go on vacation I go with every intention to have a great time and I can honestly say our vacation at the Mayan was one of the best vacations I have had. My only advice is just say NO to the timeshare and you will have a wonderful time here.", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStop, Drop and Roll the Hell Away!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2854438", "Content": "THE STORY OF THE 6 HOUR TIMESHARE EXPERIENCE.

I also felt that I was lied to right from the very start. Thus the feeling of being cheated. You know though, it is a real shame. Their resorts are absolutely beautiful.

I had read so many negative reviews I started the trip with some trepidation, but we had an excellent time. The room: We had a suite with a king bed in the master bedroom, two double beds in the second bedroom plus a living area (with couches that made into beds) & a kitchenette. I had read ahead of time about the \u201cfirm\u201d mattresses. My husband and kids like them firm. I on the other hand. . . well I packed a camping air mattress pad (that rolls into almost nothing) and put it under the bottom sheet and slept wonderfully. Each day the maid made up the room and carefully tucked sheets around my little oasis of softness. Mama was happy and you know what they say. . . When Mama's Happy. . . Everybody's Happy. The service: Maid service twice a day with turn down service at night. Waiters by the pool to serve your every whim. Polite help everywhere you turn. The employees delighted at my attempts at Spanish and encouraged me to practice with them. The pool: large, clean & beautiful. You have to visit to appreciate its enormity and variety. The walk: I read complaints about the distance from the pool. Our walk to the pool was about five minutes along landscaped paths, made more beautiful at night by the \u201cluminaria-esque\u201d lighting along the path. We enjoyed the walk!!! Slow down, smell the tropical flowers and enjoy life. I feel sorry for people that complain about the walk. The food: We did find most of the restaurants expensive, however the ambiance, service and quality of the food were wonderful. We took full use of our kitchenette and ate breakfast and most lunches in our room the days we were on site. We also took advantage of happy hour for reduced prices on drinks. Onsite Activities: If you want to get involved there are free activities all day and most nights. If you want a quiet time alone, that\u2019s available too. Just choose what makes you happy, and don't assume everyone enjoys the same things you do. My husband and kids loved playing beach volleyball with the activities staff. My daughter made some jewelry one day. There were fruit eating contests, dancing lessons, etc. Our family does not drink alcohol, but there were lots of drinking games, etc. to amuse those who seemingly come to Mexico to retain a \u201cbuzz\u201d the entire time. (My 17-year-old daughter had a life lesson seeing how some people just can\u2019t seem to have a good time without drinking, but we all found the snockered adults amusing\u2014many of them bought virgin drinks for my kids when they found out the kids didn\u2019t drink.) My daughter and husband played tennis for a very reasonable rate. Our kids enjoyed the free night time activities playing bingo and singing karaoke where they won t-shirts, etc. They somewhat enjoyed watching the Vegas-type shows (my daughter said that girls dancing in thongs was nasty\u2014ah, my lessons on morality seem to have sunk in!!) They made friends their own age during the week so they enjoyed themselves. The beach: Swimming and snorkeling right off the Mayan Palace beach is not great. However, there is a water activities stand where you can rent jet skis and snorkel on the near-by reef. You can also certify to scuba dive on property, learn to sail, etc. We spent about 15 minutes the first day we were there talking to a very sweet young lady who works at the water activities stand. She told us to just walk around the beach to the right to a nice swimming area. After about a 10-minute walk we found a great beach for body surfing. An early morning walk on that beach yielded several large pieces of fan coral as well as a large conch shell, brain coral, sponges and numerous small shells. Wow, we were impressed. Transportation/Offsite Activities: I arranged a rental rate through Budget in Playa before we arrived. We rented a car on Monday & Wednesday for the five of us for less than $80 per day including the extra insurance. We picked up and dropped off the car at the Mayan Palace. On Monday we went to Xcaret. I had checked out the weather forecast before we left and bought tickets online to save 10%. Since there were five of us it was less expensive to rent a car for the day than to take the ticket option that included transportation for about $20 additional each person. Xcaret was only about a 30 minute drive south of the MP. We truly enjoyed Xcaret. We arrived early, floated down the underground river, enjoyed the amazing aquarium and especially the large area with seemingly thousands of sea turtles. We napped an hour away in hammocks by the ocean during the middle of the day, then walked and walked all over the park enjoying various shows and displays. We opted to eat dinner during the night show. Dinner was about $20 each and was decent quality. We enjoyed reserved seating and totally enjoyed the night show. Speaking a tad of Spanish really helped. The show started with the Mayan concept of how life began, Mayan theology and then had a simulated Mayan ball game. The show progressed past the Mayan times and showed the Spanish conquistadors arriving and bringing with them the Catholic religion and showed a proud Mayan warrior bending his knee to become Catholic. It then progressed in time, showed dances and activities from different areas of Mexico, had excellent singers and progressed through modern times. It was EXCELLENT and is not to be missed. On the advice of several of the Mayan Palace employees, we went to the Coba ruins and to Akumal on Wednesday. Coba was a great experience. Once there we rented bikes for the kids to speed up the distance to be covered there and my husband and I rented a tricycle rick-shaw type of contraption. Our \u201cdriver\u201d was a 22-year-old Mayan and was one of the highlight of our trip. He grew up speaking Mayan in the home and learned beautiful Spanish in school. We with our limited Spanish and he with his limited English had a wonderful conversation about Coba as well as bout his life. Wow, a great day! There are great cenotes near Coba and the beach and snorkeling on Akumal was not crowded and lovely. We ate dinner in Playa at a local Mexican restaurant off the beaten path and for the five of us the bill was under $30 including the tip. Great food and a great time! On Friday we took the collective into Playa del Carmen for $2 each. We shopped, walked the beach, got caught in a rainstorm (we had cheap ponchos in our back pack so it didn\u2019t slow us down), and had a fun day. I highly recommend planning several days to see the sites and alternating them with days being lazy around the pool. It made for a very enjoyable week for us. Construction: The gym/spa is almost complete. They are putting the finishing touches on the interior. We heard construction noise there about one hour per day. They are also building a covered pool and another restaurant in an area between the Mayan Palace and Grand Mayan. Work seems to be progressing slowly, but one of the employees told us that it would pick up in January when occupancy levels were not so high. Timeshare: We just said no and that was that. We knew enough to know we did not want to waste any of our precious vacation time with a timeshare salesperson in exchange for the goodies they offered. We were never bothered by or approached by a timeshare salesperson after we said \u201cno\u201d upon our check-in the first day. My advice: just use your good judgment and remember \u201cTANSTAAFL\u201d (There Ain\u2019t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch). That said, the people we talked to who were Mayan Palace/Grand Mayan owners seemed to enjoy their memberships and vacations. Overall: This was a great vacation. We just can\u2019t decide if we want to go back to Cancun next year or try another Mayan Palace resort. Talk to the employees. Many of them have interesting stories to tell and can help you to appreciate the good life you have. They can also give great advice on how to get the most of your vacation, both inside the resort and on visits to surrounding cities, activities and sites.", "Date": "November 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenacres,Fl", "Title": "\u201cMayan Palace- A dump?

I must say that although I know everybody is entitled to their opinion, clearly there are people who should seek a neurologist and demand an MRI!!Yes, the timeshare presentation is somewhat high pressure. Yes, although we are timeshare owners, they tried to have us buy an upgrade to the better Grand Mayan (we own in the lesser Riviera Maya). Once I told them no, that my current plan is better than their offer,they tried again, then backed off. WHEN YOUR INCOME DEPENDS UPON SALES AND/OR COMMISSIONS BE PREPARED FOR SOME IF NOT HIGH PRESSURE!!! How NAIVE can you be? If you made 75-80 % of your income (maybe more!) by commissions only, wouldn't you try to sell aggressively?? I know I would...that being said....we were upgraded to the Grand Mayan after sitting thru a, yes, 2 1/2 hr presentation instead of 90 minutes. The Grand is much nicer for several reasons: 1) you get a better kitchenette w/bigger fridge 2) you have a small dipping pool on your much larger balcony (much larger).3) The 2 TV's are 25-27 inch vs 19 inch, and furniture is more colorful and contemporary. Plus units are bigger, especially master suite. Yes, there is some more walking to do here, but I need the exercise. Pool was 5-6 minutes away. AND WHAT A POOL!!!! If everything stunk at this resort, the pool itself is worth 5 stars!!! Easily the most spectacular pool I ever seen anywhere...1000 meters long in 3 different levels! Truly phenomenal...yes, the huts with beds were taken early, but we had no problems getting 2 chairs with an umbrella. If you arrived at the pool past 11 AM, well then you're on your own. Food at Tumtah, a restaurant near the beach was very good. Dinner cost us about $50 for 2, and both location and food were very good. The food at the pool snack bar was also good, with service a tad slow. Burgers and club sandwiches were terrific. Buffet breakfast did only once with timeshare presentation,and was OK., my biggest complaint was no eggs-benedict, my fav.! $16 pp for buffet, not too $$$. Room service was a bit slow, but I always remembered this Thanksgiving week, so a full house. Food was good, thought a bit cool. Mexican Fiesta show was overrated I thought. Food OK, but show was mediocre I thought. However, show at Xcaret at night was superb!! Best I've seen in my 5 trips to Mexico..don't miss it. Another thing about Xcaret- some people wrote this a rip-off, I don't see that.If you go after 3 PM, you get in for $35, have about 3 hours to see the exibits and see the show at 6 PM. No, it's not cheap, but the show is almost worth it by itself. Improvements to be made: beds were way too hard (way past firm), pool area needs water fountains, also more speakers around the ENTIRE pool, not just near the snack bar, more TV channels, drop the $3 charge to connect for credit card calls, and hotel deli store 30-40 % overcharge on items. Good stuff: pool and water temp perfect, A/C was fine (yes, a bit too humid in the rooms),maid service 2x a day was excellant, lobby area should have A/C- simply too hot in Cancun for open lobby...also finally be prepared to be somewhat harassed almost everywhere. We loved walking down the 5th ave area in Playa del Carmen, but you can't walk 5 feet without people asking you to come in their store or eat in their restaurant. Almost as bad as the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Cozumel. I know this is how they make a living, but it does get terminal after a while. I have found ONLY Grand Caymen to have no hassels of all the tropical resorts areas and that's because most people there are somewhat well-off (you need a certain income just to live in Grand Caymen), so begging you to come in is not as bad there.... In final, I would recommend the Mayan Palace highly unless you want to be where the action is like Cancun (30-45 min away) or PDC (15-20 min). We are in our early 50's, no kids. I actually give this place 4 1/2 stars, but there was no 1/2 allowed. My wife reminded me that this was a great family place because of the pool area. True. She also reminded me that our teenage nephew would've loved looking at all the teenage girls running around the pool in their skimpy bikinis and don't I wish I was 16 again-THAT she didn't have to remind me of!!

Within minutes of exiting our plane, we were practically attacked my at least seven men wearing official badges, we learned later that all were from the Mayan Palace. One took us aside, showed us his badge and told us he'd help us get a shuttle to our hotel--that it was his job to help us. I realized pretty quickly what he was up to, but my husband got sucked in by promises of free scuba, rental cars, snorkeling, etc. While I was paying for the shuttle at the proper taxi stand, my husband was dishing out $50.00 for \"all these free activities\" and a \"lovely breakfast and tour of the Mayan Palace.\" Let me state that in the end we did NOT get all the free activities this man promised. Fast forward three days later--we've had one day of scuba and one day of free rental car and it's time to take the ferry to Playa del Carmen for the Mayan Palace sales pitch. They gave us a breakfast from their buffet--and while I'm pretty steamed at the MP, this is a totally honest opinion: the food was horrible. More like cafeteria food than the great grub we were getting at our little place in Cozumel. We toured the grounds, and saw an impressive series of pools. It occured to be though that if I was going to spend money to fly to the Caribbean, that I'd rather actually swim in the ocean than hang out at a public pool, which I can do at home for free. There was watermelon eating contest going on, and the man shouting \"RAPIDO\" over the loudspeaker almost drowned out the screaming kids in the pool 50 yeards away. Not very relaxing at all. The rooms were beautiful, nicer than our own home. But, they were also so spread out that if you were placed in a room far from the pools and cafeteria, you'd be taking a shutttle for everything. They showed us a room with a kitchen, and spoke about a grocery store on premisis. I heard that the prices at the MP store were quite high, but might be comparable to how much a taxi would cost to get one into town to shop at a local market (the MP is pretty far out of town). The sales pitch went from nice to horrible. Never in my life have we been treated so rudely (and this is from a high school teacher who deals with juvenile delinquents). I would NEVER in a million years recommend this place to anyone--nor would I ever recommend going to their sales pitch. Once were finally out of there (90 minutes turned into over half the day), we did not get all that we were originally offered. On a purely ethical note, you need to understand that very little of the money you spend at the MP stays to help the local economy or people. MP is a huge corporation, and most of the people who earn a livable wage there were U.S. or Canadian citizens. We've been informed that the only locals hired there are maids, custodians, etc and are making very little in wages. The locals are not happy with this place, and sadly, they have bought a property on Cozumel (the Plaza Las Glorias).", "Date": "November 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPeople Complain Too Much\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2841577", "Content": "Wow....people definitely complain too much.

And feel I need to add my two cents because people who complain about this resort don't know how to appreciate a good thing when they see it. This was my first trip to Mexico. My parents went regularly and I was fortunate to join them on this trip with two of my girlfriends. I was in my late 20's at the time and had a very open mind. My Mom and Dad had told us about Mexican construction so I was quite prepared for the brick by brick laying that occured by the hard working mexicans. The resort was 'open' but nowhere near complete! The resort at the time had the temporary lobby, a beautiful pool, I mean beautiful pool and a restaurant. Did I enjoy myself? Most definitely. If you don't appreciate the Mexican way you won't enjoy your trip. But if you love to take in a piece of culture as you are staying at a 5 star resort you will totally appreciate where you are staying. But...be open minded!! When you see how beautiful the building is that you just walked out of and along the path you pass by a Mexican laying a brick think to yourself...wow.....they are such master creators. But in true mexican fashion they are creating on Mexican time. Brick, break, brick, break...ahh..the culture. Go with an open mind, go with the attitude of this is a holiday and you will enjoy yourself. Go with an uppity attitude then find a different resort because you will just come back with negative reviews. This resort doesn't need this sort of negativity. These are hard working people who go out of their way to make you comfortable. Now...if you go to time share presentation you are your own enemy and you are not dealing with the Mexican people. As I mentioned, construction was all around us but it never bothered us. We took control of our own holiday rather than let it take control of us. We enjoyed the pool, the weather and the service. We caught the bus regularly and cabbed it on the way home as busses didn't run past eleven pm. We bought groceries in Playa del Carmen to reduce our costs as meals were expensive. The walk to the beach and pool is fairly long but worth it and you are on holidays, a little exercise before you plant yourself down for the day won't hurt you! Remember......those who complain have nothing better to do. I look forward to going back, I can't wait to see the progress as the resort we stayed at wasn't even near completion.

I was afraid that it was going to be a bad choice to stay. Thankfully, to any of you who are leery, rejoice! The Mayan Palace was as relaxing, comfortable and elegant as I (a VERY picky person) expected. First, let me be clear about the beach - it's not swimable. You cannot swim in the ocean at the MP. No amount of water shoes will help. These aren't little pebbles in the water - we're talking lava rock and lots of it, hard and thick and sharp - and it goes quite a ways out. You need a boat. Ok. Over it? Let's talk about the pool...ohhhh, the pool. I have an idea that the pool was constructed as an apology about the bad beach...it's almost OVERCOMPENSATION...it's huge. It's an adventure to just try to swim the whole thing, to find every nook and cranny, feel it's different depths, it's warm spots and cool fountains...you will LOVE the pool. True about needing to get there EARLY to get a bed. Oh, and you'll want a bed. A palapa-covered bed to lounge in all day long...while hunky Mexican waiters bring you cerveza after cerveza. They'll bring you meals, blankets, drinks, anything...just ask (and tip! they deserve it!) and they'll pamper you. Anyway - I was there by 7 am and only ONCE was I able to grab a bed - so, early is key. Otherwise, there are plenty of lounge chairs, just, not enough shade. FOOD - hmm...all we did was eat while we were in Mexico, but frankly, I prefered the food in the restaurants in Playa del Carmen...it was way tastier, authentic and less expensive. We ate in every restaurant at the MP... and they were all good...but who eats 44 dollars worth of food in Mexico??? That's what they charged for one of the buffets, and while it was good, (not fantastic) that amount could feed a family of four for 2 days or more anywhere else aside from the tourist areas...it seemed a little \"ugly american\" to spend that much on a meal while these hard-working locals were serving us. Truth be told = the service was perfect, and I'm a pain in the ass. These people work hard and I couldn't tip them enough. They all had great additudes and were so welcoming and friendly - they really made the trip a success. The room was basic, we didn't have the suite with the kitchen, which would have been nice... The bed was way too hard and the pillows very flat. There was a stale, wet and musty odor that I could never get rid of from the room. Bring bug spray, I got bit more in the room than outside! The maid service was impeccable. We ordered room service our last night there - pizza and wings. Good. Timely - it came hot and was cheaper than one of the restaurants on the site - go figure. Drink the water in the room, it's fine - we did, no problem. Off site, who knows - don't risk it. I could go on and on...essentially - go there and relax by the pool - tip in dollars, not pesos - take the bus to Playa del Carmen (avoid Cancun like the plague) for 10 pesos and spend the day on the beach - while you're there pick up a huge gallon of water and some snacks - beer and bring it back, it's way cheaper! Seek out a bed by the pool - do the breakfast buffet at least once and check out the iguanas! Avoid, avoid, avoid the timeshare presentation (just say no) and soak up the sun. Enjoy!

The walk to the pool is fine, they have a shuttle if you so prefer. The pool is huge and has three different sections, all of which are a (descending) temperature. We had no problem getting chairs even at 10 or 11, it's so big it's not a problem. They have two swim up bars and two happy hours, one at 11 and one at 4:30 where everything is 2 for 1. Things are a little pricey at the pool but bring a small collapsible cooler (which the friends we made there did, smart move) fill it up and avoid that cost. The pizza at Tumtah is very good, don't miss it. We stayed in a hotel unit which was fine, we didn't come down there to stay in our room anyway. The suites are definitely better as it gives you a small kitchen and a sitting area. The Grand Mayan is much better overall, if you can stay there definitely do so. The beach is awful but we are pool people anyway. Lastly, getting to Playa is easy. Simply walk across the highway (which is no big deal) and wait for the Playa Express van, it's 10 pesos (less than a buck) per person and it drops you off about a block from 5th Avenue in Playa. Vans and buses also go to Tulum and Cancun and it's just as cheap. Although our friends rented a car, which was nice, it can be a pain when you have too many cervezas on 5th Avenue and suddenly remember that you still have to drive home! Oops.

We exchanged through RCI into the Grand, had a one-bedroom unit that was beautiful, would have been enough room for at least 4-6 people. We loved the resort, knew to stay away from the timeshare people (who were everywhere!), and had a great time. We lounged by the gorgeous pool at least every other day, and also did some sightseeing. We Did rent a car, which I would absolutely recommend if you stay here, unless you dont plan on leaving the resort. We went to Tulum (which was ok, we stayed about 30 minutes) but did run into a great local named Gilmer who works for Edventure Tours based right there at the entrance to the ruins. Gilmer took my husband and I on the BEST day of snorkeling we have ever had. He is from the area, knows it well, and knows exactly where to go to get the best sights. We snorkeled in the cenotes (caves), in the bay at Akumal (more about this great town later) in which we swam with giant sea turtles, and in a lagoon. If you are planning on snorkeling, I would definitely recommend going to find Gilmer or Edward at Edventure tours. They will show you a great time! We found the sleepy little fishing village of Akumal a great place with beautiful beaches and no crowds! Went back down there one day just for relaxing on the beach. The beach at the resort is definitely not for swimming, even for walking, unless you have water shoes. It was ok with us, as we loved the pool (which was actually chilly, and the weather was, too!) the week we were there. We ate at all the restaurants, and all were good. The walk from the room to the beach, restaurants, etc. was not all that bad, was a good way to walk off all the good food and muy beien cuervas! Some tips: you have to ask for your bill at all food and bar places, as the Mexicans think it rude to bring your check before you ask. Say la cuenta por favor! Driving our rental was no problem, just get used to split highways around Playa del Carmen, etc. and all the scooters everywhere. All in all, our trip was an adventure, and we loved it! We would definitely stay at the Grand again, but probably will rent a villa in Akumal if we go back to the riviera maya. Email if you have any questions!

Having never booked a week long trip like this to another country all by myself, separate from airfare and roundtrip airport shuttle transfer vouchers...and without having a local travel agent involved, yikes!! My fears were quickly put at ease when we arrived at the Cancun airport...right on schedule. We were quickly able to get all of our luggage and find a rep. from Royale Tours Shuttle waiting for us outside. After a short delay of radioing for the van to arrive, we were before you know it arriving at the entrance of the Mayan Palace. Our check in went very smoothly and quickly as we were assigned a 2-bedroom suite in Bldg. 2, about halfway from the pool/beach area vs. the main lobby. At this resort, the \"Grand Mayan Palace\" sets further away from the pool/beach/lobby area vs. the \"Mayan Palace\" (which we were in). This caused a great deal of concern before our arrival, as we thought this was all one resort. We could not have been more pleased with our accomodations. King size bed for us in our private room, two queen size beds for my two teenagers in the room each with baths, with a large well furnished living room and kitchenette between the two adjoining rooms. We were able to fix our own quick simple breakfasts and lunches, which only required us to eat out for dinner each night (which was our plan all along). We ate only a few meals at the resort restaurants themselves. We tried all 4 venues and although they may have been slightly higher priced for our budget, the food and ambiance was presented quite well. We either took a taxi or a shuttle to PDC each night for dining and shopping. We learned quickly that the going rate \"into\" PDC was much less than was posted at the resort as we were able to negotiate a rate of $5-7 each time. If not, we paid $1 U.S. pp to ride the shuttle bus into PDC. Although the shuttle option would probably not appeal to all, as you had to cross two lanes of high speed traffic in each direction to position yourself for the next shuttle across from the Mayan Palace. You waited, usually not long though, in a non-lit weeded area for the next shuttle. I was a little dissapointed that the resort did not have a safer setting for catching a shuttle bus into PDC, but obviously they don't want you to leave the resort and spend your dining money elsewhere!! Our return from PDC each time was generally via a taxi, which was usually considerably more expensive back...imagine that!! We were still able to negotiate a better than advertised rate back to the resort, usually about $12-$15 for the four of us. We did take the shuttle bus back once as well as a bigger \"greyhound\" type bus back for $1 U.S. pp. so it was quite reasonably priced and convenient right off of 5th Avenue. The pool area at the Mayan Palace was even better and more picturesque than advertised!!! Plenty of loungers everywhere and palapas complete with bedding, if you got there early enough to hold one (usually by 7:30AM. What an awesome concept for those that don't want full sun all day long, great for reading and playing games for all ages!! We could not have asked for better or friendlier service from bell hops, maids, and desk staff. Everything, including our return shuttle trip back to the airport and our flight back home went right as scheduled. WE TRULY CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK.

My husband and I were down in Cancun celebrating our one year anniversary. Like others, we were cornered at the airport by a young, well-spoken gentleman who sported a badge which read \"tourism advisor\". It was very official looking and everything, and us being first-time tourists from the US, were caught off-guard. Anyway, he promised us all sorts of gifts, and to be honest with you, after it all, we did end up saving a lot of money on activities we were already planning to do anyway, so it wasn't a complete loss. But I digress....We spent roughly four hours at the resort plus one hour each way to and from our hotel. The first person we dealt with was very presentable and pleasant, and since we knew what we were getting ourselves into we played along. However, we grew weary when deal after deal was thrown at us, with every possible angle you can imagine, and no end in sight could be seen. We now had the first person plus the \"closer\" both pushing us in tandem. It was actually amusing up to a point to watch them come up with new and improved strategies to separate us from our money, the guilt-trip was my personal favorite, and I'm still not sure what made me snap, but I stood up midway through one of their sentences and said \"I'm leaving now\". They both stared at me, mouths agape, and had the nerve to ask what they'd done to piss me off. I simply said \"No, you haven't done anything specific that's pissed me off, it just dawned on me that we have wasted four hours of a vacation we've already paid for listening to this\". The first one looked like I'd just slapped her and said that we were almost finished and then we could collect our earnings, because, and let's be honest, at this point that's what they were, and go. I said I didn't even care about the gifts anymore I just wanted out. They then sent us to a \"general manager\" who, when I told him I wanted to leave said, and I quote, \"you can't leave until you complete and sign this form\". I just stared at him, then walked away. My husband, who's much nicer and more diplomatic than me, took the time to complete the questionnaire (which, by the way, was some joke of a quality assurance that their reps were doing their job \"correctly and ethically\"). We ended up leaving with our gifts, so at least we got something back for all the time they robbed from us, but the entire experience still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and for a moment made me think twice about coming to Cancun, let alone coming back. Fortunately, the hotel we paid to stay at ended up being a nice place and we would probably return there. I do know one thing though, I'm going to warn everyone I can think of to be on the lookout for these scam-artists, which if you think about it is ironic since they claim word-of-mouth as one of the biggest assets to promoting their business. Yeah, well they can count on plenty from me. I submitted my full review, but forgot one really important point. At the airport when we arrived and were approached by the \"tourism advisor\" about the Mayan Palace, he offered us a free tour and two others at a significant discount, however, we had to pay him right then for the two tours which came to about $116 USD. Looking back on it now it all makes sense. He took our money, attached it to the \"offer\" he had made us, gave us one copy and then told us we could go tomorrow and if we decided we didn't want the tours, could get our money back at the Mayan Palace no questions asked. The morning he was supposed to pick us up at our hotel I was really having second thoughts, but since the only way to get our money back would be to go, what choice did we have? Very clever! So don't give any of them money up front like we did.

We have stayed in other resorts all along the Pacific Coast of Mexico over the last 8 years. Each has its own features.

The resorts on the Pacific side are much more \"ocean view\" favorable. Our goal is to relax at pool and ocean side locations. This trip we stayed in the \"Grand Mayan\" section.

We were on the third floor and could see the ocean from our balcony. The shower was large enough for 4 people, the in-room whirlpool tub was also wonderful.

There is still a bit of construction going on at this location, including a new beach front spa and gym. Because it was not finished we had massages in our room.

It is a fairly new resort and some areas are still under construction. There are currently 3 restaurants on site, to include a snack restaurant by the pool, a seafood restaurant and Italian restaurant. There is also a hot and cold breakfast buffet. They are in the process of building an Asian restaurant, covered pool, spa, gym and waterpark. I am not sure when they will be completed as they are at the beginning stages of contruction. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The rooms are very large and clean. There is daily maid service and turn-down service in the evening. The pool is gorgeous and they say it is the largest in South America! At first we were concerned that we may lose track of our children because of the size of the pool, but the pool is 4 feet deep at its deepest area so the children had fun going and exploring the fountains and waterfalls of the pool. The size of the pool was nice because it never felt crowded. They have two swim-up bars and two happy hours. There are plenty of chairs around the pool, some shaded and some not. They have hourly activities by the pool to include water basketball, water volleyball, blackjack, bingo, salsa lessons, crazy games, etc. They also have ongoing crafts by the pool under a shaded area. In the evening, they have nice dance shows free of charge and casino night. The restaurants on site were good, especially the seafood restaurant which also served pizzas cooked in a wood burning oven. The prices in the restaurants are about the same prices in the U.S. or possibly a bit more. There is a small grocery store on site or you can go to Playa Del Carmen (15 minutes away by bus or taxi) for a larger supermarket. The beach in front of the resort is not suitable for swimming as there is a lot of coral in the water. You can however wade in the water there or walk 5 - 10 minutes either left or right of the resort to come to get to a swimming area. There are lounge chairs and umbrellas on the beach. The only drawback to the resort is be prepared for a lot of walking. The pool, beach and restaurants are in one area and most of the units are not close by and do not have oceanviews. They do have a shuttle bus that takes you around the resort if you do not want to walk, but when you're on a beach vacation it would be nice to have a unit close to the beach and pool, especially if you have children. There is not much nightlife at the resort. If you prefer nightlife, you will need to go to Playa Del Carmen (15 minutes away) or Cancun (45 minutes away).", "Date": "September 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSplendid accommodations!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2518870", "Content": "I have been to the Mayan Palace in three different locations in the past four years.

I really wasn't sure how this trip was going to be with all of the bad reviews I had read. To tell you all the truth, I truly think that the people who left bad reviews (other than the timeshare reviews) are a bunch of whiners & that is all there is to it. We can't compliment the resort enough. There was so much to do & playa del carmen & Cancun are so close. Playa del Carmen is only 15 minutes away & there is a lots of people, bars and a ton of restaurants& shops. We are in our early twenties and stayed at the resort 6 out of 7 days and never got tiered of being there. Everyday from 10 am to 4:30 pm they have activities for you to participate in, like ping pong,water volleyball, horseshoes, water polo &dance lessons ( which was a big winner with the ladies). Also, if you play in a tournament & win you get a free t-shirt or a drink. Luckily for us we won alot of the tournements so we drank for free for most of our stay. What we loved about the resort the most was the staff, they are so fun and friendly , we made friends with a lot of them. Food at the resort is expensive, but that is what you expect when on vacation. Tum tuh the restaurant right on the beach was our favorite b/c it is so romantic, our waiter Juan had the mariachi band and the sax player come over to our table and perform a song especialy for us. The waiter realy made our time there memorable. The mexican fiesta was a lot of fun and by far the best mexican food we have ever had, although it has a pretty steep price at 42$ pp. It is all you can eat and drink. And the show was really a special. They also have casino night where there are roulette tables and black jack tables set up. The staff dresses up and really make it as close to vegas as a beach resort can. At the end of the night if you have done really well on the tables you can bid on dinner for 2, trips to tulum and a lot of other stuff. The beach is everything that everyone has said it is, unswimmable and rocky. But they have a lot of palapa's which you do need to get to early b/c everybody camps out on them all day around the pool and the beach. We always went to the beach palapa's in the evening and had no problem getting one. As for the bugs , I never really saw any mosquitos but there were a lot of little bugs that look like nats and those things really ate me alive. Make sure you bring OFF or some other bug spray. bugs are bugs and you are in the tropics so you should be expecting those kind of things. All in all we had no real problems just one minor thing, our key card in our rooml kept locking us out, so we kept having to go to the front lobby to get new one's.

The room\u00b4s are very spacious. We were told that the building we were in was brand new, so of course there were details in the kitchen and rooms that were missing, things so simple as trashcans (only one for the two bedrooms). From the building we were installed in, to the swimming pool it was a good 15 minute walk. Our main comment about the Mayan Palace is the transportation within the resort. They are so busy during the mornings moving people to their time share presentations, they forget they have to move the guests that are already in the resort. They said there were golf carts every 15 or 20 minutes to take you, but one time we waited for 30 minutes and nobody came around. We think they really have to work on the logistics on how to move guests arount without having them wait more than 10 minutes. Our kids are 9 and 6 years old and they obviously prefered to walk than stand around waiting for I don\u00b4t know how long until someone showed up. The housekeeping service was very good, food was expensive but good, and the swiming pool was great. It is true you are in the middle of no where, but if you are making a reservation in the Mayan Riviera that is what you are looking for. If you want to be in the middle of the excitement stay in Cancun or directly on Playa del Carmen. And the famous time share presentation everyone talks about, nobody forces you to go, if you simply say no I don\u00b4t want to go that\u00b4s the end of that subject.

This site was really helpful in getting us prepared for what to expect, so here is my attempt to return the favor: 1. It is a large property, but we stayed in the Grand Mayan with the longest walk to the pool and it wasn't too far for us....hint, if it's really hot, just walk down the breezeway through the other buildings and you can stay out of the sun! 2. Rent a car if you want to move around. Taking the bus on the highway is an option, but it looked like it can take alot of time. Also, it can be an uncomfortable wait in summer. We rented from Hertz with no problems...used our CDW insurance that came with the Platinum Chase Credit Card. I called Chase ahead of time and confirmed the coverage and made sure that it was valid in Mexico. Be careful driving. The traffic flow and the exits off the highway can be confusing, but just watch everyone else. There is good parking at the north end of 5th avenue in Playa. 3. Go to the grocery store in Playa...it's fun, inexpensive and it will give you some freedom from the restaurant fare. 4. The restaurants at the Mayan Palace are all excellent...lots of food, very well prepared, and presented. We didn't feel that the prices were that high relative to the quality of the food and the tip was already included. The room service is also a great option...same price and hot. We ate like kings and would have spent alot more for a comparable meal in the states. 5. The beach...well it is natural and unless the surf is flat, very difficult to snorkel in...but there is GREAT snorkeling in Puerto Morales. Just go north about 15 minutes and into Puerto Morales. There is an information hut that can arrange a snorkel boat for $22/each. This includes gear, life vest (mandatory to keep you off the reef), a park bracelet, and a bottle of water during a break in the 2 hour trip. The reef is directly off shore, so you spend all of your time snorkeling vs. riding in a boat. If you go back, keep your wristband on and you can save $5 on the next trip. 6. The pool...is very large with lots of variety, but it is shallow so the water heats up over time and gets down right hot...so, use the beach to cool off. BUT, after it rained the water cooled down and was great for the last few days of our week. All in all, the Mayan Palace was wonderful. They are still working on it but we didn't find the construction a problem. Bugs didn't bother us and neither did the time share sales reps. They are busy running alot of tours through every day. We would definitely go back and may try another Mayan Palace property next trip to Mexico. I also recommend locogringo.com. There is alot of information and pictures if you are interested in exploring. We went to Yal-ku lagoon in Akumal, instead of Xel-hal for $6adults and $3kids!

So I did not have very high expectations at all. I booked my trip thru Travel to Go and got a great deal on a hotel room w/o a kitchen. First I would like to say NEVER EVER accept a price for anything without saying NO at least twice. Don't act like like you even care about it very much whatever it is, even if you really want it. You can always get a cheaper price. The shuttle cost my husband and I $15pp from the airport to the hotel (Greenline Transportation). While at the airport never ever let anyone even if they have on a uniform, move your bags for you. Don't stop when you get past customs, don't make eye contact with anyone! We were offered a package at the airport by a man to go to a timeshare presentation, we just took the info and said we'd think about it and walked away. Upon arriving at the resort, we were never offered anything about a presentation, and we didn't wait around for them to ask, we ran to our room with our bellboy. Our room was very clean and the air conditioning was just fine for us. We had no problems with anything. The pool was great, it was not too warm for me, after being in the 95 degree sun and heat anything felt better than the sun on my shoulders. The beach was terrible, but we just chilled by the pool. I thought that I was going to be disappointed that we couldn't get in the water but the pool filled that need. On the third day there we took the bus (10 pesos=$1) to Playa Del Carmen. Take the bus all the way to the bus stops at the bus station in Playa. The walk to that beach is about 5 minutes. The beach is beautiful and sandy no rocks! There are however LOTS of salesmen for timeshares there. Just ignore them! Unfortuantly it rained this day so my husband and I decided to turn into sales sharks of our own. There was a guy Juan at a Fisherman's Village booth that kept following us. So when it rained we went back to him after coming up with a speech :) We got him to give us free ferry tickets round trip to Cozumel, as well as $30 cash US, and a glass bottom boat right and snorkeling in 3 spots (3 hours) and to top it off we were hungry so we asked to be feed while we were there-we got a buffet for two. I asked for a guarentee that we would receive this stuff and he filled out a form that they had there and signed. We took a cab with Juan to the Resort- less than 5min away. They took us to the buffet and we stuffed ourselves, it was wonderful! In the end we smiled and said NO- and we left with our vouchers and $30 after only 2 1/2 hours. By this time the rain had stopped and the sun was out, we just gave each other a high five :) We went snorkeling in Cozumel and it was soooooo clear and wonderful, we say barracudas, star fish, parrot fish, eels, conch, and stingray! The company was Kozumel Snorkeling it was the only red boat with a straw or palapa top, we also received drinks and Coronas. I would highly recommend them! As for food, I didn't think it was all that expensive for the two of us. No more expensive than any other resort. You get ehat you pay for it is always hot and good! On average we would spend about $40 for the both of us for dinner. We don't drink and we only ordered entrees no appetizers and we drank bottled water. We only ate at Tul Ta the resturant by the beach. They have live music every night either Mariachi band or a guy playing the sax. It was very romantic! Their pizza is the bomb! The store onsite is a little high, but we brought alot of snack food with us, granola bars, crackers, pringles and bottled water etc. The snacks usually held us until dinner. I didn't get bit by a mosquito the whole time until the last day, I was on the beach late, there are small biting flies. But near the resort I inever saw a mosquito, they spray twice a day. All in all I thought the resort was great. I can't wait to see it when the spa and gym are finished and the beach is done being resurfaced. There are always events going on every hour, water aerobics, volley ball, dance lessons (very fun), and more. If anyone wants more info regarding this resort, email me.

First, the resort is nice, very large, and the pool is great (although very warm as someone else commented) and open 24/7. Unfortunately, we were in the building that was the farthest from the pool, a 10 min. walk! The rooms were very large (we had a 1 bedroom/kitchenette) and very clean. There was a humidity issue, even when using airconditioning, all of our clothes (even the clean/never worn) quickly became damp and somewhat smelly, and the towels/swimsuits would never dry. The restaurants (3) at the resort are VERY expensive, especially if paying for a family to eat. Just having nachos (1 order), chicken strips (1 order) and 4 drinks ran us $40. Although we never ate at the evening buffet, we did ask about prices which ran min. $22.50 p/person and varied depending on what was served. The other 2 restaurants were a'la carte with entrees starting about $10-13 (for some pasta). Since we had teens with us, and somewhat on a budget, we ordered from room service in the evening. You can get hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, etc. with fries, pizza, salads, etc. for about $9 p/person. The food came fairly quick and hot. We also ordered room service for breakfast on the last day (rather than paying the high buffet price) and got omelets for about $7. Having the kitchenette really helped. We went to Playa del Carmen to the grocery/Walmart type store and stocked up on lunch meat, cereal, drinks, snack, etc. which saved a lot of $. As everyone else has said, the food in the resort grocery was really expensive for some items. The pool bars had happy hour (2 for 1) at least once a day- go to the bar closest to the snack shop that's poolside, they at least put something in your drink for the $6.50 charge! The beach right off the resort is okay, yes, the shoreline is rocky, but we wore water shoes and managed to snorkel okay. A resort shuttle will take you to the front entrance of resort (it's a good hike- take the shuttle!) so you can go to Playa del Carmen, Cancun, Xcaret-wherever. The local bus was easy to catch from the main road in front of the resort entrance. The bus ran somewhat inconsistent and not the every 15 min. as the resort will tell you. It's $1 p/person, airconditioned, and usually pretty full, especially in the evenings. We got a taxi to Playa del Carmen the first night only (because the mosquitoes were VERY bad, and we couldn't take it anymore!). The taxi cost us (4 people) $10 total. To come back to the resort from the grocery in Playa cost us $15. By the way- Playa del Carmen is about 20 min. away. I can't recommend places to eat in Playa, although we ate at a lot, it was hit and miss. We didn't find any \"cheap\" restaurants as others mentioned. Doing the Tulum/Xel-ha tour (inc. dinner at Xel-ha) was probably one of our favorite trips. Especially going to Tulum. The snorkeling was awful in Xel-ha, very murky water. It would probably be better to do Xel-ha as it's own package and not with Tulum, because there wasn't enough time to do all we wanted there. We found Xcaret disappointing as far as an ecological park. It's very spread out with very limited animal exhibits, don't expect it to be like a zoo! There aren't that many animals, and basically, it's 1 of each. We didn't snorkel because other reviews stated there was nothing to see and very cold water (in fact, there is a warning posted about the water temp. if you have certain medical conditions). We really arrived too early and spent a very hot and sweaty 6 hours there and decided to leave- unfortunately, we didn't stay for what everyone says is the best part- the show that was 3 hours later :( If you are interested in snorkeling though, take the ferry to Cozumel Island and snorkel there. What I didn't like about Mexico: be prepared for being ambushed at the airport by shuttle services. We booked online prior to arriving for $105 round-trip (to resort/back to airport) for 4 people. We did a lot of comparing, and felt we got a good rate. Bring insect repellent- the mosquitoes were worse than anything we had ever experienced anywhere. Also, bring sun block and reapply often! Sunburns aren't fun! Some shop keepers in Playa were nearly \"harassing\"- if we even looked at something, they kept wanting to sell it to us- we even got followed down the road a few times. No- body wanted to take \"No\" for an answer. Also, don't expect inexpensive souvenir/silver/ceramic prices. NEVER get suckered into a time-share presentation unless you truly have 3+ hours to waste or want to buy a timeshare. I know the offer of free stuff is hard to pass, but don't EVER believe that it will only take 90 min. And by the way, the timeshare tour at FISHERMAN'S VILLAGE (I believe) was more than 3 hours, our rep. (OTTO was his name) was just plain RUDE, and it was VERY high-pressured sales tactics. We were offered 4 Xcaret tickets to just \"look around\" the timeshare (they knew we already owned w/RCI). We got the tickets (after the presentation), but the time it took and the rudeness of the rep. (OTTO) made it not worth it. Some of the people selling various tours (timeshare, day-trips, etc.) were also harassing, they followed us very closely up/down the streets in Playa and didn't back off with a \"no.\" Also, on Cozumel we were somewhat scammed on our snorkeling tour. We were promised a rate of $25 p/person for a private boat for our family (just with guide) for 2 hours (we wanted time to sightsee afterwards), all the drinks (beer, pop, water, etc.) we wanted, and 2 stops at some of the best reefs. The guy took our money, started to walk us down the sidewalk along the beach, and then we met up with a lady from the tour. The guy turned around and walked off, and we were to follow the lady. She took us to this piece-of-junk boat, FILLED with other people, a cooler of about 4 beers and 2 swallows of pop left in the liter bottle, not enough fins for everyone (we had our own masks/snorkels) and not enough life jackets (even for the kids). They would not give us our money back, told us they never just take a private group, etc., etc. So we had no choice but loose our $100 or go. The stops they did make, we could of swam to from the shore, it was over 3 hours, so by the time we got back- we had less than 2 hours left in Cozumel. So, don't believe everything the people say. And last, everyone wants a tip for everything- tip when appropriate (restaurant, etc.), but watch it! You could (and we did) spend a small fortune in tips. On the plus side: Playa was interesting, especially if you like to shop. We did run into many nice people and people who weren't trying to rip us off. The taxi driver who picked us up outside Xcaret only charged us $15 to go all the way back to the resort (quite a trip), plus he even stopped in Playa so we could go to a money exchange, and he drove us all the way to the resort front lobby area (most will only drop you at the resort entrance). Never take the first price offered for anything (taxi, shopping, day-trip, etc.), say \"no\" a couple of times and the price always goes down. Also, we didn't have any problems being in Playa until 10 or 11 p.m. and taking the local bus back to the resort.", "Date": "July 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cDon't Give In to Their 5 Hour Presentation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2316073", "Content": "I first of all want to start off with that my family and I didn't even stay at the Mayan Palace, but were sucked into the 90 minute timeshare presentation.

We loved the place and plan to go again. We used our RCI to pay for the room. The room was nice and clean, the a/c worked, the staff was friendly, and there were nice little huts on the beach to lounge in. The only complaint was that we had to walk about 10 minutes to a good swimmable beach, but the beach at the resort was sufficient, even though you had to climb over some rocks to get in. But even that was not a problem since we brought our water shoes. We also brought insect repellant. There were mosquitoes in the room, but we did not get bitten since we brought the insect repellant. We had no problem with the timeshare salesmen at the airport or at the resort because we had sense enough not to talk to them at all and we know that there is no such thing as a free lunch or tour, etc. Having a rental car is a good idea as it gives you the freedom to move around. We went on several day and nite trips to Playa del Carmen and to Cancun.

It has been exactly 2 months since I have returned from my most recent trip to Cancun and I am STILL furious about this LYING SCAM. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to read about this \"beautiful property\" prior to making my trip. I had no idea that we would be hunted down, lied to and coerced into be held captive at this location from the moment we attempted to exit the Cancun airport! We were suckered in by their lies of affiliation with Palace Resorts (my #1 choice for ALL future trips to Cancun!) If you are one who thinks you can escape their strong-arm sales pitch and get WHATEVER they have promised you...consider yourself warned and let me say it now... WE TOLD YOU SO. If the Mayan Palace remotely resembled anything they purport to be they would not have to employ such deceit! I find it difficult to believe that there are ANY reviews of this place above a 2! Sure, it's huge...sprawled over acre after acre of beautiful surroundings. I will admit, there are a number of \"things\" that COULD make this a lovely vacation choice. But...if you are dealing with a corporate entity with absolutely NO INTEGRITY, not an ounce of honesty in their tactics, and presentations (which they have to FORCE you to remain at) that promise everything and deliver NOTHING... what exactly must their attitude be about those who CHOOSE to stay there or worse yet...become members??!!!!!!!!?

We were there from the 3rd of July to the 10th of July. Our family of 4 stayed in a \"Master Room\" which is actually a regular hotel type room with double beds. The room was on the second floor of Tulum 1/2 with a view of the jungle and no balcony to speak of (couldn't fit a chair and its prohibited to dry wet cloth or towels on it). The place has its pros and cons. The pool is really huge but the water can get hot in the afternoons because it's heated 24/7. But the last pool, near the beach on the south side has cool water. Since the water is heated, and the pool is open 24 hours, its great to relax at night, with the cool breeze from the beach. The room had a combination tub/shower and with the toilet in a little room of it own. The beds are on the hard side, but we still had a good nights sleep. The AC we had kept the room COLD even though we set the temp. at 85F. The room was a \"smoking\" room as we were told later that the rooms on the 3rd floor were the \"non-smoking\" (which we had requested but told were all booked). We accepted the 2nd floor room 'cause it was very close to the pool and we have a 6 yr old and an 8 yr old who love to swim. One big complaint we have is that the AC sends in the smoke oder from adjcent rooms and one night the people in the next room were smoking cigars and the oder was all over in our room! Which brings up another complaint, the noise insulation is non-existant between rooms, one morning we were rudely awaken at 6AM by the people arguing in the next room, we could hear almost every word of their inconsiderate blabbering! We complained to the front desk and didn't have a reoccurance. But the cooking oders were something else, as with the smoking oders, when they burnt something on the stove, it transfered to our room. And it seemed like they burnt something every time they cooked. Room service was excellent and reasonable. Except one time we called for \"express\" housekeeping to remove used plates left from room service and clean up spilled food on floor and empty trash can, even though the housekeeper was right across from our room, and had been given the order by radio, express housekeeping was a no-show. The food was ok, and well presented, the Rest. behind the new gym building (name unknown)would even split a meal for the kids without a fuss. But the buffet rest. would still charge a full meal for each child (we consider that a rip-off cause kids don't eat 17 dollars of food each!) We did go to Playa del Carmen to buy food and snacks and the rest. are very economical (recommend the OASIS Rest. on 12th & 5th, try the shrimp tacos, but beware of the hot sauce cause it IS HOT!). Transportation is a little tough, the Mayan will provide a shuttle, but forget requesting it, we did one time and they picked us up 30 minutes later (we waited in the sun, standing, cause they do not provide benches) we could have walked from the beach to the lobby in 30 minutes, then we had to wait another 15 - 20 minutes waiting for the shuttle that takes you from the lobby to the front gate where, for those who want to save $20.US (for a taxi/one way),you have to cross a busy 4 lane highway and take your life into your hands and run like hell to catch a bus that will take you to Playa for 10 pesos or a \"collective\" (which is an air cond. new van) for 20 pesos each (still a bargain!). The Mayan could use some better type of service concerning their shuttle system to Playa or Cancun. As for their timeshare presentation, well, we took them up for one (I know, \"Shark City\"!!). We wanted to see what our options were since we were already owners. But since we didn't want to upgrade just yet, we just made them an offer they COULD refuse, and they immediately hustled us out not wanting to waste their time or ours, total time including breakfast, less then 90 minutes (score one for the consumer!!!). The Grand Mayan rooms are a big improvement from the regular rooms (read elsewhere below) found in the Mayan Palace, Tulum, section. Still they could improve the reg. rooms to bring them up to par with what other timeshare resorts are selling (seperate shower, jetted tubs, stylish sofa beds with pull-out bed below, coffee makers, mini frigs, cable TV with more channels, alarm clock, etc...), afterall, what is the maint./renovation fees for?? The Mayan Palace will be a great place to vacation, in the future. The beach is still forming (a vast improvement from last year), and it is coming along. By next year they will have a new gym and spa building overseeing the beach as well a water park and an avery (bird sanctuary) with shops all around. Which will make it a little more interesting. As for our family, well we'll exchange our weeks with RCI, and go vacation somewhere else, and maybe return to the Mayan Palace in a couple of years when its all finished.

I tracked this site for months before going and had a lot of mixed feelings prior to going but those were quickly gone when we pulled up to the front gate. The Mayan Palace was fantastic! We stayed in the Grand Mayan area in a two bedroom unit that could sleep up to 12 people. We had seven in our unit and had plenty of space. Full kitchen, 3 TV\u2019s, 2 bathrooms each with Jacuzzi tubs and showers, and a small pool on our 2nd floor balcony for cooling down in. Our view was across the huge lagoon to the ocean and yes, we had an ocean view. Maid service was twice a day. We had two minor problems with our room that required maintenance and it was corrected instantly. We were asked about the timeshare presentation (also called a welcome or orientation breakfast) and said no and we were never bothered gain. Heed the warning, if you say yes to any timeshare presentation you should expect to be held captive and pressured heavily. This is how timeshare sales work. Free stuff just isn\u2019t free in Mexico and if the offer is too good to be true, then you are getting taken. Construction was going on in the spa and some walkways as well as the new lobby building but the resort is so large you couldn\u2019t even hear the equipment being used. The pool is an incredible site. It is so large that we often felt as if we were there by ourselves. We never had a problem finding chairs or shade. If there is any complaint it is that the pool water is too warm. Pool is open 24 hours a day and we used it one night at close to 11pm and had it to ourselves. I would agree with most that the beach needs work because it is rocky off shore but if you are just looking to lie out and not swim in the ocean, the beach is fine. Restaurants were good. We ate breakfast almost daily at the buffet which is excellent. We also ate dinner at the buffet and it was as well. My cautions are this: If you are going to Mexico don\u2019t expect it to be like the United States. Foods taste different. Gone are the days of all you can eat Lobster for $5. You should expect to pay fine dining prices in Mexico at restaurants that are just so/so by American standards. People act differently. Expect to be barked at and hounded by salesman and shop owners. Also expect great courtesy and a helpful attitude. The Mexican people are fantastic and hard workers but they do things differently than we do and not always as quickly. Expect a unique experience, don\u2019t expect the United States. By the way, I do not work for the Mayan Palace. I do own a timeshare at a US resort.

Our check in upon arriving at the lobby was pretty smooth since our friends had already checked into the two bedroom suite a couple of days earlier. After checking in, a sales person was ready to take us to another area for our \"welcome package\". We read this to mean \"timeshare\" presentation and proceeded to say no thank you and we boarded our shuttle to our building. We were not asked again during our week stay about seeing a presentation. The rooms we had were beautiful overlooking the lagoon area. We really liked the firm beds, bathrooms and the cool water wading pool on the balcony. The housekeeping service was outstanding and we made a point to tip them generously on a daily basis. Our friends purchased groceries when they came into town so we had many meals in our kitchen which saved some money in the long run. We did have some meals out at the pool which were very good too. The pool is definitely a signature point for the resort. I suggest trying to go to the pool either earlier in the morning or later afternoon since the water temp will be cooler than the jacuzzi temps you will have during the rest of the day. My girls enjoyed all of the activities that took place around the pool area. As mentioned by others, there is no beach to speak of so we took the great suggestion of walking down around 15 min south and found a great swimming area there. We also saw the chocolate brown labrador retrievers menioned in an earlier post! Being a golfer, I wanted to check out the golf course on the premises. Given the activities we had planned for the week, I did not have time to golf. However, the golf staff let me take a golf cart out and let me take pictures of the course. I can tell you that if you have any inkling about wanting to play this course, then go for it. Jack Nicklaus, must have been in a sadistic mood when he designed this par 3 course because it is really a difficult piece of work. I ended up taking about 50 pictures of the course on my digital camera just so that my friends back home could see for themselves. Anyway, enough about the golf... The negatives I had were that the ice machines could not keep up with the demand. Our building had only one ice machine and was daily running out of ice during the mid day. Other resort visitors experienced similar results. The other item worth repeating is that once dusk comes around be prepared to get bitten by the mosquitos. Even though we lacquered ourselves with repellent, we were still hit hard. Lastly, if you are planning to get transportation from the Grand Mayan to the airport, skip taking the Grand Mayan shuttle ($15 per person, so $60 for my family) and get a quote from one of the taxis there.

Guess what, if you don't want to attend you don't have to. They don't hold a gun to your head. They do offer incentives such as discounts or free tours, but if you aren't interested you simply say so, firmly, and the experience is over. It's common sense, don't attend if you don't want to. We absolutely loved our stay! The pools were great. We usually went to the pool around noon and had no trouble finding a lounge chair. The palapas were taken quite early, but we didn't mind. We spent much of the time in the pool or at the swim up bar anyway. Each day that you are there they give you a copy of the Mayan Times in your room. It lists the different activities for the day. They have several happy hours throughout the day where the drinks are two for one. They actually serve you two drinks at once. But if you nicely ask them to put your second beer in the fridge until you are ready for it, they will gladly do so. The food was great!! The Italian restaurant above the convenience store is delicious! The buffet at the Fiest Mexicana is INCREDIBLE!! The price is $42 for dinner and the show and it is well worth it. It was the best dinner we had the entire trip!! And the show was great too! Room service is great also. No matter what time we ordered, the food always arrived within 30-35 minutes. The rooms were always kept very clean. The housekeeping staff was so nice. They clean your room twice a day. In the evening they turn down your bed and place a chocolate on each side. At the end of the trip they leave an envelope for tips for the housekeeping staff. We didn't mind at all considering how neat they kept the room. We used the safe, they were great. However, we left such things as a portable DVD player, video camera and cameras and nothing went missing. To get to the main road you need to take a shuttle or golf cart to the gate. Playa del Carmen was about 15 minutes. The cab fare was about 18 us dollars. Or, you could take the public transportation for about one or two dollars. Don't worry, they are air conditioned vans, not busses with chickens running around. We went on tours to Chichen Itza, Xcaret, Tulum and Xelha. We enjoyed all of them. Xelha was great but we wish we would have spent the entire day there instead of splitting the day with Tulum. DON'T TAKE THE TOURS FROM THE HOTEL!! They are very expensive. When you go into Playa del Carmen you should book your tour there. Same exact tours but significantly cheaper. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our vacation. We were sad to have to leave. I read some of the other reviews and have decided that a vacation is what you make of it. Yes, the hotel isn't close to the street, but why would you want to be? The lobby was a distance from our room, but it was nice to walk and see the grounds. Or take a shuttle, no problem. We couldn't swim at the beach but we were staying on the Mayan Peninsula where there is no shortage of beautiful white sandy beaches.

You read a whole lot of letters here warning you not to attend the Time Share Sales presentations at the Mayan Palace Resort or Hotel and thats great advice. STAY AWAY AND DO NOT ATTEND there Time Share Sales presentations because they are horrible, terrifying, a nightmare and it can wreck your vacation. Please read my story. I have been to Cancun 8 times and I have also been to Puerto Vallarta 2 times. I am very aware of the fact that both of these destinations have many Time Share Resorts and many, many solicitors who run around the streets begging you to attend a Sales presentation in order to receive a free gift for your time. Well on my most recent trip to Cancun I went to the Riviera Mayan region instead of staying right in Cancun. I read a whole lot of reviews all about the horrible Mayan Palace Resort Time SHares presentations and almost every one was claiming that you were forced to stay for 5 - 6 - 7 hours before they would allow you to leave. I had read so many different reviews all claiming that you were forced to stay for so many hours I most definitely did believe them. I even printed out some copies of some of these horrible reviews and packed them in my suitcase to take on my vacation. I went with a group of eight friends on our vacation. One day four of us went into town in Playa Del Carmen. Every few steps you took you would see and constantly be approached by the yellow polo type shirt dressed solicitors for the Mayan Palace Resort. They were all trying so hard to convince you to go attend the Time Share Sales presentation and you would be given a free nice gift for your time. I finally actually listened to one man in particular very close to the large boat docks or pier where all of the large tour boats docked. He tried to get me and my girlfriend to attend and he offered as a gift COLD HARD CASH. I explained to him that it was not a good idea because I had actually read in advance about how they forced you to stay and endure their sales pitch for as long as 5 - 6 - 7 straight hours. He said that was crazy because he said, \"Why would they want you to stay for that long if they already know the answer is no\"? Well they do want you to stay that long and they make you stay no matter what. I went ahead and agreed to go attend the Sales presentation that I had already read all about in advance. Here is the first problem that sets this resort apart from all of the hotels and resorts in Cancun. The Mayan Palace Resort is extremely isolated. It is located exactly half way between the city of Playa Del Carmen and the city of Cancun. Just from the major highway or interstate to drive down the private road to the resort is quite a distance. When you get there you do immediately feel or sense that you are their captive prisoners held solely at their mercy. You are counting and depending on them for your transportation back to wherever you are going or staying. When we attended our presentation I had promised myself that I would absolutely not allow them to make me or force me to stay any longer than 90 minutes to two hours. Your invitation even says that you are only required to stay and attend for 90 minutes. Well when we reached the two hour mark I started explaining and telling all of these sales people or shall I say Sales Outlaws and Sales Criminals that all belong behind bars that we had already fulfilled our obligation and committment to them. Therefore it was time to give us our free gift (or as in our case free CASH) and let us leave. They all said NO. You have to stay because we are not through yet. I said we have already been here for longer than two hours and we are only obligated to stay for 90 minutes. Again they said NO. They now claimed that we had to stay for as long as they decided the whole or entire presentation would take. They also mentioned that I was not subtracting or deducting the time that we spent eating our free lunch. They told me that none of that time counted towards the Sales Presentation and I would simply need to stay for as long as they wanted. I even pointed out with my finger on the piece of paper on the invitation that it stated we only had to stay for 90 minutes. They still said NO. At the three hour mark when we were still told that we could not leave I brought out my loaded guns to end this once and for all. I said, \"Look, I actually read all about you people back home in Denver, CO before I even came here\". \"I read exactly how you make every single last person stay here for as long as 5 - 6 - 7 hours before you allow them to go. Thats not right and you can't do that.\" I can't remember now if I had actually taken the print out of the articles or not from the internet. Remember I told you that I had actually printed many of the bad reviews off the internet and packed them in my suitcase. Well I think but I'm not sure or certain but I really do think I now produced out of my pocket some of the actual letters about them forcing every one to stay for 5 - 6 - 7 hours. They went nuts. They then told other employees about what I did. We had already dealt with about five different people at the three hour mark and now another extremely aggressive man approached us. Remember I was there with my girlfriend. There employee said I was dishonest, a con, running a scam, ripping them off, stealing from them, robbing there resort. I said to him you are way out of line. First of all I told him you have yellow polo shirt employees and solicitors all over the place begging and bothering all of the tourists to come here. I had already told their own solicitor in Playa Del Carmen that I did not want to come here and stay all day long. However the solicitor swore to me that they would not do that or try to make me stay all day long . Of course now that I am here and you are trying to make me stay all day long. Then this aggressive man said, \"Lets get rid of them\" \" \"Lets throw these crooks out of here\"\" I was the one being called the criminal. My girlfriend became extremely upset and so did I. I was also confused by exactly who this man was. He actually either told us he owned the whole resort or that he was the President and owner of the Time Share Sales office. I think he said that he was the owner and President of the Time Share Sales department. He claimed that I was only there to steal his on personal money or cash. This man was crazy. My girlfriend and I were coming unraveled. I did not know for certain but I was thinking that after all of this time we were not even going to get our cash gift and literally be walked out by their own security and then be forced to get or pay for our own transportation back to our own hotel. This did not happen though. Unfortunately what did happen was this. EVEN AFTER ALL OF THIS ONE MORE PERSON STILL ATTEMPTED TO SELL US A TIME SHARE!!!!!! We were moved along to another area to see yet one more sales person. Instead of just finally giving us our gift and ride home she still tried for several more minutes to get us to buy a Time Share to the pitiful, pathetic, last place in the world I would want to go to Mayan Palace Resort. After several minutes we did finally receive our cash gift and our free ride back home. This was four hours later. They really did have me scared for a while when the aggressive man said we were the criminals and that I was only there to steal his money. He was wrong and they are all wrong. I truly do believe that all of these vicious, deceptive, deceitful, dishonest CRIMINALS & OUTLAWS do all belong behind bars in prison. I really do wish that they would all read this letter that I just wrote. PEOPLE DO NOT GO THERE. DON'T DO IT. If every one would unite and boycott both this resort and their Time Share Sales presentations maybe they would finally start to change their ploys and sales tactics. I know for a fact right now that they have not changed anything yet because I was reading the horrible nightmare reviews about them one year ago and these same stories are being told about them still today.

Happy Hour drinks were a great deal, and service was extrordinary. The rooms were large and very clean. Maid service came twice daily. The restaurants were fantastic, but just a touch on the expensive side. We rented a car for the week (a must!) and had no trouble with Police at all! Half an hour drive into Playa del Carmen, but well worth the drive. Great restaurants there as well. Took the ferry over to Cozumel, and did a snorkel tour. (don't bother booking snorkelling until you get there, easier to negotiate a better deal, probably as low as $20 per person). Yes there is construction, but it really wasn't bothersome. And all the people that complain about high-pressure timeshare sales, here's some advice...Just say no! We were asked once, and never bothered again. One added service probably often overlooked... a medical doctor on call right at the resort, 24hrs a day(that's another story!?)

We have been Gold Crown time-share owners for about 8 years and each one of us voted that this was our favorite vacation ever. We've been to Hawaii, Miami, Gulf Shores AL, Key West, Colorado, Panama City Beach FL, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas, and Cancun, and this was our favorite. The Mayan Palace is wonderful from the first moment you walk in until the moment you leave. The friendliest staff anywhere, they were polite, pleasant, and most courteous, from check-in to check-out. The bell boys, the shuttle drivers that will pick you up and take you anywhere anytime of day or night (by the end of the week I was joking that you could get a shuttle from your bed to the refrigerator if you requested one! I'm a very active person and it was embarrassing how little I walked!), to the wonderful service in the restaurants (reasonably priced and fabulous food), to the activities center people. The resort is fabulous, definitely Gold Crown. Beautiful buildings, lots of marble, beautiful grounds and excellently manicured. It is very conveniently located between Cancun and Playa Del Carmen (much closer to Playa Del Carmen), and we had a great time going to Playa Del Carmen, Cancun and Cozumel, all easily accessible. The first 3 days we went by bus and taxi, which is a little bit of a hassle but not bad if you're just not in a hurry. You have to go to the front gate of the resort and wait for a taxi or bus to come by, but it's very cheap; or you can get one from the hotel and they'll come right to your room to pick you up, but it's much more pricey, but you can go into Playa for as little as $2 per person in a taxi if you bargain right at the gate, or maybe $8-10 for a taxi that holds 4 people at most. We have 6 people so it was a little tougher for us. Just ask the concierge people, they are incredibly helpful and honest about prices of different things there at the resort vs on the street or in Playa Del Carmen, etc. The last 4 days we rented a van ($300 for 4 days) at Dollar Rent-A-Car - if you can, don't wait until you get to the resort to rent a car, it's much cheaper at the airport, or go on the internet before you go and find a good deal. They wanted $130/day in Playa for a minivan, which I rejected in favor of my $75/day deal at Dollar in Cancun near the airport. You can do even better if you reserve it ahead of time. And again, cars that hold up to 5 people are much cheaper. We've been to Cancun twice and didn't rent a car the last time because it's so easy to get around on the busses, but we really had a better time at Mayan Palace after we rented a minivan. Now on to the resort itself -- it was beautiful, with huge rooms, modern furniture, awesomely laid out, very pleasant, nice kitchen, but no dishwasher. Laundry room and ice machine are down the hall. You need tokens for the laundry, and I'm not sure where my wife got them. The showers are awesome. (By the way, the private pool on the balcony is just that, a small pool, not a hot tub. We never got in it, but it would feel good if you were a little sunburned, which can happen down there if you're not careful). The pool is something close to the biggest pool in the world, it's all chest-deep, great for kids, with the most interesting and beautiful lay-out ever - two or three circles like pedestals in the middle of the pool where the water is about 4-6 inches deep and you can all lay and talk to each other, fountains, one place even has what looks like lawn chairs built into a shallow part of the pool, built in a circle around a fountain that splashes up. The water is so warm! You can play water volleyball - just ask for a ball at the activities center which is right next to the pool. Many, many little palm-frond cabanas (palapas) to get out of the sun and relax in pool chairs. (There are people asleep in the shade EVERYWHERE!) Plus, they're building a huge exercise gym and spa now that should be done by the time we go back there next summer, Lord willing. I love to work out, and would have liked to have the gym there, but there was so much to do that I didn't miss it at all. Finally, to the beach. If you are just a little bit adventurous and not a fussy person (translation, not a whiner and a complainer) you will see that the beach right at the resort can be wonderful. I'm the biggest pansy in the world about going barefoot, but I was able to pick my way through sandy spots at the water's edge and walk out to where the water was sandy. It's the clearest, warmest water anywhere, just breathtaking. And if you bring a mask and just hold it to your face, you'll see all kinds of fish at the rocks right there - a ton of fun. And if you walk about 5 minutes to the left (facing the ocean) you can get to a gorgeous, deserted, all sandy beach. And about 5-10 minutes to the right gets you to a beautiful beach at another resort where you can jump in with a bunch of other people, but stay away if you don't want your kids to see topless girls - I saw about 10. By the way, last note, the snorkeling trip in Cozumel is worth the trip all the way. I'm not a strong swimmer and often don't enjoy snorkeling much. This was the most incredible snorkeling I've ever seen, and I don't want to ever snorkle again if it's not in Cozumel - I'm spoiled. Believe it or not, there's lots more to tell, but you'll have to go see it for yourself. By the way, we didn't do the timeshare presentation, so I can't comment on that, but I can say that when I told them at checkin that I wasn't interested in the timeshare presentation they didn't say a word, didn't argue, and I never heard another word from anyone on the property about timeshare for the rest of the week. That was nice! And the Mexican Fiesta show on Thursday night was awesome too!

This resort is so large that on some days we never saw any of the other people who had travelled there with us. Despite what others have said, you CAN swim in the water right there at the beach. Yes, there is a large coral reef that you need to navigate through, but, unless you think you are Tarzan, there is plenty of room to swim around and snorkel. The service and food, etc. is excellent. We were so impressed, that we upgraded to the new Grand Mayan ownership (fancier rooms and special benefits and discounts). I will definitely go there again.

We are owners so we split our week by taking the the kitchen/sitting room one week and the hotel room the next. Our only other visit to a Mayan Palace was for a week at Nuevo Vallarta in the fall of 2002 so were familiar with the resort. Like most of the other reviewers, I am convinced that most of the negative comments about the Mayan Palace are about the timeshare sales presentations. We learned our lesson in 2002 and we did not take them up on another presentation. We were asked when we checked-in. We declined and that was the end of it. \"There is no free Lunch!\" If being economical is high on your priority list, then the best place to buy things like groceries and souvenirs is in Playa del Carmen. Chedraui is a good place to get groceries, water and other drinks. For example, beer is 20 pesos a can in the resort store. A 6 pack of the same beer at Chedraui was 35 pesos. A litre bottle of tequila was 88 pesos and water was 4.5 pesos for 1.5 litres. At the MP and along 5th Ave in Playa, these will cost 2 to 3 times as much. Chedraui has extensive bakery, deli, meat, fish and vegetable sections. We took the bus in and took a taxi back (200 pesos with tip) Chedraui is 8 blocks along Juarez from the bus station on 5th Ave. and is across a parking lot from a MacDonalds at the corner of Juarez and hwy 307 (the main Cancun - Tulum road) If you plan to prepare food in the kitchen, you should know that there is nothing but dish soap. You should bring your own salt, pepper, sugar, seasonings, etc. This will save you from trying to figure out what is what in Spanish at the grocery store. We bought a bottle of gin on the way to Mexico. Tonic water is hard to find, but the MP store carries it at 13 pesos a can. The room service for meals is great. The food is prepared in the Tumtah kitchen and the prices are a few pesos cheaper. The best deal is the Mayan Palace breakfast at 230 pesos for two. It can only be had by room service. It includes memosa, fruit, smoked salmon omellette on asparagus, toast, pastires and coffee. The pool is great as everyone has mentioned. The beach is also great but the sea bed is indeed rocky. The MP has placed an artificial reef about 50 yards from shore for the width of the property. It is possible to get away from the shore and swim out to the reef. The water is only 5 to 7 feet deep. The advantage of swimming around the reef and rocks is that there are dozens of species of fish. You don't need to spend a day on a snorkeling trip to see the fish close up. If you want to swim in surf over a sandy bottom, there are beautiful beaches 10 to 15 minute walks either north or south. Both are virtually barren of people. The south beach is easier to get to. There is a bar near the Tramonto restaurant. The happy hour is from 6 to 7. We found it a great place. We would clean up after leaving the beach and head to the bar. It is air conditioned and has a competent bartender who has the time to make great drinks. When we were there, there were never more than three couples in the bar. The drink prices are the same. The cleaning staff were OK but the service was spotty at times: no clean glasses one day, no hand towels another. We survived. The staff overall was competent and friendly and helpful.

Read some of the reviews before I left and was a little nervous but my fears were alleviated once I arrived. I can see validity in all of the reviews both good and bad but it depends on your prospective. Check-in went smoothly. Take the tour if you like, they will offer you \"extras\" but plan on spending about 4 hours, not 90 minutes. Avoid the \"Tourist Advisors\" at the airport. Most of them work for these resorts and are just trying to get you to look at their properties. Keep in mind....they get paid real well to get you to go and it is NEVER 90 minutes. Keep in mind this is your vacation. Do you really want to take 4 hours (1/2 day) and give it to someone else? Think long and hard before you leave and stick with your decision. They are pushy. The Mayan Palace is under construction but it wasn't bothersome. The resort is very clean and the staff is very pleasant and friendly. The food was great. We especially enjoyed the Tramonto Italian Restaurant and the poolside service. The massage pool-side was one of the best I've had. We did take the bus to Playa and Cancun everyday just to save a little money but keep in mind that the working class Mexicans use it for their transportion and it was generally full of men who had been working in the hot sun all day if you ride in the evenings between 6pm-8pm. Not pleasant...but neither am I after working in the hot sun all day. This is just a tip to be considered. It is in no way meant to be offensive to anyone. 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen is wonderful for Mexican food, atmosphere and shopping. Xcaret is a must see especially the Mayan Show at night. The show is worth the entire admission price. Take a change of clothes and I think it would be nice to book it with the meal. Cozomel is great for snorkeling. Rent a car and see the island. Some places will rent you a VW by the hour. Taxi's are plentiful but can add up since the Mayan Palace is so far from Playa and Cancun. My sons seemed to like staying at the Mayan since it was between the two. One night they'd ride into Playa and the next into Cancun. We never wanted for anything the whole week. The staff was very accomodating. I, myself, would have been content to sleep late, stay out by the pool all day and order room service every night but then again I've been to Playa 3 times and have really seen all I care to see of the sights. I'll close with these tips: If you need shade by the pool, get out there by 7:00 or 7:30 in the morning, bring swim shoes to get in the ocean in front of resort (rocky), and never get in a hurry. If you've already booked at the Mayan Palace, relax, you'll have a wonderful time.

This is why we're going to Cancun to swim in the Carribean blue waters. But could not change our reservations. Other than a few things we were very pleased with the resort as a whole. It all depends on what you are looking for in your vacation. True the beach is unswimmable even if you wear water shoes to walk over the slippery rock & coral you can not ride the waves as there is just too much of it. They are contructing the new gym down by the beach but you are not bothered by the contruction as there is no big machinery they use. It's all manual labor. This resort is beautiful & huge. It was windy the first few days but the days they wind subsided it was very hot. We used 45 sunscreen all week & still burned. Be careful in the sun. This is the first time we bring the kids to Cancun. My husband & I have been here 4 times before but always stayed in the hotel zone. We're used to the craziness at the airport so just walk by them or say no & keep going, they don't bother you. We were able to check in early at 2pm which was great since I was concerned that check in is at 5pm here. We were asked about the time share tour & we declined. I only got one voice message asking once more if we wanted to take advantage of the 15% discount by taking the tour. We were not bothered again all week. Although we enjoyed our stay here we prefer the hotel zone. This resort is in a remote location. This is a great resort if you just want to hang out by the pool all day. The pool was huge & very warm. We were in the 2nd bldg from the lobby so our walk to the pool was a good 5min. We did not go back to the room much during the day. They have bathrooms by the pool. The kids enjoyed the waterfalls,swimming to each section of the pool. & the swim up bar.They do have activites but we found them lame. The kids did enjoy making their own pottery piece by the pool. Getting a shaded palapa is challenging. You have to go early. I've been told that the staff will remove your items if you're saving one & no one shows up for more than an hour. You can not swim at the beach at this resort. You are unable to even get into the water. But you can walk 15 min south to a beautiful swimmable beach. The walk is not bad, a little rocky but beautiful. We found the beach midweek & would walk there to go swimming for a couple of hours then hang out at the pool. Even though you are able to use the beach you are not allowed to use their facilty or chairs as it's for guests only. We ate lunch at the pool often & enjoyed it. The food was great at the pool & all the other restaurants as well. We did not have a bad meal there. They do have a beautiful Jack Nicklaus 18hole par3 golf course, but it's $240us! We like to get out & about easily so we rented a car & very thankful we did. Well,we were thankful after we exchanged a car that actually had brakes ! The conceirge & people at the front desk were extremely helpful in getting our car exchanged.We drove into Cancun about 4 times either for the day to swim in the ocean or dinner & shopping. There is just more to do in the hotel zone that you can walk to. If you go into town I can recommend Cambalache the Argentinian Steak house for an awesome steak, Lorenzillo's, or LaDolce Vita for italian. Party restaurants are Perico's, Senor Frogs,Carlos & Charlies. t's a 40 min ride north & very scary driving. From the resort to the beginning of the hotel zone is not lit at all. There are no guard rails,no lights indicating it's down to one lane or workers in the road. There is nothing in the immediate area of this resort. Playa Del Carmen is 20min south where you can take the ferry to Cozumel to snorkel at Chankanaab Park. You an swim with the dolphins here, snorkel,see the sea lion show etc. My daughters got kissed by the sea lions very cute. To go anywhere off the resort you must take a taxi or bus, which would get expensive if you were getting bored everyday. With a car you're not wasting time waiting for a taxi or bus or other people. You have to get a ride from the lobby to the front gate & wait for a taxi or bus. The walk to the front entrance is a long walk. We are an active family & don't mind the walking but if you do, you will find it tiring getting around the resort. It's a warm tropical walk so you can enjoy it you're on vacation what's the hurry?Our room was absolutely beautiful & clean with a seperate bedroom & bath. It had 2 balconies but too small for chairs & we were facing the parking lot. We did not spend much time in the room anyway. We did not have any problems with the safe either. They never touched anything. We found everyone working there very friendly & accomodating. We only went to one show the Mexican night show, we were late as the show & dinner had been on for an hour but they let us in for one payment of $15.00us to watch the rest of it. The whole dinner show was $42 a piece. You can exchange money at the lobby the going rate was 10.5 where the bank was 11. The convenience was worth it since you're not near anything. My 13 yr old enjoyed the cyber cafe so she could im her friends for $4us for 1/2 an hr. We never had bug bites. You can drive 20min south to Playa Del Carmen to a large market like a super Wal Mart it's called Charbals or something like that, it's not the Super San Francisco that's an older store. If you're buying milk it's in a box on the shelf not in the fridge.My daughter drank it & said it was good. The resort is very clean. The staff is extremely friendly.

The hotel is perfect if you are looking for a place where you really do not have to leave the prperty. They have great resturants, the most beautiful pools, activites, a large store with food, magazines, and gifts. Sure, there were the sales people trying to get you to hear their presentations, but really all you have to do is say no!!! Remember...nothing is free! Overall, I thought the Mayan Palace was a wonderful hotel and I will be returning next year.", "Date": "May 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "City, State", "Title": "\u201cSheer Extacy and indulgence\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2063702", "Content": "Hello everyone! Just got home Saturday from a WONDERFUL TRIP to the Riveria Maya. First I'd like to thank everyone for all the wonderful advice I received from this board prior to my trip that helped make it so great. Because I was desperately searching for info on this resort and the area while planning for my trip I'd like to return the favor so here goes: Car Rental: We reserved on-line before leaving with Executive for airport pickup of a Tracker for the 8 days we'd be there. Our flight arrived at 9:30am Saturday. We were picked up by an Executive representative after clearing customs/immigration and shuttled to the office. There was a small mix-up with the confirmation and all the Trackers were gone, which was fine because they just gave us a realy cute Jeep for the week instead at the same reserved price ($411 for 8 days with all the insurance/unlimited miles). We had no other problems with the rental car experience,& LOVED having the car the whole week, especially since the Mayan Palace is so far from everything. Mayan Palace: Ok yes the construction is NO WHERE NEAR completion but I must say that it didn't bother me at all. No we weren't surrounded by plush gardens and such but the staff were very pleasant and attentive. The room was nicely decorated with cheerful colors, etc. Check-in went smoothly. We promptly declined the time-share personnel's invitation for breakfast and were not bothered again about it. The maid somehow managed to be completely out of sight and yet clean the room each morning when we left and turned the bed down each night, leaving us the \"Mayan Times\" (activities newsletter for the next day) and two Hershey's kisses on our pillows. One night she even made us one of the cute towel sculptures like you get on a cruise ship. The only thing we ever had to ask for was small face towels for some reason she would forget to replace them even though she'd leave more than enough bath towels. They will give you the large 1.5L bottled water each day for around $1.00 a bottle. The pool is AMAZING! It's huge with two fountains (one with whirlpool jets surrounding it with shallow seats). It's actually three pools, connected by two wide waterfalls cascading into the next pool. At night it is so beautiful all lit up. There's two swim up bars in the pool both open from like 11am to 7 or 8pm I think (we only used it once). There's also two restaurants (one buffet style-Balche & one ala carte-Tum Tah.) The food was EXCELLENT! but not cheap. We had dinner once at Tum Tah and spent about $50 for an appetizer, dinner and sodas. The waiters were very nice and attentive and the chef came out to serve us our meal, which I'm unfortunately blanking on the name of the main course right now. We also had the breakfast buffet twice. It was $12.50 a person but well worth it. Countless cereals, juices, fruit, pastries, omelet made to order, waffles and pancakes made fresh, mexican dishes, meats, hashbrowns,etc. etc. The resort also currently offers car rentals (much more expensive than what we paid though, when we were loading our luggage to leave two guys who had just arrived said they were going to charge them $600 for 6 days rental from there). They have a shuttle service now available. It's about 15min. from Playa and 40min from Cancun. The shuttle is available to Cancun only on Mon, Wed, Thurs and costs $12.00 per person (a cab is about $35) The shuttle is available to Playa only on Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs and costs $8.00 per person/rt (a cab is about $18, bus $1). You have to reserve the service with the hotel concierge. There's also a Massage service available, but the gym, tennis courts,golf course, lagoon and water park are all still under construction. There's another really large restaurant under construction as well at the south end of the pool and the new lobby is also under constuction right behind the pool. So although the construction is going on all day I personally did not find it bothersome. There are plenty of palapa's around the pool and plenty of lounge chairs. The beach is very rocky, need sandals to walk on it. I saw a couple of people trying to snorkel off the beach. They will rent snorkle equipment, Kayaks and a little 2 person trimaran sailboat. I didn't see anyone using them but the prices were listed in the Mayan times and we didn't spend a whole lot of time around the pool (only two days) They have an activities staff that does stuff like water polo, water volleyball, beach volleyball, underwater swimming races, bingo (I won two free drinks), etc. So anyway that's all I can think of right now. I'd love to go back after it's all finished, it will be amazing. They have a HUGE amount of land they are developing. Alltournative Tours: Well after seeing all your posts. I went to their web site and couldn't decide between the two tours so I booked them both online (Pac Chen on Monday and Nohooch on Wednesday). We paid $152 for both of us each time and all I can say is WOW! They were both great experiences! If I had to choose I guess I preferred the Nohooch Jungle Crossing tour because the cavern snorkeling is an indescribable experience I'll never forget! They were well organized, fun, adventurous, safe, informative, everything I expected and more. Playa: What can I say, the best word I can think of for 5th avenue at night is \"enchanting\". All of the lights and music and smells combined to create the most romantic atmosphere imaginable. The first night we made the mistake of not strolling all the way down from Ave. Juarez to Ave Constituenes. We ate at Los Rancheros that night which is not even half of the way down so we didn't even know till the next night that it just keeps getting better and better as you walk down. It was amazing. Over the course of the week we ate at Los Rancheros, Karen's Pizza and Grill, the Panther,and Las Parillas. I only wish we could have gone to more of these great restaurants on 5th. Miscellaneous: We also went to Cozumel on Sunday (very quiet, no cruise ships in Port), Xel-ha on Thursday (loved it-did the all-inclusive plan), Cancun on the Saturday we arrived and on Friday night for dinner at Lorenzillo's Lobster House. So in conclusion if you've hung on this far to all my ranting and raving. I LOVED IT! I can't wait to go back although it'll probably be a while :o( I'll be happy to answer any questions.

The walk from the rooms to the pool/restaurants was quite a distance. (shuttle services were also available). We used the walk as a tool to work off some calories from the great restaurants. Although the restaurants were a bit pricey. (My 11 year old was charged $25.00US for the breakfast buffet), there was still an excellent selection. There were plenty of pool chairs, but more shade pallapas are required. The beach is not swimmable due to the coral reef, but the 8,000 sq. meter pool is an ocean in itself!

We stayed at the Grand Mayan which is at the Mayan Palace in the Riviera Maya area south of Cancun. We were there from April 25 - May 2. I was so apprehensive about staying here because of the negative reports, but I couldn't change the reservation because it was through RCI. Your reviews helped us prepare for everything, but please do not be afraid to stay here. It is a 5-star resort with the biggest, warmest pool I have ever seen. My mother loved it because she is very short. I think the maximum depth is 4ft. Some of the negative reviews have merit, maybe I was prepared for negative things, but it wasn't bad at all. It is still under construction, but that didn't bother us at all. We had a two-bedroom ultra modern unit with a living room, kitchen and dining area and 2 bathrooms. Our terrace also included a personal pool! We checked in at 2pm, and the smaller room was ready, so we were able to go to our room immediately even though check in is supposed to be at 5pm. At check in we were asked if we wanted to listen to a timeshare presentation, but we declined and no one ever called or bothered us about it again. 1) Distances: The distance from the lobby to my room was about 3 minutes. I was so surprised about that because of all the complaints here. The walk from our room to the pool was a little longer, but it really wasn't bad at all, and I was traveling with my 80-year old stepfather! We used the vans once in a while, especially from the front gate to our room. That is impossible to walk. 2) Prices: The breakfast buffet was $15pp. It was very good, and we weren't hungry until dinner time, so it was a good value. Chef makes omelets in front of you, and a chef on the other side makes French Toast, Pancakes, Quesadillas and waffles. There was a long line the first day for all these dishes, but it was better later on in the week. This is where the Timeshare Salespeople bring their customers. The Supervisor of the waiters (Abelardo) was so kind to my parents. He waited on them personally....carried their food from the buffet, brought them anything they wanted......and the tip is already added to your bill! Service was the best I have ever experienced. The convenience store was just a little more expensive, but I paid $1US more in Playa del Carmen for the same brand of Salsa Picante! Since that price was better than Playa, we shopped a little more in the convenience store. We ended up buying 2 sets of 6 Mexican liquers for souveniers for 154 pesos, at the convenience store which I thought was a good price. 3) Restaurants: The reviews all mentioned the Italian Restaurant \"Tramonto\" saying that it was fantastic. Well, we thought the food was horrible. It is more upscale with a nice view of the magnificent pool, but we were so disappointed with the food. My husband and I ordered ravioli. The waiter told us it was cheese ravioli. I don't know what was really inside the ravioli. I couldn't identify it. The waiter said it was spinach, but I know what spinach looks and tastes like, and shouldn't spinach be included in the description on the menu? My parents each had chicken parmigiana with a side of pasta. The chicken cutlet was deep fried and there was no sign of cheese on top. There was a black stringy lump on the plate also. We asked where the pasta was and the waiter pointed to the lump! He explained that it was cooked in the ink of squid! This was not included in the menu at all. It was so wierd.... people complained about things that we didn't think were bad, and they raved about the Tramonto restaurant which we hated! The Oriental buffet at the Balche Pool was not worth $20 US. No rice, no LoMein. Good stir fry, and sushi if you like that, but definitely not worth the money. The Tum Tah Restaurant was our favorite, and we ate there twice. The pizza was very good, and my parents enjoyed their chicken dishes. The ambience is beautiful and the service was wonderful. Happy Hour at Pool #1 was 11-12 and 4:30-5:30. At the Del Lago where the entertainment was is 8-9, and the fantastic show starts at 9pm. Everyone waited for Happy Hour. My husband saw the amount of liquor they put in the drink, so I know they were not watered down as other people stated. We ate lunch at the Balche Pool one day and we all loved our meals. I had the veggie sandwich which came with a large plate of fries, my husband had quesadillas, my parents had hamburger platters. The food was delicious, and the price was not expensive at all. 4) Beds: From reviews I have read about all the Cancun resorts, everyone is complaining about the hard beds. We felt that the beds were firm, but not too hard and I never had a problem falling asleep at all. 5) Marble floors: You had to walk past our door in order to get to the pool, and I never heard any noise whatsoever. No complaints about the floors. 6) Robbery: 3 people wrote that they were robbed from the Room Safe. I advised my family not to bring anything of value with them. My mother still left some US money in her drawer, and I am happy to report that it was never touched. Hotel employees are in and out of the room constantly to clean and to maintain the personal pool on the terrace, and nothing was taken. 7) Transportation: We opted not to rent a car. While we waited for the bus on the highway, taxis would stop and offer great prices into Playa del Carmen. One time we took a taxi for only 40 pesos which was the same as the bus fare into town! Take the Mayab line to the last stop which is the Playa del Carmen bus terminal. It leaves you off at the corner of Juarez and 5th Avenue which is right near shopping, the beach and the Cozumel ferry terminal. We even took a bus to Tulum. It only cost 31 pesos. The bus was air conditioned, the seats reclined and they even showed a video on the way! It makes stops at Xcaret and Xel-Ha first, so the entire ride takes about an hour from the bus terminal. If you are willing to do that you can save mucho dinero! Of course a car would be more convenient, but I think we saved a lot of money by taking public transportation. The Cancun airport is a madhouse. We used CancunValet for transportation to the Mayan Palace. It was very difficult to find them. You have people who are trying to grab your bags to use their service, so be very careful. The reason I didn't use the Mayan Palace transportation was because one person wrote that they never showed up, and another person wrote that they waited a half=hour for another hotel guest's plane to arrive. With Cancun Valet, the van is your private van. It costs $55 and there were 4 of us, so it was a little less expensive, but we didn't have to wait for anyone else. We took the Mayan Palace transportation to return to Cancun Airport because they leave every hour. 8) Bugs: Spraying was done every afternoon. Out of the 4 of us, only my husband got bitten up. He is extremely susceptible to bites, even at home. He would watch the fantastic show every night. At the end of the show, the audience is invited on stage to do line dances and that is when he would leave because he was getting bitten up. If you are prone to bites, please bring spray with you. 9) Drinking Water: No one really mentioned this, but FYI....you can drink the tap water; it is purified. My husband drank the water with his medication every night with no problems whatsoever. They do provide you with bottled water but it costs 12 pesos, which is a very good price. A 20-ounce bottle of water in NY is $1.50, and this was a 1.5 liter of water, so it was worth it. Housekeeping gives you a sample packet of coffee, so you can have coffee in the morning using water from the faucet. NO WORRIES! 10) Activities: We had so much fun with the staff. There are Aquarobics, Bingo, Dart tournament, bracelet and necklace making, morning Yoga and Salsa lessons. We had so much fun with the Salsa lessons. We got the basic steps, but the advanced moves had us baffled. Joanna, a dancer from the show, tried to help us out, but we were too hysterical. The shows at night were spectacular. The Mexican fiesta night was good too. Unlimited bar, mariachi band, dancers, etc. They especially catered to the children too. The cost was $42 US.11) Beach: It's true, you can't swim on our beach. We walked about 10 minutes south (which wasn't too easy. There was a lot of garbage that washed up on shore, but I don't think the Mayan Palace owns that land, so it's not their fault). We came upon a nice beach, but we past signs that said \"No Trespassing\". Now I know that the beaches in Mexico are public so I wasn't worried until 4 Labrador Retrievers came running over to us and barking. We were a little concerned, but they allowed me to pet them. They ran in their house, so I was relieved, but then they returned and ran straight over to me. The biggest black dog opened his mouth and placed a well-chewed tennis ball at my feet! They just wanted to play! My husband played ball with the dogs while I tried to snorkle. The dogs are very sweet, so if you are walking on the beach, don't be afraid if they approach you. 12) Pool Shade: These reports are true also. One of our final days, my husband went to the pool at 7:15am and got the last palapa with the mattress. The poor guy sat there until we showed up at 9:00. People start to leave the pool around 2pm, so you might be able to find shade about that time.I think I wrote absolutely everything I can think of, but if you have any questions, you can email me.", "Date": "May 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1898855", "Content": "I just returned from a relaxing week at the Mayan Palace in Riviera Maya.

It was pretty much everything I expected. I read dozens of these reviews. One thing I did notice was that normally when anyone had negative comments, it was almost always associated with the timeshare presentation. We were sure to stay away from that. We were asked once at check-in...and never heard about it again. My wife and I had a 2 bed, 2 bath...which was amazing. One reason we stayed at the Grand Mayan was because it was not all inclusive. Most other places in the area charge like $90 or more per person per day for food. So, we figured if we spent $20 per person on a meal a few times, we're still saving lots of money. We had the breakfast buffet which was pretty good. We had a BBQ which was good. We actually wish they had more buffets. Plus, right now they are not having lobster night, which we missed :( But, since we had a kitchenette, we went to Chedraui in Playa del Carmen and bought groceries...which saved us lots of $$ Here's the areas that could use improving: beach could be better--which they were working on at night while we were there : the TV only had a few lousy channels with movies mainly from the 80s... only good station was CNN. : Other than that, that's the only thing negative I can think of. The maid staff is VERY nice...a couple dollars of tips will get you a long ways. I asked a bellboy what these people make. He said around $5/$6 per day--ouch. The rooms were kept immaculate. Yes, the walk between the rooms and pool/beach/restaurants is probably about 3 or 4 minutes. So, if you're lazy, go to a little tiny joint instead. The construction was no problem whatsoever because it was off in the distance at the 3rd grand mayan building which was not near us at all. We saw tulum and chitzen itza.. tulum is OK.. but you must check out chitzen itza. We had a car and would HIGHLY recommend it. For a week at avis it was only around $200. If you don't have a car, you will either be stuck there--or you will have to take shuttles and taxis all the time..which will cost you the same as having a car. Here's something I didn't really know: if you go to chitzen itza, there are two roads. one is the 180 and one is the 180D. The 180d is a toll road, which it doesn't say till you're way down the road at the toll both. The cost each way will cost you $25. So, if you go the long way it will probably take another hour, but you're able to drive through villages and see more culture. One more thing about food. If you order room service it is actually less expensive than going to restaurants. The last day we had a breakfast that was eggs w/ smoked salmon served on asparagus with goat cheese & gouda. You get served mimosas or juices, pastries, toast, fruit. It was $26 total...less than the breakfast buffet.

It was so inconvienent at night to go into playa forget Cancun who wants to drive 35 minutes for a meal on vacation? The amenities now are very limited and I am furious with RCI for awarding a gold crown rating at this point. There was no place on site to buy tennis balls let alone rent/use equipment as most other resorts have- no tennis pro either on call. NO SWIMMABLe beach whatsoever and i agree that it will never be a good beach. Yes you can walk 15 minutes in the heat to an area but that even feels dangerous when you are swimming. There is no supervised kids club for the under 12 group. my son was really looking for a room like the other resorts we have visited with age appropriate activities although they do allow all ages to participate in the regular stuff. The buildings are architecturally ugly and you feel like you are in a conference center when dining in the glass building. On the positve side, the food was excellent and the drinks as well. Again, the babysitters they arrannge get 15 US dollars an hour which is crazy even by NY standards.

It is true that there are no ocean views from any of the rooms, but the pool, one of the largest in Latin America, is truly spectacular and sits right at the edge of the beach. We had a master suite with an additional bedroom (lockout), which I would recommend since this arrangement offers an efficiency kitchen and plenty of room. All of the floors throughout the resort are marble or some type of stone, which gives the rooms an elegant feel. We found the rooms as well as the resort grounds to be absolutely pristine - it is obvious that cleanliness and service is very important to management. There are numerous daily activities and nightly entertainment offered at the resort, and the resort restaurants are very good, especially their upscale Italian restaurant. We were offered a timeshare tour only once, and were not approached again. As I mentioned previously, service is stressed at the Mayan. Their concierge desk was extremely helpful arranging transportation into the nearby cities of Cancun and Playa del Carman, making restaurant recommendations and reservations, answering questions, etc. There is also an in-house travel agency which will schedule tours to a number of outstanding attractions. Although the in-house agency is slightly higher than those selling tours outside of the resort, the peace of mind was well worth the extra money. We talked to one guest who had purchased a tour from an agent outside of the resort, which turned out to be a scam. The tours we booked were conducted on upscale buses with very professional, knowledgeable tour guides. Our tips: 1) If you ride the bus from Cancun, make sure you take the \"Maya\" since it makes a scheduled stop at the Mayan Palace - the other buses do not stop between Cancun and Playa del Carmen. If you take a bus from the resort to Playa, make sure it is a \"Riviera\" bus so that you will be dropped off on 5th Avenue, the major tourist area in Playa. 2) Be prepared to spend a lot of money at the resort restaurants and the resort grocery store - if you drive or ride a bus into Playa, there are several grocery stores with better prices, but it is a 20 - 30 minute drive each way. 3) Have plenty of $1 US dollars with you - you'll need them for tipping! 4) If you want a poolside cabana for the day, there's no charge, but you'll miss out if you don't claim one by 7:00 or 7:30 most mornings. 5) If you want to stay in touch with friends and family, they offer a nice Cyber Cafe in the same building as their boutique and grocery store.

Go to Chedraui in Playa del Carmen when you arrive to stock up on food, snacks, sunscreen, whatever. We liked Xel-ha marine/nature park (really just a great patch of jungle), Tulum Mayan ruins(yes the kids liked it) and Xcaret (like Xel-ha but more complicated) as well as the aquarium at Las Islas shopping mall (the staff were so nice). This is the subtropics, balmy and exotic, and the parks show off the place to perfection. Personally I can't see the fascination with swimming with dolphins but if its your thing well theres lots of opportunities. We took a trip into Cancun itself, don't bother.

We had a Master Suite (2 double beds) they were a bit hard, but the rooms we're kept clean throughout the day. The chocolate kisses placed on the bed each nite was a real treat. The food was very good - a little pricey, but not any different than nice restaurants at home. Drinks were a little bit high, but there were 4 happy hours each day that you could take advantage of. As far as timeshare sales people -- they asked us when we arrived, we said no and were not bothered again during the entire week. We chose not to take part in any of the activities, but there was always something going on for those that wanted to keep active. The beach will be beautiful when it's done and so will the rest of the resort -- it's only two years old -- what can you expect? The reason the buildings are not parallel with the sea is because of the hurricanes that hit this area. We were fortunate we were in the first building and had a short distance to the pools and we could look out towards the sea from our balcony. Getting to and from Playa de Carmen was easy, we took the shuttle out to the road and then waited for the bus \"Mayab\" - it cost 9 pesos (90 cents) each way. Sometimes we took the van called \"Collectivo\" they're more expensive than the bus, but less than a taxi cab. Fifth Avenue in Playa de Carmen was fun to walk around in the evening - although part of the street was torn up because of sewer pipes being installed. There are plenty of restaurants, bars and shops on Fifth Avenue. We ate at Karen's (has great pizza); Big Lobster (Filet Mignon was great) and LaPerella (good Mexican food). Looking forward to returning to MP-Cancun in a year or two from now. We've also been to MP in Acapulco and Nuevo Vallarta -- they're both great too.

The cabs at the hotel lobby will charge 175 pesos ($17 US) to take you their. A cheaper way is to get a shuttle to the front gate of the resort. Then cross the expressway and wave down a taxi.

I first succumbed to the Mayan Palace timeshare routine in 2001, followed by my parents in 2003. We had previously only stayed at the Mayan Palace in Nuevo Vallarta. The spectacular beauty of the property and the attentive service at the resort is what persuaded us to invest in the first place. As airfares to Puerto Vallerta were sky high this year, we decided to give Cancun a try. Some of the criticisms leveled at the Mayan Palace - Cancun are also true of Nuevo. The walk to the beach can be long, depending on the location of your room. I look upon that as a benefit--it helps to wear off the cervaza. (Travel tip - head into Chadraui in Playa del Carmen when you first arrive. Cerveza is 42 pesos for a 6 pack, compared to 100 pesos at the on-site shop or 39 pesos for 1 around the pool.) The timeshare sales force appears also to be the same. Around the pool, the sales office was referred to as \"the killing fields\" or the \"shark tank\". We would watch the \"pitchers\" waltzing their prey around the beautiful pool. From what I gathered, the \"kill\" rate was high, as many also invested. (Another travel tip - should you decided that this investment is not for you, you can contact the American or Canadian consulate in Cancun. They will refer you to the Profecta--I believe that is the name of the Mexican Better Business Bureau and they will help you draw up a cancellation letter. This despite admonitions by the sales staff that this is not possible.) The resort is still under construction. I could see progress being made daily. The beach is mainly useable for snorkeling at the moment. However, they are still planting the \"reef balls\" that will turn this into a very nice beach in the not too distant future. The palapas with the beds were amazing! I wish they had more of these. I have never seen so many sunrises as I did during my 2 weeks there. When the weather is nice - intermittent in February, you need to be at the pool by 6am in order to secure one of these. It is worth the effort. I had read a review at this site dated June 22, 2003 advising not to dive with the Yucatek divers, who were the onsite diving operation at this time. I would like to report, that for the past several months, a new dive operation has taken over. The scuba diving and snorkeling at the Mayan Palace Water Sports Center is now being operated by Rafael Redondo and his lovely wife Tzetzangari. As a Dive Master, with over 17 years of scuba travel experience, I was delighted to discover one of the best dive operations I ever had the pleasure to dive with. While the weather did not cooperate during my first week, I was fortunate enough to be able to accomplish 5 dives during the second. I had checked out the prices of diving at the Travel agencies in the Lobby. What initially seemed to be an attractive price became less so, when the tax and the cost of transportation was figured in. Additionally, it would require an entire day in order to get in 2 dives. There is a lovely reef just a 10 minute boat ride offshore of the Mayan Palace. I was able to leave my palapa between the pool and the beach, hop into the waiting boat and enjoy a terrific dive within 15 minutes. I have never enjoyed such personalized and attentive dive service. On a spectacular drift dive, there was just Rafael and myself, with Miguel - the boat captain and his assistant following us above. It was a lovely 45' maximum depth wall, drift dive with more fish than I saw during a week of diving last year in St. Maarten. From other divers around the pool, I discovered that the ones that took the day dive trips to Cozumel mainly saw boat loads of other divers rather than fish. I would also highly recommend the cavern diving at Chac Mool. Being a Canadian diver and somewhat claustrophobic, I was initially not convinced that this was something that I wanted to experience. I had left cold, dark, fresh water diving in a full wet suit behind me in Canada. However, when the weather wasn't cooperating for more reef diving, I decided to give it a try. I am glad that I did, as they were the most amazing and magical dives of my vast and varied dive career. I have never met a calmer and relaxed diver as Rafael. His experienced and professional manner calmed my fears of diving in a somewhat confined environment. The water is so amazingly clear, you feel like you are floating through air and not scuba diving. Seeing the sunlight stream down through the cavern entrance to the floor 30' below, reflecting the sky and jungle above is a view that I will cherish forever. The fact the Rafael arranges these dives early in the morning, ensures that you have the caverns to yourselves, before the hordes of divers from Aquaworld arrive. It also allows you the entire afternoon to lounge around the pool, rather than commuting to and from another dive operation. Like many in the \"Vidafel family\" - the Mayan Palace's corporation, we actually enjoy our timeshare. I just wish that we had bought a resale, as opposed to buying onsite. You'll get a much better deal. Next year we may go back to the Mayan Palace at Nuevo (our favorite) or maybe try the Mayan at Acapulco. Initially, I said I wouldn't go back to the Mayan at Cancun, but the onsite diving and \"my palapa\" might entice me back for another visit.", "Date": "March 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGrand Mayan / Mayan Palace - Terrific!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1714518", "Content": "We just returned from a trip to the Grand Mayan in the Riviera Maya and it was fabulous.

You can opt out of the presentation all together, but they will give you incentives to go (15% off hotel expenses). The presentation takes longer than they say it will, but you get a nice tour of the place and the offer is hard to pass up. If you do plan to buy, hold out until the end.

We were not given any choice. That evening they had taken 22 rooms away from unsuspecting guests with confirmed reservations. They acted as though this was routine, and we were even told, if they get ?better opportunities? or ?a group coming in?, that ?it is just business? and they will do what they need to do. They said we should ?be satisfied with what we got?, and besides, ?airlines do it all the time?. Our guests slept on the very uncomfy couch beds. They sag, etc? and one of them had back pain the rest of the time, which spoiled her trip.There were no bugs: but, you better like chemical fogs. At least daily they fumigate the entire property. There is no notice, no opportunity to close your windows, or cover your food or drinks.

They need to be in your unit ?only one day?, from 9-5pm. You will receive a notice the night before, and if you see it, you can call and set the day to your convenience.

First, let me tell anyone that is going and not into a long timeshare presentation just tell them that you are not interested. If anyone has attended a time share before, this one looks to be about the same, high pressure and a pain. The rooms are very spacious and pretty. All the hallways floors, etc are marble, but that is because of heat, humidity , and bugs. (we are in the building industry) The people who work there are very attentive and do a great job of keeping the rooms and the resort clean. The pool is unbelievable!! It is huge and warm . We did not see alot of bugs, but I wouldn't have been surprised if we did because you are in a jungle type area. The food and drinkls were average prices and quality qwas good. The beach is not that great, but we did walk aboout 5 minutes away to a sand beach. All in all, the rsort is great and we have traveled many places.

We never took the bus as a shuttle or cab would stop and give us a great rate to take us into town. Enjoyed the town of Playa real well also. I really dont know why everyone is so critical of the Mayan. WE thought the food was great , nice portions, rooms were clean and nice size and walk to pool wasnt bad and the pool is great. One of the best ive seen. It also has a foutain in the first level that shoots down hot water all the time heating up the other levels. The beach wasnt worked on while we were there could walk the beach some rocks in front but then ive not seen many beaches in Mexico that are great except for Cancun's hotel zone. They do have the best happy hours all day long and prices are great. 34 pecos for a beer (2 for 1) and also for the cocktails like a Pina coloda (2 for 1)64 pecos so that is like 6.00 for the 2 pina coladoas. there are like 4 happy hours. 11-12 1-2 4-5 8-9 we enjoyed these. We were asked for the timesahre presentation when we arrived and we just said no thanks and wasnt bothered again on it. Those that do the timeshare ususally know or have heard what that envolves and know that it is a hard sell , we also have done them, but no more once is enough. So going into the 15% off a bill not worth the time to put towards it would be 150 on a 1000. Not worth my time. They also have entertainment nightly for u to attend if you want and it is free. Entertainment was good. Only complaint was the prime rib speical night ( we thought speical as in cheaper) but was way over priced and wouldnt advise this unless you want to pay the 75 for 2 way overpriced in my book and no drinks.

The resort is still under construction but has all of the amenities of most five star resorts. We rented a car for the two weeks as we had planned to do a fair amount of sight seeing. The tours, busses and taxies can run into a sizable amount of cash if you plan on going out a lot. I would suggest that one has to go to Playa del Carmen at least once and walk 5th Ave. This was the only place, other than the Airport, that we had the land sharks try to get us to take in a presentation at the Mayan Palace. This brings up something else, when you arrive at the airport don't listen to the people trying to give you \"INFORMATIONS\" they only want to suck you into going to some presentation and will tell you anything to get you to listen to their pitch including telling you that it is the law and you must go there first. The pool at the Palace is incredible. No matter how many people there are at the resort there is always plenty of room at the pool. If you are a golfer they have an extremely challenging par three course. Don't make the mistake of under estimating the dificulty of it. The price may seem a little steep but take into consideration that if you play on Sat, Sun or monday you get to play wednesday for free. We were asked when we checked in if we wanted to take the owners up date presentation for a 15% discount on food and drinks, we declined and never heard any more about it. There is no doubt in my mind that if you go on the tour it is going to take up the major portion of your day. There are over 100 sales people there vieing for their share of the take and they don't want to let you go without getting something from you. If your there for a vacation, just say no. If you want to buy a timeshare then research what you want first on the internet, talk with people that own timeshares and get all the info you can before you buy. The sales people know their business well and are honeing their skills every day. They sell one out of every four presentations and I can assure you the three that get away are usually those that have been through it before or they just don't qualify financially to make the purchase.

We stayed at the Mayan Palace in August of 2003 (not exactly the best time to go to Cancun, very hot then), but we were aware of the fact that it was still under construction and that didn't bother us at all. We were a little surprised at the location of the hotel (kind of out by itself), but in a way we kind of liked that in the long run, because we didn't have to deal with the throngs of people that are in the Cancun hotel strip either. We had been to Cancun about 5 years ago and stayed on that strip of hotels, and we did have a good time then, but I thoroughly liked the quietness of this area much better. If you want to go to a good beach area, I would suggest that you take the bus, only $1.00 per person, into Playa de Carmen and spend the day at the beach there. You can also buy all of your souvenirs there in any of the many stores to chose from. You can also take a ferry into Cozumel for the day for only $5.00 a person from Playa de Carmen. The bus station is located right in the middle of town and is easy enough to find for the trip back to the hotel. We found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant at all times. In fact, when we first arrived after our long flight there, it was very hot, and we were greeted with a very nice glass of cold orange juice while we were checking in. Which I found to be most helpful! The restaurants on site were all good and the prices were extremely good. We usually buy our own food at our time share condos, but this time since our frig was rather small, we decided to eat out more. The breakfast buffet is to die for!! All you can eat for about $8.00, and well worth it. The fruit was absolutely beautiful and tasty, and the fresh juices were fantastic. Get any type of eggs fixed for you right there by their chef, the choice is yours! Also many, many other side dishes to add to your breakfast. Hubby and I went on a couple of excursions while we were there, and had a marvelous time. Unfortunately, hubby got sick on our third night there, due to eating some shrimp at an outdoor restaurant at one of the excursion areas, and was mostly room bound after that. I decided to order our meals to our room for the remainder of the time we were there, and the restaurant was fast with the meals, delivered them directly to our room, and they were delicious too. All all that we ate while we were there for the week, our meals only cost us about $170.00 for the entire week. Not bad considering. The pool was absolutely beautiful. The biggest one that I have ever seen at any resort. It is 4 ft. deep through out the entire pool, and in August if you didn't get to the pool early in the morning, the water became warm by 1:00PM. So go early and then take a nice siesta at noon! The pool area, in August, was never crowded at all, and they have the most fabulous covered beds, pillows and mattresses with sheets on them, right by the pool area to lounge under. It was great! Being that the area was till under construction, they still had a lot to offer in the way of entertainment. Nightly entertainment was free, and very good. Plenty of activities for children and adults to participate in. Yes, the beach area had some work still to be done on it, but it was still nice to just sit on. As far as the bugs went, we didn't encounter any, and we saw that they sprayed the area daily for that type of problem. The rooms were clean and spacious, but I found that the bed was a little hard for my liking. Did let them know about that upon checking out. They will let you know about your flight times and if they are on time upon check out. They also prefer that you use their currancy instead of US dollars, but you can still use US dollars if need be. There is a small grocery shop on the property if you need to fix lunches or breakfasts in your own room. We did go to the sales pitch (and I have been to many of them in the past), and I just let them know that they have no more than 90 minutes to show us everything they have to offer. Our sale person was right on the money where the time was concerned, and we really liked what we saw, so we did invest in a time share there with the Grand Mayan time shares. They are very nice and brand new! We look forward to going back to either Cancun, or one of their many other time shares that they have, in the near future. I would highly recommend to anyone thinking about getting away to a tropical area, for a week or more, and having a nice relaxing vacation, to check this place out.

The Mayan is a beautiful resort it is huge so there is walking involved but this also makes it feel very uncrowded. I can't believe how lazy some people are. The pools are terrific, two different swim up bars with 2 for 1's twice daily at each. The beach is rocky but you can walk 5 minutes south to a nice sandy beach in you want to swim in the Gulf. The restaurants have great food (especially the wood oven pizzas at the Balche). The only downside to the resort is that it is quite a way from anything. We rented a car and had a great time, the roads are very easy to drive in this area. Drove to Tulum, Xel-ha and Playa del Carmen with no problems. The grocery store at the hotel is a \"convenience\" store so prices are set accordingly, no different then the states. There is a huge supermarket in Playa del Carmen though that has EVERYTHING from liquor to food to hardware and the prices are cheap! Playa is about a 10 minute drive south from the Mayan, not bad at all. I have not tried the golf course yet, as it was being built yet.

There are great hurdles however with no ocean view rooms and very very long walks to anywhere. The presentation is hell and long. However, we succombed to the pressure and did buy a week at what I later found out was an exhorbatant amount. But this was not even the great problem. While out all day for a trip to Chitzen-Itza, our room was entered several times and the safe was broken into. We lost alot of money and several other items that were very worthy of SAFEkeeping. We discovered the loss the following morning as we came in late and were exhausted after our trip. We went to the safe Friday morning only to find it wide open and the valuable contents missing. We called security immediately. They arrived with machines to check the safe. There were discrepencies and the machine was able to see that the safe was opened and closed, and also able to open the safe without our code. But, the machine was not set up properly and could not give the times of entry. The door to the room was opened several times according to however the hotel can read entries. They told us maintenance went into the room unauthorized. We gave our report. I went to cancel the contract after I saw and heard several things that were very disturbing. The sales manager told me that we were suspected of filing a false report by the management. We were besides ourselves. During my attempt to cancel, I was made to suffer through tactics including refusal to cancel, threats of prosecution for a false claim and further reprisal if I reported it to the police and they thought I was turning in a ficticious report. Finally after threatening to expose this all on the internet, I was given my refund. It was outright nasty. I asked that I be given an apology before my departure. I never got one. When I first called the sales office to express my dismay at what occured, I was told that they were insured and we could be helped. Later I was given other news. The reason we were accused of filing a false claim is because the hotel would have no responsibility to a claiment that was considered a fraud. I requested that a fax be sent to me explaining any results or attempts to investigate. We were staying another week in Cancun and called Mayan Palace everyday to inquire about the situation. At one point, the manager demanded that I go to the Mexican police station and file another report. He told me that he would have the police pick us up at our hotel. I decline saying that I was exhausted and would not go to a police station where I could not speak the language. I told them that the police could come and speak to us in the lobby of the hotel where we were now staying. After being accused of a fraudulant report, there was no way we would ride off with police to a station somewhere in Mexico. I also stated that it was their responsibility to make the report for the safety of their guests. We demanded a fax 2 days before we left. We called back with another request. No report ever arrived. So unless we receive some satisfaction with the Mayan Palace I will continue to report our story. In the end, all we expected to get was assistance and a feeling of closure, being that they would follow up and let us know that they cared about the security of their establishment. And let me state this, aside from the management, the high pressure sales staff were rude, nasty and inappropriate! Avoid this place at all costs. In conclusion, the sales office evidently fleeces unknowing and inexperienced buyers to give up thousands of dollars to their organization, while the hotel and it's staff allows their guests to be fleeced of their valuables. We are going to find out the proper authorities to report these tactics to. If anyone would like to join us after any negative experience at the Mayan, please write in at this location.

Although the resort is in the middle of nowhere, it was very nice. The Grand Mayan offered two very large bedrooms, each with private bathrooms (also very large) and the middle room had the kitchen (small but adequate) and a living room. We had a patio that was large with 2 lounge chairs and 2 chairs. There was also a cooling pool on the patio which we did not use. (A jacuzzi would have been better!) The pool area is fantastic - 3 levels of connected pools with each level being HUGE. There is never a problem getting a chaise lounge. The beach area was ok - if you're facing the ocean, you can walk down the beach to your right about 10 minutes - you'll see a pier where it is very sandy and you can swim there. We did not have any problems with bugs and we were out every night. There was a constant breeze off the ocean, so that may have helped. The food at the resort was very good, everyone says pricey, but there were 5 of us and we ate breakfast there twice, lunch 3 times and dinner 4 times and our bill was around $1,000. I didn't think that was too bad. They did offer us a 15% discount on our bill if we took the tour, but from prior reports, I knew this wouldn't be a good thing. I wasn't interested in buying another time share as I already own three. We met a couple who did take the tour and she said they held them captice for 6 hours! They just wouldn't take no for an answer - they went through 4 salesmen. It reaffirmed how happy I was I said No. One more note on the food, don't get the prime rib at Tramonte - it was chewy and the flavor wasn't very good. Stick with the italian dishes - they were very good. They do take a credit card on arrival, and charge you $400.00, because it's like being on a cruise - you just sign for your bills. And the tip is included, so there really is no need to give additional tip money, there isn't even a place on the bill to write it in. The only place they let us pay cash was in the store, but you could sign for that as well, if you wanted to. They have an internet cafe in the store area. We did take a cab or collectivo into Playa twice, which is alot of fun.

If it was'nt for Playa Del Carmen and Cazamel the trip would have sucked. I hope some day the Mayan Palace builds a resort on the island of Cazamel. What a great place. We rented scooters to go bar hoping around the island from a booth soon as you get of the boat. Shop around because the dicker. We paid $20 US for the whole day a piece. Well worth it. And if you dont want to wear the helmet, really you dont have to. Have it on when you leave and return, no problems. Great shoping on the island as well as Playa Del Carmen. As far as the resort at the Mayan Palace goes. We were there in Feb. 02 while some exstensive construction was happening. The resort was comming along very well but what a hell of a walk to the room. Them late nights when we had a little to much to drink, they would give us a ride in the golf cart to the room. And they do give rides to the hiway to catch the bus, which I recomend because the cab ride to Cancun will kill ya. About $35 US. The Mayan Palace is located between Cancun and Playa Del Carmen. So perty much in the middle of no where. No stores close by, just the store on grounds. The rooms are great, we had a 2 bedroom suite. Perfect for 4 people. Beds are great. They even brought me a really nice fan(stainless steel that about blew me away) because I cant sleep with out one, for the whole week. Tip the ladies that clean the room, about $4 a day for 4 people. They do a great job. Maid service is twice a day. Once in the morning and again at nite to pull down the bed and hide the top comforter, which is usually behind the curtain. The pool is fantastic. The beach was a little rocky. Great house down the beach to party at. Over all a very nice place, and that was unfinished. Hope to see what its like someday finished. We are owners and some day will return. But next time I will for sure rent a car. 4 people spent $400 in transportation between buses and cabs for one week.

By the time I got to the lobby, she already phoned to see if I was there. She showed up with my husband. Said I had to sign something. I refused. She then walked with my husband to our room. Again she said I had to sign some paper. I asked her to give it to me. She said it was at the sales center and I had to go there. I refused, told her to bring it. She got my husband to go with her to get it. Two hours later, I called the front desk to locate my husband. An hour later I called them again and told them I was going to call the police if he wasn't back in the room within the next 15 minutes. He returned just before dark, completely brainwashed.

The prices for those was a bit outrageous at the resort. We were asked at check-in about touring the resort and attending the timeshare presentation and a polite no thank you was readily accepted-we were not asked again the rest of the week.

The down sides to the resort were, if you didn't like golfing or swimming, there really wasn't anything else to do there. The beach was quite frankly awful. The beach at Playa, or better yet, Akumal is fantastic. Parking was quite a hike from the buildings-got kind of old lugging snorkeling gear that far. The main downside for us was location.

The Mayan Palace (MP) is still under construction and when it's completed it will be fantastic. We are owners by having been suckered into buying back in 1999 on a trip to Puerto Vallarta. I still have negative feelings about the whole sales pitch that the salespeople pull and had I known then what I know now there is no way I'd have ever bought into their program. That said, and having spent a lot of money in 1999, now we feel compelled to use our timeshare just to get some use out of the money spent. So we went to Cancun this month to check out the newest MP resort, and were overall pleased with the resort and the Cancun/Riviera Maya/Playa del Carmen area. It's true about there being a lot of walking from the rooms to the beach area; it took us 10 minutes to walk from our room to Del Lago, one of the three restaurants on site, and we're an active couple in our 30's. It's true about the beach being rocky, but it's interspersed with sandy areas so while it's not a beach you'd want to play in the surf, it's fine for walking on the edge of the water, and oh what nice water it is. The pool was quite large and nice, no deep ends here. The service was fantastic, the staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was very good to excellent, the breakfast buffet was super (omelettes to order, pancakes/waffles made fresh to order) with wonderful tropical fruit and juices and various Mexican dishes that were yummy - it cost $15/pp. Lunches at the snack bar were about $10-12/pp; although the nachos ($7) were huge and delicious and my husband and I split one order and were satisfied. Dinners were $12-$25/pp. So it's not cheap eats, but given that you're in a really nice resort I find the prices are suited to the surroundings. It takes 15-20 minutes to get from MP to Playa del Carmen, and more like 35-40 minutes to get to Cancun, so if you want to do activities in those areas either figure on the extra travel time and cost associated, or stay closer in. Activity tours can pick up at the lobby or sometimes out by the front gate which is about 3/4 mile away but that wasn't a problem as there was a van that would take us up to the front gate whenever we wanted. I definitely want to return to the area, and will return to MP if we still have the timeshare because for the annual maintenance fee we pay and get 7 nights in a top notch resort...you can't beat that. (Note: Except that when you add in the front end money and divide that by the number of times we've used it - well, then it gets to be ridiculously expensive on a per use basis. Anyone interested in staying at a MP should either rent through a private/third party or buy ownership on the resale market where you can pay much much less for the same thing that the suckers[read: us] buy from the developer.

This is going to be a spectacular place when it is done. We had a wonderful time. There is construction going on, but it doesn't interfere with activities. The HUGE pool is in, as well as 3 restaurants, swim-up bars, golf course, gift shop and grocery store. 9 timeshare buildings are open with another 9 under construction. We were apprehensive about the trip after reading some of the negative reviews. It is true that the resort is spread out and quite far from the nearest town. If you like a lot of night life, then Mayan Palace probably isn't the place for you. We enjoy lounging by the pool and walking the beach. The food is wonderful, good presentation, and moderately priced. ($11-$17 for a dinner.) As for a the timeshare presenation. It includes a wonderful buffet breakfast and a 15% discount on all food and drinks for the week. If you do not want to spend 3+ hours and have someone try to sell you a timeshare, it's simple - DON't SIGN UP. You can't expect the discount and the breakfast without a sales pitch. The only negative is that the beach is rocky. You can walk about 15 minutes down the beach to a place where you can swim.

We are RCI Members and this resort it one of their \"top resorts\". Upon arrival at the resort we were greeted by a very friendly staff. The very first thing they wish to do is get a credit card and charge 4,000 pesos (approx 400 U.S.) as a \"deposit\". Luckily I had a debit card to an account I no longer use with me. We were then given our room key. We had to walk a very long distance to the room. The room was very large and spacious. It had a large kitchen/living room along with a large bedroom and bathroom. The pool is gorgeous and is heated, no matter what time you go to it, it is comfortable. However, please do not make any phone calls from this resort. We used the phone for 2 minutes and they tried to charge us over $60.00.(U.S. Dollars) Also there is still construction going on. They are building the water park and more rooms at this location so their is a constant rumbling noise-Even into the night! The beach is absolutely horrible. If you want a beach, then do not go here. I was told there was a wonderful beach that was 5 minutes away by walking-Wrong. Upon arrival, my husband and I ate at one of the restaurants by the pool. I had a veggie sandwich and he had a hamburger w/fries and 2 Pina Coladas-over $40 U.S. Dollars. Also, please do not rent a car at this resort we were charged $64 per day. However, we had to get out of here and find another beach to visit and buy some groceries. This resort would like to keep you there behind their big gates so you can spend every dime there. If we choose to return to Mexico, we will be staying in Playa Del Carmen, it is reasonable and gorgeous. This resort is pretty, but there is constant noise and it is way over priced and very buggy. The bugs are horrible. Also, if you choose to leave ther resort on a tour from another service (outside the resort) then you have to wait outside of the gates in the hot sun and wait to be picked up this is about a mile away from the actual lobby. This is because the resort will not allow outside tour groups on their property. I think that this speaks volumes about their thought for their guests. If you want to have your pocket picked for every peso, then this is the place for you.l I am sure that when construction is complete, it will be a gorgeous resort.

This was a gift given to us for our honeymoon from an uncle who owns a timeshare. We were there from Friday to Friday. Arrival was great....entering the hotel , everything looked so refreshing, beautiful and peaceful. Our room was a small one bedroom apartment, dining room, bathroom, living room and bedroom. 2 balconies located off of the living room and bedroom. We were on the 3rd floor, if we were not we would not have been able to see the Sea. The Sea however was quite far from our room. All of the room were quite a distance from the gorgeous pool and rocky, unfinished white sand beach. The pool area was amazing. The pictures at www.mayanpalace.com do not lie. There are 2 swim up bars that my husband and I spent most of our time at. Happy Hours at different times - 2 for 1 drinks. Although everytime we would sign a bill it was $30.00 or more dollars for just a few drinks. The activities staff are very friendly, we met a few very nice employees that kept us laughing the whole time. However they are quite pushy and want you involved in everything they do..water aerobics,volleyball, bike tours, getting on stage at the shows each night...The shows...When you have seen the 1st one you might as well not go to the rest...they are somewhat all the same...same costumes, same dance moves.. The sales staff, however, the ones that suck you in to buying a time share are Very snooty...we werent bothered, thanks to the request of the uncles wishes...But if they walked passed you, they would not give you the time of day.

We just returned from a 7 day trip Oct 4-11 at the Mayan Palace. We are actual timeshare owners of this property. We were a little skeptical about all the past reviews. Please realize that all timeshare tours are lengthy, and very pushy whether you're in Mexico, Florida or somewhere else. You are there for a reason--probably just to get tickets free to something. Anyways, the hotel was wonderful. The service was unbelievable. I felt totally relaxed. The food was fantastic, but very expensive. The grocery store on site also has a few pricey items. We were given a hotel newspaper to advise of the daily events planned, as well as the weather & restaurant events. The rooms were very clean, and neat. We actually only owned the master room, which is the most basic of the rooms. No refridgerator in these rooms, fyi. The internet & computer access was great. The pool was fantastic. Swimming in the middle of the night was great, too. No, the beach isn't completed, but the pool made up for it. We were never crowded at at the pool. We also bought an upgrade to a 1 bedroom, because we were so happy here. My husband and I are not world travelers, and both totally agree that our investment in the Mayan Palace was well worth our money. We seemed to be treated a little extra special because we were owners, and we both were proud to be owners. Overall, this was a wonderful resort. Yes, it is a bit further from Cancun, but closer to a lot of the Mayan ruins, & places like Xcaret & Xel-Ha.

The comments of the traveler from Kentucky are very, very accurate. This is a great resort for some, but not so great for others. One thing we did learn from reading reviews on tripadvisor.com was to stay away from the timeshare presentation and we were glad we did. Endless confirmations of 4-6+ hours were normal. It was not worth the 15% off your charge tab they promise (for us would have been $75 is all). It allowed us to relax and not have that ruin our trip. This would be a wonderful place to stay if all you wanted to do was relax, sit by the wonderful pool and read, and be pampered by wonderful service (Jose and William at the pool bars were fantastic as was most of the staff), and enjoy fantastic food (it really was unbelievable and I cook a lot). But if you are looking 1) to do a lot of exploring throughout the region; 2) experience some good night life; 3) have a beach to relax by and swim in; or 4) stay in a resort that is really beach oriented then this is not the resort for you. Our initial room was 8 buildings away from the pool and easily a 5+ minute walk to the pool and probably 8 to the ocean. We upgraded to Building 6 but it only cut a minute or so off our trip. The rooms are pleasant but basically nothing more than hotel rooms with a living area in between including living room with TV, dining table, and kitchenette (small fridge, 2 burner cooktop, sink and microwave). My biggest complaint about the entire stay was simply the location. It is really out of the way. We easily spent $200 or more for transportation. We were in Playa Del Carmen quite a bit and made our way to Cancun and both couples agreed we would return and stay at Playa Del Carmen in a heart beat. Cancun is just a blend between Miami and Vegas. Playa is a charming little city that is very clean, has truly amazing beaches and what looked like a nice variety of hotels/resorts. We also heard that the restaurants are world class. It's also home to the ferry to Cozumel which we did twice and I highly encourage ($14 round trip pp and takes 35 minutes) and has a brand new downtown bus terminal with cheap transportation to Cancun or other destinations. Last, but certainly not least, take your bug spray. All Mayan Palace resorts seem to like to have ponds and lakes. In this climate, that means the nastiest mosquito's we've ever seen in our lives.
