Despite the luxuriousness and formality of the Hotel, the staff were very friendly and extremely thoughtful; all very approachable. We had not informed the hotel we were traveling with twin babies; yet by the end of the first day, we had a cot and baby hamper, filled with baby bathing products and diapers, delivered to the room. To say that i was moved by these gestures, would be an understatement. A bottle warmer was also provided, again, without our asking for same. All staff were extremely polite and very helpful whenever we needed assistance with anything. Not that i required this, but every night upon our arrival back to the hotel, our bed was turned down, and even the baby cot was tidied. It was adorable. The rooms were a lovely large size, particularly useful for the four of us, as we were traveling with quite a bit of luggage. The surrounds both within, and surrounding the hotel, were quiet. I had no problems getting to sleep. The hotel's location is in a quiet area, approximately 15 minutes from The Rocks area, and about 20 minutes from the centre of town (by foot). The bedroom was clean, spacious with a luxe period decor. The bed was a large king size, and pillows comfy. No problems were experienced with the tv. A dvd selection is available from the concierge. We didn't have water views, but we didn't mind as we were out most of the time. The bathroom had a double basin, and a very big bath. I'm 6 feet tall, and even i could fit comfortably in it! The bathroom was always cleaned very well, with Peter Morrissey toiletries provided. The single shower had two shower heads, one above and one on the side - you can take your pick which one you want to use. Room service was quick and professional. The room service menu had an extensive selection of food to choose from. On one occasion my fiance wanted to order takeaway dinner from a local restaurant. Leaving money with the concierge, my fiance not only received his takeaway without incident, but the concierge was kind enough to arrange for plates and cutlery to be sent to the room (again without our asking). It's been such thoughtful service that endeared the hotel to us. We have stayed at many 5 start hotels, but no other has shown us the same attentiveness as the Observatory. The only down-side was leaving, and the withdrawal effects suffered as a result! (gush gush). Overall, our experience at The Observatory Hotel was wonderful, and i hope to be able to stay there again in the future. The staff were all class, kind and professional in every way.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fantastic weekend away.\u201d", "Author": "Kerryful", "ReviewID": "UR128316933", "Content": "My partner and I stayed over the weekend and enjoyed the gourmet package which was very well worth it.

Old world charm with a very comfortable bed and a lovely dressing table. The bedroom itself was very spacious with a dressing table and a comfortable set of chairs whilst the living room had a lovely couch for two people and a round dining table. It was very spacious and just the epitome of comfort. The hotel service was fantastic - check in and check out was a breeze and the housekeeping staff were very nice too. We utilised valet parking when we were there and they made it so easy for us. I love going to the Globe Bar as well for a drink and the sofas are just so plush and soft. It's beautiful hotel with lovely little touches and an amazing art collection. You really feel like you're in a boutique establishment and the flowers are just heavenly. I also love all the extra touches like the pretty vases dotted everywhere. My only complaint would be that one of the concierges was a bit rude and distant and not what I'd expect of a 5 star hotel. The only why I ranked service as 4 star is because of that concierge - I really do think that a great concierge can make or break a trip. Cracking a smile every now and again also helps but obviously it was beyond this gentlemen's nature.

There's a couple of small restaurants & cafes at the end of the street that are more populated with locals than tourists. However you are only a 15 minute walk from Circular Quay through the Rocks. The hotel itself is well decorated without being flash. The rooms are huge with a bathroom the size of some hotel bedrooms. A door shut off the bathroom and wardrobe area from the bedroom which meant we got no noise from the corridor even when we had a room close to the elevators. Beds were very comfortable. We arrived, after a transpacific flight, mid-morning and while we couldn't get into our room had access to the beautiful pool area & spa so could relax down there, swim, shower and change clothes. The shower area isn't huge but the pool area is wonderfully soothing with it's star-studded ceiling. There was only one computer in the business center, internet was an additional charge and there was no wi-fi in the lobby but that unfortunately seems to be an Australian standard.

We walked from the Circular Quay cruise terminal with our suitcases to the hotel. It was a short walk (less than 10 minutes), but unfortunately it was an extremely humid morning in Sydney (I come from Brisbane and I had not experienced humidity like this in a long time). We both stopped about 50 metres from the hotels entrance because I was sweating profusely. While we had stopped so I could wipe off the perspiration, the doorman noticed us. He came down and greeted us with his trolley and insisted that he take our luggage. We were both so grateful for his help. Regretfully I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get his name, because I would love to have commended him to hotel management. We arrived at the hotel quite early. From memory it was about 10am. To my surprise, the room was available and we were able to go straight to the room. Given my state I was also extremely grateful for this. The luggage arrived shortly after we got into our room. When I opened the room door and entered I was astonished at the size of the room. It was huge! It was a Deluxe King City View room. However, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really get a view of the City. What we got was a view of the houses (which appeared to be housing commission) across the road. The bathroom was also huge. It had dual basins and separate bath and shower. However, my wife thought the room (but not the bathroom which was modern) was very old fashioned and out dated. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the wallpaper and some of the furnishings appealing. The bed was comfortable and we both slept well. However, early one morning (a Saturday or Sunday) we were awoken by loud noise outside on the road. I thought that people were arguing and fighting after a night on the town. When I opened the curtains I saw a long trail of cyclists going past (hundreds of them). They were talking extremely loudly so that they could hear one another. Of course this is no fault of the hotel. But do be aware if you have a room overlooking Kent Street you maybe woken early by inconsiderate cyclists on the weekend. The other impressive feature of this hotel is the swimming pool area. The indoor swimming pool is massive for a hotel; especially a CBD hotel. I estimate that the pool is 25 metres long. There was also a good sized spa along with a sauna and steam room in the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change rooms. The change rooms themselves were 5 star. Also the pool area and change rooms were very clean. Another nice touch to the pool area was the ceiling, which was beautifully decorated. It resembled the night sky, full of stars, which was obviously in keeping with the hotels observatory theme. The hotel also had a gym near the pool area. The gym looked quite good, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to use it. The location of the hotel may not appeal to everyone. It is quite close to The Rocks and Circular Quay, but a bit of hike into the centre of the CBD. Also the immediate neighbourhood seems to comprise of housing commission properties. When you are walking back from The Rocks (via Argyle Street) to the Hotel at night it does feel a bit unsafe. Buffet breakfast was included in our package. We both love our buffet breakfasts and unfortunately this buffet breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to our standard. The variety of food was too limited. However, I will say that the fresh fruit that was offered was very sweet and of the highest quality. If you have to pay for this buffet breakfast I believe it is $36 per person. For what is offered, $36 is a rip off. In summary the rooms are huge, clean and the beds are very comfortable. I should also add that housekeeping is of a very high standard here.

Having breakfast at Galileo and its atmosphere.. is starting the day with all the possible glamour , the maitre is there to welcome you and Mauricio, one of the waiters remembers exactly what you want to have! The concierge service is remarkably outstanding, Michael Anderson and his team,we have to mention Ryan here, they are professional, kind and help you with everything you might need. We stayed for 10 nights in a very beautiful, spacious and comfortable suite with ocean view. There is no view to the opera house or the bridge but they are both at walking distance. The hotel is in The Rocks, a historic neighborhood not far from anywhere, 20 minutes by taxi to Bondi Beach, 10 to the Fish Market (great lunch experience), Darling Harbour (Sea Aquarium) , David Jones Mall (very good shopping there!) or Taronga Zoo where you can arrange coala encounters for your kids..and yourself! The pool is just lovely! It is the place to relax. Now, things to improve, and this one seriously: The spa needs to change to policies, it is not acceptable that in a stay of 10 days we could not be able to book a spa treatment. They said they were booked already every day! it seems it is open to non guests... I think they should save at least some free shifts so guests are able to book a treatment that lasts longer than 30 minutes... we were disappointed about that and when calling the spa we were told they were completely booked for 9 days in advance... (we couldn t make it). Spa is part of the service to be offered to guests and if you need to book 15 days in advance or the spa is understaffed or overbooked the hotel should let you know about this in advance. Also, wi fi!!! They need to fix that. There is no wi fi in the rooms. And Galileo Restaurant, I loved the atmosphere, the cipriani style lamps, the dim light, everything is perfect but two things: 1) The Samsung TV ruins that lovely corner table. 2) There is a universal trend to put on display empty bottles or great wines. Actually, this is closer to being considered trash than decoration details. It s disappointing as you get closer to the bottles as we did to the read the labels to notice someone has already had them and they are still there.. we don t get it.

It has an excellent position up behind the Rocks area so is easy walking distance to Circular Key, but is also in a very quiet street. The room was very large and beautifully furnished in a homely style, with a large bathroom including a huge bath and separate shower. Some rooms look onto the inner harbour, but we had a less expensive (but for us still very expensive) room looking across to a tennis court. Very pleasant. There was a balcony and we opened the french windows and ate breakfast next to them. We usually stay in much cheaper hotels so the price of breakfast in the dining room was a bit of a shock, but room service prices were reasonable and you could just order one thing, making it much more economical. There is a small cafe a short stroll north of the hotel which you could try, but the room was so nice we just enjoyed spending a little time there. We also bought some excellent samosas from an Indian restaurant there and took them back to the room. There is a lovely bar area where you can have nice food reasonably priced for dinner. The service was impeccable throughout the hotel. I'm not a fan of 5 star hotels when I travel as I find them too clinical and their service often has a forced, fake feel (not to mention I usually travel on a budget). Not this place, which manages to feel like a small and homely hotel even while it has every luxury. Mrs Rasselas recommends the relaxation massage in the spa. There is a swimming pool.

There was water in the kettle for us to make a hot chocolate drink or Valerian tea. Just so very thoughtful. In the morning, we realised there was a balcony which we could sit out and get some fresh air. Also I thought the room was very spacious compared to a lot of hotels in sydney. I also used the gym and the pool which was amazing. Alas I didn't had time to try the spa which I definitely will oneday. The other good point about this hotel is how close it is to the Sydney Observatory. We did a night tour there which was a highlight of our trip. Also we walked to the rocks which was so lovely. The hotel is very convenient to get to darling harbour and king st wharf too. Overall, I was incredibly happy with the trip and the hotel.

When we arrived the foyer looked beautiful but then when walking up to the desk i saw bits of the 'old world charm' were actually just a bit old. The woman at the desk then informed us that because we'd booked online there wasn't a king sized bed so we'd either have to have a twin room or pay $75 dollars extra for a king bed. She added that it was because we'd booked through another agent - as if that was a little bit lower than booking through the hotel. Coupled with the extra fee for parking it was the greatest start to the weekend but I was looking forward to the room. Suspiciously it looked like the any of the king rooms advertised, however older. I like antique decor but our room really felt like it needed a good refurb. Draws were broken, wood was chipped, the bed was saggy and the blanket across it seemed very old and worn. The bathroom was nice though with a great bath. We had breakfast and it was adequate. While the buffet isn't extensive and the meals not much better than a cafe down the road the setting is lovely as were the waiters - but you do expect that from what is meant to be a five star hotel. Sadly I won't be back nor will I recommend this hotel to anyone. Character is one thing but great character needs upkeep and needs to be passed on the staff.

Unlike some other premium hotels, the over sized shower head made showering a relaxing experience. The staff were outstanding even greeting us by name each time we left the hotel. At check- in I was wished a happy birthday. This was something my husband had made only a brief reference to when he was booking the room. Clearly though, it had been noted. Personal attention such as this was a feature of our stay. The bar area was a pleasant place to sit and watch the passing parade outside. The high tea is well worth trying, even if you are not a guest of the hotel. The indoor pool area is magical to look at with lots of downlights that look like stars in the sky. The breakfast was a little disappointing with a buffet continental section and a la carte hot food. At $45 a head I would have expected a wider selection and the buckwheat pancake is not something I'd try again. Strangely, the bircher muesli was served in tiny shot glasses. Location wise the hotel is an easy walk to the Rocks area and Circular Quay. It is also not too far to walk to the King St Wharf area where there are several good restaurants.

These little things are what are missing from many of the larger chain hotels. The only two things I would comment on at this hotel are small gripes. When reading over the room service menu I was appauled to see a small asterisk at the bottom that read \"All room service items will incur a $5 delivery charge\". While I know that all hotels charge a premium for room service I thought it was ridiculous to have a price for room service food and then an extra charge to have it delivered to your room! That is what room service is and the food prices were obviously already charging a premium. This I found disappointing. As well as this, we were disappointed to be told that at breakfast we would have to pay extra if we wanted espresso coffee rather than a filtered cup. For such a high class hotel with a lovely personalised restaurant breakfast it is sad that this small thing is not included as I am sure most people would appreciate it.

The staff at the hotel were always friendly, courteous and helpful, without the toffee nosed attitude that one can get at some high class hotels! WE really felt like individuals and welcome guests, rather than just a \"room number\"! Only a few negative point - I would say that on the third floor, the water pressure is not great, so the huge opulent bath takes a long time to fill, and I didn't even attempt a shower! However, the facilities at the pool were great - lovely showers, and my hair loved the provided shampoo and conditioner! If you are using the pool though, there is no spinner to dry your swimming costume, and unfortunately our heated towel rail didn't work, so we had to fly home with wet things in our bag. I would suggest perhaps the hotel could invest in a costume spin dryer? Until then, check your heated towel rail, and give them time to fix it - we realised too late in the evening. The other real surprise was that the coffee provided in the hotel room was INSTANT! As a kiwi, I haven't even SEEN instant coffee in over a year! I drank tea! The minibar as to be expected for a luxury hotel was very expensive, but there is a shop nearby where water, chocolate etc can be purchased for much less. There is also an excellent local fish restaurant Fish on the rocks very nearby. The hotel dinner menu is really far to fussy/fancy. as agreed with other guests! However the hotel breakfast is lovely! I suggest trying the continental buffet, as even my cooked breakfast addict partner found that was plenty for him, and we only had the cooked breakfast once ( delicious but not needed!) Overall, I would like to thank the staff at the observatory for a lovely stay, and for making two kiwis so welcome. When we found the bustle of the city way to much, you were a perfect refuge for us, and we really enjoyed our stay.

I've found that picking the right or wrong hotel can colour my experience of a city. I was blown away by The Observatory Hotel from the moment I was greeted in reception. The hotel is elegant and beautiful. It smells subtly like a day spa the moment you step into the huge reception - you immediately feel calm and incredibly relaxed in this oasis. I arrived at 9am and the lady at reception welcomed me and took my mobile number and said she would call me when my room was ready. In the meantime, I was invited to read the newspapers (The Australian, Sydney Morning Herald and The Financial Review) in the beautiful formal Drawing Room, or to go sightseeing. One other thing - we booked two nights on a special deal through wotif. In other words, we didn't pay \"full price\". Not at any time were we made to feel any less or different to a full paying guest. That was really great. The very helpful Concierge, Michael, gave me directions to the best shopping districts in the city and off I went. The location is great. It is an easy stroll to the CBD, or to the Rocks, which leads to Circular Quay. Reception telephoned me at 11am to say it was ready. The service is fantastic. They call you by name at all times (Mrs So and So, Mr So and So) - wish you a good day, welcome you back, open doors for you, call your taxi for you. Carry your bags to your room... Old fashioned, sincere and friendly service. And for no tips at all. We stayed in a Deluxe Room on level one. There is a small foyer that opens to your room, and your bathroom opens off that. While I was there, they changed the old fashioned \"keys\" to an electronic card that you wave in front of the sensor on your door. I didn't mind either. The welcome fruit plate was a nectarine, apple and a peach. Lovely. And nicely presented. The bathroom is beautiful with a deep tub (incredibly relaxing to soak in) and a separate shower which was also a rainshower. It was a pleasure to use that rainshower. The shampoo, conditioner and bath products smelt so nice, I took the extras home with me. I had a terrific Frangipani & Pomegranate wrap in the Day Spa (my therapist was Emma) that was relaxing and the wrap smelt amazing. I fully recommend it. The only downside was that it was too short (30mins). I booked a week ahead (wanted a massage initially but they couldn't facilitate this - I also overheard other people being turned away so I recommend you book your spa treatments as soon as you book your room). I'm not a steam room person but I liked the ones here. I found the complimentary cold lemon/lime water or hot ginger, lemongrass and berry tea to be a nice touch. We experienced some noise problems (like a subwoofery rumbling noise) that bothered us from 11pm to 2am at night. When I mentioned this to reception the next morning, they immediately arranged for us to move to another room on level 2 which they assured us would be a quiet room. They apologised profusely and arranged for a porter to help me move all bags. He didn't let me lift a finger even though some of my bags were heavy. When I mentioned this to him, he said, \"if it's heavy, you certainly won't be carrying it, I will.\" Great service. The next room was perfect and we didn't experience any other problems. The comfort of the hotel was such that it was hard to leave to go sightseeing. And it was always such a pleasure to come back to the hotel. We didn't try Gailleo Restaurant but would like to next time. There is free internet and printing in the business center next to the reception desk. Before I booked here, I also considered the Westin or the Shangri-La but now I think I wouldn't stay anywhere in Sydney other than the Observatory Hotel.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding\u201d", "Author": "philosopherstone", "ReviewID": "UR99593519", "Content": "Faultless hotel.

Public areas quiet and beautifully-maintained. Reception perhaps not quite up to the Concierge standard but good enough. My one bugbear is one that most people will dismiss as a trifle - but it's REALLY important to me and, despite everything, probably means I won't stay here again.

Room was very good size and beautifully decorated. Lovely bathroom - great pressure in shower and good size bath. Very attentive service. There was a lovely artificial fire at end of public lounge but it was not on. It was a freezing night and it would have added so much atmosphere. We would even be happy to pay the $25 each for a cocktail to sit by this fire on the lovely cosy couches. Instead we went down the road to the Lord Nelson Hotel and sat in front of their huge roaring open fireplace and had great meal and drinks for a few hours for an inexpensive price. Not so good No turndown service for us. No \"strawberry platter\" on arrival (which was part of the package). I felt very embarrassed phoning to ask if we were meant to get the strawberry platter. The man I spoke to said he would check and ring back. Nobody phoned back but a knock on the door about half an hour later and there it was. A bit disappointing it was the size of a bread and butter plate with 6 strawberries (not even covered with plastic wrap). Good but not what I was expecting when it stated \"strawberry platter\" (not strawberry plate). No complimentary newspaper which was also part of the package. I think there should have been complimentary drinking water but there wasn't. Stains on carpet in entry passageway. Globe Bar and Galileo Restaurant very lovely rooms but very expensive. Breakfast very expensive for what you get. Have paid a lot less elsewhere and had such lovely food and good choices. Overall I really wanted this to be all I expected as we are in Sydney about 4 nights each month and am searching for \"the\" place to keep staying at instead of changing hotels all the time. It does have a lot of good points and I might stay there one more time to make up my mind.

One big improvement which I urge the Observatory to make is to consider their internet pricing. $10 an hour or $20 for 24 hours is ridiculous. I was on a 3 week trip (half business) and needed internet all the time. This was the only hotel NOT to provide free internet. Wireless internet is not a luxury and if 3 star hotels can offer it for free it makes no sense to be charging $50 for 3 days. When I got it I was expecting it to be lightning fast but it was only average and I ended up using free wifi at a nearby cafe. Another thing, our tv didn't have ABC. Since tv is incredibly poor in Australia and ABC is about the best of a bad lot I reported it to reception on the first day. It seemed to get forgotten and so I reported it again on the Friday only to get a letter through the door a while later to say it couldn't be fixed until the Monday.

Everything is beautiful marble. The amenities are labeled Serenity and live up to the brand. The towels are soft, fluffy and huge. The dressing area has everything you could possibly need; bathrobes, an iron, plenty of hangers, lots of space for clothes/shoes, a loaner tote bag and umbrella and a safe. The king sized bed has a high quality mattress and very high thread count sheets. The bed was made with only two pillows. I like more pillows and asked for extras. The pillows were swiftly delivered. The room service staff gladly delivered buckets of ice every time I called, which was daily! Turn down service is special. Your slippers are laid out.

It was Easter weekend and I knew it would be tricky to find some help if it came to that. So, I checked with Simon, the Concierge. He could not have been more helpful and really made us feel better. I was feeling pretty scared, as my husband was quite sick and we were far, far from home. Simon checked around for an open urgent care office and also had the restaurant Chef prepare a remedy of bland chicken soup and dry toast. The tray was promptly delivered by another caring staff member. There is a little convenience store just down the street. I walked there and bought Gatorade, which was recommended to keep him from being dehydrated. All of this worked and he was fine by the very next day.

So, we walked over to Wynyard Station, which is a little bit more challenging of a walk with luggage than the relatively flat walk to Circular Quay.

After a walk around the Rocks while our ropoms were being prepared, we returned to ajoinin rooms with water views slightly more expensive than those we had booked. On these occasions you'd expect the staff to make reference to th fact they had 'upgraded' our room. Not so here, just an understated pleasant surprise as if this type of service is th norm, an indeed as it transpired it was. The Gym, sauna, steam room were clean, odourless very well appointed, but the pool is outstanding. At no stage did we feel our two energetic boys were less than welcome. In fact their father tripped on a half fastened sandle walking down the stairs and in doing so liberally distributing the contents of a large cinema box of popcorn across the entire width of the entry atrium. Needless to say I was embarrassed but immediately put at ease and shuffled on my way as if it was their pleasure to clean up my mess. The rooms are likewise welcoming, tasteful and spaceous, without being kitch. The location is great. A walk over Observaory Hill to the centre of the rocks.

Having stated that, it is worthy to note what the expected return is on your investment. The Observatory Hotel is listed at the best hotel in Sydney. You won't find it towering 30 floors above the central touristic areas, though. It is unassumingly located on the West end of the city, closest to The Rocks, but near Darling Harbor -- well within walking distance to some must-see areas. It stands only three floors off of ground level. It has a nice view of the harbor, and has a very cozy, home-like feel within the guest suites. Most of all, the guest services are impeccable. I had a few unexpected needs arise, in addition to the usual touristy questions. The staff came through incredibly. From the front desk to the restaurant, everyone was only too eager and substantially qualified to make our stay thoroughly enjoyable. Most notable was the concierge staff. I spoke regularly with Michael, Simon & David; each of whom was extraordinary in his effort to assist me with needs regarding luggage, dinner advice (& bookings), as well as other information needed for our journey. I'm certain that each member of the entire concierge staff is equally good at such assistance; but these three men were always present whenever I called or visited their desk. They handled my dinner reservations while I was away during the daytime. They made recommendations. When I inquired about restaurant cuisines, they located, reserved, and printed updated menus for me...then booked a taxi to take me there, without my even having ask. I mentioned seafood. The next thing I know, I had reservations at Pier (Sydney's #1 seafood restaurant) for 9 pm, with a cab to take me there at 8:45 pm! This is merely one example. I'm not sure that there's anything more that they could have done to improve our stay.

There were huge towels in abundance and bathrobes provided, even a choice of shower heads! The most pleasant surprise came from the staff who were unfailingly pleasant, courteous and always aware of the needs of their guests. The service was oustanding. Whilst much of Sydney is easily accessible from the hotel, and especially the Rocks area, the immediate surrounds of the hotel are somewhat rundown. I do have one gripe which is more to do with the current fashion in cuisine and which is exemplified by the hotel restaurant. This style of cuisine is obsessed with presentation and is often encountered as a relatively small pile of food in the centre of a huge plate with a price to match the plate's size. On our first night my wife and I dined at the hotel restaurant and had one or two surprises. I ordered a seafood platter which when it arrived was indeed on a huge plate and consisted of an oyster, a prawn, a dab of salmon, a 2cm rectangle of fish pate and 3 miniscule slices of fish on a piece of tomato. Even the waiter remarked the I might like some dessert to make up for the platter. And, oh yes, it cost cost $36. We did manage to find a bottle of wine for $52. Needless to say, on subsequent nights we ate elsewhere at some excellent restaurants which are within two hundred metres of the hotel, serve excellent food and charge a reasonable price for what you get. On the flip side, we ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant every day but avoided the expensive buffet and opted for what we wanted which was bircher muesli, porridge and coffee which was ample and a very reasonable $22 all up. Would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely, one of the best we've ever stayed in. The hotel staff are the best. Would I have dinner in the restaurant?

Therefore, we had to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dig\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd our pillows out of the bedspread and do it ourselves. We pulled back the bedspread and saw that the mattress pad was a good 30 centimeters short on both sides and the bottom sheet was just hanging out of the mattress on one side of the bed. Additionally, there was no order card for breakfast to hang on the door. The next morning I awoke and opened the door to get the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complimentary daily newspaper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mentioned in our reservation. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there. My husband and I then went out sightseeing. When we returned our room was making an intermittent tapping sound that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop. We called the front desk and they promptly sent maintenance. The gentlemen heard the tapping and we left him to fix it. Upon returning to our room for the evening, the sound had been fixed, but the message light was flashing on the phone. The message on the phone was that there was a message downstairs for us. I went downstairs to get the message. As it turned out, the message was simply to tell us that the tapping had been fixed. I found that absurd. If that had been the phone message, I would have been able to avoid the inconvenience of going down to the lobby. By this time, I had had enough. I asked the receptionist why we were being treated this way. She was very apologetic but by this time it was too late. I told her there was no turndown service on our first night. Her explanation was that housekeeping didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the room was occupied. Was that supposed to make me feel better? I told her about the newspaper, or lack thereof. Her explanation was that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell her I wanted a paper. I told her about the reduction in room size. Her explanation was that the balcony counted for the lost space from the other room. I have never heard such logic. Can I put my luggage on the balcony? I think not! I wanted and needed a bigger room. This was our last hotel stay on an around the world trip celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. We had a lot of luggage and wound up tripping over it. In addition, the lack of vanity space in the bathroom proved to be a major inconvenience. After my complaining, we did receive a fruit plate and were comped for parking and the minibar charge. But in our minds, that did not make up for our profound disappointment. It was supposed to be a special weekend and it was not. I wrote a letter to the regional manager and got no response. Then I emailed through Orient-Express website and got no response from them either.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset, England", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Observatory\u201d", "Author": "scotty0910", "ReviewID": "UR27095607", "Content": "We stayed at the Observatory for 4 nights at the beginning of March with our 4 year old and I had been slightly concerned it may be a little stuffy to take our child too.

As such, we booked a water-view Junior Suite. Although our overall experience was wonderful, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure the hotel is living up to its 5 stars. Check-in: We live in Sydney, so drove up to the hotel and had it valet parked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the service was great, they took our details and escorted us to the front desk. Check-in was great and the staff very friendly. We were escorted to our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though we were staying only one night, we still had a couple of bags with us and had to carry them to the rooms ourselves! No one offered to take them for us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I thought taking bags to the room was fairly standard for 5 star hotels? I guess not in this one. In-room dining / service: We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eaten since breakfast as it was a busy day getting ready for the birthday, so I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to order and eat something asap. I called and ordered and was told it would take 25-30 min for the food. I called about 20 min after it was meant to arrive, turned out that whoever took our order had forgotten all about it. The person actually called us back and personally apologised, letting us know the meals would be complementary. I appreciated that touch as it would be very embarrassing to admit to a mistake and having to personally apologise for it. I thought the in-room dining menu and quality of food was good. We had also arranged for some finger foods (sandwiches) to be delivered to the room as we were having a small gathering for a group of friends before going out. We tried to arrange this in advance and were surprised how limited our choices were and how unaccommodating / inflexible the hotel was with our ideas. It was either a canap\u00c3\u00a9 selection for $30 a head or mixed sandwiches for $8, with nothing in between and no flexibility to arrange mixed food platters. We wanted a selection of small desserts as well, but the hotel would only do them as individual portions, which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never encountered this anywhere else that the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to think outside the square to accommodate their guests. In any case, all went smoothly and we had a great time in the room entertaining our guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the water views are West and it was a magnificent view of the sunset (see photo). Upon going out for the night to celebrate, I requested that all the dishes and glasses be cleaned up from our room for our return. Our request was ignored as we came back to the room as we left it. Breakfast: We read some negative reviews so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting much. The breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad however and the staff were just wonderful. We had pre-booked full breakfast and you actually get to pick the dish from the menu and it is made fresh for you (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only had this at a couple of hotels). For anyone off the street or not pre-booking breakfast, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with this one. It is extremely expensive and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast gives you only one hot dish, one freshly squeezed juice and one coffee/tea \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 if you want more, you pay for it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you do have unlimited access to the continental breakfast buffet though. Should you wish sides such as hashbrowns, bacon, etc that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an extra $8! In addition to the $50 or $60 a full hot breakfast costs. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had this anywhere else before so was extremely disappointed by this. My recommendation for EVERYONE wishing to stay at this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book breakfast and either walk or get a taxi to the Hilton, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too far (might seem like it if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re walking). The full breakfast there is $35 (from memory, but whatever it is, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth it). The hot food there is also made to order and there is no limit on how many meals you have \u00e2\u20ac\u201c get fresh pancakes, eggs Benedict, waffles, eggs of any kind etc etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c your stomach is your limit. There is a juice station and you can have all the freshly squeezed juice (pick your own combination) that you want. There is also a cold buffet and the usual pastries, toast etc. You can eat as much as you like at the Hilton and the quality of breakfast there is FAR superior! Accommodation: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to end on a bad note as we did have a great time at the Observatory and it is certainly a great experience. The hotel was very clean and it is beautiful. Our suite was luxurious and although the d\u00c3\u00a9cor may not be to everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste, we chose it intentionally to get that touch of old-world elegance. The bathroom was great and we really loved the rain shower (that the Savoy in London is so famous for). The TV is really old, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tucked away and we had no interest in it anyway. Suggestions: I think some reviews mentioned that the hotel needs a renovation. I can see what they mean, but I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been very well looked after and is very clean so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still good. To keep its reputation and stay top class, they should consider upgrading or renovating it soon as well as look after their guests a little better. Someone needs to revamp the entire breakfast arrangement, otherwise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c intending guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c try the Hilton (you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t regret it), or go somewhere locally.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely the best in Sydney, likely one of the best in the world\u201d", "Author": "astropoeia", "ReviewID": "UR26781660", "Content": "I must first qualify that I'm not exaggerating when I say that this hotel is definitely the best in Sydney and one of the best in the world. My husband and I both travel frequently and have stayed at many leading hotels of the world. But many a time, even though the hotel is a highly rated five star establishment, we still get disappointed with some aspect of our stay. But for Observatory, this hotel has far exceeded my expectations in all aspects. Most of all, its the excellent service attitude that no request (reasonable of course!) is too much for them, and that they would go the extra mile just to make your stay a pleasant one. You're made to feel that you can rely on them to get everything done right. This is something very much lacking in most other hotels. Someone somehow will miss out something, be it the concierge or the receptionist. But at Observatory, you know you'll get what you ask for. We stayed at this hotel on the last day of our three day trip to the Blue Mountains and Sydney to celebrate my husband's birthday. At Blue Mountains, we were already extremely impressed with our stay at Lilianfels, the sister hotel of Observatory. (See my other review for Lilianfels). So it was to my surprise that the Observatory was able to do even better. I will now provide a breakdown for why I rate this hotel so highly. 1. Reservations The reservations staff was not only polite but he made sure that all our requests for our room were met. In particular, he made sure we had a room on the third floor (the highest) with a lovely harbour view. 2. Reception The reception was most efficient. Check-in and out was extremely fast. Most notably, the receptionist, Robert, was extremely friendly and managed to accommodate my last minute request for a birthday cake for my husband. He arranged for a really delicious and beautiful chocolate cake to be delivered at exactly the time I requested. And upon check-out, Robert also provided good advice when I could not decide which Observatory teddy bear to purchase. 3. Room Elegant, beautiful and most charming is how I would describe the room. Its much bigger than most hotel rooms and the decor is so sophisticated. There is no issue with noises at all as there are two doors to the room. One when you enter, with the closet and bathroom within reach and another for your bedroom. The room was also immaculate. I am quite a cleanliness freak and for me to find the room clean to my standards is rare. Even the linen was spotlessly clean. You know how sometimes while the linen looks clean, after you sleep in it, you start to itch a little. But here at Observatory, there was no such issue at all. The toiletries provided were also lovely, especially the body balm which kept my skin moisturised despite the hour long swim. 4. Pool The Observatory has a most beautiful pool with a ceiling made to resemble a thousand stars in the sky. The pool was extremely well-maintained and clean. The whole atmosphere was most serene. 4. The Globe Bar After our opera, we went to the Globe Bar for a light snack as it was already 10.30pm. The waitress very politely informed us that we will need to make our food orders soon as the chef was leaving. But she joked that they'll keep the chef in the kitchen until we're satisfied with our orders. The homemade carrot soup was a gem. The decor of the Globe Bar was also very classic, like an old English drawing room. 6. Service This is the main reason why I rate this hotel as exceptional. Everyone from the receptionist to the bar staff, to the concierge, to the housekeeping staff, never once failed to meet expectations. They were all extremely professional, friendly and efficient. Everyone did their job with pride and its just so truely impressive. I hope that I've given a good picture of why this hotel is exceptional. For a hotel with all these attributes, the price is totally acceptable and resonable. I look forward to returning soon and hope that more people will discover what a gem this hotel is.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tokyo", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "aussietoday", "ReviewID": "UR25676732", "Content": "I stayed here late last week before leaving Sydney.

The room was large, clean, immaculate. The decor is not to my taste, but I knew that when I booked. Our package included breakfast, otherwise we might have baulked at the $49 price, but the food was excellent, service friendly and relaxed. We stayed there partly to indulge in the degustation menu offered at the restaurant. It was very very good - an elegant and comfortable dining room, excellent service, a sommelier who knew his stuff, and a perfect way to celebrate a special occasion. The food was divine - my favourite was the ocean trout dusted in five spice powder, served with a blini filled with wasabi cream. Fantastic! The only downside was that the tea/coffee offered at the end was not part of the degustation menu, and extra was charged. It would be more reasonable to include the price of this in the degustation menu, making it all a little more seamless. The pool is definitely worth trying, summer or winter. It was very romantic the first day we visited, but Saturday saw the arrival of families (it was hard to tell if they were hotel guests or members of the health club) and spoiled the the atmosphere a bit. The location is good. After our first day of walking everywhere, we had sore feet and blisters, but found it easy and cheap to take taxis for the rest of our stay. Only about 9 (according to one of the very precise concierge staff) minutes walk down to Circular Quay, a bit further to the city but very easy to navigate around.

We stayed in room 314, a water- view room overlooking Darling Harbor and loved it; note: the standard rooms on the back side are slightly smaller than the city-view rooms, but the view of Darling Harbor and the large walk-out balcony (with teak table, chairs, and chaise lounge) more than offset the slight difference in size. Our room was also incredibly quiet; we never heard a passing vehicle or any other guests in the hallway, for that matter. Attention to detail is the hallmark of this hotel; turn-down service was over the top and exceeded anything we have experienced in a similar 5-star hotel. Like some other reviewers, we felt the breakfast options were a little steep, so we walked down the street to to one of the local coffee shops for breakfast each morning. That said, do not let this minor detail stand in your way.

The room was fresh with clotted cream carpets and walls, and beds and windows generously swathed with elegant floral prints and silks.

We don't mind this at all, as we have visited Sydney many times, and we enjoyed our 'water view' room, looking out the large window, over some of Sydney's oldest houses and a shipping dock, to the ferries and other harbour traffic tootling to and from Darling Harbour, and the Balmain Peninsula. I also think that the streetscape from the rooms along the front of the hotel is quite pleasant - the street is relatively quiet, tree-lined, and a taste of authentic inner-city Sydney life. Actually, it is lovely to stroll around the neighbourhood - The Rocks is Sydney's historic centre, with a jumble of terrace houses, stone pubs, and the nether regions of the city's famous bridge.

Our meal in the Galileo restaurant was pleasant enough as the service was good and the wine selection very extensive, however I was disappointed with the vegetarian selection on the menu.

Out of all the places I've stayed in the world let alone Sydney, I was grinning from ear to ear when I was the bathroom. Well done! The food was great but yet again it was the service that made the experience wonderful. I wasn't crazy about the eggs benedict and when I told the waiter who served me that it wasn't to my liking he happily replaced it with an more traditional option. The waiter treated me as if I was the only person in the restaurant when in fact the restaurant was nearly completely full. The spa was just the icing on the cake. In my mind, by far the best spa in Australia. I wasn't even in the spa mood when I arrived however after spending 5 minutes checking the place out, I suddenly felt as if I needed a facial. (Funny that) I am a big fan of La Prairie and receive their facials when I stay at the Ritz in Hong Kong so I was happy to see that they too offer their services. Before I had my treatment I went for a quick dip in the pool which is really a spa treatment amongst itself. If you've never been to their spa before, just go to check out the pool. The spa treatment was beautiful and again, it all came down to detail. Nothing was forgotten or left undone and I can honestly say that it was one of the best facials I have ever had. (Thanks Malthi.. sorry if Ive miss spelled your name but you were an angel) Again, my heart loves the Hilton as its served as a home for me for so man years however my soul loves The Observatory Hotel. I'm not due back for until August 08 and I'm seriosuly torn between the two. If I'd had to decided right now, I'd pick the Observatory.

The Observatory allows small pets in some of its rooms, so I initially got in contact with them via email to see if there are any rooms that have not had animals in them, due to allergies. Luckily only select rooms are pet-friendly, so this was fine. The customer service via email was so good (the girl was very helpful and friendly) that I ended up booking a room this way. As my budget was low, I could only afford the cheapest room - a city-view room - and breakfast (valued at $45 per person) at the restaurant was included for no extra charge, which was great. Booking the lowest-priced room, I expected that it would be pretty small, but the photos on the site looked very nice, and it's sort of old-fashioned, and just a bit prettier than some of the more modern hotels. To my surprise, the room was actually very large. By \"city-view\", it's more a view across the street of houses, but this was quite nice, and the street wasn't at all busy. Being able to open a window (in addition to air-condioning, of course) is a bit of a novelty after staying in high-rise hotels. The bathroom was fairly large as well, and as beautiful as the rest of our room. The staff were extremely efficient, polite, welcoming and professional at all times, and we were even taken to our room by a staff member. Despite my high expectations, the Observatory Hotel and its staff managed to exceed these expectations. The strawberries waiting for us in our room were unexpected and a nice touch. We thought the batteries in the remote-control for the television might have been flat, and within moments of us giving them a call, they were at our door with replacements (turns out we were just having trouble figuring out how to use it!).

(For comparison purposes, we also stayed at the Empire Retreat in the Margaret River area, the Park Hyatt in Melbourne, and Lizard Island.) As frequent world travelers for both business and pleasure, and as travelers who often stay at Four Seasons level hotels and boutique properties, we must say that the Observatory most often lived up to its reputation as a world-class hotel Our iniitial and most significant visit was for 3 nights in a Water View Executive Suite (A$624). We arrived very early on a Friday morning from the USA, and were delighted that our suite was available at such an early hour (possibly helped by the fact that we visited out of season). The suite was spacious, 2 large slightly oval shaped rooms with an adjoining spacious hallway between them with a nicely-sized bathroom. It was certainly well-appointed in a more traditional European fashion as expected. Our water view looked out onto the harbour--not the opera house or bridge view, but onto another section of the harbour with a more working port view. We knew that, already. Still, we enjoyed the view. (My partner is an engineer, and was fascinated watching the ships load and unload). Also, as someone who requires it to be quite cool to sleep, the room easily cooled to the chilly 16-17 degrees C (or 58-60 degrees F) that I need. Service at the hotel was flawless, and our breakfasts were absolutely charming. The server, whose name I cannot recall, was wonderful. He remembered our orders and preferences after our first breakfast--to our immense surprise. Service does take a bit longer than Americans are accustomed to experiencing, but that isn't unusual in more European settings, of course. The hotel is located in a very pleasant residential area not far from the tourist center. It was a very simple 10 minute walk to the Rocks area where the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge are located. I must confess surprise at how close they were, as I'd read so many complaints about the fact that the Observatory isn't well located. We liked being a little bit out of the way while needing only a short walk to get to the center of things. If you prefer to be in the heart of things, perhaps the Observatory isn't for you. However, we did stop by the Park Hyatt since we had also considered that property. Thankfully, we chose the Observatory. Though the Park Hyatt is certainly a nice hotel, it is quite ugly from the outside. Its interior is a contemporary sleekness, though a bit manufactured for our tastes (which also turned out to be true for the Park Hyatt in Melbourne). Service seemed nice at the Park Hyatt, as someone was more than willing to show us an Opera House View Deluxe Room there. We were unimpressed. It was a spacious single room looking directly onto the Opera House--but it cost significantly more (A$950) than our 2 room far-more spacious suite at the Observatory--not to mention the fact that any 1st floor level hotel rooms look out immediately onto a public walk area, giving you very little privacy. Personally, I had enough view of the Opera House from just hanging out at the Rocks area a few times! In any case, we were thrilled that we had chosen the Observatory and that we would be returning after the rest of our Australian adventure...for one night before returning to the USA. Our second stay for just the single night was a refreshing return. We again had a Water View Executive Suite (A$724), a little more expensive this time for reasons we were never sure about, but so it goes--besides, we only had it for one night this time around. It was a diffrerent configuration, with a squarish living room and a short hallway with bathroom connecting to the squarish bedroom. It also offered the same harbour view as before. We must say we preferred the original configuration, but this one did offer a small balcony off the bedroom. Your choice, I suppose, as to which you might prefer. The first was more spacious, but the second offered a balcony onto the harbour view. This room took a little more time to cool down to my liking, but it did eventually get cold, fortunately. The only caveat we had with either of our stays was dinner on our last evening during our second stay. We had arranged to have dinner at the hotel restaurant, Galileo, with 5 of our friends in Sydney for our last night. Since we arrived on a later flight from Lizard Island and Cairns, we had a reservation for 7 people at 9:30 pm. Upon being seated, the server informed us that we needed to hurry because the kitchen was closing at 10 pm. This was quite irritating, since we definitely like to dine--and dinner was a prefixe cost that was quite substantial (A$130 per person, if I recall correctly, for 3 courses). No one warned us when we made the reservation that the kitchen closed at 10, nor do I believe that should matter. If a restaurant takes a reservation, especially for its own guests, then it should honor that and give us the same culinary and service experience, period. Unfortunately, in this case, the courses felt quite rushed, and we suspect that the meal quality suffered as a result. None of our meals really were that great, and for such a hefty pricetag we all were quite disappointed. At the end, the server almost threw a fit because we wanted to split the check between 4 credit cards. Not exactly the service on which the hotel or restaurant's reputation are to be based, I expect. Still, my partner and I will gladly return to the Observatory Hotel.

After trying to decide whether or not it was appropriate to complain we concluded that considering the amount of money we were paying it wasn't good enough. First reception sent up a cleaner, armed with carpet cleaner, to fix the problem (with us still in the room). He took one look and decided it would be easier for us to shift and later have the carpets steam cleaned. So, after some wait and several more phone calls, we were moved to a smaller, older room on a lower level floor (first floor, much louder and no security set-up in the lift as with the other levels). We had also paid for a water view, so the lower level wasn't as good in this regard either. When we entered, there was a dirty food plate on the table and the ironing board was left out and set-up for use. It was obvious the room hadn't been properly cleaned after the last guest!

Our only other complaint was in regards to the parking arrangements. We had a hire car and were told upon arrival that it would be parked for us BUT no-one told us that this would cost $40 and another $40 everytime we wanted to use it. There is no other option besides don't bring a car. I am sure there might be 100 other better options in Sydney if you are prepared to spend this kind of money but I would probably give the Observatory another shot next time.

As I wanted to have a really great weekend I decided to get a hotel room that would complement the rare Scotch I was going to crack open and, having looked at the recommendations of TripAdvisor and Conde Naste it looked like The Observatory was the top pick in Sydney. Looking at their website I found a great sounding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To Dine For\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package which consisted of a overnight stay in a Executive Suite room, a eight course degustation dinner at Galileo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for two, cocktails for two at the Globe Bar, and a Buffet Breakfast for two in Galileo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. While a little on the expensive side at $945, it nevertheless sounded like a good weekend away so I booked it. We both ended up arriving early at the hotel (about 1310 hrs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c check-in is at 1500 hrs). I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t met at the car when I pulled up but when I presented at the Concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk I was quickly attended and was able to hand off my car keys in less than a minute, and the bellman even checked back with me to see if I wanted my dry-cleaning hanging in the back of the car brought it as well (I had forgot to mention it). Reception staff were very professional and pleasant as well and advised us that while the room wouldn't be available until 1500 we were more than welcome to make use of the Day Spa downstairs. She even checked in two additional bags on the spot and escorted us to the elevator to send us on our way to the Day Spa. The Day Spa was small but nice with separate steam and sauna rooms for males and females (which is a welcome European touch) and I noted that the change room even included razors, shaving cream and mouthwash supplies to use. One minor lapse was that although the receptionist asked if we had our swimming trunks with us (we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, as mine was in my bag upstairs) we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offered the guest loan swimwear that they have on hand for just such occasions (I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about this I until I asked reception about where my mate could buy a pair of togs from so we could go for a swim a little later in the day). While the steam room was quite nice it would have been good to break up the couple of hours we spent in there with a swim in the pool. We went up to check-in at about 1510 to check in but our room was still not ready and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until about 1540 that we were able to go up to our suite on the third floor. When we did get to the room one odd thing I noted was that housekeeping had left a broken castor wheel on the bed for some unknown reason. The second thing I noticed was that the suite only had one King bed and not two beds like the photo of the room on the website had (although this is my fault for not checking). Not being that friendly with my mate I rang back down and asked to be relocated to another suite with two beds which, to the credit of the hotel, they arranged in less than 20 minutes (as they had to change the bed in another room). While we were waiting for our new room to be ready my mate and I noted with amusement that the walls weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very soundproofed on the third floor as the noise of the very energetic couple next door broke through into our conversation. We moved down to the first floor into the Executive Suite named Ibis (all the Executive Suites are named after carriages on the Orient Express) which I actually liked better (as the layout of the rooms was in a Y shape with the bathroom off the hallway and not off the bedroom) but my mate thought that the furnishings were better on the third floor (although I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say I noticed much of a difference). The Suite had a great bathroom with a really deep bath tub (which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use although if I had the time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure would have been great) and a great rainfall shower with single separate large massage jet shower head that could be turned on in conjunction with the rainfall shower (which is a good touch and is probably the best shower I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that is against some stiff competition). The bathroom was tops. The bedroom and lounge were pleasant and in line with a five star hotel but not particularly memorable. On a personal pet peeve, from a laptop warrior, is when will hotels stop being idiots and stop having high speed internet services that require you to slog down to reception to buy log-on time (such as the Novotel chain do and as The Observatory required). Even the ridiculously expensive Telstra Hotspot service that some hotels provide is better than this. I want speed and ease when connecting my laptop, not some old world process. To all hotels - Please, please, please follow the Crowne Plaza example and provide either one-click wireless or ethernet hi-speed internet to your rooms that offers capped rates (fees cap at some 24hr access rate). It has been down successfully in a couple of chains and can't be that hard to replicate. Drinks at the Globe were very good, with great bar snacks provided, and we felt so comfortable we even lashed out on some $150 a glass Remy cognac. Our eight course degustation meal at the Galileo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was nice and was accompanied by good service from our waiter. While the portions are small they are well-presented and tasty but hungry people are better off choosing something else. We also received a complimentary glass each of Moscato before our pre-dessert course. While the service was good at Dinner at Galileo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our buffet breakfast was a disaster for service with wait staff seeming poorly trained, rarely attentive and making very basic food service mistakes (such as delivering an order of raisin toast without any butter, with the toast barely above room temperature). Definitely a souring experience, despite the otherwise tasty hot dishes, so I recommend ordering room service for breakfast instead. Some of the hype about The Observatory is well-deserved, but there are some areas where this old dame of the Sydney hotel market needs some work, and it was a shame to see some very poor performance overshadow the otherwise nice rooms and very good service provided by other members of this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Observatory Hotel by Orient-Express", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d256652-Reviews-The_Observatory_Hotel_by_Orient_Express-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$293 - $450*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">89 - 113 Kent St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "256652", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/5b/cb/8c/the-observatory-hotel.jpg"}}
