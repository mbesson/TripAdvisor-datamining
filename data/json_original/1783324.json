Other pluses: free gym, computers/wi-fi in the lobby, no bugs (I obsessively checked) One things I'd like to state for people traveling with pets - Since I live in NY, I didn't check in with my dog. I went back to Brooklyn and got him so he could stay with my mom for a night or two (he is small - 7 pounds). When I brought him, I let the hotel know and they provided a bed and bowl. The first night, no incident. The second night, my mom and I went to dinner and when we came back to the hotel room, my dog was GONE. There was a note on the bed saying he was at the front desk. Turns out, someone complained that he barked so they removed him. This was pretty disturbing. Again, the hotel staff was SUPER friendly - my dog seemed fine and in good hands. But to remove my dog from the room without my consent? They said we had signed a waiver allowing them to do so, but we were never given a waiver (of course they had us sign one right then). I had my husband come pick up the dog then as I didn't want our pup to be a nuisance nor to be put in a situation like this again, however people traveling with pets from out of town wouldn't have this luxury.

Customer service does not exist. My husband had a business trip in New York and I tagged along for several days. He left very early Monday morning for work and I was in the hotel room by myself when I realized that the linens on the bed had a stain of poop! Grossed that I had slept on it, I called the front desk. They were neither apologetic nor sensed the grossness of the situation. The front desk notified me that they would be sending someone. They sent one male janitor who came into the room to change the sheets. Again, no apology or anything. About 30 minutes later, still in my PJ's and about to get into the shower, the same male janitor knocked on my door. There had been no call from the front desk so I was wary of opening my door. I opened it and stood at the front door asking what he wanted. He claimed he left his master key inside my room. I told him I had not seen any key but he barged in the room and started searching for it himself. At this point, I was really uncomfortable. Our room was in the corner, I was by myself, and this strange man was basically looking through my stuff. Of course, he didn't find anything and left. I was late for an appointment and didn't stop by the front desk to tell what happened. I came back into the hotel in the late afternoon and asked to see the manager. When I told her of what happened, again, she wasn't very concerned, was condescending, and kept asking me what the big deal the situation was. She referred me to the housekeeping manager who sent me a small box of chocolates to ease the situation. We left the next day. Their valet policy is to call the front desk 30 minutes in advance and they will have the car waiting in the front. (I think the place where they park is actually pretty far and that's how long it takes to walk and drive back). We called it in the next morning at 6am. My flight was leaving at 8:30 so we were cutting it close. We came downstairs after the allotted time to find the wrong car sitting in the front. We informed the front desk that it was the wrong car and they had to call over to the valet deck. Instead of hurrying and trying to get our car back to the hotel, the front desk was more concerned with whose fault they got the number wrong. We didn't care as long as the car got to the hotel ASAP. It took them another 30 minutes to do so. The charge was $49 per night for valet, so my husband wanted to see if they could waiver the last night's valet charge for their mistakes. It has been horrible trying to talk to anyone. No manger has called back.

LOCATION The Sheraton's location is just ok - on Canal Street which is on the edge to Chinatown (we thought not so nice unfortunately!) but also quite close to the more \"in\" area of Tribeca and when you walk up Broadway you have nice, though expensive shops to look at and a very nice, clean and safe area when walking further uptown. We walked Broadway (uptown) as well as West Broadway (uptown) even at night and felt safe. However, we did not like walking in the other direction towards Chinatown, as we felt unsafe there - just our impression. But location was the only not so great thing about this hotel. ROOMS When we were checked in, we were given two rooms on the executive floor. The rooms were good in size, clean and not too loud - you did hear sirens and a car alarm every now and then but that happens everywhere in NYC! The Sheraton also has wonderful beds! Our rooms had a (for our standards) huge double bed with great clean sheets & more than enough fluffy pillows! This was great for us, since we had to stay in bed more than we had wanted to due to an illness. On our 3rd day I had to contact the front office re a doctor and was told by staff they have a doctor who makes house calls. They contacted him for us and he called us at our room later. He arrived in the early afternoon and was very nice and competent. STARWOOD PREFERRED GUEST LOUNGE We stayed on the floor where the Starwood Preferred Guest lounge is located and where we got free breakfast, evening snacks and free soft drinks! It was just great! The lounge even has a wonderful terrace - too bad it was winter! There's also a computer in the lounge which you can use for free for a certain period of time each day (I think it was around an hour or less?), but there were also a couple of computers for free use in the lobby. Due to the time change we were up very early each day and always the first ones for breakfast so we got to talking to the lounge attendants a lot! They were all very kind and helpful if you needed any extras! STAFF We thought the staff was great!

The rooms are way too small, we were given a \"suite\"(As I'm Platinum Strwood) and it was smaller than the \"current\" Sheraton rooms anywhere else in the country, really a joke... of course the bed is one of the best as always in Sheraton, but the rest of the room not. The bathroom was tiny and the extractor in it is too loud, so much that we prefer to be on the dark rather than hearing that noise (The extractor works when you turn the light on in the bathroom) The lounge is on the top floor, having really nice views of the Hudson River and midtown, really nice views, but the quality of the food ofered was very low. also the service in the lounge was bad.

On the 21st floor there is a Club Lounge with an amazing outside terrace with an awesome view of the city. I believe Gold (not sure about Gold since the first time we stayed we were not offered free breakfast) and Platinum members can eat breakfast there for free. Food is good, coffee excellent. On our second visit to the hotel in January, we were promised, as now Platinum members, a Suite upgrade. Excited we went to check our room on the 5th floor and were immediately disappointed. The rooms was not much larger than their standard and the view was terrible. The small windows looked out at a brick wall. We then called the front desk, She told us there were no suites available, however we could have a room on the 17th floor with a better view. Of course we took it and it was a beauitiful view, directly across from the Empire State Bldg., but the room was standard, not an upgrade. Upon departure, we did not convey our displeasure due to the fact that they did change our room. However, when I returned home, I immediately contacted Sheraton. I received an apology from them as well as an email contact from the hotel itself with an apology and a promise to do better next time. I am not saying that I would not stay at this property again. It is convenient to visit the above-,mentioned areas for a short trip. We had reservations at Patricia's in Brooklyn which was a short taxi ride away.

It seemed like some of the main details had been overlooked when designing it. I had what I thought booked a 'King Suite', but as the price was very reasonable I didn't really seek to question the oversize double room. Sure it had a small dining table and a pull out couch, but wasn't a suite, nor did it have any storage or hanging for clothes, so I literally spent the entire 4 days living out of my suitcase. Not exactly a major problem, but more of an oversight by the management. The hot water went out one morning. I called guest services and was advised that it was being repaired and would be back on in 20 minutes. sure enough it was on in 20 minutes and again more of an inconvenience than a disaster, but not what I'd expect from a Sheraton. The coffee shop was always empty which meant ordering was quick. The bar area seemed quite adequete for a quick drink and nothing more.

I have stayed at this hotel five or six times before. I had previously reviewed it and was not going to again, until I read a review by Vivaladiva 1. First about my stay, it was even better than before. I am a Hilton Diamond member and I could have used points and stayed at a Hilton, but I have stayed at most of them in the city and I chose the Sheraton Tribeca over all of them. I did not want the hustle bustle of midtown and this hotel is a short cab ride or easy subway ride from midtown. I brought my wife and dog on the trip. My wife was so impressed with how well she slept that she asked me to find out what type of mattress they used. They set up a dog bed and dog dishes which was a nice touch. My wife had mentioned that it was my birthday and the staff all signed a card and sent up some drinks and snacks for us. I love the location as it still has the energy of the city without most of the congestion (except at rush hour). There is a parking garage right across the street (on a side street) which is convenient. We ate at a great Italian restaurand a few blocks away and went to the Blue Note Jazz club that evening. A perfect weekend with great service and a great room in a wonderful location. I was shocked to see the review by Vivaladiva 1. Sure, I had to wait five minutes to check in (seemed like 20), I would expect that in a popular hotel with good rates (as she mentioned). To have had a bad experience is possible, but three bad experiences at this hotel is highly unlikely. To give this hotel one star (actually a circle) just blew me away. I would guess that \"La Diva\" never gives more than three circles for any experience. Unfortunately she went over her credit limit on here charge card because other hotels had put holds on her card (come on now, I stay in hotels 70 nights a year and this has never happened to me). She gives them a credit card which is no good and she blames the hotel for not accepting it. She offers to give them cash. If you owned a hotel would you want this person staying there? I think Trip Advisor should remove reviews like this that are obviously someone's way of venting for a bad experience that they caused themselves. I never wrote something bad about a previous review before, but boy it feels good to defend a place that has made me feel so welcomed when I have been away from home.

If you look at my other reviews, I have NEVER given a hotel only 1 star! I have stayed at this hotel 2 times and tried to stay a third time about a month ago because of the price. My first time I stayed at this hotel it was the first week they opened. My room was clean (I was probably the first person to ever stay in it. Check in took over 20 minutes! The bathrooms are cute and my room was a nice size and I had a decent view. The staff was nice, but there were a lot of different little issues. I chalked it up to it being the first week and that the hotel would get better with time. The Platinum lounge is one of the nicest with a rooftop deck and great view. I liked the location because I work downtown often and at that time I was working in Brooklyn a lot which the train to BK was a block away. The second time I stayed was for about 2 months later with friends. They upgraded me to a \"suite\", which isn't a suite. Its a room with a couch and dining table. The room is still small just more furniture. Our check in was again over 20 minutes. The staff seemed confused, but friendly. The weekend was a mess. With keys that weren't working all weekend, construction going on that woke us up at 8am and was making our bed vibrating our bed. We were told there was construction still going on, but I love how that information wasn't told to us before we checked in. I feel like if there is noise going on that loud, maybe you should tell us so we can make a descion of not checking in. After cursing out the manager, he gave me points for the headache, but I swore I would never be returning again. Checking out took us almost 30 minutes. We almost missed our train to go home because of their \"computer\" delay. Around the holidays I had a friend from out of the country in town. I booked this hotel again because the rooms were only $99 per night and were in the area we needed to be in. A year had passed and I was hoping the hotel had got their $h*t together. Well, I was wrong. I am a SPG Platinum member and have been for years, but this hotel doesn't care. My card didn't go through because there was other hotel holds still on it from stays I had from earlier in the week. I told them I would pay cash (which I and my friend had a lot of) and I would leave cash or card deposit. Well, well, well they told me they can't do that. Excuse me? I have cash to give you as a deposit for incidentals. Remind you that I have over 50 stays a year, the rooms have mini bars and the front desk has the power to lock my movie rentals and phone. Still a no go. The manager said we have people who trash the room a lot. Really? I don't walk around thinking I deserve special treatment, but the entire point of being a elite member to something is for the \"special treatment\". I show my loyalty to a brand then I want the same loyalty back. Especially when your standing there with your bags during the holidays and just want to get into your room to relax and enjoy the little time your in town. My friend swiped his European card which it was denied as well and he didn't know why. I asked the hotel if it was their computer and they said no. Well, after an hour of what I like to call a big ol mess we ended up at the Le Meridan (which was only $60 more) and the manager said \"because I'm a platinum member and stayed here before\" he would take a cash deposit. My friend said could you try my card first, and they did.......which of course it went right through!!!! So there was no need for the cash deposit, but its nice to know that we could of used if we needed to. My friend loved the hotel so much that he booked the hotel for his conference in the spring time. This hotel isn't worth the headache.

You can hear the people next to you so if you watch T.V. at night the sound has to be practically mute.Also the T.V. is fixed to the wall and it will not move at all so you cannot turn it in your direction.The thing that really was the most irritating is that you have an elevator key that you have to have each time you get in if you want your floor and if you forget your key well it's back down to the lobby to get a new one.When you check in they ask if you want your family members name on the record ,so,if your family member forgets the key your family member gets another.Well, so much for that. My family member was grilled when they went to get another key and they left the phone in the room and could not call me when I was in the club lounge to explain to me what happened. If there are alot of people in the elevator,each person has to pull out there key for there floor and it was hair-raising to try to get all the keys in and your button pressed before it passed your floor!This shows me that this is a sketchy neighborhood or they would not have this crazy key system.The Club Lounge is quite nice but this is extra $$.They have no heat lamps or anything cheery(even a fake flower would have been an improvement) out on the terrace.If you go outside on the terrace Club Lounge and take in the only reason to really stay here (the view of the Empire State building)You have to stand literally because the way they designed it if you sit down you stare at the wall.Not relaxing.At least there is a good pizza place around the corner Saluggi(sp?) I think. I suppose if you are on a higher floor and have a view of the Empire State Building and they did not make you pay for wi-fi per day, I might have enjoyed my two nights here.At least you could open your drapes and see your clothes to get dressed without having anyone look at you in your birthday suit from the building next door.On a positive note,great bedding one more negative beds are like xtra large twins.they do not seem to be even full/dble beds.The housecleaning lady left me a welcoming note in hopes of a gratuity I guess? When I went to check out I found that there was a charge of 2 five dollar waters.I think housecleaning must be responsible for telling the front desk this?I would have gladly given her the price of water before I would have drunk a bottle of water that was 5 bucks!The water was sitting there the whole time with the 5 dollar price on it.Then I had to spend time on reversing the charges.This was the nail in the coffin to a disappointing stay", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cA Gem on Canal St.\u201d", "Author": "phred3176", "ReviewID": "UR123317041", "Content": "Great Location away from the typical Midtown crowds and tourist traps.

We gave 12,000 points which was the minimum. They told us we could not have a suite and we were a little disappointed but it would be fine because he was giving us a great view. Then the manager came in and changed everything and gave us the nicest suite ever! They gave us the top floor. They brought champagne and chocolate strawberries quickly to our room. It was the best ever!! The room was simple but beautiful. The view was amazing! The bed was soooo comfortable and I slept like a baby. I can't say enough about the bathroom. It was sooo nice. I would give the bathroom a 5 star. I'm not kidding! For a sheraton, it was very impressive. I don't know why I haven't been to this hotel before.

We booked through Priceline and got a really great rate as a combined air/hotel package. Our room was not ready when we arrived at around 11am, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d anticipated that, as check in isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until mid-afternoon. They happily stored our luggage for us and gave us an estimated time that a room would be ready. We went in search of lunch in the meantime and had a great meal in Chinatown. We wandered around, returning to the hotel at the estimated time. A room still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available, but the front desk clerk quickly made some calls and found a room that would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Enough time to grab a beer at the hotel bar! They had a special going on some bottles, so it was reasonably priced for us (I think $3 or $4?). The lobby was very nice - computers to use, a full bar, Starbucks, and you can use their Wi-Fi for free in the lobby (for 45 min at a time). They let us know when the room was ready and got our bags for us. The room was small, but not too small. We had a king-bed room on the 10th floor. As others have noted, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a real closet, but they do have a wardrobe with some shelves to put your clothes and there are more shelves under the desk area. Only a shower, no tub, but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually use hotel tubs anyway. The bed was extremely comfortable and the a/c worked great. The housekeepers our first 3 days or so were great. Left us notes thanking us for the tip we left and when I requested an extra towel, she responded and gave us extra everything! Much appreciated. The last couple of days we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any notes and the extra towels were gone w/o replacements. Oh well. Not a big deal, but the personal communications and accommodations were a nice touch. Canal St isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most scenic or prettiest street in NYC. But you are within steps of Soho, Tribeca, Chinatown and Little Italy, not to mention a few different subway lines (and if you have a smart phone and are nervous about navigating the city, I highly recommend the HopStop app). I thought it was a great location to be stationed and we never felt unsafe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have to use your room key to operate the (sometimes slow) elevators.

Irene, the hurricane, was not invited but she came anyway. We drove our car to the hotel and were a little surprised that there wasn't a better entrance for guests arriving. You're lucky to get a spot on Canal Street to unload your car. Valet parking was $60/day. Upon arrival, I thought we'd be bombarded by bellmen who'd help us get unloaded, etc. but not so much. My husband ended up taking our car to a local garage that was INDOORS and ABOVE GROUND to make sure we'd be okay if the hurricane hit. It ended up taking him about 20 minutes to go around the block and I attribute this to the mad rush of commuters getting out of the city before the storm him. Still, kind of a pain to deal with. Otherwise, check in was smooth. We were in the club level as our reservation was booked with my Starwood points. The bellman who took us our to our room, was extremely knowledgable, full of information, and eager to give us a great experience. We were taken to our room on the 17th floor. Our room was beautiful and roomy for NYC standards. One wall was all windows looking right towards the the Empire State building. Fantastic views and the rooms are brand new and well designed. Because of the impending hurricane, many of the guests were basically stuck at the hotel since all of Tribeca shut down. So the bars was full, the computers were being used and there was a lot of activity in the lobby and restaurant. I have to give the staff a ton of credit. No one seemed annoyed by the questions, the stress or the influx of guests. They kept a bulletin board with storm updates in the lobby and a flyer on each floor. Overall, the hotel was fantastic at providing news on the storm, what roads were open, what their plan was, and what we could expect if we got hit hard. Fortunately, we only lost cable for a an hour or two. Power never went out. And I have to mention how comfortable the beds were. We slept so well during the height of the storm and the linens kept us warm and cozy. Upon checkout, right after the storm, we decided to hit the breakfast buffet to get some food in us before our drive home. If we could actually drive anywhere. The buffet left a lot to be desired. The eggs were old and cold, there was no more toast left and none of the staff seemed concerned that they were busier than usual and guests were in line waiting to eat. However, I have to say that the Sheraton staff managed the storm and its inconveniences really well. I loved that there was a Starbucks in the lobby to get some morning coffee. And the lobby was bustling with travelers who made it a communal meeting space. The staff accomodated. The rooms are extremely comfortable, the views are amazing and the location is central to everything in lower Manhattan.

As a devoted Starwood Preferred Guest, I'm pretty picky about my hotels. And this one definitely hit the mark. First off, it's just around the corner from the subway station that serves the A, C and E lines. That means if you flew into JFK, it drops you off almost at the front door for a whopping $7.25 with both the Air Train and Subway fares. Other subway lines are within a few blocks, so you can literally get anywhere in Manhattan very easily and for $2.25 a ride. Add to that, you're right across the street from SoHo, which has shopping and restaurants a-plenty - all very walkable. This is a busy hotel with a fairly small lobby area that made it feel even busier. But that was never an issue for me. I was still able to get an elevator rather easily. The lobby is modern and clean with lots of amenities - a grab-and-go food/drink counter, a small bar with seating area, a restaurant, and an area with several computers . I was lucky to get into a room on an upper floor, so the view was great. Furnishings are comfortable, including the bed. The bathroom isn't huge, but it's well-equipped with a nice stand-up shower and well-lit mirror. The one thing I thought was odd was there were no drawers for unpacking my suitcase. The closet had hangers, but nowhere to really put things that don't hang. Not a huge inconvenience. Staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. The rooftop deck (which I believe is only accessible to Club floors - Splurge! It's worth it!) has INCREDIBLE 180 degree views of the city, as well as breakfast and evening snacks. This is highly unique for a New York hotel. Yes, so this hotel is directly on Canal Street, which is totally nasty and crowded. But as you walk out the front door, just head left and go around the corner to the parallel street behind Canal. It's quiet, safe, and no one is going to try to sell you a fake Rolex. That's what I did to get to the N, Q, R subway stop. And once you get off of Canal in any direction, your'e right back to charming, movie set-like, downtown New York. Comparing to what NYC hotels are charging these days for a nice, modern, new-ish room, I thought this hotel was a bargain - and I compare all Starwood properties before I make my decision (always check AAA rates and \"hotel offers\" on the SPG site before you book). This one has often had the lowest price. Request or book an upper floor, or at least one that faces uptown.

This is a very nice property but if the hotel can get away with charging you for something, they will. I stayed here in April for a college visit to NYU with my daughter and booked another reservation on August 29 for her move in at NYU. Unfortunately, I had to cancel the reservation because NYU shifted move-in schedules due to Hurricane Irene and it would no longer be feasible for me to check in to the hotel on the same day as the rescheduled move-in day. I called the hotel directly to cancel the reservation. For some reason, the hotel staff member did not provide a cancellation number--perhaps distracted due to--I don't know--maybe a myriad of guest cancellations due to the hurricane? Moreover, for some very strange reason--perhaps with so much on my mind between rearranging all of my travel schedules, being emotional over my first-born going away to college, and feverishly shopping for dorm items online while the city was shut down--I did not ask for a cancellation number for the first time in my life. Not only did the hotel charge me for the room and not retain a record of the room cancellation (don't they record conversations in the event of disputes like this?), they also insist that if I did not receive a cancellation number, then 1) the responsibility is mine to ask for one, and 2) if they don't have a record of it, it did not happen. Really?! Is it not possible that perhaps one of the hotel staff members got distracted and neglected to give me a cancellation number and record this important information? I have the phone record to prove that I called the hotel in advance of my stay and\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbelieve me, it was to cancel the room, not a request to fluff up my pillows! I had four phone conversations with the hotel to try to resolve this--first with Steven at the front desk, who promised I would receive a phone call from the general manager--a phone call I never received. When I called back, I spoke with Priscilla, she insisted she was \"the manager\" and insisted on resolving my problem, and then when I asked for the general manager, she instead referred me to Cornelio Encarnacio, the reservations manager. Fast-forward several days later, and a conversation with Cornelio that went nowhere. When I again asked to speak with the general manager, I was referred instead to the revenue manager. Um \u00e2\u20ac\u201c me thinks the revenue manager would not be inclined to reverse charges if he is responsible for increasing revenue. Just a guess. Why were guarding the GM? It was not until I looked up the general manager's name online and asked for him by name that I finally spoke with GM Lowell Beebe-Center. Apparently, he had been spoon-feeding his staff the responses to me because he held the same position -- no record at the hotel means it did not happen. He refused to reverse the charge and assume any responsibility for the mistake his staff made. Lessons learned: 1) always ask for and record a cancellation number and, 2) apparently, the customer never wins at the Sheraton Tribeca. I have never encountered such unfriendly and unbending management and staff\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially in light of the circumstances.

I was greeted by this very nice lady at the front desk (she was pregnant) and she was immediately aware of my condition. She checked her computer and gave me a room. The check-in process was very fast, probably 5 minutes (or less), which I was so grateful for since all I needed at that time was sleep.

Due to the threat of Hurricane Irene, the Saturday show was postponed, so we tried to cancel the Saturday night reservation.

Every time I spoke to the customer service reps, they said if I cancelled the second night, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to keep the discounted rate and it would result in a rate change of $100 more since it was less than 24 hours from the first check-in day. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very sympathetic to the upcoming hurricane threat and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even willing to match the current online rate, which was about halfway between the 2 rates. We decided not to cancel the 2nd night and take it up with the hotel when we arrived. Upon arrival, we asked to cancel the 2nd night so we could evacuate due to the hurricane. The friendly and helpful gentleman at the front desk said that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem and promptly cancelled the 2nd night without any rate change. We were very pleased that the employees at the actual hotel were more sympathetic to this unusual circumstance and made everything very simple and quick for us. They also let us check in 45 minutes early, so we were thrilled about that as well. The King bed room we had was very small and the bed and a chair took up most of it, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty typical for NYC hotels. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept in, so I was pretty mad when I had to wake up at 6 AM to catch a train the next morning. Everything in the room and bathroom was very clean and modern-looking, especially the flat screen TV, phone and shower. There was also a pretty cool electronics hub in the room that could accommodate all sorts of different input and output cables for various electronics, although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to play around with it. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really speak for the Tribeca neighborhood since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never stayed in this part of Manhattan before, but everything for many blocks was closed at 1 AM so there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much nightlife around. The hotel bar closed at about 1:30 AM, so that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really help our cause. I had to walk about 10 blocks just to find a convenience store that was open. The subway entrances for the 1 and A/C/E lines were both a couple minutes away, so that made it cheap and easy to navigate to various parts of the city. A final note about the Hurricane - The hotel had flyers at the front desk and elevator areas providing guests with an update of the hurricane on Friday. Even though the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the mandatory evacuation zone, they took the time to give another update to every room late Friday night asking people to leave for their safety early Saturday morning if possible, but that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d remain open with limited services if they had nowhere else to go.

I arrived with a 13 year old daughter and through our 5 night stay we had my husband join us 3 nights and my college age daughter 1 night. The location is not great for women alone or with teens. Canal street gets very empty and walking from 2 of the train lines doesn't feel safe. The location is more like Chinatown/Tribeca/Soho. Canal street is a mess. However, Tribeca and Soho can be fun for shopping and restaurants. For site seeing (museums, UN, Theater, Rockefeller Center, Central Park etc) we spent a lot of time on trains and taxis. The hotel itself is just okay. The staff vary from the bellhops which were wonderful to the front desk which was rude and hopeless. We booked a suite and asked that they have the queen sofa bed made when we arrived. When we arrived I double checked and was told it was fine. It wasn't. On the 3rd night it was finally made. The suite is actually not a suite so much as a sizeable room with a king bed and queen sofabed. If I were to do it again, I would go back to the Lucerne or one of the hotels that has true suites. I should say the air conditioning here was great for a NYC summer, the room amenities were very good and that Sheraton bed is great (the sofabed was not). We are loyal SPG fans, but sometimes it pays to look elsewhere and this hotel is not worth the cost. Also the large groups staying there meant the noise from halls was a pain if you are trying to sleep. The lobby is packed all of the time. My one serious recommendation if you stay here.

We were in NYC to search for an apartment and so were pretty busy and stressed out. We wanted a place that was central to lower Manhattan while also an oasis from the city stress. As longtime SPG members we decided to try this new hotel. I reserved a club level king via SPG and was able to easily contact the hotel. We were having a few items shipped to us at the hotel and needed to coordinate with the desk. Everything arrived and was held for us! Check In: Check in could have been better. This property has been slammed with business since its opening with a host of difficulties that I hoped would have been smoothed out by the time we arrived. But when I walked in at 6pm to be told \"hang on while we find a room for you\" when I had a reservation booked for several weeks did not make me feel secure. It all worked out quickly and we were on our way up. Please note that the bellman didn't even offer to help us take our bags upstairs. Room: The room was small but quite well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable, and even though we were near the elevators I had no problems with hallway noise or sleeping. Immediately upon check in engineering came up with our refrigerator (free, you just have to ask) and a \"Gym in a Bag\", which was a fabulous idea - mat, foam roller, exercise tubing, and a massager. The only thing we really missed in the room was a safe. There is only a safe at the front desk, not in the rooms. Club Lounge: The Club Lounge is lovely and the view from the deck is stunning. The concierges on duty were always pleasant and attentive. The Food & Beverage service, however, was lacking. Every afternoon we had the same food - samosas, some kind of sausage in pastry, fried artichokes, and various crudite. Breakfast was a bit better. The printer and fax didn't work in the Club Lounge, so anytime I needed to print or fax it was a trip down to the lobby. Room Service: We ordered room service on 3 nights, and it was consistently good food and service. Portions were HUGE! WIFI: Wifi sucked for the first day or two, but them smoothed out. Be aware that even if you have a \"Free Wifi\" Club Room you will need to check your bill for wifi charges. Checkout: Check out was pretty smooth, except for the previously mentioned wifi charges. We have 2 laptops, 2 blackberries, 2 kindles, and an ipad. Every single day we were charged for each device connected at $9.95 per device - that's $70 a day! Plus we had been charged for a phone call we didn't make (I never use hotel room phones; it's cheaper to pay roaming!). In the end our stay was great and the hotel served as a nice refuge from the city while giving us the space and support to get work done.

Location's decent - a 6-minute walk to the Subway, and plenty of little shops & restaurants also within walking distance. The Starbucks in the lobby is nice and the staff were helpful (as was the in-room Starbucks coffee and - almost a rarity - milk creamers!) It would have been nice to have mini fridges in the rooms, though. The bartender in the lobby lounge was quite nice - he gave me some snack mix even though I wasn't drinking - just waiting for my friends for dinner and lightly complained of hunger. Check-in staff were efficient and friendly. When I accidentally left the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door before heading out for the day, I got back and called the front desk for certain supplies. They were brought up promptly, and I appreciated that. Negatives: No real big negatives. There was a spot of something that looked like blood on the pure white duvet cover. There was no luggage rack in the room. The gym was nice but did not appear to have any free weights (not that I ended up using the gym - no time). The elevators were slow at peak times and once I could not get on one and had to wait another 6 minutes for the next one. It would have been nice to have two boxes of Kleenex (one in the bathroom and one outside in the room itself). The pillows were awful - some sort of foam material that felt like it was smothering my head - could not sleep the first night. I then requested down pillows and it seemed to help, although still not perfect. The decor was \"bland-modern\". The shower was nice and the toiletries were of good quality. I liked the full-length mirror beside the wardrobe. I heard there is some sort of open terrace on a upper floor, but I didn't get to see it.

The first time we got such a small room, that there was no space to move, unpack, or anything. Literally, this was the smallest room I have ever had in NY, including Four Point by Sheraton Chelsea... The reason we got such a small room as Starwood Platinum was that we checked in early, requested a quiet room and there were no better rooms, and to do room change in the afternoon the front desk made it soo complicated, that it did not work out. So if you do need to check in early, make sure you are getting the room you like, rather that bother with the room change later. It is better to drop your bags, and check in later when usually better selection of rooms is available. To be fair the agent who checked us in, did try to arrange to move us to a better room, but the new shift was less than forthcoming with the move. The following morning the agent confided she could not sleep for putting us in such a small room. Two subsequent times we were allocated a much larger room, and the experience was much much better. Those rooms had Canal St orientation, and window insulation was good, the noise did not bother the sleep, and a bonus was a fabulous view of midtown as well as over Soho. The hotel gives a complimentary access to Club lounge for Starwood Platinums. They do have some cheeses, appetizers in the evening and some not very impressive breakfast spread. Please see a picture of available drinks in the lounge. I find it strange that having invested in the lounge, nicely furnished it, hotel does not bother to take drinks out of their cartons before stocking the fridge... It is also worth mentioning that the lounge is connected to an open-air terrace with amazing views as well. The location of the hotel makes it a good option for someone needing to be in financial district or Soho, Tribeca areas.

We told him we needed a cab later and he talked us into taking one of the town cars out front.

We asked several times if he was SURE there wouldn't be any other charges. Once again we were reassured there were no hidden costs. We decided to go with it as it seemed the Sheraton was endorsing it. We also made sure the driver knew ahead of time we were going to two different terminals. When we arrived at the first terminal and my friend was getting her baggage out the driver told us we owed him $65 for the ride to the airport and another $15 to go to another terminal. We told him we weren't paying him anything extra as we had already negotiated the price with the bellman. He told us he didn't care what the bellman said, we owed him more.

The club level observation deck has a beautiful view and the continental breakfast exceeded our expectations. The room was clean, and while not exceptionally big, it was modern and had a great view. The shower was great and the water pressure was perfect. The Sheraton Tribeca is located on the border of Tribeca and Soho. There is lots of shopping to be had on Broadway, which is only 4 or so blocks away. Walking distance to Chinatown and Little Italy make for a nice visit as well. If you are a vegetarian, there is a place called 'Dojo' at 14 W 4th St(Btwn Bway & Mercer St). They have an excellent Soy Burger dinner with a soy burger patty, salad and brown rice for 5.25.. Thats right, only 5 bucks, unheard of for a dinner/lunch in Manhatten. Its a casual sit down place that also serves beer/ liquor. If you are looking to save money on your stay at the Sheraton Tribeca, there are some great options. If you need a quick snack, there is a cheap deli next door with everything from pizza, to sandwiches, subs and more. On the corner of W. Broadway and Canal there is a Bodega where you can buy beer to bring to your room if you dont want to spend crazy money on booze at the bars or club. If you have club-level access you can bring your drinks up to the 21st floor observation deck and enjoy the sights and sound of the city in style. If I had one complaint, it would be this. I booked my trip on Priceline.com and was supposed to get a Deluxe King room, with Club Level access. On check in there was no mention of the club access and when I tried to access the 21st floor for the club lounge I was denied entry and had to call down and explain to them my situation. They were happy to help, and looked up my reservation, and confirmed that I was indeed supposed to have that access, so Im not sure why it was missed in the first place. It caused some embarrassment, as I booked the room as a surprise for my girlfriends birthday and when the key card didnt work to the club lounge, the surprise was cut short and spoiled as we had to back to the room to call the front desk. Thats a small thing I guess overall, and my suggestion would be to make sure inadvance that they know you have club level access if you book through an outside source. It will save yourself some time/ embarrassment/ hassle.

However, I then sat for over 15 minutes without my food arriving. I did not get told by the server that there was any particular issue or delay in the kitchen.

I have no idea how long he waited for his!), I got up from my seat and walked over to the host area and asked if he was the manager.

I then asked for an explanation regarding why the order took so long AND why I was being given potatoes when I ordered fruit instead. This server was not the one who had taken my order, so she looked surprised and said she would return with it fixed. I then waited several more minutes, and it arrived. The manager then returned to the table to give me the most lame explanation, he said that the kitchen supports several areas of the hotel (room service, some club, etc.) as if that was supposed to make me feel better. I then said that it was shocking that it took 20 minutes to get an omelette when there was only me and one other person in the restaurant, he then repeated his previous explanation that the kitchen supports more than just the main restaurant. I then suggested that maybe there is not enough staff to which he responded by saying there are 2 chefs and this is the right amount and lack of staff is not the explanation. He then said he would comp the meal (would have been shocked at this point if he had not done so). The further upset was that although the omelette and fruit were ok -- nothing to write home about! -- the toast was burned! As I left the restaurant, I told him that I left the burnt toast and that I would be going to write this up on Tripadvisor.

The shower fixture was designed in such a way as to require one to blast oneself with cold water before arriving at the required temp, and the bath towels were rough and nearly as skimpy as the hand towels. Also, the toiletries provided are sub par. To have your linens replaced you have to have read one of the many in-room memos posted about the room, which state that this is only done upon special request.

This is unfortunate, since the decor -- a kind of heavy modernist/wood retro thing -- would benefit from a bit softer atmosphere. The current low room rates ($250 is the least expensive rate offered on the hotel's web site) are tempting, but as I discovered, that rate will only get you an extremely small room that's barely big enough to accommodate the king-size bed, too small for two people to do anything other than sleep and jostle to get by each other while en route to the bathroom or the tiny armoire which is the hotel's version of a closet in that size of room. So I opted to upgrade to their \"studio suite\", which was nothing more than a normal sized room -- and for that was forced to pay over $500, a rate that could have gotten us into a dozen other far more comfortable and appealing hotels in Manhattan which don't feel like a chain hotel. Oddly Sheraton has put the \"studio suite\" on each floor not in a corner but in the middle of the main hallway right next to the Coke machine + ice machine, enabling one to hear hallway conversations through the relatively thin door. Once in the \"studio suite\", I discovered that the bathroom fan was so noisy, and triggered by the bathroom light, that it might awaken your companion if you visited the bathroom while he/she was sleeping, and that using the internet cost another $25 per day. The windows were double-glazed, but traffic noise was still noticeable. The overly active HVAC unit was too efficient, streaming out cool air if you wanted only to lower the temperature a degree or two, or hot air if you wanted just to slightly warm it up. But somehow that went along with the clunky room furniture, which was upholstered to look like it was designed to withstand annual conventions of professional wrestlers. This isn't a hotel with any subtlety. Its use of space and choice of decor is tolerable only for short stays by those who don't plan to do anything in their room except sleep.

Let me tell you, most bartenders only want to get you drunk or suck up to you to get a nicer tip. This kid let me tell you is not like that. My wife, and I had lunch at the bar and were planning our day when he came and started telling us all the best places in New York. From museums, to the best broadway play. He told us the secrets for getting around the city fast and easy, and saved my wife and I a lot of time planning our day out. HE WAS MORE HELPFUL THEN THE CONCIERGE! He makes amazing drinks, and has a personality that very hard to come by in New York. Also the front desk manager steven is amazing! He is super friendly, and the General Manager is friendly as well. He approached my wife and I and we spoke briefly for about 3 minutes. So long story short, I will be bringing my family back here for many more years to come.
