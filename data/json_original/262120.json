After a full day of airport delays and mishaps, imagine our relief to pull up tot the San Regis and be welcomed home, as only Jean Francois and his staff can do so well. A SLH member, I expected only the best from the San Regis, and they certainly delivered. Arriving late in the evening, my travel partner and I were immediately taken to our rooms to freshen up while dinner reservations were completely arranged for us at L'Avenue. Due to our association with the hotel, L'Avenue rolled out the red carpet and made every effort to accomodate. We enjoyed a wonderful meal, a short walk to look at a sparkling Tour Effiel, then promptly fell into the immaculate room, exhausted and happy. In the morning we were treated to a fabulous breakfast while we languished in our fluffy robes and slippers scented with Hermes toiletries. How did they know they are my favourite? Our only possible disappointment was noise caused by construction on the street below, which was not the fault of the hotel by any means, but this is a big city and these things will happen. I hope the construction is complete because we have booked another trip to Paris in October and we will stay at the San Regis once more. We look forward to enjoying the expert care the staff provides and the luxury of the beautiful place we now call home in Paris.

Although only a block and a half away from the Champs Elysees, it is on a quiet side street, thus providing the advantage of a central location without street noise. The public areas and hallways of the hotel are decorated beautifully. My room was a good size (I think I was upgraded to a junior suite, with a separate sitting area - the only disadvantage of this layout was that the TV could be seen while sitting on the armchairs in the sitting area but not while lying in bed). I chose this hotel specifically because I wanted a hotel with modern conveniences, but with a decor that immediately told me I was in Paris and not in some anonymous business location anywhere in the world, and the hotel fulfilled this requirement totally. If you prefer a hotel that is identifiable only as 2008 anywhere in the world, this is not the hotel for you. However, if, on the other hand, you want a hotel that could only be in Paris, but still has all the modern necessities (and toiletries from Hermes!), at a price that is not exorbitant but far from cheap, then definitely consider the San Regis.", "Date": "Aug 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR531108060", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "londoner-wannabe"}, {"Content": "Quaint small luxury Hotel I just returned from a 4 night stay at the San Regis. I can not begin to tell everyone how wonderful the experience was. This was a surprise trip for my wife and not being familar with Paris I recieved alot of help from Jean-Francois, the concierge, in arranging everything. From tour guides, to transportation, to restaurant reservations to help in finding different places he was a tremendous asset to us. I can honestly say Jean-Francois was the reason our trip was so enjoyable with so little stress, he took care of everything for us with the greatest of skill, and I can also say I am a rather particular person, so pleasing me is not an easy task.The rooms are a shade small as compared to US Standards unless you get into a junior suite or better. Then they are not only lavish, but quite spacious. The soaps and shampoos are all Hermes, very nice touch.The breakfasts were great and tasty, had to stop my wife from sliding a few of the jams into her purse. She is still raving about them. We did not have any other meals at the Hotel.The location is grea just off Montaigne and behind the Grand Palais, most of the Paris sights are easily walkable. The location cannot be better suited for a nice romantic time in Paris.The Hotel itself is nicely appointed but I must say what seperates it from the others we have stayed at around the world was the staff. No need was left unattended and in those rare occasions were we encountered a staff member who did not speak english they were quick in bringing over someone who did. They were all very polite and more than eager to tend to any need or question that arose.We had a flight cancelled and wished to return back to Paris as we could not get one until the next day. We recieved an upgrade to a suite on the Hotel for this night. This was very gracious and appreciated.Overall I can say that for a nice, romantic setting in Paris this Hotel is a great value, dont read this as inexpensive but rather a great value for the dollar/euro you will spend. A better value than the Ritz or Athenee in our opinion.SGR NYC, USA", "Date": "Jul 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR735790340", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "parsnickety67"}, {"Content": "Great Stay at San Regis We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Hotel San Regis and we had an absolutely wonderful time.

We stayed in the San Regis as part of a package with the Orient Express. As such we expected it to be a high standard, luxury hotel. For the most part, it didn't disappoint. The staff were very friendly and helpful on our arrival, going to lengths to try to book a table for us (unsuccessfully) at a popular restaurant. I must admit one or two of the staff at other times in our stay were not so forthcoming.We had been booked into a deluxe room which the hotel upgraded for us (to a suite, I guess) and we were delighted that the room was ready for us when we arrived at 10:30am. The room - no 34 - was very large, with a three-part bathroom, loads and loads of storage wardrobes and large area with sofa, chair and table, as well as desk, dresser etc. The view was out to the back of the hotel onto some offices which was not very picturesque but did mean it was quiet at night. The shower in the bath wouldn't rotate onto a fine spray but stayed on the sort of 'jet' setting.Continental breakfast (included in our rate) was adequate: delicious fresh orange juice, tea/coffee, and a croissant, roll, pain au chocolat and sponge cake per person. For any hot extras you had to pay.The lift is absolutely tiny and you will struggle to get more than two people into it, or even two people with luggage or bags of any kind.Our low point was when my wife wanted to iron her shirt before going out and we rang down to reception to ask for an iron to be sent to the room. They clearly don't have a policy on this because they said they would ring us back, and then did so, and told us we could have an iron in our room for \u9227?0! Given that (a) the most basic corporate bog standard business hotel in the UK has an iron in every room, and (b) the suite we were in cost around \u9227?00-\u9227?00 per night, I thought this was an absolute rip-off. Needless to say, we declined.Overall the San Regis is a lovely hotel, in a good area close to the Champs Elysees and within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Jardin des Tuileries etc. But it's not perfect (which it should be at the prices) and they need to ease up a little on the money-grubbing for extras.", "Date": "Apr 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR205496781", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JohnSelf"}, {"Content": "Very French - perfect for our anniversary!
