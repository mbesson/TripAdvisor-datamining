The first room was tiny and the ceiling sloped so much that at one end of the room it was 8 feet tall at the other end 5 feet. The bathroom was sizeable and well fitted out. The problem was twofold. The air conditioning was broken and the window opened onto the interior atrium which meant that there was no fresh outside air to help. The temperature in the room reached 28 degrees. I asked the staff at reception to fix it but they shrugged and said it was not a hot day and then they turned their backs on me and started to deal with another customer. I got their attention again and they said they would fix the day. Two sleepless nights later I asked to be moved to another room and they said they were full. I asked the evening reception if they had a spare room for a friend and was told they were only half full so no problem! after an email from my company they moved me to another room which was much better and had the sea-view. The bar is very expensive the food only average but breakfast was good and plentiful. There was a noisy party one night that went on late. It is also worth mentioning that the hotel is someway out of central Istanbul and not suitable for tourist sightseeing I would not go back here again.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location\u201d", "Author": "damien h", "ReviewID": "UR123397719", "Content": "Excellent location on the Bosporus.

Located in Sariyer district, it is 45-60 minutes from the airport and 30-45 minutes from the central districts of Taksim and Sultanahmet. However, it is the only hotel in the area and it's not bad. The rooms are tiny and lacking amenities, the walls are thin, and the staff has limited English. On the other hand, it is right on the Bosphorus so there are lovely views and walks nearby, and it's near a ferry terminal if you want a quick cruise up to the Black Sea coast.

We wanted somewhere with character and minimal hassle, and felt that to be exactly what it was. The public rooms of the hotel are simply beautiful, making it one of the most amazing we have ever been to, and our bedroom was attractive though idiosyncratic. We had a view of the Bosphorus, and loved being able to watch the ferries, the fishing boats, and all the other traffic on the water. There was noise from the road, but we did not find it too bad. (One might do so if one were sensitive.) As for the internet, we had the strongest and most reliable wireless signal that we have ever had in a hotel (and we do a lot of travelling), so no problem there. It is the case that the hotel is a long way from the centre of Istanbul. We enjoyed being able to get away from the crowds, but others might find this a disadvantage. On the other hand, there were taxis nearby and it did not take long to get to the Metro.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Potomac, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cHow many things can go wrong?\u201d", "Author": "trustscholar", "ReviewID": "UR97387551", "Content": "Got here and the internet wasn't working (ultimately they fixed it--but the first person they sent to my room was clueless--they had to reset the router).

The refrigerator in the minibar is broken (so that I can't put my own sodas in). The attachment for the shower head--the part that holds the spray in place--is broken, so that you can only take a shower holding the spray. The breakfast was rather spare.

But all these were addressed and resolved for my second night stay. Because of the convenient location I decided to give the Fuat Pasa a second chance, but it will not get a third chance! We booked into the best rooms and they really are quite large and sumptious - most impressive. However, the bedspread had been 'honeymooned ' on - we were told it was probably spilled pasta sauce - the floor was dirty and during the night I had to kill various insects on the bathroom floor in order to get to the toilet. The restaurant is mediocre and very, very expensive (600% + mark-up on wines), but the view across the Bosphorus is very pretty. Despite the problems I would probably have returned for a third visit, if necessary, but the bill we were presented with at checkout was enormous - far larger than I had expected. I was told that I had 'misunderstood' the pricing scheme and was being charged in Euros, not Turkish Lira, despite the prices being displayed iin reception n Turkish Lira. They threatened us with the tourist police, and retained my husband residence and work permit - only to be returned when we paid. My husband finally gave in and settled the bill. If you are tempted to stay at the Fuat Pasa, ask to see the room first, and be absolutely sure that you know the cost - get them to write it down for you. Personally, I think two chances are sufficient and I will not be tempted again.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Izmir, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cImpressive building, but not the rooms or the service\u201d", "Author": "Bahadir", "ReviewID": "UR14905250", "Content": "This is a beautiful historical building right on the side of Bosphorus. However the rooms are quite simple and do not match up with the rest of the grandeur. I could not close the curtains fully, and the traffic from outside was very noisy so it was not easy to sleep. Beds were basic and not so comfortable. The bathroom was ok, and hot water was no problem. Breakfast however was nice, and especially having breakfast with Bosphorus views was quite enjoyable. There was a very old man in the reception, wo did not seem very friendly. When I got there it was late, and I asked how I could get my short ironed. There was no dry cleaning service at that time and there was no iron or iron board available (very typical of Turkish hotels, they don't give you the iron as they want you to spend your money in their dry cleaning service, but then the service is not always available). Finally problem was resolved by the very friendly bell boy (I think they should promote him to reception). Furthermoe, this hotel is not quite central (I mean far from historical peninsula or from Taksim), you need at least half an hour taxi ride for any of those attractions. I would probably go back there to eat food in their restaurant just for the views, but not to stay in the hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fuat Pasa Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d315123-Reviews-Fuat_Pasa_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$100*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "315123", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/daodao/photo-s/02/1e/d6/c6/caption.jpg"}}
