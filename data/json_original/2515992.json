It has a soothing breakfast room and bar in tasteful blues and whites and a random collection of pricey shops in the lobby. It also had an ATM which is handy for this part of town. I worried it was an all skirt and no knickers place (i.e. an all show hotel which would have dated rooms and fusty furniture in the rooms) but was surprised by recent room refreshments which meant they were classic but sharp looking. The bed was ecstasy. If you like them soft you will find it hard to prize yourself out of bed to explore the city. The bathroom was lovely with thick towels, short sleeve robes (I mention this because am I the only one that finds long sleeves a complete chore on robes?!) and good Lab products. It's not chic, it's not contemporary but it's really charming and staff are good. Nob Hill is slightly irritating as its a long up hill climb from either the city centre or the piers but the views are great and it's a proper San Fran experience to stairmaster your way up.

We've stayed at Fairmont hotels all over the world before, and they had always exceeded our expectations. Unfortunately, the Fairmont San Francisco did not continue that trend. It started with our arrival on a Thursday around 4pm. A storm was blowing in rapidly, and our taxi driver unloaded our many bags into the driveway. (We were at the tail end of a 2.5 week trip that included our wedding -- so we had a lot of luggage.) There was not a bellman or a cart to be seen, and with the weather threatening, we couldn't just wait for one to appear. With great difficultly we brought all of our bags in through the single door (that needed to be held open -- how is this ADA compliant?) Once we made it to the check-in desk, we were told that we would have a tower room on the 4th floor. We had specifically requested a tower room on a high floor (and had let them know it was our honeymoon). When I asked about the view, and if we could get something higher, I was told that all tower rooms have excellent views and anyways that there was an amenity waiting for us in our room, so we couldn't change it. He then (possibly jokingly) asked if we had all of our bags, or if we had left any on the curb. He didn't offer to call a bellman to help us with our bags, and he didn't congratulate us or make mention of the fact we were on our honeymoon in anyway other than the comment about the amenity. He did mention that we should check out the Tonga Room during our stay, but that it was closed for a private party that night. We went up to our room, and while the view was very nice, it was very clear that the view would be incredible. Also, there wasn't an amenity waiting for us as the man at the front desk had suggested. I called down to the front desk to see if it would be possible to change rooms. I spoke with the Front Desk Manager, told her we had requested a room on a high floor and that we were on our honeymoon. She said she would look to see what options were available and call me back. When she called back, she told me there were fully booked and no other options were available for that night, but we could move the next day to a higher floor. She told us we should leave our packed bags in the room and while we were out, they would be moved to our new room. (FYI \u2013 the amenity \u2013 a bottle of champagne and two chocolate covered strawberries did eventually arrive with a nice note from the manager. This was very, very nice, but the only personal touch or acknowledgement of our honeymoon we received during our stay.) The next morning, we re-packed everything before leaving at 7:45am for a tour of Muir Woods (it was awesome - check out my other review). We ended up spending the whole day out, and didn't return to the hotel until 10:30pm. We went to the Front Desk to get the room number and key for our new room, and there was total confusion. We were asked if we had multiple reservations and where we had put our bags. The clerk made several calls asking if anyone had picked up or seen our bags. She disappeared to the back room several times. After about 20 minutes, she gave us our new room keys, sent us up to our new room, and assured us our bags would be right behind us. I was very skeptical (and really tired), but we went upstairs. The view from the 19th floor was AMAZING. And surprisingly, our bags did appear about a half hour later. I still have no idea where they were all day. While the view was great, the room (I believe 1900), was not. We were right by the elevators, and it was one of the most noisy hotel rooms I stayed in. The elevator sounded liked a helicopter and was constant. The HVAC system made a strange clicking noise that sounded very much like the door being unlocked (which was unnerving). The room was beautiful at first glance, but upon closer look could really use some updating. The veneer on the furniture was falling off. There was mold in the shower. We decided to check out the Tonga Room on Sunday night. The concierge couldn't get us a reservation, but told us we should just go down there. We did, and the host practically laughed at us when we told him we didn't have a reservation, and then promptly sent us on our way. We asked the concierge for another recommendation that would have a vegetarian option, and they were stumped. The only suggestion he could offer was the Nob Hill Cafe (which we had already dined at), so we told him we'd find something on yelp. On our check out day, we had a maid enter our room (without knocking) at 8am. Granted we didn't have the \"do not disturb\" sign, but 8am still seems really early! At 11am, we had to wait 45 minutes (and make a follow-up call) to have a bellman come help us with our bags. In summary, we were completely unimpressed with the service -- from the front desk staff to the bellman to housekeeping to the concierge to the restaurant host. I would have expected better from a Motel 6. There were several large groups at the hotel during our stay, and they dominated the common areas (and apparently the attention of the staff). I'm sure if you were part of one of the groups, your experience would have been much better. We were treated like an afterthought. In a city with a number of beautiful hotels, next time I would certainly pick one that caters to individual travelers and not just large groups.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Central Location\u201d", "Author": "kladis", "ReviewID": "UR128493097", "Content": "We stayed at the Fairmont Nobb Hill for 3 nights prior to moving on to Napa.

The reason we checked out early is also the reason I can\u2019t give this hotel five stars. The tower suites are magnificent suites, my only issue with them is that while they are not all created equal, they are all priced equal. When booking we requested a high floor which was important to me, in part because it is a nicer view in general, and also because I had a particular photo time lapse project of the bay and the bridge in mind. They had us on the 6th floor, one of the lowest floors with a tower suite. I had hoped having a 6 night stay might give our high floor request some preference, but that was not the case. We were earlier in the afternoon, and I offered that we could check our bags and come back later if they are still getting some of the higher floor rooms ready but that wasn\u2019t the case. I then hope to salvage something from our stay by asking if we could take the 6th floor room for a few nights and transfer to a higher floor later in our 6 night stay. Our very friendly check in agent spent a lot of time with us but said that all the higher tower suite rooms were \u2018locked\u2019 and he couldn\u2019t switch any of them around. After talking with a manager he even got the keys to our suite and a very nice upgraded suite in the main building to offer us a choice. The upgrade suite was huge, even larger than the tower suite, but basically on the same equivalent floor, so it didn\u2019t improve the view which is what I was hoping for. Since all the higher suites were locked we didn\u2019t really have a choice, it was the 6th floor or nothing. Our 6th floor suite was still very nice and had all the amenities of other tower suites except the view, we did not have a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. My own estimation is that you would have to be on a floor in the teens or higher to get a good view of the bridge. With 23 floors in the tower this would probably include over half of the tower suites, but definitely not all of them. While I\u2019ve long been aware that not all hotel guest are equal (some requests were able to \u2018lock\u2019 rooms for all 6 days while my reservation was not able to), it would seem very reasonable to price different rooms differently. I would have paid more to get a room that met my requirements, and ended up feeling overcharged for a room that did not. With that basic complaint out of the way let me list all the great aspects of the hotel that still merits it getting a four star review. ARRIVAL Let me start with the booking process. If you\u2019re contemplating booking this hotel, and are not already a member of their President\u2019s Club, just sign up. It is free, and starting with this stay you\u2019ll get complimentary high-speed Internet, complimentary use of the on-site gym (both are services they charge for here to the chagrin of many reviewers) and express check-in. Arriving in the portico is quite an experience, the front of the hotel is covered with a detailed Terra-cotta exterior draped with flags from around the world, and mammoth Corinthian marble columns. The lobby was stunning. Renovated to accent its 1907 design and grandeur, the floor is alabaster marble, and marble columns and gold accents would make any silver magnate feel at home. I already mentioned how friendly the check in agent was spending over a half hour with us trying to accommodate our request. But everyone we met from housekeeping to the Laurel Court staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, a very worldly and well trained staff. THE HOTEL The hotel really is the Grand Dame of San Francisco hotels. It may show its age (usually in a good way) in some parts, but it has been renovated regularly and is a first class hotel by any measure. If you insist on a very modern hotel the Four Seasons or the Mandarain will likely be more your cup of tea, but if you appreciate classic hotels like the Del Corando, The Grand Hotel, or the Stanley, you\u2019ll love the San Francisco Fairmont. Just as important the service is what you would expect from a top hotel. The walls are decorated with pictures of celebrities that have visited over the years and range from Obama to Truman. The rooftop garden is a very pleasant surprise. It really is the hotel\u2019s own little oasis complete with a fountain, palm trees and benches in the middle of one the world's busiest cities. Lastly if you like history and get a chance poke your head into the Venetian Ballroom. While a who\u2019s-who of celebrities once entertained here, I liked to stand and envision being one of the lucky few who sat at a table and watch Tony Bennett audition \u2018I Left My Heart in San Francisco\u2019 in this very room. This would not be anyone's idea of a budget hotel, but if budget is your primary concern you\u2019ll probably end up staying somewhere other than Nob Hill. CONCIERGE I had seen travel programs that indicated the Fairmont had Tom Wolfe, who was the first concierge in the nation, but assumed he would have been long since retired. Not so... he is here and has been since 1973. When we ran into him on our way out one morning he very graciously stood for a picture with my wife and myself. Yes, everyone here was very friendly.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRipe off.\u201d", "Author": "Traveler49er62", "ReviewID": "UR127493354", "Content": "Revisiting our honeymoon hotel from 20 years ago. Was promised they would do everything to have our stay special. Apon arriving, found the room we requested unavailable. With apology, an inspection of two rooms settled in room on the 9th floor..11 floors lower than what we had requested. Just alright with that, continued to enjoy our weekend getaway. After parking our car in the hotels garage we found out without notification from staff that parking was $62 per day. Continuing on trying to enjoy our anniversary weekend we tried to log on the wireless Internet that was offered but wasnt told that there would be a charge of $14 a day. So at this point we are wondering if we could wash our hands, use a towel, or even use the toilet without being charged. So unless you are willing to blow your money or here on business ready for your company to blow their money, I would not recommend this hotel. The room was common, the bed below standard, the tv small in today's world. The best features of the room was the view and the bathroom. Unfortunately you didn't get the view in the bathroom. So maybe if they can change that so that the bathroom could be the main room with the view it wouldnt feel as bad to be ripped off.

It's such a standard hotel thing, so it is really bizarre that they've chosen not to provide this one amenity. It was actually annoying.

We were planning a special weekend to celebrate an anniversary, and after a recent visit to SF where I wasn\u2019t convinced that we should stay in the SoMa and Union Square areas. The Fairmont San Francisco is only a few blocks away, but feels a world apart. The stunning building is a beauty to see, especially lit up at night! Walking into the majestic lobby felt special every time we returned to the hotel \u2013 lots of history was made here! There was no line for check-in, and it was friendly and efficient \u2013 we were off to our room within minutes. We stayed in the Tower Building, a short walk from the lobby but home to some of the best views in the hotel, as it extends more than 20 floors \u2013 much higher than the historic building. If you have the option for a discounted upgrade during booking or check-in, it\u2019s definitely worth it to upgrade to this tower since the views are extraordinary from atop the hill \u2013 much better than anything I\u2019ve experienced at the Westin, W, or St. Regis during previous stays in the city. I used one of my Fairmont upgrade certificates for this stay. The rooms have great bathrooms \u2013 we like the new Rose toiletries that Fairmont has switched to. The living areas are traditional and well-furnished - representative of the \u201ccasual luxury\u201d that Fairmont is known for. The bed was extremely comfortable. The fitness centre is well equipped with modern equipment \u2013 and a steam and sauna. I would have liked for it to be open past 7pm on the weekends, but we had evening plans anyways! Signing up for free with Fairmont\u2019s Presidents Club program gets you free Internet and the option of getting a reebok gym outfit to use during your stay. We had a great breakfast at Laurel Court on Sunday \u2013 it was reasonably priced at $30 and I was happy that they had gluten free options! If you feel like an adventure, go down to Market Street to Dottie's True Blue Cafe - where we went on Saturday. I'd agree that it's the best breakfast in San Francisco, but it's a pretty sketchy area - we were harassed by at least 5 people walking down the street. We arrived by 8am to avoid a 1+ hour wait. The Tongo room in the basement looked like a really unique place to dine \u2013 we didn\u2019t get a chance to make it down there. For a special dinner, head 2 blocks away to Keiko a Nob Hill \u2013 one of the best meals of my life and very reasonable for the quality of food you will get ($85 for 7 course tasting menu) A lot of people mentioned the parking costs, so I planned to return my rental after dropping off luggage, but Avis nearby didn't allow after-hours rentals. If you have a rental car and arrive too late to return it before the morning, there is garage just one block up California which is $34 for 12 hours.

The front desk gentleman and the bell service were very polite and helpful with our needs and questions. We were booked in the Tiburon Suite which was amazing! The room was huge with a corner view of the city, we could see the bay bridge as well as the Golden Gate from the 20th floor. The room came equipped with a telescope so you could read even the street signs far below and plan our route to Chinatown. This view was so wonderful that I never turned on the 2 flat screen TV's, opting to only enjoy the beautiful city instead. The bathroom was nicely appointed in marble and granite. The towels were great, the robes were great, the bed was comfy. Their were 2 air temp control buttons in the room, 1 for the living room and 1 for the bedroom. There was a mini bar which we did not use but no fridge to add our own items. If needed, I'm sure the hotel would have brought us one. We dined in the Laurel Court Restaurant and Bar twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast. The staff was engaging and very polite. The food was very good on both occasions. For breakfast one day I sent my husband to the El Centro cafe for pastries and coffee and it was good also. We used the Hertz service to get a rental car for a day to head out to wine country. I thought the gas rates were crazy, gas costs $1 higher in San Francisco than home but that was not Hertz or the Fairmont's fault of course. They brought the car straight to the hotel garage and we had to return it to a place 6 blocks up the street and catch a taxi back,(don't poke fun of me for not walking 6 streets, it's all up a steep hill!) it's a shame they didn't offer a ride back to the hotel considering what we paid for the rental car ($127 including gas.) Don't park at the hotel because they want $62.50 per night for parking! The lobby and the walls of photos and history were beautiful and interesting.

One was new and had no experience, the other wasn't interested in helping us nor did he seem to know much about SF restaurants. We were shocked at the lack of service provided. We ended up doing everything on our own and even got in to a restaurant that both concierges said we'd never get in. The guest room itself was small, stuffy, and smelled bad.

This visit I wanted to spoil myself and splurge on a nice weekend at a grand San Francisco hotel. At 106 year old, The Fairmont is the Grande Dame of San Francisco and was the obvious choice. I wasn\u2019t disappointed! I reserved a main bldg 2 room suite for a 3 day weekend get away, Feb 24-27. I found the rates reasonable for what you got and the location, for a suite I paid $390 + 55 tax per night. The hotel upgraded me to a Tower Suite on the 23rd floor. The views were incredible. No hotel in San Francisco can come close to views from The Fairmont Tower. Period. Views of The Golden Gate, Alcatraz, Coit Tower, The TransAmerica Pyramid, the Bay Bridge and the entire skyline. Sunrises and sunsets are amazing. Each room has a telescope to see the sights. From my suite I could even see what people were drinking at The Top of The Mark. The suite was huge, beautifully decorated with a gorgeous marble bath. Everything in the room was in perfect order. I was able to check in early at noon and check out 2 hours late with no problem. Geoffrey, at the front desk was fantastic. The entire staff was friendly and eager to help. The lobby is incredible and the roof gardens are a sanctuary in the city. Every morning, I ate the breakfast buffet in the Laurel Court Restaurant. The food was very good with a lot of variety. The omelet chef even remembered what I liked after the first day. All my local friends joined me at the hotel for breakfast. At $30, it\u2019s a bargain and convenient. I doubt you could find brunch for less. Plus I never ate lunch because of my big breakfast. I also had room service twice for a late supper; the food was fast and tasty. The cost was no more than going out to eat and so much easier when your tired. I also took advantage of the spa and had a great massage. It\u2019s nice to spoil yourself. If you haven\u2019t been to SF, it is expensive. Everything is. If you don\u2019t need a car, don\u2019t bring one. Parking is not cheap. However the in/out valet parking at The Fairmont is cheaper than other Nob Hill hotels. The in/out privilege means you won\u2019t pay extra to actually use your car. You can rent a car for a day trip at the hotel or off Union Square for less than the price to park one. Cabs are generally available and reasonable but they can be hard catch away from the hotel district and slow to come when you call. You can reserved a Town Car though several services (like Quicksilver or Ubercar) for not much more than a cab and you have a guaranteed ride in style. Also get a Munipass so you don\u2019t pay $6 each time you ride the cable cars. You can catch all 3 cable car lines at The Fairmont, the only place in town they all cross. Take the California Cable Car down to the Ferry Building (the view is incredible) to shop and the catch the F line trolley to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf or to the Castro. Location is so important when you travel; The Fairmont is close to everything. The Fairmont is beautiful grand hotel from a different time where the staff takes pride in this grand icon of San Francisco and the privilege of working there.

Paid approximately $300 per night NOT including daily parking fee....I'll get to that. Overall it was a pleasant enough stay. The location was great. The lobby was beautiful. My check in was fast and easy. We got there very early and feared we wouldn't be able to check in for a few hours but they let us get our room at 11am. I think this exception was made bc I signed up for the \"President Members\" program or whatever it's called before my trip (it's free -do it if you are planning on staying at a Fairmont Hotel). My room wasn't as big as I thought it would be but according to seasoned San Fran travelers the Fairmont has some of the bigger rooms in the city. Even so, felt a tad cramped but this wasn't a big deal. Grief #1 - we had dinner reservations in town first night and needed a cab to take us there. Got down to lobby 20 minutes prior to reservation. It took the doorman exactly 20 minutes to get us a cab. A lined approximately 16 people deep formed (and I was close to the front of this line) and the Fairmont staff failed to get additional doormen or staff to assist the mounting line in getting their transportation. For a hotel with this type of service reputation I would assume management would act to triage the situation such as this. Sadly, nothing was fixed and the lone doorman was left fighting to get guests cars from the parking lot, greet arriving and returning guests as well as trying to flag down Taxis all at the same time. Needless to say we were late for our dinner but gladly our reservation was still honored. Grief # 2 - my wife and I went to the Laurel Court bar for a pre dinner drink the second evening. Making sure we didn't make the same mistake as last time, we arrived in the lobby a full hour prior to our dinner reservations. Well, wouldn't you know it took about 15 minutes to even place our drink order. Mind you there were only 5 other patrons in the bar....total. Next, after we got our drinks it took another 20 minutes for our waiter to even check on us. By now we had to get our check. Thankfully the check arrived quickly. I guess they wanted us out of there rather than serve us. I would have had another drink had the waiters cared to check on us. But I guess they were pretty busy chatting to each other behind and around the bar instead. Oh well. Grief # 3 - this one I can't really complain about but I am including it here for your education. It will cost you about $60 per day including taxes. Thankfully I had done my research first but had I not it would be safe to say I would have been a bit upset. This parking fee is a tiny little footnote that is hard to discover when booking a room here at the Fairmont. All in all I would say that while nobody at The Fairmont was mean, quite the contrary actually, I would classify some aspects of the operation as unprofessional. You can have a winning personality and a never ending smile but when you fail to take care of a paying customer it's still unprofessional. My only staff compliment goes to the parking garage attendants who were extremely professional and helpful at every moment. I found myself calling upon them for my car and going straight down to the garage instead of the front because my car was always waiting and they always had great recommendations and were very helpful and prompt. Kudos to whomever manages that part of your hotel operation. Otherwise, I received service overall comparable to a Holiday Inn. Wish I had paid Holiday Inn prices. Im not a traveler who complains about costs otherwise inwould have added Greif # 4 to $80 breakfast pricetag for 2 at Laurel Court restuarant at the Fairmont (i get over it bc it's an \"upscale\" hotel). But i do expect a certain level of professionalism to accompany the costs rather than just everyone being so nice. But hey, the location is great and apparently the rooms are bigger than most other hotels....so I've been told.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nederland, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "ThatGirl_77627", "ReviewID": "UR124978116", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay at The Fairmont...

Meant to be a luxurious end to our stay, but it was the biggest disappointment of the trip. Not outright bad, just a big disappointment. Firstly, we were greeted by a very rude valet parker. I prefer to self-park, not just a cost thing, but I still have all my faculties, so am capable of parking my car myself, plus I prefer the convenience of self-parking - come and go as you please. At the Fairmont, it's valet parking only, at the cost of $62 per day (the most expensive in the neighbourhood). At least they don't charge extra for the greeting we received from the valet - the rudeness comes for free! When we checked in, they didn't have the room we expected. When we had booked 6 months earlier and enquired about a family room, we were told to book a twin, which would have 2 queen beds, so would be OK if our 2 daughters were happy to share a queen bed. When we arrived, the receptionist said that not all twins had 2 queens, some had much narrower beds and this was all they could offer us. We requested a more suitable room, but we waited so long with no word that we gave up and headed out to explore Union Square (we only had limited time in San Francisco). By the time we came back that evening, it was too late to move rooms, so we accepted the solution of a rollaway bed for one of our daughters and stayed in the same room. Big mistake, as the guy in the adjoining room kept us up all night. The following morning, I spoke to the old guy at the concierge desk (reception was busy with checkouts), who promised to sort things out while we were out sightseeing - by arranging another room and/or speaking to the noisy neighbour - but when we returned that evening, nothing had happened, the front desk was completely unaware of our complaint. We persuaded them to arrange another room for us but, when we walked in to the room, there was a lady already there, just beginning to unpack her luggage! So back to square one. Throughout this, the front desk manager was determined not to give us a room that was in any way better than what we already had, which was why our options were so limited. It was only when I started to cause a scene - as my frustrations finally boiled over - that she at last found us a suitable room, this time in the tower. The room was ba lot smaller than our previous room, but much less tired, with 2 queen beds and with no noisy neighbours. So after more than a day of frustration, we at last had the level of room we thought we'd booked. At this point, the front desk manager suddenly became friendly and offered us something by way of apology, such as a bottle of wine. This wasn't really our priority, but she told us to think about it and let her know. The next day, we returned from our Alcatraz trip (and climb up Nob Hill) in need of refreshment. Therefore, instead of an expensive bottle of wine, we just asked reception for a pot of tea and a couple of cookies for our daughters. The manager from the previous day was not around and had not told her colleagues about the offer of apology, so the guy on the front desk was reluctant to help us. When he did eventually agree to send a pot of tea to our room, it took over an hour, because he forgot to tell the room service people. So any goodwill that this small gesture of apology should have generated was lost. We have stayed at many 5-star hotels and the staff usually make us feel like kings. Here, they made us feel like dirt, so we began to understand the 'Snob Hill' jokes of the tour guides. None of our complaints were treated seriously until I lost my cool, and I shouldn't have to do that on holiday. Nothing was ever passed from one member of staff to another, the communication was just dreadful. I would recommend sending the staff to some of the top Asian hotels, then they would really know the meaning of customer service. Now for the positives: (i) great location, if you like walking, it's 30 minutes to Fisherman's Wharf (at least with children), around 15 minutes to Union Square and convenient for the Hyde-Powell cable car; (ii) great views if you're in the right rooms; (iii) tower rooms a bit newer than the older wing; (iv) even if the rest of the hotel is tired, the lobby is very nice, especially at Christmas time.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cnice surroundings but annoying fan system\u201d", "Author": "KarlOA", "ReviewID": "UR123683078", "Content": "Stayed in the Calcuta suite - beautiful but the noise from the internal fan system was extremely annoying.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cImpressive lobby interiors if you're into old world gilded architecture\u201d", "Author": "IceQueen2013", "ReviewID": "UR123655463", "Content": "The room we stayed in is average for the price.

Well the good views of the bay are specific to the room you choose, (see room recommendation) I would recommend this Tower signature suite as it is a good size and had a fabulous bay view. Things to consider with the Fairmont are that is not ultra luxurious in terms of modern terms but is more of a grand dame, and has lots old world charm. I have read that some people say the large hallways are spooky but I think it gives the hotel all it's charm and if you realise this at the time of booking you cannot go wrong with this hotel. Housekeeping was great noticed no problems during our stay. We valet parked our car which is expensive at $50 a day but that is consistent with other hotels in San Fran, that said the valet staff were excellent and very helpful. We were still on UK time zones so I did coffee runs each morning to the onsite illy coffee store which is great and very convenient. Is located on on a very steep hill which is very pleasant to walk down but going up could be a problem for some. Has a tram stop right outside the coffee shop at the one corner of the building which is very convenient and should negate the need to walk up the hill as the trams are really great. Book here if you are looking to be removed from the hustle, also if you are are not on tight touring deadlines. Also do not expect all the new bells and whistles expected newer 5-4 star hotels.

Nob Hill is historic and feels like a neighbourhood where locals live. It's near enough to the shopping and restaurants in Union Square, but removed enough so that you don't encounter the noise, people traffic and bustle of downtown. There are churches, parks, historic buildings, and neighbourhood haunts to explore. There is also a historic pay-what-you-can guided walking tour that starts outside of the Renaissance and ends at the Fairmont itself. It's informative and gets you to look up and around the neighbourhood. The Fairmont is grand, without feeling cold, austere or trendy. Stay in the North Tower if you have a choice of rooms. I asked for a complementary upgrade as a loyalty program member, and graciously received an upgrade to the North Tower after sending out good vibes and a warm smile or two. The rooms look out onto the rooftop garden. I saw a wedding there my first afternoon. There is a business centre in the main building with computers and printers, but nothing extensive. You can print out your boarding pass and surf the 'Net, which is enough for most travellers' needs. I didn't visit the restaurants, although I did walk by. There is a gym, which looked small but adequate. I definitely suggest signing up for the loyalty program, as you'll see benefits such as free WiFi, complementary newspaper, and the ability to \"rent\" workout gear during your stay. There is a little Italian bistro within walking distance (I forget the name, but a concierge may be able to help) and a great little breakfast place that serves sandwiches right across from the cablecar museum (a slight walk down a steep hill near Chinatown). There is also a coffee shop right around the corner at the cablecar stop that serves Illy coffee/pastries. I took the cablecar from Union Square to the hotel upon arrival, but chose to walk to/from Union Square during my stay. In terms of noise, I've stayed in the Financial District, SoMa and Nob Hill. For my own preferences, I like Nob Hill because it's removed from the activity of Union Square. The Financial District is good for restaurants, but can be a bit of a hike to Union Square for the shopping. SoMa is very close to the activity, although some streets require attention to your surroundings. The Fairmont staff at reception were effective, knowledgeable and quick with the check-in/out, if not a bit cool. However, I had no problems and found the housekeeping, front desk and other staff kept the atmosphere feeling clean, safe and well run. I've stayed at The Westin in SoMa, The Grand Hyatt in the Financial District, and Le Meridien in the Financial District. Although the overall cost of air/hotel dictates where I stay, if price were not a factor, I'd choose The Fairmont hands down. I didn't rent a car, but understand that valet parking in general is expensive and the Fairmont is no exception in that respect. However, if you're not renting a vehicle, public transit and walking are very good alternatives. You can take the BART from their airport straight into Union Square, then take the cablecar right to the Fairmont's front steps. I suggest walking up 1 stop from the cablecar turnaround at Union Square because the line up oftentimes snakes up the block. The drivers only fill up the car 3/4 at that stop so that they can continue to pick up passengers along their route. If you walk up at least 1 stop, you have a chance of getting on. It didn't hurt to look a bit in need of mercy while holding my travel-sized backpack. :) Nob Hill is very safe at all times throughout the day. Union Square is fine when you are aware of your surroundings and follow your gut. You may encounter very obvious signs of homelessness throughout Union Square, with one street seeming fine and the very next one sending off red flags to avoid it. Like any big city, be aware and you'll be fine.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel.....convenient yet quiet.\u201d", "Author": "MrLuv2Travel", "ReviewID": "UR121842104", "Content": "Although I'd lived in the SF Bay area for many years before, this was the first time I'd actually stayed downtown for more than a day; 3 nights at the Fairmont. I'd done a great deal of reading up on the different hotels downtown that would be convenient for me to get around, yet quiet enough to get some sleep at night. I'd read many other reviews about guests being woken up or kept awake in the middle of night due to the homeless yelling, people partying and getting drunk, traffic, etc. which got me a bit worried. Not so at the Fairmont! Nob Hill is a beautiful area and the Fairmont is a large and very grand old historical landmark hotel. What amazed me during my nights there was the total silence....I truly slept like a baby!....I'd also add that the incredibly comfortable beds, sheets, and pillows made it doubly wonderful! I stayed in a Tower room can say that they keep the place very clean and well maintained. I never had time to check out the gym, but I heard it was off site, which is a bit of a negative for me. I don't think there's a pool either. What I liked is it's location....far enough from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to walk to Union Sq. or Chinatown. I actually enjoyed the walk, but trekking back up the pretty steep hill may be a bit of an exercise for some. Then again, the trolley is right outside and there are plenty of cabs waiting, so it's very convenient. Talking about the trolley....this may be the first thing you hear in the early morning that may wake you up, but it's not that bad. Be careful of the little cafe (Cento?) located on the Powell St. side of the hotel. Yummy pastries, teas, and coffees.....thank goodness for the steep hills you can work it all off later! Since this was my first hotel I'd ever stayed at in the downtown SF area, I can't say that I'll be back right away as I'd like to try others too, but it's definitely on my KIV list.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cNeeds an update\u201d", "Author": "Lauren502", "ReviewID": "UR121805708", "Content": "The lobby area of the hotel was nice, but that's where it ends.

Upon check in we decided to get an upgrade for a room w/a view .The total came to almost $550 w/tax. The room was spacious,bathroom had a beautiful tub and the panoramic view was to die for. Just a couple problems.. We did notice that an electrical outlet cover was broken and half of the plastic was missing. Just a little eyesore and so simple to replace but no big deal. We then opened up the refrigerator/honor bar and noticed that the previous guest had left behind some half eaten fruit in a ziplock bag (which was stuffed on top of the canned nuts) not very appetizing to say the least. There was also crumbs left inside the cabinet. On our way down to dinner we let the receptionist know and she apologized and said it would be cleaned immediately. Ok great . We returned several hours later after having wonderful dinner downtown Our room at night was lit up by the beautiful city. lights and was truly breathtaking.

We drove to SF from San Diego, so it had been a long trip and Fairmont was our final destination. Before coming to the hotel, we dropped a rental car at the SF airport and took a cab to the hotel. When we arrived and got out of the car, we were told byb the concierge that he will get our bags from the cab and would bring them to our room. In half an hour or so the concierge brought our bags, and half an hour later I noticed that two bags were missing. One bag had our evening outfits (dress, suit, shirts, etc), and the other bag had all toileteries. We immediately ran downstairs and informed the concierge that we were missing two bags and he said that they will need to watch a video tape to find out what cab company we used and to identify a cab. We sat in the lobby for an hour hoping that they will find our bags, but noone came to us. We asked a for a manager, but he was unaware of our situation, so we had to repeat what happened. Each time we asked about a status of our lost bags, they were not aware, as if Fairmont staff doesn't communicate to each other. It was already late evening, no bags, we were tired, and the hotel staff didn't even offer us ANY toiletries - we had no tooth brush, no tooth paste, soaps, flosses, perfumes - all was gone. Only after I approached a concierge (1000's time) and almost broke in tears he brought some toothbrushes and toothpastes. Whatever... Note: NOONE yet apologized to us, nor anyone was updating us of their search results. The next morning we had a planned trip to Alcatraz - imagine that we were in a terrible mood. By that time we already told the staff approximate name of the cab that brought us, but they kept telling us that they were investigating. Apparenttly, the video tape was blurry so they could not see clearly the cab number (what is the purpose of such video tape then??). However, at least they could see how many pieces of luggage were taken out of the cab trunk - which proved that we weren't lying. But their favorite version was that we forgot the bags in a rental car. I clearly remebered checking that we didn;t leave anything behind when we dropped a car in the airport. We tried to reach that cab company but without success, as it was just hard to find a person to talk to at the cab company. In the early afternoon we didn't hear back from them yet (!!) and my husband called and insisted on speaking with a head of Fairmont security. He told him about everything (again). Security guy said that he would look into it. When we came back into the hotel - around 2-3 pm, noone told us anything again, I bumbed into a concierge who left our bags in the cab - not even a sight of apology - \"I understand mam...We are doing doing everythiong we can...\". Happy end: when I finally decided to go shopping for a dress, because we were going to a wedding next day, and got in a cab, I got a phone call from security informing me that they found these bags. When I picked them up I was told that a cab brought them back (apparently hotel had nothing to do with finding these bags). I was sooo happy to get my staff back that I didn't even say anything, but later we realized that NOONE apologized or offered anything complimentary (at least a free drink - as a token of apology) to us. NEVER again I would stay in this hotel. If anything like this happens, you feel humuliated because you almost have to beg for their attention, everything is \"high road\". I understand that staff happens, but it is just soo hard to deal with people who does not accept their responsibilities. It also tought me a lesson that we should not trust anyone with my things!

My last trip, we had a corner room with City views: quality bed, linens, seating and desk - the bathrooms are a bit dated (sorry Fairmont), but in every other aspect the rooms are splendid. Not hip and chic (aka pounding music in all the public spaces) and many of us locals miss the Tikki Lounge; but there are so many bars/restaurants within a 5 minute walk or cab ride, you truly are spoilt for choice. Highly recommend the big buffet breakfast - amazing choices and will set you up for the whole day.

Super important detail depending on your travel companion or height. That was the only drawback (and the hills) of the hotel. This is an old hotel so you should be aware of that when booking. That lends to the charm and everything is updated anyhow. The bathrooms are clean but small. The location is great as we walked to Union Square and the the edge of Chinatown.

I joined the Fairmont President's Club a few years ago (it's free), and as a result, we get free WiFi. That alone is worth joining, but we also have received discounts on rooms after we have stayed at various Fairmonts. Anyway, the Fairmont San Francisco was one of the few large buildings to survive the 1906 quake and fire, and its lobby still reflects the ornate style of 1906 San Francisco. And at Christmastime it can be quite spectacular. For a trip down memory lane, the Tonga Room is still alive and worth a visit. It brings back memories of the 1950s, or if you weren't alive back then, it gives you a glimpse of what was avant garde 60 years ago. All things considered, the Fairmont San Francisco is a wonderful hotel and a great place to stay when visiting the city!", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cFair\"NOT\" in San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "barca212", "ReviewID": "UR119333629", "Content": "Having stayed at other Fairmont properties, this one is a real disappointment. First, the location on top of Nob Hill is not convenient. One has to take a Trolley Car to the top of the hill unless you feel like climbing up a steep hill. Second the rooms are really dated! I was lucky enough to have a room on the 22nd Floor of the Tower with a great view of the city, but that still did not make up for the absolutely dismal decoration and stodginess of this room. So I can only imagine how much worse it would be if one was in a room without a view and natural light. Third, and the major failure of this hotel, is its staff. It is seems like they are doing you a favor by answering a question or serving you a drink. The conceirge might as well not be there. So unhelpful and always recommending what is right around the corner and complete tourist traps. I used the wonderful apps on my i-phone to find much better places than what was recommended by the hotel's conceirge team. All in all, this is an overpriced hotel that is way past its glory.

A must visit when in San Francisco , loved the Mai Tais and the tropical rain storms every half hour - had a smile on our faces throughout Happy Hour! The front desk staff was great - provided a couple of restaurant recommendations that were excellent. One was MyMy for breakfast - , lunch and was great! Ended up there twice because our lunch was so good. Also ate twice in the dining room which had excellent service, very good food - must say a little pricy - but was worth it! My reason for 4 stars is that 2 out of the 5 nights I had to call to get my room cleaned. This is after I was out and about all day and arriving back to my room after 4-5 in the afternoon? One of the evenings I had to wait downstairs while they cleaned my room. Although in Fairmont fashion, the manager did buy me a glass of wine while I waited. Still was a hassle especially given that it happened twice. Also think their concierge services are mediocre. Was having a hard time on the MOMA website - wanted to attend the Stein Exhibit. Called down to the concierge to explain my issue and could she assist with getting tickets? Her response was that getting my tickets via online was my best bet......didn't I just say was having a difficult time on their website?

(Hint to the hotel manager - double Richs' salary and only allow him 1 day off instead of 2 ), it's much better when he is behind the desk although everyone was nice and helpful. The room was definetly worth the wait. Views of the bay and of the city and the room was spotless every day. We ate breakfast every morning in the Laurel room and had the buffet which was included in our package. Really worth it and the food was delicious. Everyone of the staff there was friendly but special thanks to one of the servers, Ben (Hint to the hotel manager - Double what you pay Ben and only give him one day off) Like I said everyone was nice and friendly but Ben gave it extra effort. Then there was the Caffe Cento. A pretty long walk from our room but worth the trip. The coffee was really good and the service was good, especially when Linda was there. She had no idea that we were even staying at the hotel and went well out of her way to help us with service and with a question we had about purchasing some coffee cups from the caffe.

If you stay at the hotel you can pop your head inside to see what it looks like and maybe even have a drink, but once you see the rain effect you can leave. The food and service left a little to be desired. (Hint to the hotel manager - turn the Tonga room back into an indoor pool) Service and food not so good. If you want better chinese food go to China town but have the hotel make reservations at the R & G Lounge restaurant and ask for the first floor seating. Good food and decent prices. Another recommendation is Johns Grill near Union Square. Food is really good and the ambience was fanatastic especially if your a \"Maltese Falcon\" or Bogie fan. Nice soft music added a great touch. Then last but not least the Tadech restaurant. A short cable ride on the California line and you're there. No reservations are taken but it's fairly large but you may have to wait a little, but worth it. Great food and service.

As a first advice, if they offer you \"the beautiful Malaya suite\", do not take it! Because you pay for the balcony, but you don't get one. The so called \"balcony\" is covered to 85% in glass, so it's more like a winter garden. As you can see from the outside of the hotel, this balcony is the only one that's limited in that way. But this didn't even make the doctor write this review. He was even willing to not complain about the muffy old room that was quite dusty and should have been remodeled over a century ago... No, what was really embarrassing, was the winter garden/balcony itself. First of all, the balcony had not been cleaned for quite a while and just due to this fact, it was no joy to be out there. The armchairs on the balcony where full of old stains and even mold! So if you wanted to sit down, a muffy, dirty, moldy armchair was set up to your comfort (as you can see on the pictures I uploaded). When I went down to the front desk, to complain only about the armchairs, I didn\u2019t get an apology, but I was ordered to go back to the suite and wait for housekeeping to bring new chairs. After 45 minutes of waiting, I went down again and asked how long housekeeping would need to bring up new chairs, because I didn\u2019t want to spend the whole evening sitting in the suite. Shortly I was told that they told housekeeping to speed up. Again I waited for over 30 minutes, until housekeeping called just to tell me, that they have no new chairs or any other alternative. So for the third time I went down to the front desk and I was offered\u2026 nothing. Instead, I was told to \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d. So I decided to check out immediately, without even staying a night at the Fairmont. As the pinnacle of bad service, they didn\u2019t offer me help by the bell desk, so I had to carry my luggage all by myself down into the garage. I do not know, what you expect, when you check in at a grand hotel, but this was the lousiest service I ever experienced. What embarrasses me the most is the thing that the personal didn\u2019t seem to be surprised by the fact, that they have moldy chairs and an unsatisfied customer. Overall they just didn\u2019t care. I even contacted Lucas Schumacher (that\u2019s the one who asks for contact when you write a review like this on tripadvisor) and that was no good either. He apologized, of course, and offered to make the San Francisco Fairmont management contact me, but guess what, they never did. I take that as the last proof that they really do not care about the customers they have and strongly advise you, not to book at a Fairmont hotel if you\u2019d like to enjoy proper service.

As a treat to ourselves we also stayed the night, in room 434 (old tower). Hotel snobs and Four Seasons aficionados will not be impressed by the rooms. Although we had a nice view towards the Financial District, the window, bedroom and bathroom are small by modern standards. The weather was considerably warmer than usual for SF and the air conditioning was not completely up to par to keep the room comfortable. The bathroom has pretty standard amenities and was small for a hotel at this price point. I wouldn't say the room was sparkling clean. The closet furnishings were dusty and some of the furniture was pretty beat up in places. The bed, however, was very comfortable, and we had no complaints about noise. Most of the sheets seemed pretty new except for a very shabby worn out bottom sheet. With all this being said, the grandeur of the public spaces...the lobby, restaurants, ballrooms, etc. is where this hotel shines. There are always people dressed up--coming and going to some special event that really adds an exclamation point to your own experience here. This is a great hotel to use as a rally point for a group in town for a special event or an anniversary. The upkeep of this property must be nightmarish and I'm sure that's where a lot of your nightly rate goes. The valet (20 minutes to get car), check in (15 minutes with only 2 in front of us) , room service (50 minutes for a 1AM pizza), and breakfast buffet (20 minutes waiting with only 1 party ahead of us) were slow for the price. You can really feel the \"union\" nature of the staff here. They've been here forever and pretty much perform only to their own personalities. At the same time sometimes I tire of the painted smiles other properties insist on. The breakfast buffet at $30 was better than I expected. The Tonga Room has last call just after midnight which surprised us since it was still quite busy.

At 4-5pm you got woken up by what sounds like delivery lorries. At around 7-7:30 pm you get more noise from the staff starting to clean adjoining rooms - very noisey and loud - do they not realise there are guests who might actually be resting?

Upon arrival at the Fairmont we were greeted by William one of the Valet attendents. He couldn't have been more helpful. Our check in was quick and efficient. We even got an instant upgrade (Presidents Club you know) from a room in the original hotel to a larger room in the tower. The room couldn't have been nicer with two exceptions. No robes (the ladies like the robes) and placement next to the elevators was not so great. Maybe we would have been better off in our smaller room in the main building. Since we were there to party what's a little whooshing sound coming from the elevator shaft. Breakfast on Saturday was very nice. $68.00 for two people. Don't you just love hotel food prices! Scrambled eggs and toast and of course coffee was extra. I don't blame the Fairmont as all the big city hotels do the same thing. It's just the principal. No inroom coffee was a bit bothersome as my wife really needs her coffee in the morning as do I. They have a small coffee house outside the hotel and down a hill called Cafe Cento. Fair prices and decent breads and rolls. That's where we had breakfast on our second morning at the Fairmont. Saturday evening we went to see Beach Blanket Babylon a decades old show held in the North Beach area. Lots of fun. We thought we would take a cab but were pleased when the hotel offered to drive us in the hotel car. Nice touch! Sunday came to fast and it was time to checkout which we did with ease. My only real complaint was the hotel parking. $52.00 per night plus $14.00 in taxes. Ouch! Really! Really! The Union square hotels don't charge $66.00 per day for parking. I think I could have hired someone to feed a meter for less. Walking up and down those hills will either kill you or stregthen your heart. I'd like to think it is the later.

Upon arrival the porter should place the suitcase on the stand and spend a moment explaining the features and amenities in the room. * Any staff I spoke to were courteous and helpful. But unless I spoke to them it was as though we didn't exist. No-one contacted us to check we were satisfied with our room, enjoying our stay, or if we had any questions. Even when we checked out, we were not asked if we had enjoyed our stay. I got the impression that the hotel did not care that we were there or satisfied. * Upon arrival we opened our own taxi door, hauled our own luggage up the steps, opened our own door into the lobby and found our own way to the check-in counter. I am quite capable of all this, but I expect more from a supposed \"5 star\" hotel. So it was a comfortable stay and central to many of the attractions in the San Francisco area. The issues I have described above did not detract from us enjoying our vacation. But for value I will be staying somewhere else next time I am in San Francisco.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fremont, California", "Title": "\u201cAnniversary stay- very good, but not stellar\u201d", "Author": "jandollar", "ReviewID": "UR117469378", "Content": "This was a first stay for us, and we were celebrating our 35 th anniversary. They were kind enough to upgrade our room to a Signature Tower King, with sweeping views of the bay. This was not a huge upgrade, just the next step above what we already paid for. While it was only the 5th floor, the view was indeed magnificent with a large picture window. We had unobstructed views od Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz, and beyond. Then the fog rolled in, giving us a view of gray. But, we can't fault the Fairmont for that. Plus, as the night wore on, some of the fog lifted and we could take in the city lights. Even only 5 floors up, we were far enough away from street noise for the most part. We could hear the clanging of the cable car bells (they run on both California and Mason Streets, so two sides of the hotel get the effect). But, they do not run that often, and we like the sound of the cable cars. We could not hear the grinding of the cables or the screeching of the brakes, so that was good! The room was spacious even though it was not a suite, and we liked the decor. Too bad there was no telescope in the room and the window was soert of dirty. The bed was comfy and we were able to connect my iPad to the LCD TV to watch Netflix movies. We were disappointed to find we were given a handicap room (no we didn't ask for one), which in this hotel means no bathtub and no shower stall. Yep, this was the full \"roll in\" shower with a seat accessible by wheel chair. Sort of like a hospital shower, made fancy with marble tiles. Not my idea of romance, but by the time we discovered it, we were unpacked and relaxing. Otherwise, I would have asked for a different room. I had read other reviews, so I knew to look out for this, but the mini-bar goodies are \"wired\" to be automatically charged to your room as soon as you pick them up. So no looky-loos on the snacks and drinks. They have them set up on a little teeter totter thing that senses the change in weight, and there literally is a wire coming from the pad to behind the TV. The one out in the open even has a little teddy bear in a box, I guess to attract any kids you may have brought along. There is another in the top drawer of the armoire with more snacks. You'd thing there'd be a warning sign on this attractive nusiance, but no. There must have been a price list somewhere, but I did not dig around for it. I didn't even open the fridge to see what was in there. I would think at the rates they charge, they could just have housekeeping keep tabs. Room service was expensive, as expected, but they add 20% gratuity, plus $5 service charge (as opposed to the more typical 15-18%). That said, we had room service for breakfast ($54 for two), and we were pleased with our meal. We had one order each of strawberries, mangoes and banana bread (house made), and a full pot of coffee. There were two large slices of the banana bread, plenty for two people. Sure, we paid more than we would in the Laurel Court restaurant downstairs, but we got to enjoy our million dollar view with our breakfast this way. We had dinner in the Tonga Room, early before the band began because we wanted to be able to talk during dinner. Rather than ordering entrees, we each had seared opa salads, shared an appetizer platter, and a side of fried \"shaka\" rice. We were given a volcano dessert complimentary for our anniversary. We had read that the food was not very good, but we enjoyed what we ordered very much. We loved the kitchy feel and the fake thunderstorms. The decor was well thout out and not at all tacky. Better than Trader Vic's I think. We got a poolside seat, so when it rained, we actually felt a cooling breeze from the falling water. If you cannot suspend your disbelief to enjoy the fun, I guess you are a snob or depressed. Whatever. The location was very nice, even with the very steep hills (the better to walk off those spring rolls!). We arrived by Bart from the East Bay, getting off at the Embarcadero Station. The Powell Station is closer, but they say the hill is steeper. We had lunch in the Financial District before walking up through Chinatown and on up Nob Hill. Since we were staying only one night, we only needed a small overnight bag each. So, overall, we thought the SF Fairmont was classy, historic, and memorable. But, it was not a perfect stay (handicap bathroom).", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno, California", "Title": "\u201cNice, fancy hotel\u201d", "Author": "facebook6", "ReviewID": "UR117413861", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for one night.

I remember promising myself I would go back some day for a vacation. 20 years on, the Fairmont did not disappoint! The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas, with a HUGE tree and a full-size gingerbread house! People were coming into the foyer from the street, just to have their photo taken beside the tree. There was a feeling of being part of an olde worlde setting, in plush, beautiful surroundings, where service was given with effortless ease. The breakfast buffet was amazong, with a wide range of choice to suit every taste, and the letter of welcome in the room on arrival was a lovely touch. The concierge was knowledgeable and extremely helpful, and the whole experience was just unforgettable. If you are looking for a modern, impersonal place to stay, don't stay here. But if you are looking for something classic and special, with more than a hint of luxury, and you fancy stepping into the splendour of bygone San Francisco, then the Fairmont is the place for you. Would go back in a heartbeat - and intend to do so next year!", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cMy second time there but not my last!\u201d", "Author": "nellymty", "ReviewID": "UR116116848", "Content": "I went last January to attend a Meeting but I also took my husband with me to enjoy the city of San Francisco.

It was pretty close to a perfect hotel for us. It was built by the Fair sisters (their actual name) around 1900, using their father's silver-mining money, and is the first of the Fairmont chain. It survived the great earthquake of 1904, largely because it was built on solid rock, so you can sleep easy in your bed! It has a classic exterior and interior, and was beautifully restored by the famous California architect Julia Morgan (who also designed the Hearst Castle, San Simeon). The lobby is one of the greatest in the world, and worth a look even if you don't stay there, built of solid honey-coloured marble (real not faux). The breakfast room/bar has been restored back to its gorgeous original state, although the stained-glass domes no longer let in external light. There are several delightful 1930s murals illustrating circus acts in the Circus Room (an old bar I think). There is a large roof garden with palm trees etc from which one can see Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz. They have their own bee colony! There is a Polynesian-style bar which is a famous SF nightspot and has been around a long time (more than 60 years I think). Many presidents and other dignitaries have stayed at the hotel, and some of these occasions are shown in a photo gallery. The original charter of the League of Nations was signed here. The hotel is probably the highest structure in San Francisco, on what is called \"Nob Hill\", yet it is only 2 blocks to Chinatown, and a 20 minute walk to Union Square or the Ferry Terminal. Two cable car lines and several bus lines stop within a block of the hotel. We went to some fabulous restaurants, not too far away, of which the top three were 1.Masa's, 2.Michael Mina and 3.Jardiniere (the latter being conveniently close to the Opera House). The Slanted Door (modern Vietnamese fusion) in the Ferry Building also gets honourable mention (and is much less expensive). We breakfasted in the hotel every day: although it is a tad expensive, we thought the fine food and service and the relaxed setting were well worth it, and they don't mind if you linger and read a paper or do a crossword.

When we arrived, it was just such a lovely experience, the lobby is a good size and old fashioned enough to be opulent. Our friends arrived from Australia at 11am, not a good time as the hotel would not allow them to enter their room until 3pm, a real minus point for anyone travelling long distances and needing a rest and something the hotel should address, it is very off putting to be so tired and denied a room for 4 hours! Other than that, the hotel is a great experience. The rooms are well furnished with all the amenities you could need and the breakfast dining on a par with anywhere else i have stayed in around the world at this price. We did not eat our evening meal there so i cannot comment, but one place to dine in San Francisco and must not be missed under any circumstances is Gary Danco's, but book weeks before your trip as it is fully booked every night without fail, in fact, book there for every evening, the menu is so comprehensive it would take a month to try everything. Back to The Fairmont. Situated at the top of Nob Hill and with cablecar access right outside the door going to Union Square or Fishermans Wharf or Golden Gate Park, it's positioning is perfect. Just one thing to try during the day, hire a bicycle and cross The Golden Gate Bridge, carry on to Sausalito and catch the ferry back to Fishermans Wharf, but put on sun block on your face as the wind, even a gentle breeze, can give you a very red face in the morning. Next day try the Natural History Museum in the G G Park, between the museum and walking in the park, that could be a 2 dayser, but go there on a trolley bus, it stops right outside gate 8. Union Square shopping is great (if you like shopping) and Chinatown is another experience. Lombard Street has to be walked down, just to say you have done it, and walk back to the hotel sometimes just to work up an apetite for afternoon tea and a shower before taking the cablecar to Gary Danko.

Where we had stayed in a small boutique hotel the first time, our graduation to the top of the hill (Knob HIll) was absolutely outstanding. This is the original Fairmont. Elegant, rococo, sophisticated. The hallways are lined with the pictorial history of the hotel, and we got a slight shiver from the romance and the passion of a great hotel with millions of stories to tell. The rooms are equally charming. The front desk and concierge smooth and polished. We knew nothing of the Tonga Room when we arrived. In fact, just going for a walk around the block, we chanced upon a side door near the rear of the hotel. Peeked in. A south seas motif, with a large pool of blue water in the middle. It reminded us of the Polynesian Room at the old Ports of Call in Toronto in the 60's crossed with the Tiki Room at Disneyland. It promised a bit of fun, and likely tourist food to boot. Wrong on one front. It WAS fun, the place was packed, and the food was marvellous. And at 9 pm, the reflecting pool (for that's what we thought it was) came alive with music and a band floated along it on some kind of barge. As it turns out, the Tonga Room is the old basement swimming pool area which, in the 50's, had a cafe added around it, so that bathers could stay poolside and enjoy a bite and a drink. This was such a successful idea that the restaurant was expanded and the pool became a thematic centrepiece instead of a place to swim. The Tonga Room is actually famous, and maps of San Fran show it - without mentioning the name Fairmont. Although it's atop Knob Hill, and the streets in every direction are steeply downhill, the rear of the hotel is on Powell Street, and you can catch a cable car right there to go either downtown or to the wharf area. In the third direction you can get a cable car on California to take you to the Pier 1 area on the Embarcadero. If you're inclined (or 'disinclined') you can walk along Powell down to the wharf area and it's all downhill all the way to the water and an Irish Coffee at Buena Vista.

The bellboy was nice enough. There was no complimentary newspaper and no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. It took 45 minutes for a pot of hot water to be brought to our room. The Fairmont needs to learn that it isn't enough to look nice - the memory of superb service and attention to small details (which the Langham and the Four Seasons do to perfection) lasts a lot longer than a gilded lobby and nice flowers.

Finally my sister couldn't stand it anymore (and given that we were there to run a half marathon I felt the same way).

I would like to preface this by saying we have stayed in some of the finest hotels in the world including the Burj Al Arab, Waldorf NY and Goring etc. and so although we all know that hotels can be flawed in many ways, our expectation was reasonably (and not surprisingly) quite high, given the reputation of the hotel chain and the hotel itself. After a loooong flight from Sydney we arrived very tired but really looking forward to our first stay in San Francisco and at the much vaunted Fairmont. On arrival at the hotel we unloaded the bags and a bell hop arranged to take them to the room, this seemed to be very matter of fact and not that welcoming. I went to check in and was met by a lady who gave me the impression that I was definitely an interruption to whatever she was doing. There was little in the way of interaction and virually no eye contact. It was done swiftly and with almost indecent haste and I was handed a room card. I had to ask if that was it as there was no suggestion of \"the lift is over there...\" or \"would you like us to hold a dinner reservation for you?\" etc. So we went up to our room and I have to say that is was the smallest room we have ever had in a hotel the US. The bed was a standard double bed and there was no coffee or tea making facilities in the room .When the bell hop bought our luggage up I asked if we could have some coffee making facilities. I was told that they do not put them in the room as a matter of course but they would arrange to send some up. Needless to say it never arrived! In the restaurant there was little distinction between a continental breakfast and the full buffett, which was $30 dollars plus tax and compulsary 15% tip each - this made breakfast $75. Therefore $27 for a bowl of cereal and a slice of toast (which is all my wife usually has) seemed a littel excessive. The buffet breakfast was incredibly poor value for money as, although there was an egg station, where you could have them any style, all the other hot food was kept in trays with hot water troughs underneath to keep them warm - it didn't! The biggest plus here was the Maitre D who was very friendly and welcomed us warmly. The general waiting staff just didn't seem interested and we had to ask several times for things as they kept fogetting or bought the wrong tea etc. When the restaurant was busy (we had to wait twice for breakfast for at least 20 minutes) which wasn't an issue itself but once in there it was clear that they could not handle pressure of any kind as they all ran around frowning and looked frazzled. There was one young lady who served us drinks and food in the lounge for 2 evenings and she was excellent and actually put her more senior colleagues to shame in terms of service and attention. Checking out was met with the same indifference - it was as thoguh we'd never been there. And apart from calling us a cab the door staff were no help at all as I loaded the car myself with the help of the taxi driver. All in all, for the price, it was extremely disappointing and very poor value fo rmoney.

The room was large and the bed fantastic to sleep in with soft pillows and good bedding. I loved the walk in closets, and the little alcove area with ledge, seat, and mirror. The furniture fittings were in good order without the usual marks , cup rings and dings. The bathroom although old in design was well maintained, and large, in other words you didn't get the feeling of meeting oneself when you turned. Room cleaning was of a high order, and the bathroom was replenished with toiletries . The Hotel foyer(sorry lobby I forget the hotel is in America) was everything a really great hotel should have, it was large , well designed and classically tasteful, I found myself just sitting there and looking soaking it all in. almost in an Edwardian time warp. What can I add but that in a room just to one side of the lobby, the United Nations was founded. I saved the best to last, each morning I had breakfast in the Palm Court and was exceptionally well taken care of by a lady called Mila ( I hope I pronounced her name correctly). She took the time and trouble to get the kitchen to serve the porridge (sorry Oatmeal) the way I like it and also to discover the way I like my tea (boiling hot water and two tea bags in before serving). This may sound trivial but I can honestly say it was the first time in America , the I enjoyed the tea, she touched an Englishman's heart. All the staff were courteous and helpful, and were not \"hunting for tips\" I say this because I stayed in the Savoy Hotel in London (another fairmont hotel) before leaving England and I found myself in an atmosphere of \"tip expectation\".

I had stayed once before at the Fairmont, a standard room for a good rate on a Groupon deal. We live in San Francisco, and having a yummy night or two away as tourists in our own town is a real treat. This time, on our second Groupon stay, when I made the online reservation I checked the option to e-upgrade. I was happy to learn that we were in fact upgraded, but I was thrilled when the bellman opened the door to our corner suite on the 16th floor (the Sutro Suite) and I entered our spacious perch high above the hustle and bustle of the city - with a 260 degree view. I'd never seen San Francisco look so appealing, and I've been living here for more than 30 years! More than a fancy hotel getaway, our two nights at the Fairmont were sanctuary. The lobby is opulent, the Laurel Cafe for breakfast/ brunch is luxuriously quiet and divine. The staff is professional yet friendly. Because we live nearby we took a discreet cooler in with us with our own snacks and libations. The mini-bars at the Fairmont are of the annoying sort where sensors ensure that you get charged for just touching something. The beds and linens both are worth the price of admission. Each time I stay there I fantasize about buying the exact same set up for our home. Being in bed at the Fairmont makes this particular princess very very happy. We had a wonderful time taking photos of our beautiful city, night and day, and celebrated our best Valentine's Day ever. We looked into staying in the same room for July 4th for what would be an AMAZING view of fireworks, but alas, the rack rate was about 3x what we were paying with our Groupon and e-upgrade. I have to admit, the decor is not my style, but it IS the style of the hotel, and we just pretended we were on the set of Mad Men, or in Nancy Reagan's parlor. Parking is very pricey (like 60$ or more a night), and they charge 15$ a day for WiFi. I found that excessive.

Based on current airfares, I think I paid less than $200/night for the Fairmont. At first we were given a room with one queen bed. This was problematic since I was traveling with my teenage daughter who is a total bed hog. I emailed reservations and, after initially blaming it on USAirways, was given a room with 2 beds at no extra cost. We arrived at the hotel at around 8 p.m. Check-in was very fast and easy. We were given a room on the 3rd floor, near the elevator. We might as well have been sleeping in the hallway, the room was so noisy. I complained the next morning and we were given a lovely room on the 6th floor, very far away from the elevator. This was much better, but I have to say that the walls do not provide a very good sound barrier. We could clearly hear our neighbor's television and him talking on the phone. I guess this is just a hazard of staying in an old hotel and I was willing to deal with it because the room was so nice, large, and the view amazing. Take ear plugs though or you might have trouble sleeping. The location of the hotel is really great if you don't want to be in the thick of touristy Union Square but want to easily get around. The cable car stops right outside the coffee shop. Very convenient (although at $5 a ride, the cable car gets very pricey). Every hotel employee we came in contact with was very friendly and helpful and the service was great. My only real complaint is that we ordered room service one evening and it wasn't very good, was expensive (over $50 for a small cheese pizza and a burger), and took almost an hour to get.

There are so many things that I love and enjoy about staying with you. The service is amazing, properties are beautiful and so comfortable it almost feels like home. Recently, when planning my travels to the San Francisco area I was pleased to see that there in fact was a Fairmont. So, the decision was easy. I had a need for a suite with a separate room . When I checked in on Friday, Jan 14th I have to say it was not the experience that I am accustomed too. It took forever to get checked in and the woman at the front desk was not welcoming in the least! When I asked about the room that I had originally book ( ns suite in old building) if it had a nice view she said \"no\" but did not offer any suggestions. I asked if I could get a different room with a better view and she said that she would check. After again waiting a long time she said they did have a suite in the tower available but there would be a price difference. I asked if she could check on my corporate rate for the room and she said that it would be $100 more a night (I wish that she would have given me the total for the room including all the taxes too) it might have been helpful? but this sounded good so we proceeded. She then offered me a roll away bed for the room because my daughter would be staying there too. I thought that this was thoughtful and thanked her for thinking about it . She did not however mention that it would be an additional $35 a night ( In the past I have NEVER been charged for this ). She did not point out any of the ammenities of the hotel (the coffee shop, business center, Tonga) or offer any additional assistance. In my opinion she was not a great first impression on the hotel. When we got to the room ( Sutter Suite) the view was fantastic and for this I was glad for the upgrade! The room was clean and decorated in the special Fairmont style that I love. Although, the room had no extra blankets, pillows or a robe for my 7yr old daughter that I had requested this upon making the reservations. The TV had issues remote barely work and channels would flicker... no big deal since we planned on enjoying the city anyway. After returning from dinner on the first night we came back to a beautiful bottle of wine and cheese platter on the table with a note. I thought how thoughtful of them to send this up .... Wait it was not for us and was intended for another guest. I found this out after I read the card that was left... Oops! everyone makes mistake I completely understand this so I call the front desk to let them know. They inform me that I will need to talk to room service to let them know. .. \"ok\"? Although she did say that they will probably just tell me to keep it . I explained the situation to room service and apologized for opening the card. They said nothing.... no apology for delivering to wrong room just that they would be right up and asked \"if I had eaten any of it..??\" When we were in the lobby of the hotel during the duration of our stay (which was so beautiful and has such a wonderful history) I was surprised that the staff did not ask us if they could help with anything or greet us. Usually we are being inundated with cheerful, helpful staff looking to make your stay more enjoyable. That was not the case here! I do have to say that the concierge \"Tommy\" was fantastic!! Helpful, cheerful and had just the right suggestions for us on what to do or where to go! He is a real GEM !

The room was perfect, and we actually took pictures of the bathroom because we've been trying to describe to our contractor what we're looking for. The views of the bridge and the bay are not to be surpassed anywhere. Though most of the service was very good, we were a bit disappointed at check in. We arrived early, and dropped off our bags letting the front desk know that we were early and didn't expect to be checked in. They offered to text us when the room was ready, and they didn't - I didn't ask or expect them to text us, and if they wouldn't have offered to do so, I wouldn't have expecting anything, but once they told us they would then didn't, I was disappointed. Check in after we finally went back to the hotel went smoothly, but we specifically requested that coffee be delivered to the room each morning, and it was the first, but on subsequent mornings we had to explain again what we wanted. They were always willing to please, but I felt for this amount of money we should not have needed to request again. On the morning of our check out, the bill was not correct, and luckily I woke up quite early and was able to go down stairs and fix it before we left, but again, it should not have happened. Again, the staff was very helpful and patient, and made sure that it was correct before I left. Enough of the downside, they were building the gingerbread house in the lobby the week we were there and it made the lobby just smell fantastic.

We had read many of the other reviews on the hotel before traveling so we had some idea of the potential pitfalls to avoid. I'll list the pros and cons: Pros: Great location - the hotel sits on the intersection of all the major cable car routes, so that's a big plus. The hills are steep to walk, but not that bad with good tennis shoes. Room view - from our room, we could see the entire bay, alcatraz, and the golden gate bridge. Fantastic. Staff - very prompt response times and extremely helpful. If it wasn't for the staff, my rating would be far lower. Cons: Hotel Renovations: no where on the reservations did it mention that the hotel was undergoing renovations. We were woken up each morning around 7:30am to the sounds of hammering and scraping. Check into this before booking! Nickle and Dime Charges - we knew about the \"automatically charging refreshments\" in the fridge and drawers, so we requested they be removed when we first arrived. Sure enough, our preliminary bill had hundreds of dollars in charges on it that needed to be manually removed because \"they can't override their own automatic sensors\", even though the hotel staff is the ones who removed the products. Highly recommend you do the same and request a guest fridge as check in. Note that you can buy 12 bottles of water from Walgreens right down the street (use the cable car) for the same price as one bottle of water in your room. Honestly, for a $450/night suite, this is just plain silly. This is the ONLY hotel that I've seen that doesn't provide as least some light refreshments for free in a suite. Room Maintenance - TV signals were hit or miss due to faulty connections (after one attempt at repairs by the hotel engineer, we gave up), shower drains were slow (fixed by hotel staff). These types of things should be taken care of before guests arrive. Furniture - the beds are pretty hard, so if you like soft beds, you are out of luck. The rest of the furniture seems run down and fits in well with the antique theme (although I'd swear some of it is old enough to be an antique).

The hotel is centrally located at the top of Nob Hill - at the intersection of both cable car lines. This provides a fantastic jumping off point to see all that this wonderful city has to offer! Be aware though - it's a STEEP hill to walk up, and aside from the cable cars - there aren't a lot of other Muni options nearby. As the cable car is more of a tourist attraction, you can expect long lineups and full cable cars going by the Fairmont pretty much all of the time. Taxi's are a good option in the evening - for dinner reservations or bar hopping, but we were stuck waiting in a line about 20 deep of annoying, arrogant consumer attorneys and their \"hired\" companions!! As far as the hotel goes - the hotel is absolutely stunning, especially the lobby! I particularly enjoyed the antique mail chute, and the way the hallways reminded me of scenes from \"The Shining\". They have a great tiki restaurant/lounge called \"Tonga\" in the basement of the hotel (around the old swimming pool which is now a lagoon). They have a very popular happy hour on Thursday and Friday nights which is VERY affordable, and the fake thunderstorms that occur every twenty minutes or so is kitschy but cool. There was a real thunderstorm going on outside when we were there! The long-term plan is for this restaurant to close in a couple years - given how popular this restaurant appears to be (and how incredibly fun it is), I'd say that this would be a fatal error on the part of the hotel management and ownership! The rooms are well-appointed, with warm, comfortable finishes and furnishings. We had booked an Interior Queen in the main building, and were upgraded to an Exterior King with Bay view on arrival.

Charlotte at the Concierge desk was also very helpful when looking for dining suggestions.

In fact my coworker has pointed out to me that it is a historical landmark of San Francisco, so you can expect to feel a bit nostalgic here. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a free upgrade to a king size room, which is very large, with a king sized bed and a walk in closet! The bed itself is very comfy, I would prefer fluffier pillows though, but that's just personal preference. The usual amenities are there, except for the coffee maker. I really hoped for one since I did not feel like shelling out to have a coffee in the room. Internet is not free, and wireless was very weak. I also resort to the plug in ethernet for a reliable connection. I also got a decent view from my room, straight out my room faces the wall of the hotel beside it, but on an angle I get to have a view of the bay, which you can see in one of the pictures.

I went to one of the boutiques on 3 separate occasions and although myself and the girl working at that time were the only ones in the room, I was not acknowledged once. I stood at the concierge desk a handful of times on the way out of the hotel with questions and again, no assistance. The two times I was assisted, the concierge gave me incorrect information about how exactly one uses the cable cars, and when I was too exhausted to go find somewhere to eat, I was referred to have Chinese delivered from (what the Concierge described as his 'top recommendation from China Town') a place that sloppily brought me leaking bags of food to my room. When I asked someone about delaying my checkout time by an hour, I was told to call the day OF checkout to see if it could be pushed back. Which seems to defeat the purpose of a later leisurely checkout. Plumbing was clearly an issue when each time I went to brush my teeth, the sink was clogged and quickly filled with water. A man was given the wrong room number at one point and spent 10 minutes outside my door try to pry himself into my room. There was a gap in the seal of the door so the light from the hallway shined through all night. We went down to the Tonga room and ended up walking away after no one ever came to seat us. I called one evening to have a cab ready to take us to the Symphony because I\u2019ve had experiences with some cabs in other cities not taking credit cards. I was told it would be no problem and there would be one waiting at a specific time. After watching the bellmen hop around assisting everyone coming in and leaving the hotel but us, I stood at the end of the street to flag down my own. Which is not a problem, however if that was going to be the case I shouldn\u2019t have been told otherwise. Ordering room service one night was a complete waste of the overpriced menu food I could have prepared myself; with the exception of the chocolate cake which I must say was phenomenal. I do wish it had been more clear and literally mentioned to me about the room service charge per person with gratuity included when I placed the order. Maybe that\u2019s naive of me and you're thinking I should have read the fine print, but again this was my first time traveling to any other city besides the state I live in and I expected to be taken care of. Which I don\u2019t feel is too much to ask. Although these were not a necessity to me, I also found it odd that such a higher end facility would not already have wifi and parking included; when even many 3 star hotels do. Just because one makes enough money doesn't mean they should be taken advantage of and sucked dry. I was just really let down with the ever so mediocre experience when I was expecting to have a happily memorable stay there, a fabulous place to call my own which I could continue to stay each returning trip, and a definite place to refer to those close to me.

It has a great location. It's an old hotel however so the usual can be expected. Bad plumbing, no electrical outlets. WIFI is 13.95 per day. THere is no laundry service. Hardly anyone in the hotel speaks english as their first language. The coincerge is overworked and hardly ever available. Make sure you do your planning ahead. You can walk to virtually everything but be careful because it's all hills. I recommend the Sight Seeing Tours in the Double Decker Buses or $35 a piece. It's definitely worth it and you can get on and off at all of the places you would want to visit in downtown San Francisco. The cable cars are $5 a piece one way. Make sure you know which direction you want to go though! The coincerge told me to just jump on one and it would take me where I wanted to go....NOT TRUE! After a $5 dollar ride down the hill I had to pay another $5 dollars to take me back up the hill in the \"correct\" direction. Overall San Francisco lives up to the hype though. It's a cool place but don't think you are going to be able to have fun on a BUDGET. It's a pricey place and stay at one of the \"brand\" hotels so you get the amenities at no extra charge and where the hotel staff is a little friendlier because of their corporate structures. P.S. There is no laundry service at the hotel. They outsource it so expect to pay TIME AND HALF if you need something the next day. P.S.S There is no pool and parking is $50 dollars a day. Don't pick up anything in the room that looks like food or beverages. It's spring loaded and will charge you automatically.

The Fairmont Hotel is a majestic building on top of Nob Hill, on of the few buildings that survived the 1906 Earthquake almost undamaged. When we entered our 'Tower room' we where astonished by the views over San Francisco and the Bay. Astonished to a degree that my wife, who has not only problems with heights but also with windows that can't be opened, felt rather uncomfortable. I decided to ask for a room with windows that can be opened and were, without hesitation, upgraded to a superb suite with a balcony on the backside, unfortunately without a great view.

The service staff was astounding--- pot of coffee from room service in 3 minutes flat! Seriously! Waiters, bussers, bartenders, all top notch. The down sides? A few. The room could have used to have been cleaned well sometime in the past year. A quarter inch of filth (not dust, grunge) on the baseboards was just a bit much. This hotel is ungodly expensive for everything. Ungodly. One example: they even have the unmitigated gall.... and I do call it gall.....to charge a 15% \"surcharge\" (yes, really) for breakfast which takes you to $40 PER PERSON before tax and tip for the roundly average buffet. The St. Regis in Princeville, with stunningly better food options and a view to die for, isn't even so proud of itself. On top of this, they were running loud construction every day during breakfast.

Hint, Mr. Klein, most guests of a 5 star hotel don't groove on pottymouth and bad manners over breakfast, and have NO INTEREST in your staffing, mechanical and other issues.

I love the history of the hotel and how it dates back to the early 1900s. However, with a name like \"Fairmont\", you'd expect classy service to go with what I understand is their flagship hotel. I was completely wrong. I read on one of the reviews that the place is just \"ok\". I would have to agree 100% Although the place is impressive, you are not getting the service to go along with this. During recent visits to San Francisco, I've stayed at the Ritz Carlton, The Omni, St. Francis, and Mandarin. Of these four, the two that stood out the most and far exceeded expectations were The Ritz Carlton and The Omni. Ritz is Ritz, what more can you say. As for the Omni, it's a smaller hotel, but their guest service ranks right at the top. Rooms are equally as well kept and clean as the Ritz Carlton, and the food is very good. I stayed at the Fairmont with several relatives and friends while in town. It was nice to be at the top of Nob Hill, something different for a change. However, I had an incident in the room where the wires seemed to be dangling from underneath the desk. I could clearly see it was not connected. The wires were on my lap while using the desk, that's how low. I called front desk and asked if someone could take care of this. They said someone will be up there shortly, within 30 min. I waited and waited. I gave it an hour thinking maybe they're backed up or something. I called again. This time the guy on the phone said \"I show no request for the wires...\" What?!!! Not too pleased with this, I said, \"can you just have someone come up here to at least fastened this properly, so it doesn't always hang down onto my lap?\" Okay, so I waited after he said \"I'll send engineering right away.\" I waited... and waited. I finally called downstairs and asked for the Manager. I got the front desk manager. Funny, he sounded just like the guy I spoke to 30 min. earlier. Hmm. So the manager apologizes and says, \"did they fix your toilet?\" What?!!!! In the end, I once again explained the situation, only this time, I told him, sorry, but I'm just going to tape this or something because it's annoying with the wires hanging down. When I checked out, I thought, \"this is such a nice hotel, but boy do they lack the overall service a hotel like this should provide.\" If it's for a night where you don't mind spending the money and don't care if you need the staff for anything, I'd say go ahead and stay there for the experience of this hotel. But if there's anything beyond staying at a place with a bed, I'd highly recommend the Ritz Carlton or the Omni. Both just down the street. I was very surprised with the Fairmont's Management. Very under trained. Inexperience shows so, so much.

There was an 10 foot closet and a large marble bath. It was great. The bed was extremely comfortable. The sitting area of the room was large- with a desk and chair at which I easily worked. The seperate chair and side table were comfortable for reading. Room service was utilized late one evening when I was tired and was excellent., but as usual, costly. Temperature controls were excellent. And while I did not have the best view, it was more than enough to not feel cramped.

However, an unlimited usage MUNI pass is a great bargain. We bought a 7-day pass for $26/ea. Cable cars are $5 on-way, busses/trolleys are $2 each time. You can do the math and see the savings. Leave the car at home, and rent one only on the days you really need one. You can grab the Powell-Hyde cable car, go to the Hyde end of the line, and Hertz and Avis are within 2-blocks. We rented a Mustang drop-top, on two seperate days, for $140/day (rental fee, taxes, etc.). That rate was with a reservation. The Fairmont is located perfectly--all three cable car lines pass within feet of the hotel. If the cable car doesn't get you to exactly where you want to go, a short bus ride will.

As a fan of the TV Series Hotel from many years ago I was keen to see the hotel the show shot its series in. Well what a disappointment. On arrival we were greeted at the door and our bags unpacked and taken into the foyer. Geat start and a wonderful foyer with beautiful architecture and the old world glamour. As our room was not ready we left our bags and headed out to San Fran. Upon arriving back at the hotel my husband went back to pick up the keys to our room as we had checked in earlier in the day. The elder gentleman who served him was very disinterested and in fact at one stage said I have to go out the back and I will be back in a minute, almost ten minutes later he returned and said here's your keys, no apology for the wait - nothing. My husband was not impressed. Upon arriving at our room the room service breakfast trolley in all its disgusting glory was sitting right next to the door of our room, not a particulary nice way to enter your hotel room. The room itself (Room 1007)was quite nice and well appointed and we had a great view of the San Francisco Bay, however, housekeeping had not vacuumed the room very well as there were bits of stuff all over the carpet. Our bags were delivered by a very nice porter who explained about the features of the room and we asked him to remove the offending trolley of left over food from our door. Starting to unpack we noticed there were no robes or slippers in the room, so we rang down to the front desk complaining about the food trolley, requesting housekeeping come up and vaccum the room and also asked about robes and slippers. We were advised that that robes and slippers are put in at night with turndown (funny I have never found that in other hotels - but we gave them the benefit of the doubt). The robes and slippers arrived shortly after that and not at turndown. They also then sent housekeeping back up to vacuum the room and offered us two bottles of complimentary water for our inconvenience (big deal) in hindsight we should have just asked for another room as after this introduction to the hotel my husband was not happy in the room. Going down to the bar for drinks the service was quite good and we then decided to cross the hall and have dinner. My husband was in dress shorts and a smart polo shirt, (as we had been out all day and it was not a fine dining restaurant and we wanted a quick meal before retiring for the night) when he was told he could not enter as he had shorts on, but we could order from the same menu back over in the bar, which we did. However after being turned away we were not happy to see half way through our meal a family eating in that dining room with the man in shorts. Calling one of the restaurant staff over to query this when my husband in better dress shorts than the other gentleman had on I was advised that the other parties luggage had gone missing so they made an exception to their no shirts role. I advised them that if it was good enough for one guest it should have been good enough for all and that we should not be discrimated against in this manner, they apologised and offered to relocate us into the dining room, we refused on principal. On the positive side the room was nicely apointed and the bathroom was of a good size with separate bath and shower and a separate toilet area, however, the skirting boards on the bottom of the vanity basis were missing from under the vanity - not very good for a hotel of this nature. On the second night during of our stay at 11.30 pm the fire alarm went off. Well we were not sure what woke us and then had this droning sound, after a few minutes in which we expected if it was a fire alarm to have notification my husband went outside and found other guests wandering the corridor as well not sure what was happening. Upon trying to ring down to reception the lines were engaged, so we all just stood around not sure what to do until another guest came out and said false alarm. Not great if in fact it was a fire. Would I recommend this hotel NO, would I stay there again - a resounding No. For a hotel supposedly of the Fairmont Quality it certainly left a lot of be desired when in fact housekeeping and some simple customer service skills could have made our experience a lot nicer.

Cons: Location isn't great if you're interested in exploring the city; doors in the main building are REALLY loud when they close, so avoid it if you're a light sleeper; but the real problem is this hotel's service: it's is poor, particularly given the Fairmont reputation and price. 1) My husband joined the President's Club to take advantage of free internet service in the rooms. Personally, I don't think a hotel of this quality should be charging $14/day for the internet. But my husband had trouble accessing it (probably because he was new to the President's Club). When we checked out, instead of taking his PC number and taking the charges off the bill, the woman at the front desk spent 15 minutes telling him that he didn't log in correctly. Finally, she took the charges off. 2) Upon check out, we called the bell desk for help with our bags. We weren't leaving San Francisco until that evening, so we wanted to store them at the hotel. The bellman told me that we could just leave them in the room... he would be right up to get them. Guess what? When we returned that evening, the bellman on duty (not the one from the morning) couldn't find them. Turns out that they were sitting in our vacated room ALL DAY. And to add insult to injury, the bellman took my husband over to the front desk and explained that we had never checked out properly or this wouldn't have happened. Since we spent 15 minutes with the first rude front desk person to get a new receipt, we pointed out how that was incorrect. And again, instead of just apologizing, the bellman and the front desk employee went on and on about how we shouldn't have left without a claim ticket.

The hotel is gorgeous throughout. Our room in the Tower on the 19th floor had a great view, with a big bathroom etc. Location is fine if you are able to walk, and if not transit is at the door. We walked all over the city wth our young baby, and thoroughly enjoyed coming up the hill at the end of the night The staff for the most part were fantastic. We did have an issue on the Saturday night, as a function occurring in the Crown Room created the feeling of being in a night club. I phoned and spoke with an operator who put me through to the manager. She did not offer to do anything for us, and said she would have engineering look into it, which in fairness to her, is all I asked. We had no interest in moving as my baby was asleep, and we were exhausted anyways. Fell asleep despite the noise. All other staff including concierge for questions were fantastic. Most of the complaints I have read can be alleviated by a few easy steps: Join the Presidents Club, it is simple and easy, and best of all, free Your WI FI is freee in your room, you can access the gym for free, and they will even provide you with gym clothes to work out. It was on my way to the gym early in the morning that I noticed coffe and tea at the concierge desk. I believe this is provided before the restaurants etc open, but not sure. When it wasn't there I brought up coffe from Cafe Centro, which is much cheaper than the ridiculous room service prices Overall, if you understand you will be in a hotel that is over a hundred years old, and will be a bit noisy etc, and don't mind walking a bit uphill, and you join the PC, you will enjoy your stay.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to enjoy the city and walking to attractions rather than taking taxis or public transport, although the cable cars run literally from outside the hotel so no problems getting around for those wishing to experience the unique cable cars. The hotel itself is fabulous, the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and always greeted us with a genuine warmth.

First, since most people only write about the hotel, I want to write something about the city for those of you who are also first time visitors. The airport is large, and very busy, but there are a lot of cabs to the hotels, it was $40 each way. The location of the hotel is pretty good, however, if I were to go back I would like to stay in the Union Square at the Drake or JW Marriott, or the Fisherman's Wharf at the Hyatt. You are about a 5 minute walk to Union square, but believe me it is a walk, the hills are so steep here that we preferred to take a taxi. The Trolleys are located right behind the hotel. We took the trolley to the Fisherman's Wharf, it is $5.00 each person, but it is a hassle, they only stop at certain locations, and there is never enough room. We just took a taxi again for $10.00. So if you are staying at this hotel to be close to the trolleys (like I did) I recommend another hotel closer to the hot spots. Room: We had an exterior room, the hotel was sold out when we were there due to the 4th. The rooms are average size, very comfy king bed, small bath, nice view from window of the Bay Bridge. We signed up for the presidents club online so we were able to use the internet there for free which was great. Cleaning staff was amazing, we even had turn down service nightly. When we checked in we noticed our mini fridge was empty, so I called immediately to let the staff know, hopefully we are not charged for anything, I am still waiting for my monthly statement. Weather: Pack accordingly, it was all fog, and a high of 60 degrees! I am glad I brought long pants, and sweaters! Napa Valley: We rented a car for the day and headed to Napa Valley, it was 85 degrees there and only 45 minutes away. We traveled through Muir woods (very cool) and across golden gate bridge. I recommend going to V.Sattui if you like sweet wines, I bought a Moscato there that was to die for! On the way home we took the Oakland way, there are a lot of restaurants there, and then we went over the Bay Bridge home. Union Square: So many stores and restaurants, but very very expensive. Everything in San Francisco is expensive, we spent over $1000 for 2 of us in 3 days. Also there are a lot of people living on the streets in union square begging for money, I wouldn't have felt safe unless I had my boyfriend there with me, this was not something I am used to. Fisherman's Wharf: You must go to Pier 39 to see Alcatraz and the seals! PS. Do not eat at Joes Crab Shack, it was gross. Height and Ashbury Street: It is about a $20 taxi ride there, and it is full of young hippies, but the stores are amazing, I bought some really cute tops there. Alamo Square: This is where the Full House home is! But besides that nothing else, its right by height and ashbury street and an expensive ride for a picture (probably a good idea to see if you have a car) Car Rental: We rented the car to see Napa, we got it from enterprise on Mason st in Union Square, we waited about 2 hrs for our car so they upgraded us to a Mercedes which was nice. Parking at the hotel was $50, and since we only had the car for 1 night and we left the next morning we dropped it off at 9pm with the valets at the hotel next to enterprise for $30, everything worked out great. Overall, I would probably stick with Napa Valley, it is much warmer, and not as many street people everywhere, I felt a lot safer there. I am glad I was able to travel to San Francisco but I would probably just visit there instead of stay there.

We loved our stay there, with only a few minor exceptions. When I originally started planning our trip to SF I checked rates for the Fairmont and found it to be too expensive, so I booked another room upscale hotel in the city. The week before our trip I checked rates again and found a great rate on the hotels website. With a AAA discount I was able to get a room in the main building for $153 a night, but opted for a larger, standard room in the tower for $171. I thought that was a great rate. At check in DH decided to upgrade us to a premiere tower room for $50 more a night. It was worth the money, as we were on the 20th floor with a view of the entire city. The room was lovely and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was large, with a large shower and separate soaking tub. The only down side was that there was very little counter space. The service was amazing. We used the concierge desk several times for making reservations as well as various suggestions for travel around the area and shopping. They were always very helpful. Also, upon checking in, we noticed there was only one bathrobe, so we called and asked if we were supposed to have two. Within five minutes there was someone at our door with a second robe. Also we had drinks in the Tonga Room, and it was great. Only a few complaints. As others mentioned, there is no coffee maker in the room, or coffee conveniently available. A pot of coffee from room service was $20 plus all the service chages, gratuities etc. In the morning, while dressing, I would just like a cup of coffee to help me get going. I don't want t spend that kind of money and I don't want to get dressed to have to go looking for coffee. Also, I joined the Presidents Club in order to get free internet otherwise it was $13.95 a day. In the desk, there was a wireless router, but the signal was so low I could never connect to it. There was also an ethernet cable/connection, but it would not work either. I found a 24 hour help desk number and contacted them. They walked me through what I needed to do, but it never worked. He suggested that I might need a new ethernet cable and said he would contact the front desk and have a new one sent up right away. We waited for a long time, but no one ever came. I finally found one of my own in the bottom of my computer bag, and was able to connect with it. We were never able to connect wirelessly. I do not recommend the Sunday breakfast buffet. We decided to try it, even though $30 each seemed a bit high. We figured it would be wonderful. While it was okay, it was definitely not worth the money. The buffet did have lots of good fresh fruits, and some nice baked goods, but the main dishes were just not great and had a small selection. The selections of hot dishes were eggs benedict, French toast, oatmeal, potatoes, bacon and sausage The French toast was dry and stale, and the eggs benedict, looked pretty dried out as well. We opted for the omelette station instead. The omlette was okay, but not something I would have again. They did offer Belgian waffes as well, but we did not try them. The breakfast price included coffe and juice, and we ordered nothing extra, but by the time the bill came, with all of the surcharges added on, including a 15% breakfast surcharge (What?) it was $75.75 for 2 people. Really outrageous for a mediocre breakfast.

We called down to the front desk only to be told that the only room in the hotel available, was an inside standard rooms. No view and only a queen bed. (Only suites have king beds.) The standard rooms are very small. Probably, the reason for no king beds. The bathroom was only big enough to physically contain the camode, sink and tub. But, the standard room was more updated. The bad thing was that our room was right next to the housekeeping supply closet. So, in the middle of the night, when someone wants some towels or something, we were awakened. Even after several complaints to the front desk, the staff made no attempt to be quiet during the night. For the money, this place is a complete ripoff. I can stay at a hotel with a nicer, larger room for half the price. If you do not care what things cost, you won't mind the inflated cost of the room or $30 per person for the breakfast buffet, plus 15% gratuity that THEY ADD to the check (for a buffet). The service from the staff was actually OK, with the exception of the doorman. When we were leaving, he watched me struggle with our luggage down the stairs while he was chit chatting with another employee. As I got the bags to the cab, he finally came over and asked if we needed any assistance. I said well, not anymore. He did not like that and basically advised me (with extra attitude) that I should have waited at the top of the stairs until he arrived to help. I said I had a flight to catch and he should go and finish his conversation with his freind. Anyway, it's nice to pop in and check out the beautiful lobby, but save yourself some money and stay in a nicer room somewhere else.

Built in 1907, the hotel has beautifully retained its opulent charm. The lobby is especially stunning with its marble floors, staircase, plush floral arrangements and soaring ceiling. Upon arrival, the front desk staff was welcoming and friendly. Check-in was quick (due in part to being a President\u2019s Club member and having a separate reception line.) I was shown to my room (Main Building - Balcony Suite.) The sitting area furniture looked quite worn and the bedroom was very small. I was excited to see the balcony, but directly underneath was a large noisy generator which would have made sitting outside unpleasant. None of these would have affected my stay much, however I asked for a room change because my non-smoking room reeked of cigarettes. When I called the front desk, I talked to a very helpful employee who had my room changed immediately. He gave me my choice of 2 rooms and I told him to put me in the one where he would want to stay as a guest. His pick was absolute perfection! I was shown to the Calcutta Suite in the Main Building; what an amazing space! The bedroom had a king bed, television, marble bathroom and sitting area. Connected by a short hallway, was a 2nd room with a dining table for 6, couch and armchairs, television, a desk, and a second full bathroom! Being a corner room, natural light streamed in through the windows. I felt like I was in a luxury apartment and not a hotel room. I was grateful that although only 3 floors up, the room was silent. This is rare, but absolute bliss when staying in the heart of a city! Additionally, the views were stunning. (Being on top of Nob Hill means that even the lower floor rooms have amazing views.) During my conference breaks, I'd sit at the desk or on the huge windowsill in the room, and soak up the city sights. When visiting, I took advantage of the fitness center and attended a morning yoga class which was so soothing after a day of traveling. I highly recommend it! Fairmont rooms are consistently beautiful, clean, and comfortable, however it was the staff\u2019s gracious attitude and quick problem solving that makes them stand out from the competition. I will definitely return and recommend this hotel to friends and family. Side Note: The only drawback to my stay was arriving late and needing to eat in the Tonga Room downstairs.

When we arrived our server was there to greet us fairly promptly so there are no complaints there. Although the server was friendly, we soon found that it was difficult to communicate fully with him as his English was limited. We ordered our meals and wine though and then sat for more than 40 minutes before the first courses of salad and soup were delivered to us. We were confused by the problem since it surely wasn\u2019t a case of the staff being too busy; the dining-room was far from full. When we asked the server he wasn\u2019t able to explain what was happening so he brought the \u201cmanager\u201dover; she was a young woman who was training for her new job in the restaurant. She had no explanation either and asked us to be patient; I requested that we be compensated in some way for having to sit so long filling up on mediocre bread and butter (couldn\u2019t you at least provide good bread?). She gave us a free bottle of wine. Then the soup and salad finally arrived. The soup was lukewarm and not very tasty; the salads looked like they were pulled straight out of a plastic bag of Trader Joe\u2019s greens. Now if we were almost anywhere but the Fairmont Hotel this probably wouldn\u2019t have been such a big deal, but at the Fairmont we expected a lot more. When our $34 entrees arrived it was the same impression. The food was fresh but oh so meagerly placed on the plates. Now we are not the types who like to \u2018supersize\u2019 meals but a steak the size of a post-it is just not right \u2013 especially at these prices!

There was no way to make coffee in our room (the Fairmont in Sonoma had a French press in our room).

The cons were minor, but going to mention them here: 1) When hubby went to check in the day of the wedding, they did not have the room I reserved nearly a year in advance. However, since we were not going to be in our room until later, they managed to put us in the Buckingham Suite - no complaints there. 2) We ordered room service for breakfast and when it arrived, the drinks were warm. Despite being in iced containers, the milk and orange juice were both warm from having been under the tray. Not drinkable. Also, we didn't order orange juice, but they included it anyway.

So, the furnishings are far more luxurious than an average four star, but slightly too worn for top ratings. The beds, however, are very good and the linens are Frette -- wonderful. If travelling with children; this would not be my top choice -- stay at the waterfront! The Argonaut is a terrific, fun, hotel with kids, and there will be far more to entertain them. Likewise, for a young adult, there is nothing hip or cool about the Fairmont. But for the business or adult traveller, the location is central for business and restaurants and quietly above the fray -- no cheap t-shirt shops on Nob Hill! And the Fairmont is truly a beautiful historic building. The best thing about the hotel per se, are the views -- so book a tower room (this is admittedly not the old part of the hotel, but you can still hang out in the historic marble lobby). Another decent choice are rooms in the front of the hotel overlooking the roof garden, which is lovely. By all means avoid the interior rooms - there is no point in staying here at all if you are looking out at grey interior walls!

I assume that this was to get additional business because I certainly had not earned the upgrade. Prior to this visit I have only stayed at a Fairmont three times. Included in the mailing were certificates offering \"reserve 3 nights, pay for 2 nights\" and \"upgrade to a suite\". Even better - you could use both certificates for the same stay! I went to the web site and booked the cheapest room I could find and then called the President's Club line and redeemed my certificates. It was that easy! After arriving at SFO we took BART to Embarcadero, bought multi-day MUNI passes, then took the cable car up California street, arriving at the hotel around 5:00. We checked right in and were excited to see our suite. The front desk was very efficient and very friendly. We were given the Piazza suite on the third floor of the old building. My previous visits have been in the old building and this is where I prefer to stay. The suite is very nice - for starters it is a corner suite so there are lots of windows (and all of them open!). When you walk into the suite there is a hallway - go straight and you enter the large bedroom. Here you'll find a bathroom, closet, dresser with a plasma on top, chair, small table, king size bed, and two nightstands. The carpet in the entire suite was brand new. If you turn right down the hallway you enter another large room with a dining table and four chairs, couch, coffee table, two end tables, large TV stand with minibar and another plasma, desk, and chair. The main window in each room faced north out to the bay. We had a nice view of North Beach, the Wharf, and Alcatraz. Each morning the SF Chronicle was delivered to the room. I much prefer receiving a local paper as opposed to USA Today. The bathrooms are nothing special but they are clean and everything works well. Unfortunately, both bathrooms have a combo tub/shower. There was plenty of hot water and the water pressure was good. I thought the shower heads were too low (I'm 6'1\") and this is a pet peeve of mine at most hotels. There were plenty of towels and toiletries in each bath. The maid service was excellent, both in the morning and at turndown. The maids were very friendly and very efficient. At no time did we feel as if we had to call housekeeping for anything. I asked about chocolates at turndown and the maid told me they stopped doing that after 9/11. We didn't eat any meals at the Fairmont because there are so many great places to try in the area. However, the Tonga Room was packed each evening and we did get a mai tai to take back to the room each night. The Tonga Room makes a real mai tai - this is not a sickeningly sweet glass of fruit juice with some rum. Just the fact that they use crushed, instead of cubed, ice puts them ahead of most mai tais out there. It is definitely one of my top-5 mai tais. The coffee place facing Powell was also quite busy during the trip. The Fairmont is in a great location. You are right at the intersection of the three cable car lines. There are several bus lines that stop within a block of the hotel. Chinatown is a couple of blocks away. The shopping at Sutter and Union Square is right down the hill. North Beach and the Wharf are close by. There are lots of restuarants to choose from and some parks are close, too. There is no need to rent a car if you are staying at the Fairmont and with parking at $50 a day why would you want to? When it was time to print my boarding pass I used the free service just off the lobby - you don't even need to go downstairs to the business center. I did not use the gym but I have been in it on past trips - it is very nice and doubles as a membership facility. We like this hotel and we will DEFINITELY be back.

The hotel's hall is full of style and fashion, with great decorations and furniture. But. The service is poor, or in any case not as great as you can expect from a place like this. The room service is even worst, with - for example - no soap replaced in 5 nights, very quick everyday setup and cleaning of the room, a general feeling of ordinary service. The Fairmont with all his story is now very similar to a business oriented hotel, and in fact during our permanence there was a big business convention. Speaking of business: the Internet connection costs 13 dollar for day, and the printing of a sheet of paper in the business center costs 4 dollar (I spent 20 dollar to print the flight boarding pass!). The breakfast is nice, served in a great location inside the hotel, but very expensive: 25 to 30 dollar for the continental buffet. We found a good deal on the Internet, so we spent for The Fairmont what we would have spent for a lower class hotel in San Francisco, but if you had to pay a full rate we can never recommend this hotel. If you can find a good deal, it could be a good idea to stay in this historical location. The rooms on the California's side can be noisy, because of the cable car.

For only $1.88 you can get some pretty cool t-shirts. My NUMBER ONE suggestion is, if you're planning on going to Alcatraz, PREBOOK it thru their website. It is almost impossible to get tickets the day of or two days before. I learned the hard way and paid 2 times as much thru a place down there.

Fortunately, it was not too hot in SanFran while we were there...if we wanted to open our windows to the breeze (which, surprisingly, we could do on the second floor--no screens or bars!), we also had to listen to the trolley bells until about midnight as well as traffic. Beware that the valet parking costs $50 a night! With taxes, it came to about $64/night--absolutely outrageous! We normally don't have a car with us in the city, as we prefer to take taxis and walk everywhere, but we had been traveling south of the city before this and decided to just keep the car until going back to the airport. In other words, we paid $64/night to park our car and still paid to take taxis to dinner, etc. Do yourself a favor if you're staying within the city proper--don't rent a car!

Fairmont Miramar, 2. Inn of the Spanish Garden, 3. Intercontinental The Clement, 4. Napa Valley Lodge). First off, the Fairmont holds arguably one of the better locations in the city, right atop Nob Hill - great unless you have to walk up this hill a few times. So my first suggestion is to get a 3-day (or however many days your staying) pass for all transit and use it! It will save your feet. Two major cable car lines go right past the hotel. The hotel is certianly one of the most historic in San Fran, and the walls inside are fairly tastefully plastered with lots of memorabilia to remind you of this. The lobby is quite spectacular, with tons of marble and seating, all very old world style. Staff were wonderful with one notable exception - Rick. Rick was completely unhelpful both times I had the misfortune of trying to seek assistance at the front desk. Just avoid him and you will be fine! We initially had a room on the 14th floor, and the staff was happy to move us up to the top floor (23) the next day - so we had a spectacular view of the bay, including Alcatraz and the bridge. The Tower room was very nice, well kept with spacious bathroom completely swathed in marble. Seperate tub and glass shower - all the amenities you would expect. Beds exceptionally comfortable, staff all great (except Rick) and great location made for a memorable stay. Since I have a corporate rate, and also Fairmont President Club status was able to get an upgrade at a great price. Highly recommend the Fairmont President Club - one of the best in the industry in my humble opinion - and only 5 stays to get Gold status! This is nothing for business travellers. Would definitely stay here again. Only downside is, as with most large hotels, the price of food onsite is outrageous. I used my $50 food certificate for breakfast on the last day, and that did not even cover the full cost!! I have no problem paying $200- $300 for a great dinner at a top scale restaurent, but the idea of paying $60 for breakfast just spins me around. You can get a perfectly good breakfast sandwich, with large latte at Starbucks for $6.50. Nothing justifes 10x that. Wonderful historic hotel, great location (despite the climb to get there), great staff (except Rick), wonderful room and bath - no problem recommending this hotel.

We received a corporate rate of $229 per night and I can honestly say I've received better rooms at a Hilton Garden Inn. The room wasn't ready when I arrived at 4pm which was odd because check-in was at 3pm. So I waited a while and was assigned a room on the 5th floor. It was just OK, nothing real special about it, just a standard hotel room. The food in the bar and restaurant is WAY overpriced, but I guess that is to be expected for San Francisco. If you want to get to the attractions of SFO this hotel is not real convenient, but it is a short ride on the trolley or by cab.

We stayed for 4 nights and wish we would could have stayed for 4 more. If you remember the 80's TV Show called \"Hotel\", this was the hotel it was filmed in and modeled after. This hotel lobby will take your breath away. I have stayed in many 5 star and 4 Diamond level properties and this one is right up there. The stay was great, the chamber maids were extremely pleasant, the concierge knew everything about the hotel and the surrondings and the drinks at the bar were out of this world. The hotel is so beautiful that over the 4 nights we were thier they had 2 weddings a day. The hotel is located directly at the top of Knob Hill which is between the Union Square area and Fisherman's warf. You can walk to Union Square but not to the warf due to the hills and the grade. I can go on and on with my bits to make you feel comfortable about this hotel but I do not have the time. I can tell you that I we have booked this hotel again for our trip back to San Fran over Christmas. PS - I did forget one thing. The hotel has two areas for rooms. You can stay in the original side or on the new tower side. Here are the differences: Original Side - These rooms are larger, have 12 ft ceilings, all the old wonderful crown modeling, victorian type look and feel and all the charm. The only draw back is you do not have a view. You only look out over the garden area or onto the street. The Tower side - These rooms are not as large (they are approx 450 - 500sq ft not including the very large bathroom) The views are either of downtown looking onto Union Square OR directly facing the bay. We were on the 20th floor and looked direclty at the bay, golden gate bridge, alcatrez and China Town.

After my stay, some expections were met, others weren't. The Fairmont is a real 5 stars hotel in many things but some aspects let the expernece fall down. The building is nearly at the top of Nob Hill, offering wonderful sights on San Francisco. At my arrival immediataly 2 members of the staff were ready to open taxi's doors and take the luggage out of the car; they gave me a card in order to take my suitcases back after the check-in. The lobby is not huge but spectacular, one of the best I ever seen: floor and colums full of marble, beautifiul ceiling and carpets. Due to a misunderstanding between the hotel and my travel agency, my booking (2 queen size beds room) were transormed into a king size bed room. Because there weren't other 2 queen beds room available, I was upgraded to a larger room with a partail view of tha bay in which they placed a rollaway bed. The check-in was anyway fast, then a bell-boy immediatelky took our luggage to the room. Lifts and corridors are nothing special compared to the lobby; the size of the room was quiet good (about 30 sq. mt): there were a very comfortable king size bed in the middle, an LCD flat screen (37\" or 40\"), some lamps and 2 armchairs. There were a small marble bathroom (product's bathroom were Miller Harris) and a big closet. The room (located in the old palace) was full of contradictions: beutiful lamps but and old armchair, marble bathroom but an old bathtub, a beautiful bed and an LCD TV but old and not very clean curtains. And this was the feeling I had during my whole stay. Every morning they left in front of my door a copy of the US Today. On one day of my stay, SF authorities had planned to simulate a huge nuclear attack in SF's downtown. The evening before, hotel staff informed me about this event with a very detailed letter describing this training (in the letter there was even the street that would had been closed). A nice and useful touch. Staff confirmed their skill when I informed a guy about a stain on the rollaway bed's sheet. I wrongly thought he was a member of the housekeeping but I didn't need to call housekeeping to let the sheet change: this guy (probably a hotel's supplier) informed directly hotel staff. The hotel offers two great restaurant options: the famous Tonga Room and a restaurant adjiacent to the lobby that, as the latter, has amazing walls, furniture and ceiling. Since electronic check-out wasn't available on my departure date, I checked out at the front desk and they took me off the rollaway bed costs (90$). Another nice touch I really appreciated. I think one of the basic 5 stars hotel guests' expectation after paying a lot of money for a room is not to find a hotel where everyone seem to be ready to charge everything (another example of this king is the minibar that was not, luckily, an electronic one. At the check-out I was happy to hear again after a long time the question \"did you take something from the minibar?\"). And finally here are the issues I found that don't allow me to describe my Fairmont experience like a five stars one: 1. my room wasn't absolutely soundproofed. Always, especially in the early morning, I could hear from my bed many terrrible and very noisy door's slams. This was REALLY ANNOYING and out of standars for a luxury hotel. 2. something looked old and not being subjected to the recent restructuring: one the left carpet of the lobby there was a big rip, like on a sheet of my bed. And, as I wrote before, corridors, lifts and moquette were not in line with the beauty of the lobby. All in all, the Fairmont SF has all the features in order to be an amazing hotel: beautiful building and common areas, and a very skilled staff. They just need to bring to higher levels all the details I described. So probably, actually at the Fairmoint's rates, it's possible to find something better in SF.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place; worth the money\u201d", "Author": "mushmouser", "ReviewID": "UR19534043", "Content": "I'm a local to the SF Bay area and have stayed here twice, both when family has come to visit and wanted to stay at a fancy hotel in the city proper.

And, room service showed up not 30 minutes later with a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate dipped strawberries - now that's class. There's not any other places I've stayed in that are that thoughtful. The Tower has great views and is a bit newer, but the original building has much more character. We stayed in a deluxe double in the original two years ago and it was truly charming. Huge bathroom and walkin closet, beautiful view with large vertical windows that open and you can sit on the ledge and look out. Stay here at least once and see if you like it. Oh, and the Tonga room is a bit cheesy and the bands decent, but very much like wedding bands, so don't expect too much. Drinks are strong, so worth a visit just to check it out.

We stayed in room 675, which is the older main building, not the tower. The room we booked was a queen sized bed, interior courtyard view. There is no view to speak of - you're looking at the room across from you. That was fine and I knew that when I booked the least expensive room. Check-in went smoothly and they were able to accomodate our early arrival time of 11 am. The room itself was gorgeous and fairly large. The bathroom is a bit small, but nicely appointed in marble and the shower pressure is excellent. Great walk-in closet. Has the usual overpriced minibar and the dresser was kind of small if you were staying for more than 3-4 days, but the closet space more than made up for it. Very clean. The beds are the BEST I have ever experienced at any hotel (sorry Ritz Carlton!) and were so comfortable that falling asleep was effortless. While falling asleep was effortless, actually STAYING asleep provided to be the greater challenge. The walls in the main building are paper thin and the couple in the room next to us on our first night there was having the most major of arguments, complete with things being thrown around the room and profanities abounding. We called security at midnight and things did seem to calm for awhile, but picked up again with the same behavior. We could hear everything. Granted, these people were completely inconsiderate, but even when the tenants changed the following day, we could still hear talking - so just beware that while the rooms are indeed beautiful, your conversation and activities are not completely your own. The lobby is indeed palatial and deserving of its place in grand hotel history. Complimentary coffee was offered in the morning. We did not eat at all in the Laurel Court, although it did look quite nice. The other hiccup in our Fairmont stay was the Tonga Room - the lower floor bar complete with fake rain, thunder and lightning. We went on Friday night for happy hour, since we had read multiple times that this is the best happy hour in the city. What a joke. The buffet is a waste at 9.95, nasty frozen egg rolls and overfried chicken wontons with salty noodles on the side. Don't even bother. We were definitely disappointed in the Tonga Room. The \"thunder and rain\" effects appeared super-cheesy as well - to be honest, they do a better job with that kind of thing at any Rainforest Cafe. The staff was very friendly. Maid service was great. We requested a wake-up call our last evening there and it was promptly administered the following morning. Location is wonderful atop of Nob Hill - really can't ask for anything more with the location of the Fairmont in San Fran.

You also have the option of taking the tram, with two lines (heading to all 4 main destinations) quite literally passing the hotel. There were a few negatives - obviously its quite pricey in parts, but you should expect this given the initial price, etc. The Tonga-related bar was also a bit bizarre, with no real atmosphere and strange water and light effects every 10 minutes but we missed the live band which apparently makes it all worthwhile.

Everyone else talks about service and the lobby so I'll keep my review to this - don't stay here if you can't manage walking up hills. The Fairmont website claims to be close to the BART station, which isn't exactly a lie, but the map doesn't show hills. The Fairmont is at the top of one. A steep one. Luckily, we braved the streets and traffic and drove our bags to the hotel before dropping the car off at the airport after having been to Napa. Frankly we wouldn't have made the hills, up or down, with our luggage. Even without heavy bags, the hills do put you off coming and going more than once a day, unless you are either driving or are prepared to pay for taxis everywhere.

The California Street line took us down to the Ferry Building at the Embarcadero. While I wouldn't use cable cars as a primary means of transport (make sure you either buy a 1 day or at least a 3 day MUNI passport), being on a cable car is much more enjoyable than walking the steep hills of SF. This is a prime consideration as the hotel is at the top of Nob Hill. Our room was very large, with probably the biggest bathroom I have seen in a hotel that wasn't part of a 5 star resort. The bathroom was lined with marble, and had a huge shower and separate bathtub, along with a semi-private area for the toilet. The king bed was quite comfortable, and there was ample room for a desk and sitting area. There was a 32\" LCD TV, and the channels were all quite clear. If there are things to complain about: $50 a night for parking, and then 14% occupancy tax is charged to make the total nightly cost $57. For some reason, the maids were compelled to turn the temperature on the thermostat to the lowest level on the dial (50F, and set to cool), when the temperature outside was never higher than 60F the days we were there. We did not take advantage of any of the other hotel services like the restaurants or room service other than getting coffee at Caffe Centro on the parking level. There were too many great choices for dining that are close by, either in Chinatown or Union Square.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cGrand Hotel with Grand View\u201d", "Author": "IanUK72", "ReviewID": "UR17310820", "Content": "Arrived at Fairmont around 3pm to have our car door opened and luggage immediately taken off us by the bell boy as we were shown into the vast and brightly decorated lobby.

Huge lights and candleabras lit up this lobby to a great effect and atmosphere as people came and went. Check in was smooth and we were advised where to go. We had to the new tower on 27 floor I think with sweeping views of the bay area and brdige/alacatraz. It was mainly foggy when we went but that didn't make it dissapointing. The room was large ad well appointed. A King bed which was very comfortable, with desk and chair/business area with lap top access, chaise longue, bedside cabinets with I-POD alarm clock and LCD TV/HD were among the modern amenities. The bathroom was large with a large shower and bath, bathrobes, seperate area for the toilet and a good size sink area. All in all a very clean modern and well decorated room. Although we had a connecting door we heard no noise at all from fellow guests despite being near the lifts. I know other reviewers complained about this, but in the tower it di not seem to be an issue. We had a lovely breakfast in the spacious dining room. My wife had a buffet whichshe said was plentiful and tasty, with s seperate egg station, fruit, pastries, cereal and the regular hot and cold things such as bacon, sausages etc., and a fantastic banana cake and scones - delicious!! I had an A la Carte omellette and hash browns and it was very good indeed, rounded off with noce strogn coffee and a tasty and refreshing OJ! Went for dinner one night to find out it did not open on Sunday or Monday, so did not try it which was a shame as we were looking forward to a nice dinner there. A nice touch was free coffee and tea in the morning. Before we went on a couple of tours early, it was nice to go to the urn and pour a couple of coffees for along the way. Shame more hotels don't do that! Our 4 days were great there. We had little demands or needs as I had planned before hand. One question we did have for the concierge was dealt with off hand and a tiny bit rude, but he was busy, and I was not that upset by it!

Unfortunately, you can not buy a cable car pass at the hotel, but it was three blocks down the hill to Walgreens to buy the pass. A single ride on the cable car is $5 with no transfers. The 3 day pass was $18.00 for unlimited rides. It also included the historic street car along the waterfront and the bus system - but not the Bart. Between the cable cars and the street car we could get everywhere we wanted to go. Taking the cable car to Fishermans Wharf is a longer ride, and it is a long line to get back on at Fisherman's Wharf to go back to the hotel. We found the cable car to Embarcadaro - was quicker and the Ferry Building was a new find after many trips to San Francisco. From there you could take the street car to Pier 39 or Fishermans's Wharf.

Why it was hovering around the 70's on the Trip Advisor rankings when I booked is a complete mystery, though I see it's improved since then.

The king bed featured the standard super comfy bedding and high quality duvet and sheets you expect from a luxury hotel chain and set off an understated, elegant room that hinted at it's age but didn't show it. And what I mean was being over a century old you could tell the building was designed in another era with high vaulted ceilings, very large walk-in closets and a very deep tub but a more recent update had brought the fixtures and furniture up to more modern standards so I never felt it was too \"antique\". The mini-bar was hidden in a nice cabinet that the flat screen LCD TV sat on top of while the bathroom featured a nice blend of marble and tile. But the highlight of the room to me was an unique hanging main light sort of mini-chandelier that again was both modern but with a traditional sense at the same time. The pictures I'll include show it probably better than I've explained it.

And while the bathroom was a little smaller than I expected it did offer a very deep tub that was good for soaking the tired legs in after hiking around, or more correctly up & down, the hills of San Francisco. The Fairmont sits atop Nob Hill and never having been to the city I had no idea how steep the hills actually are so getting a workout just sightseeing left me with zero energy to even try the hotel's gym facilities so I'm afraid I can't comment on those, although being a luxury business hotel I'm sure they are up to at the very least an acceptable minimum standard. The soaring ceilings in the lobby serve to leave a very lasting impression when you first enter by the main doors off Mason Street and seem in a way to dwarf the check-in, bell, concierge and Fairmont President's Club desks. The friendly reception was very polite and helpfull and that was the impression I received in all of my interactions with the staff. On my last day I had a very late flight out of San Francisco International, around 10pm, and asked the night before checking out whether I could get a late check out or whether there was anywhere to store my bags and the main desk agent called over the bell captain to answer my questions which seemed a small gesture but was miles better than simply telling me to walk over there myself. I should mention while speaking of the lobby that both guests and those attending one of many seminars or events at the hotel occupy the many sofa and chairs and most were quite well dressed which made me at times feel a tad underdessed. I did forget to write a few emails until after checking out but thought I'd still inquire whether I could pay cash for some time on one of their PC's and was told yes at what worked out to be $1/minute. Needless to say I wrote two very short emails and went on my way. I didn't think to ask if this was the price for walk-ins and whether the price for guests was different, though I was upfront at the business centre about having checked out only 15 minutes earlier. One small gripe that arose during my stay was at times the walls could be a bit thin and I thanked my lucky stars the guests on either side of my room were fairly quiet. Once or twice I could easily overhear one side of a business conversation that went on for 5 min. with what sounded like a bad connection as the gentleman in the next room was speaking quite loudly. I can see how with the wronf guest next door it could become a problem and it surprised me a little as I would've expected a big, older luxury hotel to be much more soundproofed than today's equivalents. But overall the stay more than exceeded my expectations and I'm glad I got to experience this memorable hotel in what has become a fast favorite world city of mine. I couldn't fault much at this local landmark and would stay here again if visiting the city again as I felt it offered enough luxury in a historic setting without resting too much on it's laurels.", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "paphos", "Title": "\u201chappy returns\u201d", "Author": "retiredincyprus", "ReviewID": "UR14295564", "Content": "We returned to the Fairmont for the 4th time in 2 years and loved it even more if possible.We have travelled very extensively and even been to the Burj Al Arab in Dubai, which calls itself the best hotel in the world but the Fairmont is in a different league because the view is so amazing.We love the incredibly comfortable beds and linen and the new tower,where we always have a suite is quiet and enjoys the most spectacular views.Try to stay on high floor as this takes you away from the street noise.

I was in one of the corner rooms in the new tower section. I paid $290 a night. Overall, a wonderful experience. My room had a sweeping view of the bay from Coit Tower on one side to the Bay Bridge on the other. For this sweeping view, ask for rooms in the new tower that end in \"9\" (Rm. 69, 79, 89, 99, etc. the higher up the better). If you're staying in the old historical part of the hotel, make sure to ask for an exterior room not the ones facing the courtyard. Of course the higher the floor the better otherwise, be prepared to endure the street noise especially the cable cars that run past midnight! The room decor is traditional as expected of a historical hotel. Rooms are well-equipped with internet access, flat screen tv, iron, etc. The lobby, conference rooms, and other public areas around the hotel are beautiful, well-maintained, and full of historical photos and art pieces; worth looking at. The hotel staff for the most part are low-key but polite and responsive when engaged. They are helpful and very professional. The hotel restaurant serve good meals but very expensive but why dine in the restaurant when just steps outside the hotel are plenty of wonderful and unique restaurants to explore. There is a coffee shop a floor or two down from the lobby level, if you just want a quick cup of coffee and a pastry. The Tonga Room restaurant in the hotel is an interesting, kitschy place but worth peeking in and having a drink or two. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you want (and can afford) to indulge a bit such as to celebrate a special occasion in San Francisco. It's an expensive hotel but in spite of what I paid for my room, it wasn\u2019t as luxurious of a hotel as I expected. I felt like I paid mostly for the hotel address, to have the bragging right to say, \"I stayed at the Fairmont.\" :-) But to some people, that\u2019s reason enough to stay at an expensive hotel. If you're looking for value for the money and a more intimate, personal hotel experience, this is not the hotel for you. This is a large albeit luxurious hotel.

Being so close to the elevator we were somewhat concerned about noise, but our fears were unfounded. The room was overall clean, although the duvet was torn--something housekeeping should easily have noticed and taken out of service for repair. The minibar was well stocked, as was the bathroom with toiletries, however there was only one robe where two should have hung. The bed was comfortable with Frette sheets, and there was a large flat screen LCD TV. The bad--Our second day there we returned after a day of sightseeing to find the door to our room had been left ajar by housekeeping. Fortunately we had locked up all valuables in the large safe, but it was very unsettling to know that anyone who happened by could have walked into our room and taken anything they wanted out of it. The front desk was called and a member of the hotels security staff was dispatched to read the records on the automatic door lock so they could determine who had left the door open. We felt that the hotel should have offered a small something as a token of apology--a few sweets left in our room while we were at dinner, or a couple cocktails at one of the lounges--we've been comped far more for far less serious issues at other hotels without asking. Unfortunately the hotel offered only an apology for our inconvenience.

The hotel is very elegant and majestic. Upon arrival we were assigned a room in the main (original) building.

But the view of the bay, Alcatraz, SF and the surrounding hills was magnificent. The furniture seemed to have been in the room ever since the tower was built and needed a make over. The air-conditioning did not function and a service man came and had to exchange the filter. The 42\" plasma TV had a very limited number of channels and no foreign channels in English or other languages at all.

We had a fabulous weekend and the hotel only added to our wonderful weekend. This hotel has a beautiful lobby that reminds one of grand hotels of years long past. They just don't make them like that any more. Our check in was superb. We are President's Club members and that may add to the perfect service but I hope that everyone experiences the same friendly, helpful welcome we received. Our room was on the 19th floor overlooking the bay. The views from the upper floors overlooking the bay are about as great as you will get in the city. The room was a nice size with a very comfortable bed and nice sitting area and a nice working desk. I too, as someone else mentioned, miss not having tea making facilities in the room. We didn't even think about getting tea sent to the room. My bad. The location of the hotel is just the very best. A tip that we will share is that if you take the cable car down Powell to Market, and you are over 65, you can buy a month pass for city transportation for $10 at the green kiosk right by the cable car turning platform. They also have two and three day passes but the monthly senior pass is the best buy. They didn't even ask for our identification cards. Drats! So for the 4 days we were in San Francisco we could cable car, bus, trolley, or surface rail cars for $20 total for both of us. We used all forms of transport and went far and wide and found the service was excellent. And, the Fairmont is perfectly located to use the public transit services to the fullest. A couple of things did not come up to our expectations and we commented on these on our Satisfaction Form we filled out and left with the front desk on our departure. Our housekeeping services were not top notch. Every morning when we would leave the room there would be dishes sitting outside the rooms on our hallway. When we came back to the hotel in the evenings the same dishes were still in the hall and a full day's worth more dishes had been added. I don't know if the responsibility is housekeeping or food services but we found it objectionable. We pointed this out to the front desk twice and the dishes were picked up shortly thereafter but the next day it was just the same. And, the dirty glasses in our room were not removed nor clean glasses put in the room each day. When we call down to housekeeping and said we did not have clean glasses in the bathroom, a gentleman brought up one glass for us. I didn't bother sending him back for another one so we shared our one clean glass as I had given him the two dirty glasses that were still beside our door. (we tried leaving the dirty glasses in the room and setting them out in the hall - neither plan resulted in clean glasses in the room.) There are no chocolates on the pillows in the evening, nor fresh flowers or fruit in the room when you check in. This is rather standard in first class hotels such as The Four Seasons, or The Peninsula. The prices at the Fairmont are similar to the top hotels but the little extras that the other hotels provide aren't part of the Fairmont experience. Now that being said, let me tell you that we were in San Fran for my birthday and that came out at our check in. We came in that evening after spending the afternoon walking around China Town and found chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne from the hotel. That we thought was brilliant! First Class, Top Drawer and all that. This is not our first or last stay at this hotel. We would not stay in another hotel in San Francisco because we like many things about the hotel.

Not only did they extend our stay, they upgraded us to a high floor in the Tower with a king size bed(not queen as in the package) and a city and bay view.

If you rent a car, return it every night to avoid the hotel parking charge of $45.00. It's only a $5.00 cab ride to get back to the hotel from the Hertz garage. Avoid the Tonga Room at all costs. The hokey Mai Tai (in a plastic coconut) tasted like cough syrup and the dinners were comparable to a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall. It was so highly touted by the hotel we thought it would be historic and wonderful. They neglected to inform their guests that they were also replicating a1950's menu. Visit Grace Episcopal Cathedral which is around the corner from the hotel. Their philosophy is the same as Glide Memorial's. It's a beautiful church rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake and welcomes all people offering \"sanctuary to everyone.\" Don't miss the chapel to the right that offers solace to aids victims and their families.

I strongly recommend enrolling in the Presidents Club which is the hotel's loyalty programme (free), as this will enable you to use the hi-speed internet in the rooms and the gym free of charge. Otherwise there are fairly steep charges for these. There is a link to the Presidents Club on the Fairmont Hotels web site. There is also a dedicated front desk for Pres Club members. We found the room and bed very comfortable and liked the fact you could control the heating and air intake. On the other hand we agree with some of the other reviews which mentioned noise. The soundproofing didn't seem adequate to us, you could hear doors slamming, conversations in the hall and from other rooms, and if someone was taking a shower you could hear the water running. This may be a problem with rooms in the older section of the hotel, not sure. There was a nice large flat screen TV, but the remote control for the TV didn't work very well. We reported this to the management, to have it politely and promptly replaced by another one that didn't work very well. Not a big deal as we were out and about a lot, but not quite what you'd expect in this class of hotel. We enjoyed the retro vibe and the fact they had not over-restored the old section, thereby leaving the character and atmosphere intact. The lobby was stunning and decorated nicely for Christmas. If we had not found an internet special (we paid about \u00a360 per night) the hotel would have seemed overpriced to us. We stay in SF fairly often and so are familiar with the prices and range of hotels. Apart from the free NY Times delivered Mon-Sat other amenities were charged separately. However the bathroom was well-stocked with nice toiletries, and cotton bathrobes are also supplied. We were annoyed at the fact that there was no coffee-maker in the room, and from what we could tell no free morning coffee in the lobby as you often find in other US hotels. The Nob Hill location is less convenient for shopping, sightseeing and to get to other destinations, but it can be nice for the view. I definitely recommend buying a MUNI pass which gives you unlimited travel on buses, trams and cable cars (not the BART). I bought mine at the airport information desk; they sell them at various places around the city and you can get them for one day, three days, a week, etc. There is more info on the MUNI web site. If you are too tired to hike back up the hill the cable car stops at the corner next to the hotel. It is $5 one way if you have not bought a MUNI pass. I wouldn't recommend driving in SF (expensive, congested, plus there's plenty of public transport). We found the front desk staff to be polite and helpful. In our view housekeeping was also of a high standard. We did have some minor service problems the couple of times we visited the bar, where the service seemed indifferent bordering on rude. On the whole the bar had a nice atmosphere tho, with live piano music some nights. The hotel's gym is a 'real' gym, which was great and so well-equipped and professionally staffed (it is part of the Club One gym chain). We also liked the displays on the T level of the hotel, with old photos and menus etc from years past.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel - Good Location\u201d", "Author": "OhCurious1", "ReviewID": "UR11244229", "Content": "Standard King/Queen Room # 557 I couldn't resist the great deal I found on this hotel from TravelZoo ($199/night + FREE breakfast - which turned out to be a $40 credit for breakfast).

It didn't take long to check in and even though we were early, our room was ready for us to head up to. (later we noticed in the lobby that there was a long queue to check in and only 2 attendants) THE HOTEL: The hotel was already decked out with Christmas decorations and a Christmas tree in the center of the lobby. I was impressed by the lobby of the hotel - very classy, grand and beautiful. THE ROOM: High ceilings, new large flat-screen tv, and roomy bathroom (with comfy robes!). In case anything was forgotten, the room is well stocked with amenities. Bed was a little on the hard side, but we still slept well. The walls seemed to either be really thin or the people in the room next to us really loud. We could hear every word.... THE GOOD: The service was excellent, except for in the Laurel room. The waitress was a bit slow, even though it didn't seem too busy for dinner. Dinner in the Laurel Room was great, but not spectacular. Presentation was lovely. The ambiance of the hotel was very nice and gave off a relaxing and not to stuffy feeling. THE BAD: $50 for 24 hour parking!!?? Since they can get away with it, I guess they might as well....Breakfast pricing was steep as well - $29 for the buffet (albeit a very nice one) per person. I guess that's what you should expect in a hotel like that anyways. $13.95 for internet service in the room?? They should offer free WiFi! Walking to Union Square is do-able. However, walking back up the hill is a different story. It can be done, but be prepared to work your legs! We also walked down to Fisherman's Wharf, more then 4 blocks away, but that is also do-able.

At the same time, it lacks some very basic services and operates a little like a low budget hotel. If a few policies were changed, this would be a truly great hotel! As it is, it's just okay. The great things about the hotel have mainly to do with the opulence and reputation of the place. The lobby is beautiful and there is a lot of history attached to the hotel! The views in the tower are spectacular. From our room in the tower, we could see the Bay, most of the city, the hills all around - really great. The service is responsive, though we had an issue with getting housekeeping to give us bedding that was not down (we have allergies and the housekeepers did not speak English as we tried to act out \"no feathers!\"). Also, the general facilities are great with a famous old restaurant/bar (the Tonga Room) and a great fitness room for a hotel. Finally, the bathrooms and bathroom products are really good. The bad parts were the lack of basics like coffee in the room, free access to the fitness room and internet without having to enter a mailing list (the President's Club), and the prices on minor conveniences in the hotel. Why does a great hotel not have free coffee in the rooms? Shockingly inconvenient and short-sighted. Instead, the only free coffee is in the lobby area before 7AM. That's fine for business, but stinks for vacationers who want to sleep in a little. Instead, if you wake up after 7, you have to go to the espresso bar in the basement and pay nearly $10 for coffee and a danish. There are no inexpensive cafes anywhere nearby and all other sections of town are down steep hills, the kind you don't want to climb back up immediately after you wake up - if ever. There are no soda or snack machines in the hotel that I could find - so you are stuck paying the outrageous mini-bar prices, going to the espresso bar, or paying for a full breakfast at the hotel. It seems almost as if the hotel is trying to wrestle every penny they can from customers, which feels more like a much much cheaper place.

August 1-5, 2007. I have stayed approximately at the Fairmont ten times in the last 15 years in San Francisco. Love the town, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ve also had the pleasure of being at the St Francis, Four Season and Ritz Carlton, The best service in town. The quintessential SF hotel is the Fairmont. Solid on history, long on elegance, deep in tradition. The location is a few blocks off Union Square shopping. the trolley run in all directions from the Fairmont. Parking is high. Rent a car at Hertz but drop it back off before they close to save about $50. Their desk is in the lobby. This is a full service hotel. Exercise facilty is good. I called the hotel directly after using the hotel's online reservations. We asked for our main building suite with patio.(I highly recommend the patioed suites as they are perfect for lounging and breakfast.) I even verified a few days before if we could get the same suite (Karachi) that I normally like. We arrive and unfortunately the exact suite we wanted was taken. The Hotel was sold out starting Friday and they upgraded us to the Buckingham Suite. This is a very nice suite that is gracious enough to entertain easily 20+. We only entertained a total of 7, easily handled and the room service was superb, on par with Ritz Carlton or 4S. The rooms in the tower are very nice with KILLER views in the higher rooms, but I like the charm of the main building suites. Some of the front corner suites are nice for a family, e.g. two baths and a side room is available. DO NOT stay here if you are pinching pennies. This is a Big Dog hotel with Big Boy prices. (Better yet if someone else pays via expense account). They don\u2019t gouge, it is a premium priced hotel for exclusivity and old traditional ambiance. DON\u2019T stay here if you need outrageous attention levels from the staff. They are good but it won\u2019t be the level of 4Seasons or Ritz Carlton, maybe a B+ instead of A+ on that level. (Frankly I rate them A but my wife is more particular and gives them a B\u2026so B+) Maid staff A, Front Desk A, Bell A, Concierge B+, Restaurants B. The restaurant facilities are very adequate however in this town one doesn\u2019t go to a hotel for fine dining, well excluding the Ritz\u2019s Dining room which is extraordinary. One must have a causal night at the Tiki style Tonga Room. They have a nice happy hour. Hawaiian shirt preferred. Very campy but a Mecca for those who worship the flaming drinks styled ala Trader Vics. The convention facilities appear to be very adequate as I peered in and viewed a few large meeting over the years. High Speed internet is in the rooms. President Club members aren\u2019t charged but everyone else gets hit for a few $s.

He was there for business, while I was there on holiday. We have previously stayed at both pricey and cheaper hotels, but I have never been more overwhelmed than I was by the opulence of the Fairmont\u2019s lobby \u2013 it is breathtakingly lavish, with old-style glamour. Our room on the 21st floor in the new tower had generous proportions, and the bathroom was big with a separate (big) shower cubicle next to the bath. The room had an extremely comfortable super king sized bed, and the most comfortable pillows I\u2019ve ever rested my head on (lots of hotel pillows tend to be too thick, whereas the Fairmont\u2019s were just right). We had what would\u2019ve been a lovely view of the city and parts of the bay (but not of Alcatraz or the Golden Gate, which you\u2019d have to pay a premium for), had the windows been clean. The view was still lovely, just not particularly clear. All the hotel staff (apart from some of the bar staff, who seemed a bit disrespectful and slow) we encountered were friendly and courteous, without being \u2018in-your-face\u2019. To me, the epitome of high class service is just that \u2013 second to none, but discreet. The hotel is in a good, safe location on Nob Hill, which is close enough for a short walk to Union Square, but away from the worst hustle and bustle, and best of all \u2013 away from the tramps. It is possible to walk to most sights from the hotel, although you need to be fit (or willing to put in the work and ensuing pain of walking up and down the hills of SF). I spent, on average, about 4-5 hours a day walking, concentrating on 2 sights a day. Granted, I wore the wrong kind of shoes the first couple of days, but my legs (already reasonably fit from cycling) were in serious pain for the whole of the week spent in SF. It\u2019s been mentioned before, but is worth mentioning again, as many seem to have missed it \u2013 join the \u2018President\u2019s Club\u2019 before you arrive! It costs nothing, but gives you free internet access for your laptop, free local calls, free use of the gym and many other benefits. Negatives and alternatives: \u2022 It was hard to get a table for breakfast. This was not a big deal for us though, as there are plenty of diners down the road for cheaper breakfasts (yes, it involves walking down the very steep hill for a few blocks, and then all the way back up again, but you might need that anyway after the stodgy American breakfasts served). \u2022 The service tended to be a bit slow in the bar. \u2022 The walls are a little bit on the thin side, although I\u2019ve experienced much worse in other places. \u2022 Not sure if this is common in hotels generally, but our floors were never cleaned (not that big a deal to us, but this is not a cheap hotel. I only noticed it in this one because I dropped some popcorn on the floor early on in our visit, and these were never removed, which then made me notice the rest of the dirt on the floors that remained throughout our stay. No biggie though.). It was also hard to enjoy the view, or see what the weather was really like, as the windows were very dirty on the outside. They also ought to clean the peephole in the door, as it was difficult to see who was there because the glass was so grimy. \u2022 The parking fee of almost $50/night is extortionate. There are cheaper options, however \u2013 depending on how much time you plan to have your car parked. All parking lots in the area tend to be very expensive, but if you plan to use your car for half of the day, then a better option is to go to one of the parking lots nearby that charges per 12 hours rather than like the Fairmont\u2019s, per 24 hours. If, like my husband, you sometimes have long days of meetings, and come back after 7 in the evening and leave by 9 in the morning, you can park for free on the street (you may need to circle the adjacent blocks for a while for this though). Overall, I loved this hotel, despite its foibles that, in some cases, can actually be seen as rather charming. It is, after all, a rather old hotel, with the eccentricities and personality fitting of a 100-year-old high-class charmer.", "Date": "August 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "edmonton, canada", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced but posh\u201d", "Author": "SunnyMcWarmguy", "ReviewID": "UR8347729", "Content": "Stayed for one night at the Fairmont SF.

The lobby is breathtaking, with big marble columns and is lavishly decorated with plenty of seating. The corridors are furnished with interesting historic photographs \u2013 some dating back to the earthquake in 1906. The hotel only sustained minor damage, yet everything around the hotel was leveled. There are posters hanging from the various movies that were filmed there and of course the TV series, Hotel, and lots of photos of famous guests throughout the years. The meeting rooms are very ornate and seem perfect for a convention\u2019s needs. It seems the meeting staff is very much on top of things\u2014there were several meetings being held during the course of our visit and from what I could observe, it seemed that the clients were in good hands. The room was fairly small, but comfortably furnished with nice linens and towels. The marble bathroom had a tub and separate shower making it accessible for my mother who would not have been able to negotiate a tub. For business travelers, room features included a spacious work desk, a multi-line telephone with voice-mail and High Speed Internet Access. There was a Web TV keyboard for those without a laptop. Valet parking is a bit expensive--$49 a night, but parking in SF is expensive in general, as is the case in any big city. The valet attendants were very friendly and professional. We rented a wheelchair for my mother and the Fairmont gave me a great recommendation. This company delivered and picked up the wheelchair, making it very convenient for us. It was $69 for the three days we were there. Across the street is the Mark Hopkins Hotel, which houses Top of the Mark, a great spot for a drink with excellent views of San Francisco. The hotel is in a spot where each of the city\u2019s cable cars meet. North Beach and Chinatown are within a short walk, Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and Union Square are a cable car ride away. The hotel lobby had a complimentary coffee cart set up each morning. In addition there was a coffee shop one level below the lobby where one could buy coffee and pastries.

The lobby bar is in the same room as the Laurel Court restaurant. As in most hotels, drinks were expensive ($6.00 for domestic beer). We only ate breakfast once in the Laurel Court and it was very nice, but pricey. The Tonga Room is located downstairs from the lobby and is very tropical-cheesy, in a good way. The location of the hotel was fairly central, just a walk down the (very steep) hill to Union Square, etc. The three cable car lines converge near the hotel, so if one isn't up for walking, transportation is very accessible. While others may deem the area too quiet, we really liked being away from the crowds and felt very safe there. The hotel is located directly across the street from the Mark Hopkins. Make sure to stop by the Top of the Mark for drinks and an amazing view of the City (when it's not foggy).

Just before dinner a maid came by to offer more towels, turn down service with post cards and other amenities. We had two meals at the hotel: firstly we had lunch in the Laurel Court which has gorgeous murals on the wall, but I was not impressed with the food.. Lunch for two is approximately $50.00 We had the chicken quesadillas, and the crab cakes. The Crab cakes while expensive were lovely, but the quesadillas were cold and far too seasoned and salty. The Tonga room, was much more fun, and casual. Dinner for two there was $70 and I found the food to be more flavorful and of better quality.

Buy yourself a pass (which unfortunately for some reason they don't sell at the Fairmont considering its location). And a note to an earlier review: when getting off of the cable car behind the hotel, you don't need to walk up the big hill to enter through the hotel front door; simply enter through the parking garage in the rear, follow the walkway to the elevator, saves a lot of walking. Catch any of the 3 cable car routes right behind the hotel and it's easy to get to many places.

We loved the bountiful buffet breakfast, especially since our schedule did not allow much time to have a relaxing lunch. Our hostess even located us in the dining room somehow one particular morning to take a phone call from home when our cells were not working. Also the waiter took time to give us some unsolicited advice on the wine country which he could tell we needed by our maps and puzzled faces.

Bathroom was great and overall nice hotel experience. But, the food -- for its expense. We admittedly had low expectations of the Tonga Room and were ready for the rather faded kitsch and fake tikki flavor. But we spent $120 for the appetizer platter, 2 salads and 2 desserts with 2 cocktails. The appetizer platter tasted like Costco freezer reheat and the desserts also tasted and felt like freezer food. The descriptions were great, but the creme brulee had mushy grainy sugar on top (not golden and crunchy) We sent it back and received...The pinapple upside-down almond cake that was like a slightly reheated hockey puck surrounded by flavorless fruit salad. I don't know how a \"caramilized pineapple\" become cold and hard after cooking. The cocktails had plenty of booze in them, but were nothing special. I would go JUST for the cocktails and $7 appetizer BUFFET during happy hour. The atmosphere is unique, but it could be really great, with al the themed eateries out there these days! We also had lunch box service for a conference in the ballroom. 500 people, but only about 300 boxes, so many had to wait. Same thing with the afternoon ice cream.

We had a nice dinner at the Tonga room where a simulated thunderstorm occurs about every 20 minutes and the center of the restaurant is a small pool where the band plays on a boat which floats in the pool. The food was tremendous. Get the appetizer sampler plate. Really good! One issue is that if you stay for any length of time, buy a multiday cable car pass as it is a steep walk down the hill several blocks to the nearest shopping at Union Square, which we both do recommend. If you ride the cable car all the way down to Market Street it puts you right in front of the mall. The stores are huge and lots of selection. We ate ate at the Nob Hill Cafe, which was good for lunch and weekend brunch. The cab fare from the Airport is $40 which I recommend from a convenience standpoint, but if you know when you want to go back to the airport, arrange for the airporter through the concierge desk, it's only $15 per person and they make only one stop between the Fairmont and the Airport, at least when we rode it. They have adjoining room situations which might be fine for kids, but we didn't bring ours to this conference. This is a really neat hotel.

First, the Fairmont charges for use of their gym and for high-speed internet. It turns out that you can get these for free if you fill out a little form and join the \"Fairmont Club,\" which costs nothing. However, no one tells you this--you have to figure it out for yourself. This is ridiculous. It is a fairly expensive hotel, and should simply provide these things for free. Second, the restaurant is ridiculously inefficient at breakfast, a major faux pas when serving business travelers with flights to catch.

Beautiful view from window, and the window opened to allow fresh cool air in. I had a king size bed w/4 fluffy feather pillows. I thought the bed was very comfortable and slept quite well. The rooms were very quiet: no noise from the outside except for the occasional clang of the cable car(which I believe stops running around midnight) but really could barely hear it anyway, no noise from A/C, pipes, or other rooms. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel is any hallway conversations seem to carry and are extremely!!! audible, I could hear the housekeeping crew each morning and each night I could hear rude people having conversations in the hall and unfortunately it did wake me up. I don't know if it was the shape of the hallways, poorly insulated interior walls or thin room doors but it was loud, although once the talkers made it into their rooms I fell right back to sleep.

After this initial confusion we checked into our room in the older part of the hotel overlooking the air conditioning units. Not exactly The Honeymoon Suite! Anyway the view didn't bother us as the room was comfortable and spaceous. We both love the city of San Francisco so we were not going to let this ruin our stay. We got changed and went downtown for the afternoon. We returned to our room in the early evening and we were really tired after the flight not to mention the wedding so we were looking forward to relaxing in our room and getting a good nights sleep. Unfortunately the room was far from relaxing. There was a 2.5 inch gap between the door and the floor so I had to block it up with a towel however the room also had an adjoining door and the guests staying in the next door room had a young baby that cried virtually all evening and then throughout the night. I said to my husband that we should ask to be moved but he said they would probably check out the next day and we had already unpacked. They didn't check out the next day but the day after that. I saw the cot in the hall and was looking forward to a quiet night. But the next guest was a businessman, he was on the phone and then practising a presentation nearly all night. Okay his voice may have been loud but more likely he could hear us as much as we could hear him. We ate breakfast in the restaurant one day but it was quite expensive ($22.00 each + tax + tips for toast and coffee). I didn't find the staff at the Fairmont to be very friendly in fact the only people capable of smiling worked on the bell desk. The puiblic areas in this hotel are beautiful but once in your room you could be anywhere. I would suggest that anyone that stays here asks to be put in the 'new' wing.

Hotel staff was very accomodating, and even put in extra effort to place us in a room with a beautiful city and bay view on the 4th floor. I recommend traveling outside of the restaurant for all dining experiences. Sears is top-notch for a reasonable breakfast, and is walking distance from the hotel. Other \"must see\" attractions are a short walk or ride on the street car - such as Union Square, Fisherman's wharf, Masonic Museum, and China Town.

The Fairmont San Francisco is magnificent. From its ornate architecture to its sweeping views of San Francisco Bay, this hotel is tops. My husband and I stayed here for two nights over 4th of July weekend. The hotel is centrally located in the Nob Hill neighborhood, within walking distance of almost anywhere in downtown\u2014Chinatown, North Beach, the Wharf, SoMa, Union Square and the Financial District. A cable car stop is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel, for those who may not be up for the steep climbs leading to and from the Fairmont. Our 18th floor Tower room was very spacious (unusual for SF), stylishly (but simply) decorated, had luxurious bed linens and fluffy bathrobes, an elegant marble bath with separate shower and tub and was meticulously clean. But, the real story with this hotel is the incredible view. We enjoyed a panoramic view of the Bay from the Golden Gate Bridge across to the Bay Bridge. Alcatraz Island was in plain view. We nixed a trip up Coit Tower to view the city because there was no way it could be more amazing than what we had right in our own hotel room. We enjoyed the spectacular Independence Day Fireworks over the Bay right from our hotel room! It was an experience we won't soon forget and are actually considering making this an annual 4th of July trip. The hotel also has rooms in the main building which I understand are beautifully decorated, but they do not have the signature views that the Tower Rooms have. Be sure to book a Tower Room and request a Bay view\u2014you won\u2019t be sorry. We paid $279/night, which we thought was quite reasonable for a busy holiday weekend and for such an extraordinary view. The hotel\u2019s Tonga Room Lounge is kitschy but fun. We enjoyed a mammoth (and strong!) cocktail for two while experiencing the Bar\u2019s signature theme park-like thunderstorms (think the Venetian Hotel in Vegas or the Rainforest Cafe.) We didn\u2019t eat any meals at the Fairmont, opting instead to try out some local restaurants. We heard from other guests however, that the hotel\u2019s Laurel Court Restaurant was lovely and the food divine. The hotel\u2019s common areas are decorated most elaborately with gilded gold, ornate furniture and gorgeous flower arrangements. The lovely works of local artists are also displayed in some of the corridors. We didn\u2019t have an opportunity to use the Fairmont\u2019s \u201cClub One\u201d Health Club and Spa, however we took a peek and it is state of the art\u2014for $15 per day per guest, I would expect it to be. Our only gripe with the Fairmont San Francisco lies with its inconsistent customer service. While upon our arrival, the bellman and front desk staff were very gracious and courteous, we had an encounter with another employee that I can only describe as mildly offensive. Later in our stay, however, the service was very prompt when we requested champagne glasses (for use during the 4th of July Fireworks show!) We also were disappointed in the Concierge who appeared as though we were bothering him when we asked for restaurant recommendations. He then proceeded to direct us to restaurants that turned out to be closed (we specifically asked him if they would be open on a Sunday evening and he assured us they would). Luckily, San Francisco is home to so many fabulous restaurants that we easily found our way to a lovely meal. The disappointment we felt in some aspects of the service was quickly forgotten when we looked out our window to an amazing view of San Francisco. Regarding things to do while you\u2019re in San Francisco, we highly recommend the Museum of Modern Art, Alcatraz (of course), Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, Ghirardelli Square and a trip down Lombard Street (or UP if you\u2019re ambitious!) These are all \u201ctouristy\u201d things to do, but so much fun. You\u2019ll find great little Italian places to eat in North Beach\u2014don\u2019t be afraid to indulge-you\u2019ll walk it off climbing the steep hill back to the Fairmont! There\u2019s also a convenient market/grocery store about 2 blocks from the hotel-this was a handy place to pick up bottled water. If you can\u2019t tell by now, we highly recommend this hotel. We left our hearts at the Fairmont San Francisco and we\u2019ll definitely be back!", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairview Hgts Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDirty Room\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3598441", "Content": "The room was dirty.

The lobby area is so beautiful that, even if you do not stay at the hotel, you should stop by just to see it. There are two areas in which the Fairmont does not fair quite so well: The hotel has a newer tower--with lovely but much more standard-type rooms--and therefore the Fairmont is a large hotel in which you feel like if you suddenly evaporated into thin air, nobody would notice. Second, the concierge desk is not particularly well-informed.....Better to use the internet or some guidebooks to help you figure out where to go and what to do with your time. I've been to SF many times.....The Argonaut is fun if you have kids, but for an ultimate, classy, luxe San Fran experience, stay at this Grand Dame. If you really want to live, stay in one of the suites in the old section of the hotel. I should add: if you are looking for an incredible view, you don't get it from the old wing of the hotel.
