Entered 2 adults and 2 kids, and the rates displayed, and the order the rates were displayed, and the remark on the website all happening only with that specific hotel on the website lead me to expect different rates than what the hotel told me at check-in. After long conversations with Tourism Montreal and the Hotel, no one was able to explain why the site did that and displayed different numbers than what the hotel received, and in a different order. I had a choice of go somewhere else or take the hotel's manager offer which ended up higher than what I expected. What disappointed me even more was that I realized later that what the manager gave me and called a discount was actually another correction since the site gave me a 4-adults rate instead 2, but she insisted she would base the 50% off of the rate before the $20 discount as some kind of \"count your blessings\". Later I figured out the fact that the $20 was actually a correction, and then what she did was simply taking advantage of me not knowing that and charged me $10 more on the discounted nights. Now $10 is not much and am not fussing about them, but it only showed me a dishonest move from a manager of a big name hotel, and for how much? $10? off a 4 night stay of almost $500 in total ? Escalated issue to head office, and later got the message clear saying it is a franchise business and head office has no control whatsoever on rates. Aside from that : Pros: - location close to airport bus route - breakfast was good Cons: - Hot water tank in the bedroom closet made loud noise every time someone was using the bathroom, and that was very annoying at night. Reception told me all units have the same problem. - Mattress felt like a cheapo coiled one. A slight move on one side of the bed shakes the whole bed. I thought they stopped making those $200 ones anymore. (or at least it felt like one of them).

The kitchenette was nice, with a separate room for the bed, but the couch looked like it was from the 90's and had lots of random stains. There was only 2 of each utensil in the cupboard, and no dish soap - so if you plan on using the dishes, bring soap. The breakfast buffet was small and not too much there unless you like cereal, toast, yogurt and fruit - which was fine for us. The location is good - depending on where you are going. It is a close walk to Old Montreal and right next to China Town. To get to the shopping though, is about 15-20 minute walk, and same with most of the bars.

A meter in central Montreal on a Saturday evening! When we came back empty handed after cruising around for a while and asked what we should do, we were told in no uncertain terms that there was nothing the hotel staff could do for us.

The other room which has a door featured another TV armoir, a work desk, and pull-out sofa. The two beds were supposed to be queen size but they felt only a bit larger than a double bed. Also, only internet access available in the rooms is wired. This is a disappointment since only one person in the room can use the connection at once and you are tied to the work desk. I would expect wireless internet at this property for sure. The view from our room was not that great as we faced in the interior of the building. We were not bothered by this however since there is not really much to see directly outside the hotel other than a street and a few other hotels/buildings. We did however like the fact that the windows opened since the room did get a bit warm sometimes. Each morning a complimentary continental breakfast is available. The usual staff like cereal, bread, bagels, yogurt, fruit, etc are provided as well as 2 hot dishes. During the 5 days we were at the hotel, the only hot dishes were bacon/scrambled eggs or a disgusting cheese \"omelet\"/sausage patties. The best part in my opinion was the cinnamon rolls which were GREAT. Warm and very soft. My friend and myself intended to use the on-site gym but were very disappointed to find only a few mismatched dumbbells, an old treadmill and stairclimber, and a deflated exercise ball. The quality of the gym was quite poor for a HI Express. There was a bag of trash in the gym that was not removed for 3 days. Where is no pool on-site. The business centre has two computers, a printer, and a scanner. I couldn't get the printer to work for some reason. Luckily I had my own computer because the business centre was extremely warm when I went in at night. Overall, the hotel was very much worth the rate of $122 a night due to the cleanliness, size of the rooms, and the location. A 5 minute walk to China-Town and 15 minutes to Plais-de-Congres is a big plus. I would really like to see wireless internet access here though and perhaps an updated gym.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCheap and Cheerful, a great little spot.\u201d", "Author": "garthicus", "ReviewID": "UR56430837", "Content": "We booked this hotel via hotwire.com.

There is an egg dish daily (omelets or scrambled eggs), with meat (sausage or bacon), along with their famous cinnamon rolls, toast, muffins, cereal, juices, tea, and coffee.

There was Internet access available, but in our room it was only available with an Ethernet cable. That was acceptable for me. I understand that there was wireless available in the lobby. I have read other comments regarding the questionable surroundings. I did not have that same feeling. We were one block from Chinatown. Granted, on your way to the Metro station you do pass some strip clubs, but in the daytime there's not much going on there. We were only a couple of blocks away from a large IGA store, and we found that we could get food items there and prepare them in our rooms. That store connects into the large underground mall. I wanted to mention that when we arrived at the train station, I inquired of one of the cab drivers about the hotel location. (I was wanting to take a cab to the hotel). The cab driver, obviously not wanting to deal with a small fare, said it was only \"2 blocks away\".

First let me start by saying we took VIA in from downtown Guelph, to downtown Montreal via Toronto. I really do recommend VIA, even if they decided to talk about strike action the night we arrive (the Monday), and actually strike at 12 noon on the day we were to leave (the Friday). Haha, we were lucky as VIA was able to get us on the 630am train (ugh) which got us to an empty Union Station in Toronto at 11:30 am, a half hour before the strike took affect. But, once again, when VIA has everything operating, it is such a great way to go from dt to dt, no gettting to the airport, no security checks to have to wait at, and in VIA1 business the service is quite excellent , with full bar service and meal / snacks at a great price. Anyone want more infor about VIA1 (Business Class) in the Southwestern to Montreal corridor, just ask, i've done it a few times. Ok, back to the hotel in question. I am writing this review not only as a visitor to Montreal, but also as a loyalist to the ICHotels Group of hotels (whose brands include Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Intercontinental, and others). If you read my previous posts I really try to overlook what others have said and usually find the best of each hotel. We arrive around 5pm into Montreal and make the short walk, about 10 minutes, from Gare Centrale to the hotel. Check in, and the man at the counter is very nice. Get to the room and 'give me a break'...if you could possibly lay down the floor plan and pick the worst room, I got it. The hotel has an inner courtyard (open to the outside) but non the less a courtyard on three of the back walls. So, I get the inner corner room, looking into a dark space, with a window of my neighbour to my right at 90 degrees and of course the window across the courtyard. It only ticks me off, because, if I owned a hotel, this would be the last room I'd give away. This is the type of room they give to someone who got a way tooo good deal on hotwire, not the room you give someone who is a Platinum Priority Club member or anyone who paid website rate on the IChotels.com website, especially if the hotel still has other rooms available. But that being said, I called down and asked for an exterior facing room and they moved me no problem. But, once again, why would you do this in the first place. The first room and the replacement room, both different layouts, but both have small kitchen areas, which I've never had in any hotel room before....this actually came in quite handy. Now, let's focus on the 'replacement room'. None of the rooms have a safe, but that wasn't a problem, nothing went missing even with 2 laptops sitting out. The bed and bedding were the standard very good quality HIE (Holiday Inn Express) style, as were the towels. The room , as others have stated, is a converted condo, so you have your kitchen facing what should be the living area, which is where they put the beds and then the bedroom is used for the sofa and desk and the second tv. Why this layout you ask? Well, when we pondered this, it's clear that in order to comfortably accommodate the 2 queen beds, this was the only option. The furnishings are standard, simple yet solid, but not cheap looking, HIE type furnishings. Internet is wired, 'high speed', but , as stated earlier, is quite slow. I'd highly reccommend disabling your pictures in your browser settings to help speed this up. But, once again, it is free, so that is nice. The hotel is very convenient to St. Denis Theatre (where alot of the Just for Laughs shows take place), and St. Denis is like a really long Queen West in Toronto with a big mix of both unique and commercial stores as well as a gazillion eating establishments , alot with patios. So conveniently located that this hotel wins as far as location goes.. Sketchier as you walk east and north from this hotel, but still not anything to be afraid of, even at night. And China town and the downtown shopping area as well as the magnificent Old Montreal are so easy to walk to. The morning breakfast bar, included in the HIE price, was a mad house....but well stocked with attendants always keeping the items full. The first day was the usual , cereal, yogurt, milk, juices and the HIE cinnamon rolls and assorted breads. On the rotation; day 1 was an omellete with or without cheez whiz and sausage patties. On day 2 was scrammbled eggs and bacon. With it being so busy, thank goodness for the hotel not being that big, so I was able to grab a plate and take it back to the room. Oh, on that note, the elevators are slow during peak tyimes, so if you can, take the stairs. There are laundry machines in the back hall as well as a small tuck shop. The concierge desk seemed to always be covered when we would pass through the lobby. Well I did book this based on brand, price and location....but if there is a good price at the HI Mid Town I would probably go that route, as I stayed there before and it was good, but pricey.", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cPricey but worth it\u201d", "Author": "ngachacha", "ReviewID": "UR35084706", "Content": "Great Hotel, ended up getting a Queen -Suite?

Negatives: - I'm not sure if this is Hotwire or the hotel but we were placed on a smoking floor and told that there were no other rooms available.

The hotel has a pretty decent location in downtown Montreal, not far from the seedy Rue Ste Catherine, and right across the street from Chinatown. Only a couple of blocks away is Vieux Montreal, the old port which is really neat and full of great shops and restaurants right along the St. Lawrence and the quais. The rooms were very roomy, the beds were large and comfortable. Plenty of TV stations, in both French and English. The bathroom was neat, roomy, and came with the usual amenities. Also had a kitchen in both rooms, which we didn't really use much. Only complaints were the water heater in our one room didn't work one morning and they had to use the other bathroom to shower. Also, the A/C system was not up to par, it was a window-mounted unit, that was supposedly controlled by a wall-mount thermostat...well whatever, between the 5 of us, all fairly intelligent people, we could not get either room's climate control system to work. Luckily the windows opened, but that got a bit brisk overnight and into the next morning. Breakfast was alright; HOWEVER, I advise against going later on a weekend day. We got there around 8:30 on Saturday morning, and it was getting full. On Sunday, we didn't get there til 9:15am, and the seating area was completely full, with many families and obnoxious kids, with a long line out into the lobby, and people pushing and being generally rude to each other. I said to hell with it, and just found a Tim Horton's, conveniently located not far down Rene Levesque. All in all, I recommend the HI Express Downtown, but be careful on weekends, at it's usually packed, especially from May on with the weather being warmer. Plenty to see and do in the city, take the hike up Mont Royal, awesome view! Also, while most natives/locals have a working knowledge of English, most of the signs and literature is in French, and can be a pain to translate if you don't know a bit of French.

Our room was a queen suite, two rooms with a kitchenette. High speed internet was wired, but free. The TV had extensive channels included in both French and English. Amenities included were shampoo, soap, and bath gel, which was nice. The shower head was low, even I, at 5'8\" needed to duck a bit to get under it. The clock radio had a dual alarm, which was a nice touch. The kitchenette featured a full size refrigerator, microwave, and electric coffee pot, as well as plenty of cabinet space.

This one had hot entrees, the first day scrambled eggs and bacon, the next had cheese omelets and sausage patties. The attendants had trouble keeping the food stocked as demand was high. I had planned to have one of the world-class cinnamon rolls on my last morning there; alas, they ran out and were not restocked before I had to leave. Coffee is available all day long here. Parking is by Valet and is an additional charge. Cars are stored in an underground garage. You will want to take advantage of this as we did see an unfortunate car owner nearby whose car had been broken into by shattering the window. An odd thing did happen...the Valet rung our room with a cryptic message, stating something \"perhaps comical\" had occurred, without revealing details on the phone. We ran down immediately to check out the issue, seems he had knocked a cup of coffee we left in the car cupholder...but as far as we could tell, nothing spilled on the car, somehow the entire thing spilled into his pocket. We were grateful for his \"head's up\", but would have appreciated more detail about this inconsequential event on the phone, as he inspired great worry on our part. Nonetheless, kind, and he did not have to alert us at all. Chinatown is just two blocks away, and we were within an easy walk of Old Montreal. We took advantage of the outdoor ice skating rink there, which was fantastic. The rink is well used, but it seems the ice is groomed about every 1.5--2 hours. With music playing, it was lovely.

About a 25 minute walk to Rue Crescent for those who hunger the Toronto crowd. OVERALL Holiday Inn Express Centre Ville provides good value, however if you are staying for more than a few days, or enjoy having a full kitchen with a stove, head on over right next door to Les Suites Faubourg St. Laurent. It's the same building, same rooms, same amenities, same valet parking rates, and even the same furniture in many cases. Rates appear to be about the same.

The kitchen is a godsend, full-size fridge, microwave, bar stools, and a real kettle, not just coffeemaker, is great to have as we usually travel with some food items, order in food, fix some late-night snacks, or carry medicines. 3) Let someone else struggle to park underground (valet - fixed daily rate) with your overloaded vehicle 3x/day while you schlep upstairs with kids is another godsend! Valets carted up bicycles, strollers, and other wheels to the front door in no time flat! 4) Great closet space, two full closets & large bathroom 5) Don't need a big fancy $30 hotel breakfast for an egg & bacon strip, your family needs their own favourites - included! 6) Not just a family-friendly hotel, lots of diversity in the guests from the US & beyond, couples, partners, all visitors! 7) QUIET QUIET QUIET for sleeping at night !

We had a 1 bedroom suite w/Balconey overlooking Old Town Montreal. It was large with a full kitchen w/breakfast bar w/stools and a living room area w/couch and chair, Desk w/chair, 2 TV's, 2 HUGE closets and more storage area than you can use in a week!. All you need to bring is your table service!. This is the most centrally located hotel you could find in town. We walked by most of the expensive boutique hotels and for the money YOU can't go wrong with this location! Restaruants, Grocery store, Shops!. We walked everywhere and saw everything on foot except our trip to Mt. Royal and driving around the city and suburbs. The area was very nice!. We walked at all times of the day and night and always felt safe!!!. I don't know about the people who wrote the negative review, but we felt FAR SAFER than we do at home. The town is much smaller that it sound!. The walks are easy to anywhere and we had rain everyday!. The only disapointment was the rain and lack of a crowd to make those area that needed it alive. Many place in Old Town were closed all week due to the rain!. This is the place to go to set up your base for a great visit!. A GREAT LOCATION!!!!.

I felt safer in this neighborhood than in many neighborhoods in Boston. You could easily walk to Old Montreal, the grocery store (IGA), the Latin Quarter, and could easily catch a cab out in front of the hotel. As with any urban setting, I wouldn't recommend that one walk alone, but I would say the same to someone walking in the city in New York, Seattle, or San Francisco. It was really cold when we visited Montreal but we still felt comfortable and found it quite easy to walk from the hotel to different places in the city. The hotel valet parking was reasonable, especially considering that all guests have in and out priveleges and it is is affordable compared to other area hotels. We had a great queen suite room that was clean. When requested, the front desk provided disposable plates and silverware for us to eat our take out. If you are planning on eating a significant meal in your room make sure you bring your own dishes/materials. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and were eager to show us how to get places on a city map they provided. When the concierge didn't know where a small out of the way restaurant we were going to (recommended to us by locals), he called the restaurant and pinpointed it on the map. Overall the staff was very nice. The included breakfast was very comprehensive on the weekends, including \"toastable\" waffles, muffins, fruit, hard boiled eggs, cereal, bagels, english muffins, and more. The staff at breakfast was very prompt about replenishing breakfast supplies. On the weekdays there was less overall food but the same selection -- this was okay as there were less guests. We found the restaurant very easily. Just use map quest or drive down Rene Levesque and you should be able to find it. We asked for a high floor with a view and were given a great room on the 8th floor (the top hotel floor -- there are condos up on above floors). The only problem with the room was that it was really dry because Montreal was having a couple of dry, cold days. We had a great view of the old city though. It was wonderful. The price was great compared to other comparable places. We got an $85 USD deal for a queen suite room from the Holiday Inn website. Don't waste your money going somewhere else!

We stayed in Montreal only a few days, but the hotel I booked there is definitely worth a recommendation to any of you, travelers. If you're looking for a neat and super clean, quiet hotel, which feels like home away from home, that's the place to be - Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites MONTREAL CENTRE-VILLE. The staff is very friendly & helpful, speaks English well. Check-in & check-out were very fast. Indoor valet parking is available for CAD$10 per day and service is very fast and efficient too. We left skis on the car rack, we didn't have to worry about it. The suite is really large and very clean, looks very new and unused. Kitchenette - (kitchen furniture, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, electric kettle, no utensils or pots, pans though) with bar stools. Bathroom - bathtub - very clean - new curtains, soft & easily absorbing water, 100% cotton towels, new massage Kohler showerhead, hair shampoo, body lotion & hair conditioner (products by Lord & Mayfair). Living room - cozy & comfortable sofa and armchair, tv, internet, tv games option, paytv. Bedroom - so, so cozy, the most comfortable bed so far :-), huge closet, tv in a bedroom. Light in the suite is very soft and warm, lots of options to adjust it to your liking. Separate in the kitchen, living room, bedroom, entrance hallway. The furniture isn't tacky and is really made to use. So many hotels carry sofas or armchairs you don't even want to seat in, because they're uncomfortable. One more thing - it's so quiet - our suite (no.172 or 173 - 7th floor I think) had windows facing small street, no view though). The continental breakfast was a real breakfast (choice of teas, coffee, milk, juices, cereals, pancakes, choice of fresh bread, toasts, fresh fruit, boiled eggs, fresh muffins, jams, peanut butter, yoghurts etc.) Everything was delicious and fresh). Breakfast is served downstairs, at reservation desk floor, it looks like a little cafeteria with tv, there is a whole section where food is offered as buffet. There's also a lady to help if you need anything. I noticed they also have a gym room with treadmills, etc., but we haven't used it. There is no restaurant in the hotel - we had a problem with finding an open restaurant on Xmas Eve - most of the places were closed. I think the hotel was recently renovated. To me it looks like it was built recently. In one sentence - a great deal if you're looking for a moderate price hotel. Forgot to mention the price: I booked a 1 bedroom suite for the Christmas time, CAD$104 per night including continental breakfast. 1 bedroom suite accomodates up to 4 people I believe. Once you stay there, you get spoiled with the space. You go to another hotel where you've got only one room and bathroom, you want to go back .We had a great time, if planning another trip to Montreal, we don't have to worry about chosing hotel. Check the map of Montreal for tourist attractions - it's close to the Old Montreal and Chinatown, within walking distance to many places, metro is close & convenient.

There was a TV in the living room area, and in the bedroom which is good if you can't agree on what to watch when you crash after a long day. Old Montreal is a less than 10 minute walk away. I would highly recommend a little restaurand called Jardins Nelson. They have an open garden area where you can sit, and live jazz is always playing in the evenings. It was perfect. For Shopping St. Catherine St. is about a 10 minute walk with lots of unique shops. We walked most of the street and were too tired to walk back, so we took the subway system which was very easy to figure out and pretty clean. If you're thinking of doing some cooking in the kitchenette (which only has a microwave), make sure to bring some plates and cutlery. There is nothing of the kind in the room, not even glasses. Odly though, there was a dishwasher in our kitchenette. The morning breakfast bar was really nice. Tons of stuff, you'll be more than full. The only complaint I have is the airconditioning. It worked fine, but because the airconditioner was in the living room, I found the bedroom to be significantly warmer in temp. It didn't bother my sister at all, but just a heads up for those sensitive to the heat. Overall, I would definately go back. The best part was how clean the room was.

Close to beautiful Old Montreal. Very easy to get to from the highway, you don't need to navigate your way through annoying one way streets to get there! I would suggest when you get there, you park and leave the car at the hotel. Walking in Montreal is great, lots of people watching and things to see. The metro is the best way to get around. Service: Our room was not ready when we first arrived around noon, but they allowed us to park our car and keep our luggage at the hotel as they got it ready. We walked to a nearby place for a great lunch, came back, and they gave us our room key. Unfortunately when we walked in we found it was not cleaned, but no problem - we called the front desk and they sent someone up to us right away with keys to a different room down the hall that was spotless and ready to go. Room: Very spacious, clean and nice. Everything is new. Suite was the same price as a room, so we booked that - had a kitchen and living room area with a pull out couch, and a seperate bedroom with a queen size bed. Air conditioners in each room. Very comfortable, and again, CLEAN, which is the most important thing! Not super fancy, but good for the price. Breakfast Buffet: Unfortunately we didn't get to see this as we didn't realize it stopped at 10am on weekdays. Breakfast is one of the best meals to eat out in Montreal anyhow, so we made the most of it. Parking: Valet, $20 a night. The Valets are great and very helpful.

Bring your own, bring some up from breakfast or you will not be able to use the kitchen. 2. There is absolutely no way we could find to avoid the parking charge which seems to be up to $16 a day (with taxes this becomes $19 a day). 3. This has been said before - many rooms do not have AC in both the living area and bedroom. We travel with two little kids, and the living area was not air conditioned. The vents are not connected to anything. The bedroom had a portable AC unit, and by the time we had everything unpacked we were too lazy to ask to be moved - so make sure in advance! 4. This is sort of trivial, but... $142 canadian is actually $23 more per night - $2 a night city tax, and two more taxes added on - so budget accordingly! The reception and parking staff were very helpful, the other staff could be better: we had a toilet overflow, and while it was repaired when we were out of the room, the sewage soaked towels were left on the bathroom floor.

The bedroom only had space for a full (double) bed. Perhaps it's because I paid a lower rate of 106 CAD (ichotels internet special)!!

First off the suites are BIG. Yes, they are bigger than some 1 bedroom apartments. Clean and modern. They lack central air conditioning, but have 1-2 portable units per suite, one in the bedroom and one in the livingroom. Make sure you get a suite with 2, our first suite had only 1, and it was hot (30+ degrees celcius outside). The rooms were a little smokie (other rooms on the floor are smoking rooms) but after a little airing out they were fine. One bedroom with queensized bed and double hide away bed outside. Big shower tub - very clean. The kitchen was big (microwave, fridge, cofeemaker and dishwasher, no stove?) but had no cutlery. I almost think this building was built as a apartment building then converted or is going to be converted. 2 TVs with french and english cable chanels, PPV of course. Free ethernet internet (weak wireless signal is present). 2 phones. The desk service for the most part was good. One grumpy receptionist, but the concerge and the valet were very polite and even tried to get us tickets to a sold out show. There is NO parking around the hotel. The valet service is the only option, and it's secured underground according to the valet. $12 a day. If you plan on being downtown you could probably get away without a car as the metro is walking distance. Otherwise just factor that into the price. For the price of $135 CDN per night I cannot complain at all. The immediate neighbourhood is somewhat sketchy. Like being downtown in any large city. A few street people. But two blocks over is chinatown, which is very nice, one block east is St. Denis (where the locals go to drink/eat/party) and one black north is St. Catherines (where the tourists go to show/drink/eat/party). The conference center is less than a 10 minute walk away. (probably 5 minutes, but you have to wait for the lights). All in all a very nice hotel for the price.

It is very clean throughout, everywhere. The rooms are quite spacious and cozy, very comfortable. Having a complete kitchen (full sized fridge, microwave, sink, dishwasher, coffee/tea maker, kettle, etc) was terrific !! I had a suite, ie., main room and bedroom with queen sized bed. I was here last week for 2 days, but would have liked to stay longer. The breakfast buffet was quite nice and filling, lots to choose from. The breakfast room had a nice cozy feel to it, very relaxing. You can even sit in the breakfast room after breakfast hours and read a complimentary paper (in English or Francais) and have a coffee or tea. They have the coffee and tea brewing here on hand all day long! No one bothers you, it is enjoyable! Staff was nice/okay; they were very efficient in their jobs. I would like to make a comment on the area of the hotel; it is okay, not bad bad as some reviewers have said. Just use your 'street smarts' like anywhere else. TIP: If you are using the Metro (subway) at night and you want to avoid the 'seedy' areas when you leave the subway for the hotel, then take the subway station called CHAMP DE MARS on the orange line. It is a couple of blocks south of the hotel; you will avoid the socalled seedy area completely. Overall it is a terrific hotel, I have no complaints as such. I paid $119 per day for my room/suite. Breakfast is included of course. I would definitely stay here again. It is like a home away from home. There is a big IGA grocery store 3 blocks away at a mall called COMPLEXE DESJARDINS -- easy walking distance. So you can bring stuff back to your room for a snack or nightcap, drink, etc. Double thumbs up on this hotel !!", "Date": "May 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent sevice, excellent rooms, excellent price, best place in town\u201d", "Author": "r100g", "ReviewID": "UR3376884", "Content": "I went to Montreal to attend and international conference from April 8 to the 15th, 2005. There were 11 professors going from my institution and I was the only one at the Holiday Inn Express. Everyone agreed that I had gotten the best deal in town!!! The staf at the hotel is excellent (Tina, Pasqual, and ViVi especially), the service terrific, the rooms are clean, with a nice mattress and a soft comforter. They have a small kitchen and, in my case, I had a one bedroom suite with two TVs. There is free wireless internet available in the rooms, and the continental breakfast even offered hard-boiled eggs, together with baglels, cinammon rolls, juices, hot coffee, chocolate, and different types of tea. There is parking available for a reasonable fee, the subway is within walking distance, and there is a large supermarket two blocks away, as well as a very nice mall (Les Jardines) Chinatown and Old Montreal are within a 10 minute walk too. As everyone said, I had the best deal in town since I could do my work in the room, prepare a small dinner in my kitchen, enjoy a great breakfast for free, and even use the bussiness center 24/7!!! Please do not be deterred by the reviewers that mention the subway stop as being near a seedy area! You can almost by-pass it by taking a longer route. The city is safe and the people are very nice.

The main shopping areas of St. Catherine Street and the train station are a couple of subway stops or short taxi ride. The staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The rooms are clean, spacious and well appointed. I stayed twice within a week either side of a couple of days in Quebec City. Both rooms were suites, the first with amazing views across to city hall; both huge, super-comfortable beds and sofas, kitchen areas with fridge, freezer and microwave. The complimentary buffet breakfast was amazing - loads of choice, fresh bagels, fruit, cereals, pastries and delicious cinamon rolls, yummy!

Getting to one of the four nearby Metro stops (St. Laurent) requires walking past a few derelict buildings and peep show shops, and maybe a few grubby-looking folks, but my wife and our toddler did the five-minute walk nine or ten times, once late at night after an Expos game, and at no time did I feel remotely unsafe. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< I not only agree completely, and note that identical complaints could be made about several fancy Montreal hotels e.g. the Hyatt, which is within a couple of blocks of one of the densest concentrations of \"contact\" strip bars and hooker hotels in the city, much closer than the Hotel Suites Le Faubourg is to any specific allegedly \"seedy\" area.
