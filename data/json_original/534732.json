I DID NOT follow Trip Advisor's recommendations on this hotel after the glowing report on the crap-hole the week before but rather did other research. It was a clean place, lobby smells a bit weird but otherwise the room entrances are all indoors, the beds are clean, fresh and lovely. It's quiet, roomy and for the price, a great value. A bit removed from everything in Daytona but only by a few miles. It served its purpose and that was for a quiet night of rest.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerset West, Western Cape, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cPorter Family\u201d", "Author": "Stephen P", "ReviewID": "UR136375245", "Content": "we had a great time staff very friendly,helpful always on top of things.Sandra advised us on transport around the area and also assisted in hiring a car for the family.We will certainly return here someday.Thank you again for making this a pleasant stay", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Hill, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt was super!\u201d", "Author": "BXDIVER", "ReviewID": "UR135786140", "Content": "Stayed here overnight and my experience was excellent.

Was given a second floor room (204). While trying to get my stuff upstairs, I couldn't get the elevator to work. The guy came over and pounded the button and I was able to get to my room. As soon as I walked in, the room smelled as if someone had peed all over the entryway floor. As it wasn't so bad further inside I ignored it and got ready for some sleep, choosing the far bed. Thought I'd watch TV for a few minutes as I dozed off, but something was wrong with it . . . at that point I wasn't going to complain. Slept really well for about twelve hours. Headed downstairs about 9:50 a.m. for some breakfast . . . couldn\u2019t get the elevator to work. Finally found the stairway, and with my knee screaming at me, made it to the lobby. Breakfast ended at 9:00 a.m. (not 10:00 a.m. like everywhere else)! My fault for not checking beforehand, but still . . . Limped back up stairs. Called the front desk three times for a late checkout . . . no one answered, so I left a message on the manager\u2019s voicemail. Over the next hour, I was threatened and harassed several times even though the front desk eventually got back to me and said the extra hour I needed was fine. To their credit, the elevator was working again when I left. Place is clean and looks fine, though I can't vouch for any of the amenities as I didn\u2019t use them. Will be in Daytona for a few more days, but will not be spending them here!!!", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price\u201d", "Author": "Jerry-retired", "ReviewID": "UR127686775", "Content": "This Super 8 is a good value with nive rooms for a reasonable price.
