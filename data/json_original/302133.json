{"Reviews": [{"Content": "First Class Hotel The Shangri La Hotel is conveniently situated for access to the major features in Hong Kong. It is an easy walk to the Nathan Road shopping area as well as being close to the harbour and the ferries to the Island and elsewhere.We booked a standard room as we were only there for a 2 night stay and found it to be well up to the standard you would expect from the Shangri La chain. The view however was of another tall office building but with a bit of a stretch you could also see the boats on the water. No complaints about the facilities in the room.We had not pre-booked breakfast and found it to be vary varied with Chinese, Japanese and European options, but a bit expensive. Had we have found a simple (non-Chinese) breakfast alternative nearby we would probably have opted to take it.Overall a pretty good hotel.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR740996562", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "terry_liz_morris"}, {"Content": "Kowloon Shangri La - A great place to stay       Another view form the room", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR226501848", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "L&JinVA"}, {"Content": "Loved it!

The concierge service was also the best we have experienced so far.They were very helpful about guiding us to choose our day tours and shopping along with precise travel tips and choosing the right local transport.The staff was very courteous and friendly. My 13 year old son also enjoyed the temperature controlled pool at the hotel.He would wait to go to the pool as soon as we reached back at the hotel.

The hotel is lavishly decorated. The lobby area has a great atmosphere with music playing lightly, the fountain running, people chatting and drinking at the bar, all against the backdrop of the dramatic views of the HK island skyline.The staff were very efficient and helpful and takes the time to smile and greet you every time they pass you. The rooms were sufficiently large, well air-conditioned (very important in the hot and humid HK weather), very quiet and very nicely decorated - not modern in decor but quite traditional with a sense of warmth and coziness. Our only comment is that a flat screen TV would have made the room perfect as most of other 5 star hotels have them.The bed was extremely comfortable, the pillows gave great support and the linen very soft - just what tired tourists like ourselves needed!!The welcome tea and fruit was very much appreciated - although it would be better if it was provided for each other night of stay......We also had the opportunity to use the gym facilities which was great - they provide light fruit water drinks there and the facilities were modern and well maintained as you would expect.......the only disappointment was the size of the swimming pool which was more like a spa rather than a pool one could do laps.The hotel is also great for anyone who likes gazing at luxury cars - the undercover area just outside the front doors are always parked with about 20 or so cars comprising of Bentleys, Lamborginis, Maseratis, Mercedes, BMWs, Lexuses, Porsches and more!!Overall, we had a great stay at this hotel and our only disappointment was that we had too many family committments and did not spend enough time at the hotel restaurant or bar - we would have loved to try the afternoon tea there but maybe that is something we can try next time when we go back to stay at the Kowloon Shangri-La", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR799740000", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "KeenTravellers2"}, {"Content": "KOOL KOWLOON We stayed at the Shangri La for a 2 night stopover on our way to Australia. The hotel was fabulous and we had booked, as a 10th wedding anniversary treat, a deluxe harbour view room which was just spectacular. The views of the bustling harbour below were out of this world and the room itself was very grand with nice toiletries and little touches that made our stay even more enjoyable. The afternoon tea served in our room was an added bonus. The hotel itself is centrally located for all the usual sight seeing spots and its easy access from the airport. Make sure you get the airport express train from the airport as its quick and cheap. Once you arrive at Kowloon station there is then a free hotel bus shuttle that takes you to the hotel. The staff were always pleasant and happy to assist with any requests and the restaurants in the hotel are also very good. The 2 nights we were there we ate at the Tapas Bar and Angelinis and these were excellent. If you fancy splashing out then head to the Peninsula Hotel and the Felix Bar on the top floor for the best views of the harbour at night and note that every night at 8pm there is a laser show on the waters front which again is impressive.

My only regret as that we were not here for longer.We had booked a standard city view room through trailfinders but were given the option to pay for an upgrade to the horizon floor upon check in. We decided to go for this as it included buffet breakfast (gorgeous buffet and cooked to order breakfast in horizon club), access to the club lounge with free drinks (including coctails) and delicious hour deuves between 6pm-8pm. It also meant we got a room on the horizon floor with floor to ceiling windows and the most amazing view of Hong Kong island accross the harbour.It was not a cheap stay by any means but we left feeling we had had an amazing experience and value for money.The room was lovely and had a huge comfortable bed, a massive bathroom with walk in shower and a bath and everything was just really nicely fitted. There was an abundance of quality toiletries (Loccitane) and these were constantly replenished. The bathrobes and slippers were bright white and really soft and fluffy.The thing that really made the stay so nice though was the staff, nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel really special. I was given flowers on arrival (as we were honeymooning I think!), a lovely basket of chinese tea was brought up to our room and a basket of fruit, and one night chocolates were left by the bed. The turn down service was discreet and we were never disturbed and I love how they put a glass and a complimentary bottle of mineral water by the bed each night.The location was excellent, right by the harbour and about a 10 minute walk along the waterfront to the Star Ferry. The entrance to the MTR was also just a couple of minutes away.I just loved this hotel and could go on and on,and it knocked the socks off the Four Seasons which we stayed in in Sydney. I will definately be using other Shangri la hotels in the future.Myself and my husband will always remember sitting in the club lounge watching the city light up whilst sipping cocktails.

My husband and I visited Hong Kong for a baby moon the first weekend of June and our stay at the Kowloon Shangri-La was wonderful.As soon as we arrived and barely gotten out of our car ,2 hotel employees greeted us and welcomed us to the hotel. It was as if they knew we were coming. It was a very nice touch that made us feel specialWe upgraded to a harbor view room which was not cheap. It works out to about $100 U.S. dollars extra a night. We were glad we did upgrade though. The view was wonderful to come home to and wake up to each day. The room was very modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The food at the buffet restuarant was very good. The concierge desk was extremely helpful. They got to know my husband and I well and were very patient with all of our questions. The only issue we had with the hotel was during check out. We paid for our rooms through a package and they tried to charge us again for them. We aren't quite sure if this was an accident or not. Just be sure to look over your bill closely. Hong Kong Tips:Tours- We took a city tour the first day and it was helpful. The guide gave helpful information about getting around. Safety tips, food tips, etc. The tour itself wasn't all that great though. If we could have had a sit down with just the tour guide that would have been ideal. So don't bother with the tours. They limit you in regards to time. You might get somewhere and be bored and are stuck until the tour moves on or somewhere great and have to leave to soon. Restaurants:Aqua is an absolute must! It's on the 59th floor and the view is amazing. It's very trendy and the decor is really cool. The food is excellent. It's a mixute of italian and seafood. The prices were pleasantly lower than expected. Museum of Art: Spend your time doing something else. The museum was very nice but the art is quite boring. I come from a family of artists and enjoy going to museums but the Hong Kong one was not great. Shopping:If you live in the Philippines like we do, the night market and other souvenier or knock off markets are no different than those in Greenhills. Except the prices are higher. If you require full fledge designer fashion or accessories, Hong Kong is the place to go.

King sized bed and turn dowm service.

Great service and great location. Was put on the club floor which is nice as they offer dedicated check in, made to order breakfasts and drinks in the evening. Did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants as they had plenty of snacks and hot hor'deurves in the lounge.Only complaint was that, even though I requested a harbor room they said they did not have one available. Since my company spent a lot of money with their hotel, I thought they would honor my request- but no luck. My room looked out to another office building. Also, I requested a massage and they did not have any appointments available for an in-room and they were expensive. So while out shopping I was approached by a woman hawking massage services on the street and arranged for a massage that way. Was a little nervous about this being on the up and up. But a nice young lady met me in the lobby and came up and performed a great hour massage for a reasonable price. After 6 hours in an airline seat from the middle east-I needed it.Splurged and hired one of the hotel limo's to take me to the a/p the next day. A little over priced at $60-but it was comfortable.

You can top up the card or get a refund if you don't spend all the money. It's really cheap, safe  very easy to get around, even taxis are very reasonable.For a drink with an amazing view, I recommend a bar called Aqua, it's about 10 mins walk from the hotel, no 1 Peking Road. it's on the 30th floor, (there is also a restaurant, but I didn't eat here) This place has to have one of the best views in Kowloon. The drinks are a little pricey but the cocktails are the best I've had. Treat yourself.For a day away from HK Island  Kowloon, I recommend Lantau Island with the Big Buddha.

The itallian in the hotel is also excellent and has wonderful harbour views.I loved everthing about this hotel the only thing I was disappointed with was that it didnt have an outdoor pool; if that doesn;t bother you and you are happy with an indoor pool then this hotel will not fail to impress you.One thing you need to be aware of which is nothing to do with the hotel was that on the promanade outside the hotel ther were a number of asian men trying to tell you your fourtune.When one has got you talking the other one bumps pass you and steals you wallets so be aware, As I said this has nothing to do with the hotel whatsoever its just some Hong Kong advise.", "Date": "Feb 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR596852840", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BUSTYBREEZER"}, {"Content": "Would stay again We stayed at Shangri La Kowloon from 22 - 25 Dec.

So I booked a Horizon Harbour View Club Room which include Horizon Lounge access. I soon come to seriously regret this. First impression when I arrived was already poor. I reached the hotel at 1pm and was informed that my room was not ready since the hotel had full occupancy. I was informed that it will take another hour. Granted the hotel official check-in time is 2PM so I went somewhere else and return one hour later and to my dismay, my room was still not ready. The check-in staff at the Horizon Club made a half-hearted apology and asked me to wait at the lounge while she chased the housekeeping staff to tidy up the room. Finally, the room was ready at 3:30pm. As I paid a top-tier rate for this room in the same range as what I have paid recently for the Four Seasons Hong Kong, I expected to be impressed by it. I was not. The room's decor is the very standard 5-star hotel room, ie carpeted, marble bathroom, slightly larger then normal, working desk, king-bed, the standard stuff. It's all very dull and plain. Furniture and fixtures looks new and functional though but again boring design. They advertise the room as having flat screen TV and surround sound. Well, the TV looks cheap and is only 32 (compare to the usual 42 flatscreen plasma found in most modern hotels). The surround sound is a joke, as the sound comes from a cheap home-theater in-a-box type of setup with such poor sound quality from the small speakers that you might as well just listen to the sound from the TV speakers. For the price they are charging, one should reasonably expect the hotel to invest in a proper sound system if they really want to implement this feature and not put up a gimmick. Next, the poorest aspect of my room, the bathroom. First, you notice the extra-small bath-tub when you step in. Even though I am just an average build asian, I have problem fitting inside it. Then the shower cubicle only have a overhead shower nozzle but no shower stick, highly inconvenient. And worst part is that this bathroom is no different from the bathroom avaliable in standard rooms at a much lower price. Compare that to the luxurious and well equipped bathroom of the Four Seasons, it is simply no comparison. Not everything is bad though. There are some good aspects of this room. The view is reasonably good and there are conveniences in the room such as a Ipod station for playing songs and charging your Ipod and a fax machine/printer. Internet speed is reasonably fast and the sofa chairs are quite comfortable. Well, since the room is only so-so, I thought maybe the lounge will be better. Another big dissapointment. I think the so called lounge area is simply 3 or 4 bedrooms knocked down to form a single room. So the design is longish and worse, they crammed three rows of table across the width of the hallway so there is barely any space left to skretch your legs. Because of the space constraint, during breakfast, there is not enough space to lay out the food presentation so most of the items like eggs, sausages, pancakes etc are in a separate menu which has to be ordered to the kitchen. As a result, the staff at the Horizon lounge wasted a lot of time running in and out of the kitchen area to collect the dishes. Food selection during cock-tail is poor, with only very limited variety. And during evening, because of the small size and close proximity with other tables, it became very crowded and noisy during the evening and lacking privacy. I have seen better and much more spacious executive lounges in other hotels. Even the Shangri-La in Jakarta is better. This lounge looks distinctly four star. The worst aspect of my stay is the service attitude of the Horizon lounge staff. Unlike the Four Seasons where I was greeted warmly by name everywhere I go, I stayed 2 days in the Kowloon Shangri-La and often drop by at the club lounge for drinks and not once was I welcome or greeted by the staff on duty, and of course they can't remember my name. They simply ignore me until I call upon them when I needed something, then they were inconveniently made aware of my existence. But I noticed they were very quick to greet and service the other guests who are caucasians ( ie westerners ). I am very annoyed by this kind of attitude and bias treatment, as if my money is not good enough for them. And it is not just me, I noticed another lady hotel guest who is a asian lady also had problem getting any attention during one of the breakfast session. Not all the staff service attitude are bad. The housekeeping, reception and conciege staff are reasonably good and responsive as expected of a 5-star hotel, but again nothing special or outstanding.It goes without saying that they did not bother to ask me how was my stay when I checked-up. Overall, this hotel is fine if you stay in a standard room and pay under USD250/= which is about the standard rate for a 5-star hotel in Hong Kong and you do not have high expectation. But the Horizon Club room rate is more than double that and at this price, it makes a extremely poor value considering the poor room and lounge facilities and what other 5-star hotels in Hong Kong can offer. Couple that with the indifferent service attitude of the staff at the Horizon floor, especially if you are asian like me, it is best to avoid this hotel completely. How others can rate this hotel as excellent is beyond me, they have certainly not experienced a truely luxurious 5-star hotel or have very low expectations. I will probably not stayed in this hotel again, esp the club rooms. It is just short of being a rip-off for the price.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR523856526", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BENLEE123"}, {"Content": "The perfect end to a perfect honeymoon on arrival at hongkong airport we were great and taken to our private transfer car which was out of this world. on arrival at the hotel we were greated by a concierge and taken directly to reception to check in where we were greated by the customer relations girl and presented with a posy of flowers and given an up grade in room for our honeymoon. the room was lovely and spacious and the bathroom was just as big as the bedroom almost, the view when we opened the curtains was to die for the harbour was there infront of us in all its splendor. kowloon was a lovely city and the short walk from the hotel to the star ferry was great. the staff at the hotel where excellant and helped you with anything. would most deffinatley return some day.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR440818058", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "KimGogarty"}, {"Content": "Perfection!!

The chefs still cannot figure out what an 'overeasy' fried egg is...always over cooked. I didn't even contemplate asking for a 'sunny side up' egg!! The pancakes are limp and old looking and the hash browns are the frozen Mcdonalds variety. The Asian selections seem much more appealing.

I had to keep the blinds closed night and day to avoid people peeking into my room. The room was pretty nice, although it was not clean. One of the bath robes had coffee all over it and smelled like sweat. I am pretty convinced that it hasn't been washed after the previous guest.

The hotel staff is very friendly and the welcome tea set in the room was a nice touch and very comforting after such a long trip. We had a City View room on the 12th floor. The room was very quiet and reasonably updated. Of course, the hotel is on the Kowloon side of the harbor, so it's a bit removed from all of the attractions in Central Hong Kong. Still, the MTR station is not very far away (it's two stops to Central Station) and it's a nice stroll along the water to the Star Ferry terminal which will take you across to Central.The breakfast buffet is very good as far as hotel buffets go, but it's a bit expensive. If you're looking for something lighter, there's a great Chinese bakery across the street from the hotel that offers delicious baked goods. There's also a very busy Starbucks right down the street for those who need a morning boost. Also, the sushi in the Japanese restaurant in the hotel is excellent.As far as nearby attractions go, Nathan Road (The Golden Mile) is about a 5-10 minute walk away as is the Hong Kong Museum of Art.

We stayed at the Kowloon Shangri-La as Island was fully booked. We are a recent convert to the whole Shangri-La experience having thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Island back in March 2005. As we now have Shangri-la membership we thought we would stick with the group. Although Kowloon was not our first choice, we negotiated a very good deal with a City View room on the Horizons floor.The room itself was the standard level room furnished in a classic American Regency style. It has been recently refurbished, though the discerning eye can pick out what has been re-used, such as the bathtub, sink and wardrobe doors. The bathroom did not have the LCD TV, but everything was to the same level of detail and attention and seemed nice and familiar. Forget the view, there wasn't one but that was not our main concern. The plus point was a huge room that accommodated a kingsize bed, sofa and arm chair with room to spare. This was important to us as we were working out of the room for large parts of the day. With free internet, in room fax/copying facilities and free use of lounge and 1 session of the conference room, it made working and meetings so much easier. The free pressing came in handy too.Service wise it was as helpful, friendly and efficient as ever. Express check-in at the lounge was a nice touch as were the complimentary beverages in the lounge. The location itself was OK if not a bit out of the way for us. The hotel does provide free shuttle to the Star Ferry but otherwise it\u9225\u6a9a a 10 min walk via Mody Road/Granville Road or the subway to catch the MTR. As we spent most of our time on HK Island, this became a bit of a chore and the taxis journeys became very expensive due to the extra toll charges they added to cross the harbour. This brings me to say that Kowloon is generally more touristy, so things such as taxis generally work out more expensive as they take longer routes. A visit to an optician carrying the official HK tourist emblem also turned out to be a bit of a trap with him trying to sell me all the expensive frames/lenses and bombarding me with the sales talk. In the end I don\u9225\u6a9b think I even got the full 30% off as advertised!Food wise it was a bit bare in the immediate area. I can thoroughly recommend the ground floor Thai Restaurant in the Tsim Sha Sui Centre next door (come out the hotel turn right) and also the Shanghainese Restaurant Xiou Nan Guo which is on the 1st level (You can see the diners from the elevated walkway from the hotel). Both serve good quality food at very good prices. Its also worth checking out the numerous Indian Tailors on Mody Road for a made-to-measure suit. A men's wool suit (not designer fabric) should be in the region of around HKD$1500 and take 2-3 days to complete. The hotel also arranged a booking for dinner at the exclusive KEE club, which is a members only affair - food was good with a relaxed dining atmosphere.All in all a lovely relaxed experience, though Island still beats it for quality of service and comfort!", "Date": "Nov 24, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR119874407", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Dezzydez"}, {"Content": "The Shangri-la delivered the goods We stayed at the Shangri-la Kowloon for three nights end of October on our way to Bali and can honestly say it delivered all that we had hoped it would.
