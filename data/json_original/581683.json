It gets an A+ for location -- Ebisu is just 2 stops away from Roppongi and 1 stop away from Shibuya and Meguro. The rooms are standard Japanese business hotel size and you won't have any room for yoga after putting your luggage down flat. Decor is dated but everything works, is spotlessly clean and not a whiff of smoke on our non-smoking floor. On our last day they were in the process of replacing all the old CRT TVs in the rooms (with LCD ones I presume). Booking is not convenient as they don't do email or online bookings. You'll have to call or fax them but their spoken English is excellent. A true budget gem in a trendy part of Tokyo.", "Date": "Nov 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR529936464", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gauntlet"}, {"Content": "Our favorite Tokyo hotel Can't beat the Hotel Excellent for location--walking distance to Daikanyama, Shibuya, and other trendy hip locations if you want to stay out after the trains stop--and price.

This is a great place to stay if you want to be right in the midst of things! It's right across the street from the Ebisu station, so travel to other localities is very easy! The room was small, but quite clean, the halls were quiet, there's a fridge and water heating device so that you can refresh yourself. The Peacock grocery is just down the street, so you can fix things to eat in if you need to. I'll stay here every time I come to Japan! You might need to plan on bringing some wash cloths for the bath, and you might want to purchase some softer toilet paper when you get here, but other than that, this place is wonderful!", "Date": "Jun 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR865231850", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TNTravelerTN"}, {"Content": "By the book! This was the second time I have stayed at Hotel Excellent. Probably my last time too.Before I get onto what made me never want to come back, I say a few good things about it....It's in a very convenient location right across from Ebisu station (on the Yamanote line), so not too far to drag your baggage. Lots of great food options here, from your Western fast food outlets to awesome ramen shops. Go exploring around the back lanes for the best places. Ebisu is right next to Shibuya and Shinjuku, so you're right in the thick of it. The rooms are small, but clean. The non-smoking rooms smelt of stale smoke, but no big deal. Free internet was a bonus!Ok, onto the bad points:I arrived on a long haul flight from London, arrived at Narita at 7am, got to the hotel around 10am. Check in time is 2pm. I was hoping for a bit of leway so I could have a shower, change stinky clothes etc, but they were insistant on the 2pm check-in. Being deadly tired I decided to go to Shibuya to grab some food and look around. I got back to the hotel around 1:55pm and asked to be checked in. They one again stood firm and told me I would have to wait until 2pm to get into my room. Waited for 5 minutes then they checked me in. Argh.On my last day, check out time was 10am, I was busy showering and packing for my last leg back to Australia. I got a call at 10:05am asking when I'll be checking out. I told them I was packing and would be down at 10:30am. Packing and cleaning took a little longer than expected and got down to reception at 10:40am. They kindly informed me that they would have to charge me for the extra 10 minutes! My jaw hit the ground.. I was speechless. I paid the trivial amount and said goodbye forever to this hotel.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR915644904", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Very convenient location, reasonably price clean room I stayed in Ebisu Excellent Hotel during my business trip to Tokyo cos its just 10mins walk to our Tokyo office;Now I'd already stayed there 4 times during past year, and each stay at least 6 days.Overall its a nice tidy business hotel and price is very reasonable(considering hotel rate is freaking crazy in Tokyo!!!)room's tidy  clean, the cleaning ladies really do their job seriously well :)but since its a business hotel, its size and amenities are limited, I'll use petite to desrible size of hotel room, if you stay too long in your room you'll feel like sitting in jail :)especially for bathroom, considering i'm an average size asian woman (5'3 and 110lb weight), already I felt very difficult not to hit anything when i turned round or came out from bath tub.......so for men or big guys, they may have a hard time in the bathroom though.and bear in mind you've got only 2 cloth hangers in each room!!!! so during my 1st stay in Ebisu Excellent, I had to hang all the clothes (for a 8 days trip!) on that 2 and only hangers!!!! LOL.......since then I always keep 3 spare hangers in my suitcase with me :)if you are easily awaken, better request a room at least above 6/F; I remember the hotel seems to have 10/F (or 11/F?? ....can't remember precisely~);I've stayed in 3/F (reception counter is in 2/F, its G/F is a japanese restaurant); 4/F, 6/F and 9/F;all facing the main road in front of hotel (also facing the train station); I had a hard time to sleep except the last time I stayed in 9/F where I finally could have more peace at night; otherwise you can also try to request a room facing the back street behind the hotel (well, basically you wont be able to see the backstreet if you're staying in that side, cos you'll see the wall only....LOL, thats what happened to my colleague's room);and remember the hotel has a very strict policy with check out time! they need you to check out at sharp 10:00am!!!! not the usual 11am or 12am check out time in other hotels around the world! one time I was still in my room at 10:05am, the reception called me 3 times to remind me its time to get my butt out of that room!!! LOLin terms of hotel location, since its in front of Ebisu JR train station and tokyo metro station as well; you can travel by both JR train and Metro underground; and Ebisu is simply 1 station from Shibuya, 2 stations from Harajuku/ Omotesando, 4 (or 5?) stations from Shinjuku and 5 mins taxi drive to Roppongi; you've got all the main shopping / eating / drinking area nearby; in a way you're actually saving money on transportation w/ train, cos all you need will be 130 yen to 150 yen to get to those locations. and next to Ebisu Excellent Hotel, there're 2 little streets which are full of restaurants and drinking pubs, you'll find all sorts of cuisine.and if you wanna shop some grocery, next to Hotel Ebisu you'll find one small street (with a Vodafone store at the corner), walk inside this small street you'll find a Daimaru supermarket which offers you everything at good price :)all in all its a pretty good deal to stay there if you wanna minimize your budget when visiting tokyo", "Date": "Jul 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR259102559", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "eunice417"}, {"Content": "Convenient location, clean rooms!

It's a business man's hotel which means the rooms are meant for sleeping only, not lounging. For westerners, this means not much room. The bed was small and indeed occupied 90% of the room. The bathroom was literally an elevated, plastic cubicle, but perfectly acceptable as long as I remembered to duck my head and move slowly.There weren't really any amenities to speak of, but at US$100 per night for two, we thought it a good deal.
