{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Charming place - great value for money We spend five days with our three children at this beautiful place. We have been in many hotels in Bali and this one also stands out in value for money. At less than half the price of most hotels in the South of Bali you are right on teh beach and have a wonderful resturant overlooking the sea.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR491581577", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "wfengler"}, {"Content": "Sunset, Sunrise After the initial problem with our reservation, which was sorted with minimum of fuss, we found the staff friendly and helpful in this small (20 rooms) beach front hotel.We stayed upstairs in a seaside suite which we would recommend that you book to take full advantage of the sunset, sunrise and beach activity views.You are out of the way so will find you dine at the hotel. They offer a small but satisfying menu and if you manage to catch fish they will prepare and cook this for you, at a cost of course! If you're out and about the Lovina Bakery is an excellent choice for lunch - fresh food and extremely clean kitchen upstairs.Would recommend for everyone and anyone.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR318918301", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CJCT"}, {"Content": "Relaxing retreat away from the crowds in the north of Bali       The hotel room with the very spacious bed", "Date": "Mar 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR661685185", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "marcstrauch"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297699-d638931-r20609324-Adirama_Beach_Hotel-Singaraja_Bali.html", "HotelID": "638931", "Price": "$72"}}
