I travel to California for business in regular bases. I've stayed in different hotels prior to the Renaissance Hollywood, however this new experience changed everything and it increased my level of expectations for the hotels I have yet to stay in the near future thought the world. From the moment I arrived until checkout, I can only describe the Renaissance Hollywood and its staff as First Class and a Five Stars hotel. My first interaction with the front desk personal was delightful and unforgettable. I have yet to experience the level of professionalism received from the two very polite, helpful and caring receptionists, Ms. Aricele (pardon if I misspelled the name) and Mr. Kyle. Ms. Aricele has the best attitude for the industry, a great personality with a welcoming smile. No matter how late or how tired you are when you check in to the hotel, after your interaction with Ms. Aricele, you will be certain that you will experience a very pleasant stay. In addition to Ms. Aricele being the best, all staff members are very polite and happy to assist and answer any questions you might have. At the concierge desk, I was able to obtain a wealth of information about restaurants popular destinations, in addition to the many facilities the hotel has to offer. The hotel itself is modern, very clean and it has all the amenities you would need without leaving the premises. Its location is perfect for every occasion. With all the amenities the hotel has to offer, in my opinion what really makes the difference and a memorable experience, is the extraordinary customer service skills received specifically by Ms. Aricele but all staff members are DELIGHTED TO ASSIST. For most travelers, the service you receive from the staff, being attendant to in a timely manner, the welcoming smile is the finishing touch and the icing on the cake.

Sure it is a bit crazy and lots of people, but in a strange way it represents Americana and the cinema world and as such it is an amusing place to visit....at least once! We arrived early on Sunday and were able to check into our room courtesy of a wonderful young man at the front desk Alex. He did something special for us when he found out we were on the Executive Level BUT near the elevators (which we really do not like). He said \"wait a few moments\" did some kind of magic and before we know it we are happily in a gorgeous suite with wrap around windows all sides, corner room, and HUGE! separate, kitchen, dining table, living room, etc., but all open and furnished in 1930's Movie Style. Really a very nice surprise and greatly appreciated. The food in the lounge for breakfast is wonderful and we stopped in for some tea early afternoon and they even had some food then for munchies, but the things for the 5-7:30 portion are not very nice at all. Potato Chips and peanuts and cheese with rasperry jam and Macaroni and Cheese! Odd really. Saw that they had a very nice honesty bar set up though. The Navigator (Concierge) here is very good, got us dinner/lunch reservations and suggestions in the Beverly Hills area easily and we found on our own a WONDERFUL place to hike to the top for the vista looking down on this city. It is Runyan Canyon and is less than l km behind the hotel and an easy walk. The only downside is that dogs are allowed to run leash free and if this is a problem, save your walking for other areas. We always seek out something in every area that is a bit of a challenge since we enjoy outdoor activity and walking alot. The hotel itself as others have pointed out is situated in the best location for being here. But it is quiet in the rooms. If you have never been here and have the need or desire to visit Hollywood, this is the place for sure. We have been treated very well at all times. Housekeeping is efficient and there is turn down in the PM.There is a small gym which could use a little improvement, several pieces of equipment were not working and the weights are outside by the pool.

Our food was delivered promptly and the gentleman who delivered it was so friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast at the buffet in the restaurant. The full buffet was about $27 per person but we were so full we were able to make it through to dinner. The omelettes were the best I've ever had. Light and fluffy! The service was great. Oth days.

If you want to do the touristy stuff then it's in a fabulous location. It's right next to the Kodak Theatre and the Hollywood & Highland complex with heaps of shops and restaurants. Most of the tours depart half a block up from the hotel and the subway stop is right on the corner of Hollywood&Highland too so it's easy to get around (which was handy as I did not have a car). The hotel itself is huge, modern and clean. I got a room on the 18th floor with a view of the Hollywood sign and the hills. The room was a good size, very functional. The tv had plenty of free channels (I had read a review of someone saying there were no free channels on the tv which was completely incorrect). The bathroom was an Ok size, but the shower was over the bathtub. I had problems with the drainage in the bath/shower so that by the time I had finished washing my hair, the bath was half full with water as the drain was very slow - but it did eventually drain all out. The bed was very comfortable, but I had problems each morning with hearing noises from either the room above or the room next door - I couldn;t work out which. It sounded like someone walking in high heel shoes on tiles. This happened every morning around 6-6:30am and it went on for at least half an hour each time. This was annoying, although not really the fault of the hotel, although perhaps their walls are really thin. The check in & check out were very efficient and friendly, as were the \"navigators\" (concierge) who helped find supermarkets and laundries close by and even recommended a good bookshop within walking distance. The restaurant in the hotel (Twist) has reasonably priced breakfasts and they even let me substitute the bacon for fruit in my meal as I do not eat pig. Staff were very friendly. The room service was actually also reasonably priced too although the choices were not always that appealing. I also got a massage at the Spa (Spa Luce) that is part of the hotel. The cost seemed a little expensive - but I was on holiday so decided to go for it. It was enjoyable and relaxing and they try to make sure you are completely comfortable through the experience. The thing I loved the most about the hotel is the location though. There is so much to do close by, and if you want to travel a little further away, there is Hollywood Bowl, Universal Studios and Griffith Park all within about 10miles of the hotel. If you are more into Santa Monica or the beaches, then this hotel is probably not for you as it is a fair distance from them, but for my purposes it was fantastic and I loved the convenience of the location. The only \"gripe\" I have is that it costs $13 a day for internet. Yes I was a tourist, but I still want to have internet available to check up on things and to help with planning my days, so $13 a day was a bit steep considering many hotels now offer free internet.

The location is great, you are in the middle of everything. The only draw back, this hotel is in the middle of everything. If you are looking to sleep in peace and quite, don't stay on the weekend or a holiday weekend. We did not know this was a party like hotel, we did not sleep for three days. When the bars close, all the people come back to the hotel to continue the party, and it was Halloween weekend, so we should have known better! The staff goes out of their way to control the noise, so if you have a problem, call down to the desk, they will take care of it!!!

We were told before we went that LA was not that great, but we wanted to see it, and gave ourselves two nights, and two days here. We ended up staying in one of the nights, and left early on the 2nd day. West Hollywood/Sunset Bvld is really like a rubbish Leicester Square. Very touristy (as expected), but even within this, not much to see. LA seems very spread out, and I suspect you need to know where to go. Unlike other places we stayed, where there were lots of bars and restaurants in a small area, outside of the tacky tourist spots, there was no congregation of areas to go. I suspect a bit like London you need to know where to go. So onto the hotel. Not much really to write for me here. We have between us stayed in lots of Marriott hotels over the years, and actually redeemed points to stay here, rather than spend on another couple of nights accomodation. We considered 3 nights here, but so glad we decided to spend a night at Hermosa Beach (read other review). It was standard Marriott fare. Clean, large, and comfortable. Points I can add:- Check in lady was very polite, and helpful. Bell boys/car valet were very polite and helpful Concierge did not seem to know much more than a good bar/restaurant within the local area despite us being willing to travel further to find something we were looking for. Car parking was $10 a day, or over triple that for valet. Park the car yourself - is cheaper and not very difficult! There are three platforms to take a photo of the Hollywood sign from - in the outdoor part of the shopping complex. Marriott guests can go to the third floor, but are not allowed to stand on the walkway to take a photo, they are only allowed to access the Spa and Pool (which looked nice, but we did not use). No idea if this is Marriott or building management stopping you, but seemed a bit petty. A bottle of water from your room was $6.50 Nothing wrong with the hotel, it is Standard Marriott fare. It just felt too much like a business trip to me, and nothing special. If you were there on business in West Hollywood, and did not fancy doing much in the evening is worth a 4 rating. For a holiday/honeymoon - I would look for an alternative area in LA, and just visit here for a morning to do the tourist bits.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorba Linda, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for visiting Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "ChrisH3040", "ReviewID": "UR119301001", "Content": "This hotel is located at the Hollywood and Highland shopping center, in the same area as the Kodak theater (where Iris is currently playing) and Graumann's Chinese theater.

Very good, central property were you can not go wrong. However, lacks the hip factor and the club scene of nearby hotels such as The Roosevelt, The Roxbury or the W - however, feels much more relaxed and approachable and is in a better part of Hollywood than the latter two properties Please see my Pro/Con List for the other properties.

Room was adequate with a very comfortable bed and good TV. We needed to use the 'complimentary business centre' whilst we were there to access the internet which we assumed from the literature in our room was free. However be warned when they say 'complimentary' it means your room key gets you access to the room, that is it. However the internet charges were reasonable so we spent around 5mins checking out some areas in LA online that we were going to visit. Upon logging off we were charged $199 for the session!!! We immediately reported this to reception who gave the attitude that they didn't really care and it wasn't there problem as the internet is provided by a third party and they have nothing to do with it. We spent the rest of our holiday spending some time each day trying to rectify this problem. Numerous visits to the hotel reception seemed pointless as no one seemed to care. In the end the whole problem was left for us to sort out and we both found the attitude and service from the hotel staff pretty disgusting for a top end hotel. We had stayed at three other hotels leading up to this one as part of our trip and couldn't fault any of them. In particular the service we received. I would never stay at this hotel again purely based on this experience. When you are on holiday/honeymoon something like this is disappointing and you don't expect it to happen.

As I entered the lobby , a staff member greeted me and handed me over the keys to both my rooms . She told me that being a Platinum Elite member, one of the room was upgraded to an Executive suite and was connected to the other room and that we were already preregistered. Excellent! Then another staff rushed and took the second room keys away and told me that the other room was not ready and would be so in another 15 minutes. It was 5.30pm. We went to our so called executive suite so that we could stretch out for the next 15 minutes until the second room was ready. The suite was nothing but a larger regular room with a dressing room and very poorly planned large bathroom. The space could have been exploited much more cleverly if needed. Anyway we had a great view of the Hollywood sign form our room. As time passed on, there was no sign of the second room being ready and it was well until 7.30 pm after many calls to the front desk and profuse apologies etc that the keys were handed over. Apparently the housekeeping had forgotten! This was totally unacceptable. The second issue which upset me was that the Club lounge was closed on weekends and no alternative was given for elite members. This is again a part of the total inconsistency seen in Marriott Group hotels where some properties offer breakfast coupons on weekends and some don't - something which I totally fail to understand. The staff are overall very good but the housekeeping could be better. There is a Hetz car rental in the lobby too and that was very helpful for us. The last issue which really upset me the most was that a few days after we checked out and paid for our rooms in full, I got an email from the front office manager requesting me to pay for my room. He sent me an invoice for a room which I had never stayed in at all! As of today not a word of apology at the mess created by them. Overall this is a good property but has its own shortcomings.

The concigier was NEVER there! When there was someone manning the desk, they had no suggestions, didn't book any dinners for us, and handed us an attraction pamphlet. Room service took over an hour - for a ridiculous priced burger and salad. We were unaware of the need to have a car to get around. The hotel has a car but what a pain in the butt that process was, mainly because of the attitude of those people! I'm paying them and they act as if they can't be bothered to have my business. AND they even have the nerve to charge you to park their rental in the hotel. The rental car people were so vague with everything and it was a huge hassle. The hotel offers a hotel shuttle, for a charge of course, to and from the airport. Parking is outrageously priced. The room and hotel were clean. There is a pool and workout room-both very small. The location is good for Hollywood attractions-all a short walk away. But to get to all the movie studios, rent a car because cabs are expensive. Again, NO ONE here will help you so if you want good customer service, I wouldn't recommend this place.

As others have mentioned, many of these are within walking distance of the hotel or just a short drive away (Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, beaches, Warner Bros and Universal studios, etc). We also enjoyed the convenience of having a mall attached with restaurants, eateries and shopping, not to mention the Kodak Theatre. Not all rooms have great city views as ours faced a side street with a view of the hills and the Hollywood sign. However, our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The major room problem we had was with housekeeping. Being early risers, we were out of our room by 9am and usually returned by 1-2pm for a short rest. Both days this meant that housekeeping skipped our room. The first evening we were able to get it cleaned after 5pm by request. The second afternoon we left at 4pm and were assured by housekeeping, who were in the hallway, that they would get to the room before they left. Of course when we returned the room had not been cleaned. Needing towels to shower early the next day before we left, we called down to the desk to request towels that were never delivered. We noticed an unlocked housekeeping door next to the ice machine and took matters into our own hands and helped ourselves to the towels. Additionally, since the room had not been cleaned for two days we were out of Kleenex, low on toilet tissue and trash cans were overflowing. Not what I would expect for over $300/night. We enjoyed the pool during our stay as the weather was beautiful and the pool heated. The tile floor of the pool could use a good scrubbing but the rest of the area was clean. The cabanas available were a plus for the pool but the small pool deck resulted in a lack of enough lounge chairs for everyone and many people ended up having to use the regular chairs from tables in the eating area. There was a bar open but you had to serve yourself. It seemed a little odd to me that a hotel this nice wouldn't offer cocktail service around the pool. There is also a small menu to order food at the pool. We found this service to be slow and disorganized. Almost everyone who ordered didn't receive the correct food and by the time they brought out what was missing, you were done with the rest of your food. We took advantage of the valet service which we found to be quick and courteous. They always had the car available and were ready to help with any directions we needed. With \"carmageddon\" clearing the streets for us, we actually drove out to also explore some of the beaches that were within a one hour drive from the hotel.

My experience is the Marriott group's hotels have all been good (especially TEDA). As I have remarked in another review of another hotel; the circumstances surrounding ones arrival at a hotel has much to do with first impressions. In my case I was returning from Hawaii full of good feelings. My better half was thrilled to find that we could see the Hollywood sign from out room and was busy consulting the hotel information book for a stretched limo to take her and my daughter on the 'must do' tour of the homes of the stars. This she found at a great price. Me, this gave me time to explore. First I must avert to my arrival at Los Angeles Airport where I encountered a rude security officer who opted not to speak but rely on aggressive hand gestures to their hyper sensitive security screen alarming as in I entered. Efforts to get a response to my question in English only got more frantic wrist flapping. The Taxi ride was silent and as eventually emerged direct and not overcharging. Welcome to L.A ! So it came to the Renaissance to be welcoming. The reception is brightly decorated with colourful abstract paintings and looks inviting. We got text book functionality and competent assistance at the desk. The entreaty to 'have a nice day' though seemed to be used as a period, or full-stop as we might describe, to indicate an end to the transaction. On the positive side I must mention that it was 7.30 am and we got our room immediately. As I write I realise that I have never written a critical review of a hotel and this is not one either. It is reviewed in the context of matters surrounding that results in my disposition. So to the Hotel. The standard of this hotel was well in line with those of others in the group. The room was top class for a standard room. Breakfast was particularly good memorable for treats such as delightful fresh strawberries and other fresh fruit among the elaborate fayre. The hotel location is very central, particularly for my better half, as I referred, and to her celebrity curiosity. The complex that adjoins and incorporates the hotel includes a big Shopping Mall that included umpteen shops and eateries. Exit to Highway Bvd leads you to the street frontage of the Kodak Theatre and the famous Walk of Fame. My wife would be in her element I thought as I explored while she and daughter number two explored the Hollywood Hills. As I explored in the direction from Hotel through the Mall I met my next security officer, a female, who told me where I could not go. Why is it that the word 'Sir' is used in such a pejorative tone that suggest the opposite to deferential?. I ignored the interception. On exit to Highway I saw that preparation for an event at the Kodak was in progress. Standing on the side-walk surveying the activity I was approached by a black suited security type person who again told me where I could not be. Our 'conversation' about it being a public footpath and his absence of jurisdiction unless he could convince me that he was a police officer did stop him in his tracks. Speaking into the walkie talkie he was soon joined by an even bigger suited colleague with whom I had the same conversation. About this time my senses alerted me of remember things such as the Agency for Homeland Security exist, so I advised them that I was returning to my room in the Renaissance via the route I arrived. They said nothing. I choose to think they had difficulty understanding my Irish accent. Our pleasant evening meal in the Mall was in a restaurant whose name alludes me but it had a reciprocal arrangement with the hotel so that I could charge my meal should I choose. Clever marketing I thought. My stay as I said was en route from Hawaii to Ireland so this was a two day stop over to break the journey. Departing we asked the hotel to order a Taxi to the airport, which they willingly did. The Russian taxi driver was talkative that is until I pointed out that his meter was already registering higher than the first Taxi charge and we were nowhere near the airport. He fluffed about the meter only recently being calibrated bla bla bla and made a querying phone call to base or somewhere else. I took out my phone and asked for the number of the hotel so that I could discuss this matter with them. The meter was immediately turned off. We arrived at L.A airport to be assisted en route to our departure from the United States by two more abrupt and rude airport staff.

It's essentially an expensive tourist hotel aspiring to class. It is attached to a mall complex containing food outlets, the type of popular chain store which attracts visitors, some tacky souvenir shops, and of course the Kodak Theatre where the Oscars are held. On weekends this mall hosts musical performances which can be earsplittingly loud, but it is a virtue of the hotel itself that it is sound-proof. Every staff member on the ground floor level was warm, friendly and responsive. This compensated for the somewhat sterile lobby decor. Even if you're standing in line waiting to check in, you'll get a warm greeting from some staff member. In my case, I had been incorrectly flagged for a handicapped room, and when I returned to Reception to ask why, they apologized profusely and promptly upgraded me to a better room. No complaints here However, the room itself was nothing to write home about. Comfortable bed, a desk with a good work area, well-appointed bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a glossier version of what you would expect from a good two-diamond motor inn but at a much higher price. However, the room was not well laid out. Instead of a comfortable reading chair, there was an uncomfortable tub chair squeezed into the cramped area at the left side of the bed. I discovered when I ordered from room Service (the Cobb salad was excellent, by the way) that there was no room for a table to be wheeled in; I was expected to use a small high coffee table beside the chair \u00e2\u20ac\u201d okay for a sandwich perhaps but problematic for anything else. When the waiter first placed the tray of food on it, he didn't position it properly, and it almost tipped into my lap. Room maintenance was not acceptable. The drapes had come partly off the track in the bedroom and could not be opened. A request for someone from maintenance to come up yielded no one, nor did the maid deal with the problem when she arrived rather too late each day to make up the room. So essentially, my room was in semi-darkness for two and a half days. Hotels like this have the pretentious habit of giving the bed more pillows and cushions than it needs. One night in my sleep, I pushed one of the unnecessary cushions to the floor on the far side of the bed. It was still on the floor after the room was made up the following day. In the bathroom, I never did receive a second bar of soap for the shower area. This smacks of lazy, sloppy housekeeping. The one full-service restaurant closes after lunch, which means if you don't want to leave the premises for dinner, your only recourse is the bar menu or room service \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the problems eating in the room I have already mentioned. However there is an excellent restaurant, The Grill, in the shopping complex, and hotel guests can charge their meals there to their room. Valet parking is less pricey than at some other big L.A. hotels. Self parking is available, but for a number of logistical reasons is not a good alternative.

It must have something to do with the quality of the sound insulation between rooms. I didn't find it to be a problem, though. I was at the Renaissance for a business meeting. I never did quite get my bearings straight as I wandered, with other conferees, from the hotel to the ballroom, which was past the outdoor pool and a short walk to the other side of the Hollywood/Highland complex. It was a bit confusing, despite the signage. Catering, apparently provided by Wolfgang Puck, provided some good meals, though there were other meals that seemed promising at first (the Asian buffet, for example, noodles and potstickers and a beef dish, among others), but fell short. Banquet servers were a little abrupt in their effort to be efficient. Plates removed when you stepped away from the table to visit with a colleague, for example. Oh well, this is not unusual for banquet meals at any hotel, I supposes. I didn't spend any time at the pool, which seemed small. But during my stay, it didn't seem crowded. Having previously lived in Los Angeles, the idea of spending time in Hollywood never had any appeal for me. Souvenir shops and tattoo parlors still line the area. The Hollywood and Highland Center certainly gives some life to the area, but as one of my friends said about his stay at the Renaissance a few years back, \"I felt like I was at a hotel at the mall.\" I agree. While you have the Kodak Theater and the Chinese Theater as part of the Center, most of it is comprised of the small chain shops that point the way to the anchor department stores at most malls in the US. The difference: no anchor department stores. But, if you need a GAP or California Pizza and Pasta, you're in luck. Overall, I thought my room was great and the level of service was also quite good at the Renaissance Hollywood. I'm not a fan of the location.

However inside the Renaissance you dont feel that as the hotel feels quiet (bar the loud lobby bar) and safe even though it's linked the Highland shopping mall, which has some excellent food options. You can get directly to the Highland via one of the hotel floors, which is great. The complex has a California Pizza Kitchen, Starbucks, Quizno's, Rolling Stone and several other restaurants and stores. The hotel lobby bar is okay and has a cafe. The gym is pretty small, but has a nice view and half a dozen cycle-type machines, which is far more than your average hotel. The weights are outside next to the pool, which is a bit of a bummer as it can be pretty cold outside (yes, even in LA). Valet service was fast, though parking is expensive at 29$ a day, which is a hotel norm. I recommend just parking next-door at the Highland complex for less money. The hotel room, I stayed in a double, is pretty standard, but had great, comfortable beds and a good work desk. There also was a couch and a small table, which brings a nice ambience and gives the room a bit more \"chilled\" athmospere. The closet space is okay and shower pretty standard in terms of size, but there's definitely enough space for your toiletries. While the hotel provides the usual body lotion, shampoo and conditioner, it doesnt provide body wash/shampoo which was a bit weird. There are bars of soap though. Now while I said it was quiet, our room had a door to another room and one night through that, the neighbors were up chatting until 5am and I could pretty much hear every word and laughter, which was very annoying.

LA is a sprawling city and this was pretty centrally located for what we wanted to see. It was a 35 minute drive to Disneyland on a Sunday morning with almost no traffic. 40 minutes to see friends in Long Beach. It was a long 45 minutes to Santa Monica with much stop and go traffic because of all the lights. It turns out there was a faster way of getting there than following Santa Monica Blvd as advised by the concierge desk but I assume they recommend that because it's a straight shot and you won't get lost. The area right outside the hotel on Hollywood Blvd is a little cheesy and can be quite annoying to wade through as tour bus operators will accost you every few feet.

We were originally going to stay out near the airport, which he described as 'Depressing' and immediately saw he was correct. The location of this hotel is unreal. Its attached to the Hollywood/Highland Mall, as well as the Kodak Theatre, and Chinese Theatres.So you're just a stones throw from the heart of Hollywood. We were given a room on the 17th Floor, overlooking downtown LA, and the Hollywood sign. I like to think its b/c of my Silver Elite status, but it was probably just chance. The room was very modern, as clean as could be, and quite big. It boasted floor to ceiling windows, which was really neat and made for great views of downtown and Hollywood. Our first night, we simply just had a few drinks and enjoyed the view with the lights off. While I really have to reach to find someting to complain about, it would be the connection doors in our hotel room. They were paper thin, and you could hear the children next door almost like they were in our room. I also resent the fact that you have to pay $13/day for internet at a hotel that costs ~$200/night. Seems pretty stupid since I can go down the street to a crappy Days Inn or a McDonalds and get free wi/fi. We also visited the pool during our first night. The temperature was in the 50s that night, but the pool water was probably in the high-80s and was very comfortable. Its quite a pool, with a great view of Highland Ave, the hollywood hills, downtown LA, as well as the mall. The pool was very large, and could serve the casual wader, as well as a lap swimmer. There were plenty of lounge chairs for sunbathers (and you could get some great sun there!), and were also a handful of private cabanas as well. There is also a cafe that appeared to have served food and beverages, but was closed during our evening swim.

However, each time I receive increasingly bad customer service and a management team that should be running a resort in Syberia. Resident Manager Sean Steenson is absolutely to blame or the poor quality of service at this property. Coupled with his partner Fredrick, this dynamic-duo of poor customer service dish-up absolutely the worst experience that this frequent traveler has ever received. I will always give a place a second, and in this case a number more chances, however, this time my duty is to you the consumer. I encourage you to avoid the Renaissanc\u00e2\u20ac\u2039e Hollywood Hotel & Spa at all cost. If you want to stay in this area, stay at one of the properties previously mentioned, or maybe the historical Roosevelt Hotel directly south of this horrible hotel.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuperb hotel with staff dedicated to customer satisfaction\u201d", "Author": "tasty_kebab", "ReviewID": "UR102293327", "Content": "We stayed at the Renaissance Hollywood for 10 nights in February as part of our honeymoon, let me simply say that this hotel turned the vacation spectacular! I chose this place as TripAdvisor held great reviews for it, plus the management leave comments on these reviews which shows they really care about what customers think of their stay. Upon arriving you note the lovely reception area with occasional guitarist or pianist near the bar. The gentleman who served us at check-in (nice guy called Daniel) got the trip off to a wonderful start when he informed us that we were being upgraded to an Executive Suite as it was our honeymoon. When I asked how much breakfast would cost, Daniel said he would add in Club Level buffet breakfast for free! This allowed us canap\u00c3\u00a9s in the evening and access to the Club Lounge at any time of day. Daniels enthusiasm and kindness really made our trip before it even began. ROOMS Please note our room was a suite so I cant comment on standard rooms. Our Executive Suite was massive, with a couple of sofas and armchairs and also a 40 inch LCD TV. The decor was contemporary and linens were of high quality. The bathroom was spacious, with a separate area with mirror and table for lady cosmetic stuff. The shower was a bath with shower curtain however the water temperature was satisfactory, I know other users have had issues with the water but ours was fine. The minibar is locked but to keep our own food chilled were given a separate fridge on request for no extra charge. We were on the 9th floor with a great view of the Hollywood Hills and Griffith Park. FOOD Breakfast in the Club Lounge was adequate although I suspect the choice of food wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as good as the main breakfast restaurant downstairs (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try that place out). There was a fridge with complementary drinks and a healthy selection of bagels and pastries also. You cannot order food here so you have to make-do with scrambled eggs, toast, cereal or pork etc. HOTEL FEATURES The hotel has a Hertz office right next to the main reception so hiring a car is so easy, they have your car in the Hollywood and Highland carpark so pick up is simple. That carpark costs $10 to self-park for 24 hours. Or you can pay $29 for valet park but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste money on that, just do it yourself because its easy. The pool area is fairly small although the Wolfgang Puck poolside bar offers light snacks and lunches at good prices. The IT suite is expensive should you wish to gain internet access, like $12 for 10 minutes I think. The hotel also benefits from a direct connection to the Hollywood and Highland Centre, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to walk outside should you wish to go shopping there or infact watch a movie at the Chinese theatre. LOCATION The best thing about this hotel is the location. This hotel is just 100m away from Hollywood Blvd, and indeed the nicest park of Hollywood (some bits of Hollywoods are very seedy and tacky). There are loads of places to eat, see and shop nearby. For example, the Kodak theatre, Chinese Theatre, Hollywood and Highland Centre, Hard Rock Cafe, Ripleys museum, El Capitan cinema, Mels drive-in and Hollywood museum are all within a 3 minute walk from the reception. Trust me, you will not stay in a better location than this for Hollywood. There is a Metro rail station nearby which makes getting to Burbank TV studios and Universal Studios very easy indeed. Just be careful after dark as there are often crazy homeless people around. In conclusion, this hotel is perfectly located in Hollywood to explore the local sights with plenty places to eat and shop also. The hotel provides great service with a smile and will do whatever they can to please you. This hotel is perfect for business or leisure trips and couples and families will enjoy the services it has to offer. To the management, please thank your staff for their service during our stay, it really made our honeymoon special. In particular, please thank Daniel for his kindness in the room upgrade and complimentary Club breakfast.

The center is also right across the street from Disney's El Capitain Theater. This location added a great deal to the enjoyment of our visit as there were major rainstorms during our stay and we were able to avoid using our car entirely during our stay. Universal Studios (and Universal Citywalk) is easily accessible and just one stop away on the Metrorail. Other Hollywood and downtown locations such as Union Station are also very easily accessible -- not at all typical for LA. We enjoyed dining at the California Pizza Kitchen that is in the Hollywood and Highland Center. While in the hotel, we had access to the \"executive club\" and found that the breakfast was great. It offered h'or d'oervres and desserts at different times week day evenings and the desserts were great. The staff in the morning was quiet, but friendly but the staff in the seemed to do his best to avoid any acknowledgement of the guests' presence (a simple \"good evening\" or \"welcome\" would go a long way).

The Spa is prominently featured, but my mother-in-law was disappointed when she went there to investigate and was told that they had steam but also no jacuzzi. I was warned by Marriott reservations about the $29 daily valet parking charge, and, when we arrived, they were very clear about specifying that it would be $29 and we'd have to self park in the center lot to try to avoid this. I am not clear on how much that would be, but it wasn't that close and we were in the midst of a major rainstorm, so I was fine with paying the $29/day and considered myself fairly warned. Hollywood has come a long way in recent years, but there's still an underlying grittiness and seediness in the areas surrounding the major attractions.

I did not book under the group because my uncle's brother-in-law works for Marriot and we were able to get a rate of $69/nt instead of $159/nt (group rate). We checked in on thurs the 2nd. To my suprise, I was told since I was paying with a debit card, that they would have to hold an add'l $50/nt ($150 total) on top of the price for my room (approx $236). I wasn't happy about this b/c that was a total of $386 they were holding on my card. Our first impression of the hotel from walking in the lobby is that it was nice. Once we got in our rooms, we thought that is was ok for the price they charge for the rooms (reg 234/nt). We didn't even have face towels in the room! So, the next morning (3rd), we ordered wireless internet which was $12.99. I go online to check my bank account & there is a charge of $513 in addition to $386 on my card. I was furious! Come to find out, they said our employee discount form was not completely filled out. WHAT! My uncle went back and forth with them. B/c the form was not completed they took it upon themselves to charge me regular rate for the room without notice/call/permission. Needless to say, my account the whole time I was on vacation was in the negative.we checked out b/c we refused to pay that much for that hotel, the staff was not trustworthy, and the fact that my father's event brought so much money to the hotel that wknd. They charged us $69 for the one nt. I was not satisfied with this. I felt they should have taken the loss due to the circumstances and the fact that our event was at the hotel & b/c of them being deceitful, my account was messed up. Luckily I had money in another account. otherwise, i would have been thousands of miles away from home without funds when all they had to do was give us the courtesy of a call to inform us of the problem & to find out if we still wanted to stay in the hotel at that regular rate. My father's event had at least 100 rooms filled. Upon checkout, i asked to be refunded the internet fee d/t us having it for less than 2hrs. The manager refused & was not apologetic for the check-in staff's oversite of the forms nor of staff not notifying us that our card would be charged add'l monies. This issue was not cleared up with my bank untill tuesday the 7th which is the same day one of the manager's called as a f/u to my formal complaint. He was apologetic and said at the least they would refund the internet charge. He promised to call back the next day after speaking to the mgr who we interacted with on check-out day. Well he hasn't as of today (1 wk ago) nor is there a credit on my card! btw, walls are thin. we heard out neighbors having sex & valet parking is $29/day.

We arrived in our Hertz rental car .....from Temecula and San Diego Calif....at around 12 noon. an aside....Doing some research...we discovered that Hertz had a rental place withing the hotel...so dropping the car would be most convenient hiring with them....we had wonderful service form LA airport to San Diego rental with Hertz...we have never rented with them prior....we had upgrades on both rentals and good service...we normally rent with Avis...we will rent with Hertz again...make sure you join as a privelege member...it is free...and worth it:) At check in....this is what either makes a property a 5 or 4 star to me.....the service was incredible. Friendly, efficient....and just plain wonderful. We were offered an upgrade to a higher room....we have points saved with Marriot...part of this chain...and a member card...again free...not sure if this made a difference...but the room....offered a special view of the Hollywood sign...very memorable. the room we received...a king as requested....was extremely spacious....but were told so when we received th upgrade. The furnishings were a bit basic...and could have been better....but the size and views of the room made up for it. The bathroom in this particular room had a make-up/dressing area and then bathroom....bathroom had basic white subway tiling...bath was very ordinary...but clean. We did a tour here recommended by the concierge...LA tours...guide was very informative...as we were just in Hollywood for 1 day....we wanted to see as much as we could in a very short time.... I am a lover of old Hollywood...the 30's, 40's....not much here to see/learn about unfortunately...they have not much left to salute those who made Hollywood...sad.... The hotel is attached to Kodak theatre...where the Academy Awards are held....and you literally walk outside a block and turn...and you are in the middle of it all....Walk of Fame, Hollywood Museum...(Max Factor Building)...which we toured...did have some old Hollywood pics and memorabilia...did the Tussand's Wax Museum...great time for a cheesey thing to do:) we walked into Musso and Frank's ....an original restaurant of old Hollywood still left...but the street here was getting seedy...and if was a bit stuffy inside...in terms of breathing I mean...had a hard time breathing...have asthma....the menu was not our cup of tea either...and pricing high...but seemed friendly...and cool to think the stars dined here... We decided to venture to the original Hotel where the Academy Awards were first held. The Roosevelt...which was actually recommended by someone here on trip advisor...it also has an amazing location. It is an old Hotel with lots of History.... older decor...very decadent...The restaurant (which was recommended by our tour guide) is known for its Hamburgers and wine. This was our second restaurant that had this idea on our trip to California....:)....so...we indulged.... The Sweet Potato fries were perfect...not soggy...and full of flavour...the hamburger was great...very big ...a bit too big to finish...but great....service was happy and friendly...we sat in read leather booths...the little restaurant was jam packed...decor...dark red walls and painted red tin ceiling...very cool...felt like I was transported back in time... We walked though the hotel...it is supposed to be haunted on the 9th floor we were told...and there was a Marilyn Munro mirror that hung here that was supposedly haunted...it is now in a museum...but....they do keep Marilyn's room...where she used to stay...we were very priviledged to see it....felt very strange once inside of it....very neat room...kind of eerie...but what a memory!!!!! We then went back to our hotel and walked through the lobby to the adjoin to see where the red carpet area is..(Academy awards) .there is a shopping mall here with plenty of take out restaurant choices ....seeing where the Academy Awards are held was very memorable... Back at our hotel at about 10pm....the concierge asked if we enjoyed our day....so friendly...:) the next morning we were flying home...as we are with Air Canada...and they offer no meals what so ever unless you pay $10 for a sandwich etc...we decided to order room service....It was prompt...and again the fellow was very friendly. The meal was very good...eggs perfectly cooked, as was the bacon ...the juice was lovely and coffee good...pricey...but good. We booked a shuttle to the airport here....save $$$ by not taking a cab.... down to the lobby...again...friendly....bigger lobby area...with a starbucks at the entrance.... I would say if you are staying for a short stay...this is your hotel...clean, updated, friendly....and at $189.00 per night....CAA rate...we think this is good value for the location.... Valet parking here is $29.00 Parts of the Hollywood area are quite seedy...and we did not feel comfortable by 9pm walking to the end of ....where the stars' plaques on the sidewalk were ( to read the names)...during the day...I felt fine.

When we asked for a couple of additional sundries, they were there immediately and tried to please us as much as they could. This service from the cleaning staff was one of the Hotel positives. I would like to bring to the hotel's management and to your readers' atttention the terrible treatment my wife received from the Bell boys. Upon departure, we called them. They took about 20 mins to come and they were quite rude to my wife. Throughout the moving the luggage experience they continued to speak non-English to each other and when my wife gave them a $5 tip, they laughed at her and effectively told her off.

We paid $29 more (total not each) per day from the best room rate I could get from the hotel which then included a full hot buffet breakfast for us all.

Only issue we had was with ABC where the signal would break up all the time making it unwatchable. We told them but it didn't improve.

This was definitely the best place to stay as there was so much going on. The best thing about it is the location - I could not believe how near to the walk of fame and Kodak and Chinese Theatre we were! Also seeing the sign from the hotel was brilliant. The rooms are rather basic (maybe only to us after leaving a luxury Vegas suite) but had everything we needed. Liked the make up mirror and complimentary Aveda toiletries in the bathroom and the Starbucks coffee and coffee maker. We had a view of the H&H complex which was very private. Housekeeping good and we had clean towels and more coffee every day. Great to have free air con and safety deposit box. All the staff we dealt with in the hotel were lovely, the concierge was especially helpful. We went to the jazz brunch on the Sunday in Twist Restaurant, what a treat! All the (delicious) food you could want and unlimited mimosas (bucks fizz!). Our server was lovely, the music was fantastic and it really was the perfect start to any day. We also had a couple of drinks and coffees in the bar downstairs, enjoyed the free nibbles with the cocktails and beers. One night they had a Frank Sinatra tribute singer who was great. The pool is really nice, however when we went up there were only 2 free beds (in the shade) which we grabbed for half an hour or so just to chill out. The others (prime spots in the sun) were all covered in towels and no-one to be seen. Grrr. Whilst in LA (only for 3 days) we went on the hop on hop off bus tour on one of the days which was very good. We stopped off at Beverly Hills and Venice and Santa Monica beaches, fantastic. We spent the rest of our time in Hollywood, we loved it. On the Sunday there was a movie premiere of Legend of the Guardians and the place was buzzing, it was really exciting. We had lots of lovely food but in particular loved the Hard Rock Cafe which was on our doorstep. We ate there twice and had lots of drinks in there too (both top notch). The interactive stuff is so cool on the walls and as you would expect the music is great. All in all, a fantastic trip. We really loved LA and found it to be a very friendly, cool and trendy place with fantastic food and shopping. We found it cheaper than San Francisco and Vegas.

The $329/night was an Executive City-view Suite and it was lovely. The $229/night was a \"Standard' city view room, and it too was very very nice.

Check in was on the slow side and when I asked questions she was quite rude with her responses. The room was clean, not too small and had a nice view, but for what I paid I did expect more. The biggest problem however was the fact that I paid extra for a package that included sparking wine and strawberries upon check-in and after a quick search of the room....neither of them were present. Made the first call to the desk and was told rudely that the staff that was responsible for them didn't operate till 5pm...what the......?? And I was supposed to know this how? 5:30pm...still nothing. I make the 2nd call, this time I'm told that they will be someone up right away to deliver them. At least this person had a nicer attitude about it, but still was not impressed. Finally got tired of waiting and went out at 6:30, talked to someone downstairs and once again, they told me they would take care of it. Got back at 9pm and you guessed it, still nothing to be found! This time however there was a voice mail left saying that I would be getting them shortly...this msg was left at 7:30... A 4th call made at 9pm got me the response that there were sending up someone right now with them......and at 10pm I finally got them. Didn't even have the nerve at this point to argue and question the delivery guy, he probably had nothing to do with this anyways. Also just in case anyone is wondering, the wine and the strawberries were actually good. Aside from this, the valet parking was decent....not once were they accurate with there timings but I never waited more than 15 mins so I'll overlook it The one good thing I can say about this place was the breakfast. Had the breakfast buffet and all of the food was excellent, everything was fresh, tasty and the made to order omelets were excellent. The guy working at the bar was the only friendly employee I met on the whole property. This place aint cheap neither, so my expectations were pretty high and boy was I ever disappointed. At the end of the day it did provide a place to sleep and the location was good but it didn't do much else, the next night I just decided to stay at a best western, it was 1/3 of the price and had far better service.

A bellman rolled our luggage from the door of the hotel to the front desk, and advised us that someone else would be taking it up to the room after we checked in. And then he stood and waited..... for a tip. 2) Another bellman took our luggage upstairs, sat it inside the door. No offer to get ice, directions. Didn't even turn on the AC. 3) When we checked in we valet parked at $29 per day. We called for our car 1,2,3 times. No answer. We decided to walk to dinner. 4) After returning to the hotel after dinner, we called housekeeping to get a set of sheets for the sofa bed for our 8 yr old. 3 calls before someone actually picked up the phone. Then after we requested the sheets, 1 hour later, no sheets. We called again, and the sheets arrived 45 mins later. By that time our child was fast asleep. 5) Saturday at the pool, one single waiter for the entire pool. I placed an order for a sandwich - a variation of a BLT, except it was a Salmon, Bacon, Tomato Avocado. I asked for no bacon. 1 hour and 30 minutes later it arrived ..... but it had bacon. The waiter took it back and said he would bring a new one. 1 hour later, still no sandwich. The kitchen refused to make another one. Really? Is that supposed to happen?

I would describe the hotel as a standard 5 star chain hotel, clean and comfortable. The rooms were a good size, I stayed in one with 2 double beds and there was still plenty of room for our suitcases and to move around. The room was very dark in the evening, the hotel needs to invest in more lighting.The pool deck is pleasant and the water is heated, great after a long flight. There is also a standard gym next to the pool which is free. If you don't have a room with a view of the Hollywood sign you can get a good photo from the terrace of the shopping centre next door and also the pool deck. I had the continental buffet breakfast one morning, very filling and it kept me going all day. I went on the movie star homes tour while there, (if you are keen to see their homes you'll be let down, unless you get a thrill from seeing gates and obsure windows). It is however, a very pleasant drive through the rich areas in LA and if you are into gardens you'll see plenty of nice ones. If you have a car I wouldn't bother with this tour, you can do it yourself. I also went on the hop on hop off bus tour. I wouldn't recommend this either, I'd take public transport. This service only runs every half hour to 45 min depending when you go and we got stuck in Santa Monica due to a timetable error and had to catch the local bus back to the hotel, which was easy. Madame Toussaud's is also located just around the block from the hotel. I got a free ticket with one of the tours. I thought there would have been more statues, I went through the exhibit quite quickly. The Grove shopping centre is very nice and upscale (the Abercrombie & Fitch store had a good 'sale' area when we were there), the Farmers Markets next door to The Grove were a let down.

It is a beautiful place with impeccable service, located at the corner of Hollywood & Highland right next to the Kodak Center. It took us only 12 minutes to walk to the Bowl. We didn't use the valet service because it was $29 per day to park. Directly connected to the hotel is Kodak's parking garage (with security personnel) for only $10 per day and can be parked overnight (big savings).

This time we chose the Renaissance and it was a great experience as usual. The common areas/lobby/bar are nicely decorated, elegant without being stuffy; check-in was welcoming and friendly. There are two bars: one in the lobby, which closes at different times depending on what guest activity is like, and one upstairs in the restaurant, Twist. We love the lobby bar as it's very comfortable. Be aware that drink prices are high by many people's standards, not unusual in Hollywood, but it's easy to run up a $100 check on appetizers and cocktails for two. The rooms are very clean; the decor is that almost-generic sleek modern style that isn't remarkable but works fine while you're there. A room with a view of the Hollywood Hills is well worth the upgrade charge, especially if you can get a higher floor. The concierge lounge isn't open on the weekends so it may or may not be worth the upgrade charge there; when it's open, it's got a fantastic view of the Magic Castle, and the continental breakfast is a nice selection, nothing too fancy but good pastries and bagels and lots of coffee. Food service tends to be quick, efficient and tasty, again priced a little high but at least you get some nice giant prawns on your $17 prawn appetizer. Breakfast at Twist is usually a good experience; we had less than attentive service on our last visit but nobody's 100% I suppose. My only \"caution\" with this hotel is that it attracts a LOT of partiers. Weddings, bachelorette parties, conventions, guys' weekends, you name it. We had an early flight and left at 6:30AM, right when a cab full of clubbers was coming home to sleep. The common areas do get a lot of traffic late at night; don't be surprised if the elevators are full and slow at 3 in the morning. The guests sometimes get a little rowdy--- I've had to call hotel security on two different trips to ask them to quiet down the neighbors--- security handled these requests gracefully and promptly. Considering I've stayed there about 8 times, this isn't a good average but at least they take care of the problems quickly.

The room was a good size with a very clean and roomy bathroom, which had the usual complimentary toiletries and also a proper hairdryer for you to use. Large mirrored sliding doors opposite the bathroom housed a good size wardrobe which contained an ironing board and iron and a small but adequate safe. There was a large flatscreen TV showing a number of digital channels on top of a unit containing 4 good size drawers. Next to this was a desk and chair for business users where u could plug in your laptop. There is a charge for this although I'm not sure how much as I didn't use it. There was a nice little coffee maker and we managed to adapt it to take our PG tips t-bags by removing the coffee bag and replacing it with the t-bag. Creamer,sugar and sweetners are also provided. There are no overhead lights but 3 lamps are provided and these were more than adequate. There is also a very efficient air con system which was good as the large size picture window does not open. Between the beds there is a bedside table which had a clock radio on it that also played/charged your ipod, which was very handy as the daughter had forgotten her charger! The beds were very comfortable and each bed had 5 pillows on it which were very soft and comfortable. The location of this hotel is excellent with a direct exit onto the Hollywood and Highlands shopping centre and barely a few minutes stroll to Hollywood Boulevard and its attractions. Thankfully we had excellent weather with a short heatwave in the mid 80's F so we were able to take advantage of the pool area. The pool didnt seem to be heated but was really refreshing after a hot day sightseeing. There are lots of sunbeds to lounge on if u just want to relax and there is a pool bar serving anything u want from cocktails ($10)to mocktails and soft drinks. ($4) There are also a few gazebos with sides and seats and tables if u want to keep out of the sun.There is also a spa offering a range of treatment for a fee and a small gym which is free to guests. Another thing I was pleased with was a computer at the concierge where u can check into your flight home and print your boarding pass, something I was worried about before I went.

I'd avoid rooms near the elevators especially near the concierge lounge since that tends to have a lot of foot traffic. The rooms are nicely sized, I wouldn't consider them to be spacious, but I've never felt cramped in them. I only have a few minor annoyances with the hotel, first being that $29 to valet park overnight is really expensive and I don't know if I would spend that much if I had to pay out of pocket. Second, the key slot for the concierge floors in the elevator is too low. Third, the key slot outside the concierge lounge is too flaky, often involving 4 or more swipes to get it to work.

On Highland Ave right on the corner of Hollywood Blvd attached to shops and restaurants. As Australian's we had never tried California Pizza Kitchen before and loved it! The hotel is lovely and well presented. The rooms are a good size and bed was extremely comfortable. We did have one problem on our first night. With about 20 floors we were unlucky enough to be put in a room next to a big suite full of women celebrating a hens night and it was so loud. I went down and complained and the first guy I spoke to behind the counter told me rather rudely that no one else had complained (no one else was in the room next to them!). The second guy (at the Bellman desk) was fantastic and after I explained that I didn't want any action to be taken except for a room move he was very reasonable. However when he turned me over to the next guy behind the counter he was very sour and seemed quite put out over our room change request. We were changed rooms 6 floors up and it was very quiet and peaceful with a great view of the Hollywood sign. The guys at the front doors were always polite and friendly. I guess it depends what you want in a hotel. We stayed for four nights and I think that was enough. We had already travelled to Hawaii and Anaheim and had stayed in places with free internet access (not here, I think it was about $13 per day), a fridge to put things in (the fridge is stacked here and to buy anything out of it was expensive) and no washing facilities (except expensive drycleaning). On the hotel map it says there is a little shop (which was in other places we stayed) but going there it was a Hertz office. So if you want little incidentals during your time there you have to walk to a little shop in the Highlands complex.

The location is great if you want to explore Hollywood. The hotel is literally half a block off Hollywood Boulevard. Everything you could ever need is within walking distance. The place was mostly spotless, and I certainly have no complaints in regards to cleanliness. Where I can complain is in the service department. While folks were nice enough, the competence level was lacking. The hotel could not find my reservation (which was made over a month in advance) and did not want to give me the government rate for which the room was reserved. They wanted to charge me the full $299 rate for the same room. The guy working the desk seemed to have difficulty understanding that I didn't think I should have to pay full price since I was there for a conference being held in the very same hotel, and I had reserved well in advance at the lower rate. Eventually the matter was resolved, after I had already been charged for the full price, and the difference was refunded to my credit card. When I got to my assigned room, I could not believe they actually charged $300 a night for THAT. The room was little more than a standard hotel room, with a bed, a desk, a television and a bathroom. I have had one bedroom suites, with full amenities included, for one third of the $300 nightly rate for this room. Granted, they were not in Hollywood, but is Hollywood really an excuse for such exorbitant rates? The view from my room was also horrid. The window looks out onto the roof, and all of the air conditioning equipment for the third floor. My view was of the hotel wall and a roof access door, with several soggy cardboard boxes strewn about. Someone obviously didn't consider that the area could be seen from the room windows. Also, the flea-bag motel next door had me concerned that I might be witness to a crime if I watched long enough. The fact that the hotel charges $13 a day for high speed internet access, which most hotels I have stayed in provide for free these days, was just an added insult. It seems that this hotel caters to people who have plenty of money and don't mind parting with it quickly.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "LawsonsScotland", "ReviewID": "UR47818055", "Content": "Awesome hotel,the rooms,staff and location were all perfect,the only bad thing i could say is having to pay $12 for use of the internet.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "iluvla", "ReviewID": "UR47713152", "Content": "We stayed for a month and had a wonderful time.

So, why so few stars? Well, the room that I was in had connecting doors, which afforded absolutely no sound insulation. Now I hate these. If you are staying with family members, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the next room you can get hold of them fairly easily, via the corridor. Connecting doors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t used by 99% of guests, but mean that you can hear what next door are ordering from room service.

For the Renaissance, we combined two different packages for two separate days. Our first impression upon arrival was a little mixed. When we walked into the lobby, there was a band in the lounge area playing exceptionally amplified music to an adoring crowd. But the concierge (or \"customer wrangler\"?) was there to guide us to the front desk, where both the desk person and I had to pretty much shout in order to talk over the loud band. Most likely your arrival won't be nearly as loud, though. One of our package deals included room service \"pizza, two soft drinks\" (10\" turned out to be just the right size for two people to share), an in-room movie and breakfast. The other packaged included a 50 minute spa treatment (upgrading to an 80 minute massage would've only cost another $40 or so) and lunch. Both deals included valet parking, which was quite a relief not having to worry about hunting for parking or paying extra fees for stashing the car in self parking. The front desk provided me with a discount card (typical discount was 10%) for a number of the eateries and shops in the mall between the hotel and the Kodak theater. Right now, new reservations at Renaissance also come with a $50 discount off any Spa Treatment\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. which my girl ended up using on a pedicure she was happy with. In the room, there was no minibar, no room fridge and no room safe (which I would have loved to have had, since I like to lock up un-needed credit cards from my wallet or my computer or passports or whatever). Closet holds an iron and ironing board and also plastic laundry bags. There's a complimentary overnight shoe shine service but the first night I called for the bell guy to pick up my shoes and he never dropped by. They did a fabulous job on my shoes the second night, tho! Room had a flat screen TV and an interesting box next to the TV where one can plug in various cables (like a stereo connector cable from an iPod, a VGA import port from your laptop), presumably so you can stream music or movies into the flat screen TV. In room movies were included in one package, but the audio / video quality of this in demand service were remarkably terrible for the big screen TV (the first screen you'll see of any movie is \"This movie has been edited for size\" screen; big screen TV's don't matter much when the resolution being displayed is bad). Twist restaurant is open only for breakfast and not for lunch or dinner. Sandwiches and salads are catered by Wolfgang Puck's kitchen and are available at lunchtime by the pool. Don't worry about dinner options within the hotel. If you're not up for doing room service, just walk next door to the mall and there are a number of semi-formal and informal places to dine. The fitness center (next to the Spa, just indoors from the 4th floor outdoor pool) has a very nice collection of equipment. One neat little feature is that you can plug your iPod into a number of the exercise machines and watch full screen movies or stream music from your iPod through the machine. Internet is available via either WiFi or Ethernet cables within the room but once you buy it, you'll be set for 24 hours and it'll also enables unlimited domestic Long Distance on the phone so you can keep in touch with family/friends via a cordless landline instead of relying on your cell provider.

Anyway, the location as many other reviews have indicated is excellent. Seriously, just a hop skip and a jump from the walk of fame, Grauman's, metro station, Kodak ..... The whole area became so familiar to us. The lobby area was nothing special but there is a side entrance to the Hollywood and Vine shopping area where all the other attractions lead off. This is a huge convenience. We had a double queen room - we were two adults and two kids (age 8 and 16). The room was larger than 'normal' queen rooms and it certainly made a difference. Room was very clean and fresh, nice and bright with a great view of the Hollywood sign. Bathroom was fine. Breakfast in the Twist Restaurant was an excellent start to some very busy days. There is also a fab doughnut shop opposite for early morning coffee - Highland Doughnut was a great hit. I think that the best thing about staying here was that because we were in the middle of it all we found that we weren't rushing round and could take more time to explore at leisure. Universal Studios is only one stop away on the Metro train and there is a tourist office outside the Kodak Theatre that is very helpful.

I chose the hotel based on its proximity to where I was doing business. If I was going on vacation, I probably would not stay in the Hollywood area. Check in was fast and friendly. I asked about a late check out and was told that for a small fee I could check out as late as 6:00. I can't remember what the cost was but it was reasonable. The hotel itself is very well maintained and the room was in excellent condition. There was no peeling wallpaper or disturbing stains on the carpet. Everything looked very new and well kept. Both the bathroom and room were immaculate - I even tried to look for dust but I couldn't find any. Everything in the room worked, the bed was comfortable and it was extremely quiet. The security at the hotel seems to be good. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a staff member asking if I needed anything. While walking to the gift shop I was stopped by someone who I'm sure was just checking to make sure I was a guest. The only concern I would have is that the hotel is connected to a shopping mall and from what I could see anyone could walk off the street and into the mall right to the 2nd floor elevator lobby. The area is fine during the day and I felt very safe walking around. At night you need to be a little more guarded. I didn't have any trouble, but there are fewer people on the streets. There are some good places to eat within walking distance too. Just west of the hotel on the south side is a place called something like \"Burgers & Wine\".

It was a great deal for this price. We stayed two nights. The hotel is clean and convenient for the Hollywood and Highland Center (a random and unpreposing spread out group of stores/shops. You feel as though you are walking in the subway, very unattractive. However there is a Starbucks and CPK there which are great if you have kids and want a quick and affordable meal. The hotel also has a coffee bar which serves excellent if pricey coffee and pastries and a restaurant which we didn't try. The staff are helpful and friendly. You basically have to use the valet parking ($28/day). They have a ridiculous system of having to bring the car up for you to get one item from inside. I just wanted to go down and get it from the car, instead spent twenty minutes waiting for them to bring the car up. Of course they expect a tip for this.... Our room on the 8th floor overlooking pool, compact and clean. Comfy beds, nice duvets. Two small towels only. Had to ask for more. Room was noisy due to elevator noise but heard no noise from other guests at all. Ask for a room away from the elevator. It is a surprisingly intrusive 'whooshy' sound! Breakfast was very expensive and not worth it (room service). Go to the coffee bar or Starbucks. The pool was cool and there is no hot tub (disappointing). The pool is also only 4 feet deep. Lots of beds though and plenty of towels. They are a bit slow cleaning up though. We were there to visit American Girl, La Brea Tar Pits and teh mission our daughter is studying. Convenient for all three (though my GPS didn't recognize 'The Grove' as an address...) One major problem which was resolved: I was waiting to ask the concierge about a place to eat. The people in front were asking about \"Mam Mia' tickets. I thought I had somehow missed that this show was in town. When my turn, asked if there were tickets available for tonight. 'Yes' said the concierge and proceeded to book them through Ticketmaster. She printed out and as I walked upstairs I noticed they were for 2 weeks away. Went back down, concierge was gone. Explained problem to another. He said he would 'look into it'. Half an hour alter he appeared at our door with $190 in hand. Said his colleague had made a mistake and the show didn't open until the following week. Apologized and gave me the money. I wouldn't hestitate to stay here again at this price. By the way, the area gets pretty seedy within a few blocks. Yet another hotel which charges for internet ($12.95/day) Outrageous. If you sit on the terrace by the pool you can pick up Starbucks internet free if you have the Starbucks code (buy a card for coffee and it comes with it).

Immediately, the doorman/valet approached the driver and told him he needed to move the van because he was blocking someone. The driver began to argue with this guy. The argument developed, which drew the attention of the other valets. The driver ended up using obsenities with the doorman. While all of this was going on, I got my own bag from the van and went into the hotel. (I had pre-paid the driver.) I was rather disappointed that none of the Renaissance doormen/valets seemed to be concerned with me, their guest. I was able to check in early (which was a blessing after my 5.5 hour flight). The woman at the Front Desk, however, was horrible. She didn't welcome me (or more acurately welcome me back). Additionally, she didn't tell me anything about the hotel.

When I said, \"it was okay\", the Front Desk Manager wanted to know why. When I explained my issues, she offered me Marriott Reward Points.

I arrived before check-in time, but was put up in a room immediately. Construction was going on in the \"zen\" rock garden in the lobby the entire time I was there, so that part was not so \"zen.\" Otherwise the front lobby area was great--plenty of comfy seats to wait for friends or just decompress. First off, I would recommend when booking a room that you request to be on a high-up floor. I was on the 6th floor and my view was of a concrete roof, not of any of the beautiful Hollywood skylines you've seen in other pictures. It wasn't such a big deal to me, seeing as how I was not spending my own money to stay there, nor was I going to be in my room very much. The room was very spacious and contained a king-sized bed. The furniture style was modern, but not the most stylish. For some reason it felt like it had been decorated by someone in their 70s trying to pick out furniture that they thought was cool. The television was a big tube television, which surprised me, I thought they would have flat screen TVs by now, but not a big deal. The bathroom was nice, with a crescent shower rod and nice toiletries from Lather (The facial soap was LOVELY.), and a vanity mirror and hairdryer plugged in ready to go. Unfortunately, no bathrobes were to be found! Some local magazines were left on the table for my use, and a book of photographs of the area which was a nice touch. I was disappointed that there was no mini bar in the room, all food requests had to be made via the room service, which tacks on a 18% gratuity to your order. However, ordering room service was a pleasant experience. They greet you by your last name when they answer the phone, which is simultaneously nice and creepy at the same time. I ordered room service several times throughout my stay, and orders always came much quicker than I would have expected them to. The servers were courteous, always asking if they could enter the room before doing so. I ordered a variety of items during my time there: BBQ chicken quesadilla, berry parfait, eggs, roasted potatoes, a boxed roastbeef sandwich with chips, macaroni salad, and apple, seafood pasta (from Twist restaurant), mixed berry bowl, breakfast bento box. The food was satisfactory, but not spectacular. Portions were not huge, but not skimpy. My favorite item was probably the BBQ chicken quesadilla. A USA Today paper greeted me outside my door every morning, the wake-up call service was sufficient, as well as requests for the cleaning service to come later in the day during a specified time. The meeting rooms were fine, nothing to write home about but clean and serviceable. On the day I was scheduled to check out, my flight was not until the evening. The hotel allowed me to keep my bags in the luggage room no problem. (That night I ate at The Grill, which is in the Highline complex and is affiliated with the hotel. Ordered the chicken pesto penne, it was WAY too salty. Again, food was not spectacular.) I found the bed comforter way too warm--I actually found myself waking up in the middle of the night, back completely covered in sweat--but otherwise the bed was lovely. The pillows were a bit too soft for my liking though. The in-room internet package was great- around 13 dollars for 24 hours worth of access, complete with free local and national calls. The location was fantastic. The fact that the hotel was connected to the shopping center was fabulous for non-drivers like me, and the fact that I didn't have much time between meetings to explore. The fact that I could just step outside my hotel and be right on Hollywood Blvd was pretty spectacular. The Mann's Chinese Theater was great, and there was an adorable women's clothing store called Varga where I picked a great jacket. All in all, I found the customer service to be excellent and the rooms clean, roomy, and pleasant. Would recommend staying here if you have the cash.

This was a sightseeing trip with my family; I chose this hotel because I wanted something that was in a good location for touring around, and where we could sleep comfortably. I booked the hotel a couple of months ago, on the hotel website. At that time I requested the club level. I was willing to pay a bit extra for the convenience of the continental breakfast; I could not find a rate that included breakfast otherwise. When I got to the hotel, I learned that the lounge would not be open for 3 of the 6 days we'd be there. At my request, we were moved to a non-club level room, at a lower rate. They did not reduce the rate for our last night, however. (The rate was going to go up because of the New Year). Thankfully, however, the hotel is connected to the Hollywood and Highland Mall, and we did not need to have breakfast in the hotel. My husband brought up coffee from the Starbucks each morning, and we did not pay the outrageous prices for the hotel breakfast buffet. There was no minibar, but we did not miss that. I did notice that there was no in-room safe. We did not use room service, and housekeeping was adequate. The hotel was in a great location for sightseeing- we went all over L.A. and had a great time. There is an on-site car rental (Hertz) which was convenient. We parked in the mall for $10 a night rather than pay the $29 for the hotel's valet parking. The hotel was functional and served its purpose as a base for sightseeing, and a place to sleep and shower. It was in no way luxurious, but it met our needs.

It's held here every other year, so this was my third time at this hotel. Things have definitely gone downhill. I'll start with the pluses: The spa was nice. The room service veggie burger was really good. The bed was comfortable. My room was relatively spacious. I requested a refrigerator and they brought it within 5 minutes. But let's talk about the bad stuff. First of all, there was no minibar. Well, actually there _was_ a minibar-- it was just empty, with a note on it that it was \"being renovated\" and that one should call room service for food and drinks. Not exactly what you want to see when you're arriving very late and just want a Diet Coke. I was grateful my flight hadn't been delayed-- at least I got there before room service closed for the night. Why would you leave the minibar in the room if it's empty? Room service was also hilariously bad. I'd seen some reviews that said the homemade granola was good, so I figured I'd give it a shot one morning. When the guy brought up the food, he lifted off the silver platter to reveal... 2 boxes of Kellogg's granola! I said that I thought it was homemade, and he said oh, sorry, we ran out so I just brought you this. I'm glad I didn't order an omelette-- I probably would've gotten something from McDonald's. (They did eventually bring me the real granola, and it was pretty good-- nothing to write home about, though.) But the worst thing was the housekeeping. I noticed a nasty-looking red stain on the bedskirt and left a note for housekeeping asking them to please change it. When I got back to the room that night, all the sheets had been changed, but not the bedskirt. I ran into the maid the following day, pointed out the stain, and asked her to change it. She looked at it, shrugged, and told me, \"It's just ketchup.\" I was dumbfounded. Um, 1) it wasn't MY ketchup, 2) even if it _is_ something innocuous, I don't want to look at it! I asked her to please change it anyway and she made a big deal out of having to _call_ someone for a new bedskirt. Anyway, while it was convenient to be at the conference's official hotel, I would seriously consider staying down the street at the Roosevelt next time. There may be some urban legends running around about the cleanliness of the Roosevelt's pool (google it), but at least you can get a Diet Coke from your minibar.", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cPretty good hotel in a decent location\u201d", "Author": "NYCFrequent_traveler", "ReviewID": "UR22318454", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights at the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel using Marriott points, in November 2007.

We didn't eat in the hotel, but used the adjacent HIghland Center for several meals, which were very good, and even went bowling there. The area is very touristy in and around the Hollywood & Highland Center and on Hollywood Boulevard - but you can walk to several attractions including Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Museum. It is also a pretty good location for driving to other areas for sightseeing. However, get more than a few blocks away from the Hollywood & Highland Center and the area gets pretty seedy.

Upon arrival I was greeted by a nice gentleman who checked me in. Something that was a bit unique about check in was that the desk agent actually came out from behind the desk to hand be the key to my room and pointed me in the direction of the elevators. Nice touch, but that's where the 'niceness' of the hotel ended. MUSTY SMELLING ROOM I was checked into a room on the 13th floor which faced north and had a nice view of the Hollywood sign. However, the smell in the room was overwhelming. Before getting settled I called the front desk and asked if I could change rooms because the room really smelled musty and dingy. I was told 2 or 3 times by the front desk person that there were no additional rooms available however, when I insisted that the room I was in stunk too bad for me, he placed me on hold for about 5 minutes and when he came back on the phone said he found another room for me. I went to the front desk and received the key for room 1823. ROOM CHANGE When I arrived in room 1823, it had a little of the same smell but not nearly as bad as my room on the 13th floor. However, I had been traded from a larger sized room with a view of the Hollywood sign to a room slightly larger than the hotels storage closet. It also had '6-7' foot ceilings so I felt a bit claustrophobic. After a while I got used to it and at least it didn't smell as bad as the first room. QUESTIONABLE SECURITY On my second night at the hotel, I was sitting on the bed watching TV when I heard someone swipe their key in my door. I jumped at the sound of the door opening while hitting the safety latch. I quickly ran to the door and peeked through the eye piece and saw a gentleman's back as he rounded the corner. I called the hotel operator who patched me through security. I was asked if anyone had announced themselves prior to opening the door and I said definately not. The security officer came to the room and did an audit on my lock. After a while, I received a call from the front desk to let me know the attemped intrusion was by one of the hotel bellman who was delivering messages from the conference host. I actually never received the notice however, I did receive a verbal apology for their bellman not following the policy of announcing himself prior to opening the door to the room. DATED DECOR While the lobby and main areas of the hotel were rather hip and trendy, room 1823 was very 90's and need of a Hollywood facelift. For instance the TV in the room is still the regular old TV. You'd think when you pay $229 a night in a 4 star hotel you'd at least have a flat screen HDTV with a nice selection of hi-definition channels... not at the Renaissance Hollywood! I expressed this concern at check out and the front desk person said they get that complaint a lot and are trying to get it fixed. You have to ask yourself how long should it take? Many 2 and 3 star hotels already have HDTV's! ROOM SERVICE I ordered dinner room service one night and the food was very good. A couple days later I tried to order breakfast room service, however, I was told it'd be over 1 hour to have a bowl of oatmeal delivered to my room. I was encouraged to go to the restaurant on the 5th floor where I could get oatmeal from the buffet. Also as mentioned in a couple other reviews, not sure what the 80's looking mini bar is doing in the room since it's not stocked. I guess at this point I was really questioning why this hotel is considered a 4 star hotel! SUMMARY Overall, in my opinion, the only real thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent Hollywood location and it's Renaissance name.

Rooms were modern and clean with nice comfy beds. Having access to the Club Lounge for breakfast and snacks was great especially with 3 teenagers who are forever hungry. The hotel is situated right in the heart of Hollywood with easy access to all the sights - Kodak Theatre, Graumanns Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Fame. The hotel is also adjacent to the Hollywood/Highland Shopping Centre which is great for shopping and dining. We caught the metro to Universal Studios. This was very easy as the station is just down the street from the hotel and you only have to travel to the next station. Definately worth a visit. This was our family's 1st visit to Hollywood and we had a fantastic time. Yes it's touristy and crowded but thats what it's all about. I did quite a bit of research on TA before booking the Hollywood Renaissance Hotel and I was very pleased with my choice. We would definately stay there again!!!", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guernsey, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, hotel a few problems\u201d", "Author": "Doughballs", "ReviewID": "UR19579142", "Content": "Prior to my arrival I sent an email to the hotel with a couple of general questions. No reponse, so I resent. Still no response. A bad start...We picked this hotel for a holiday a) primarily due to the location, and b) I usually enjoy the Marriott/Renaissance chains on business trips. Location did not disappoint. It is smack in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard (Graumans, Kodak theatre) and in the middle of Hollywood and Highland complex which houses several eating options, from takeaway (one night we got a takeout from California Pizza and ate in room...) to formal. Also if you want to take any tours, many leave from Graumanns. But hotel did disappoint... Our first room, although a non smoking hotel, stank of smoke. Plus it was next to the ice machine on that floor which seemed to be leaking and smelt of gas. We asked to be moved which was not possible that night (we were in a suite, the quantities of which are limited). We were promised to be moved the next day and told just to leave our suitcases which would be automatically transferred. Next day before we left for the day I checked at reception re new room...and nobody knew anything about it. After a while they gave us a new room number. When we got back that night....no one knew anything about it.But we eventually did get the room. But communication and organisation seems to be a recurring problem. Even when we left, we had pre paid the travel agent, but the room charges were on the bill, and it took a lot of checking before this was rectified. The rooms itself, a 2 room suite was not great. It is billed as a chic boutique hotel, but in truth the (final ) room we had, while not exactly shabby, was just not great. Maybe the high rates are the privilege of being on Hollywood Boulevard, We took a 2 room suite as I was travelling with my 16 year old son, the sofa in the lounge folded down. But when folded down, it practically reached the TV, cutting the room in 2, so effectively when the bed was down half of the room was unusable. On the good side. A coffee/ tea machine, ironing board which made life easier. To be honest if I went to Hollywood again I might well stay in this hotel purely for location, but the whole experience left me a bit flat", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cFour stars Hotel\u201d", "Author": "doledes", "ReviewID": "UR19466823", "Content": "After finding a good rate on the Renaissance web site, I decided to book a 4-night stay at this hotel (180\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for a triple room). I have to say that the hotel met my expectations. This hotel is rated 5 stars but guests must be ready not to find that kind of luxury typical of a real 5 star hotel. I arrived at 8 pm but my room wasn't ready (although I informed them at the moment of my booking about my scheduled arrival time). Check-in staff told me my room would have been available in 30 min., so we went to the mezzanine bar in order to have a cup of tea (the lobby bar didn't serve hot beverages in the evening). The mezzanine bar is very big and there was a huge selection of different types of tea. The tea was very good and not pricey (about 3\u00e2\u201a\u00ac and it was served together with some complementary honey). After that we came back to the lobby at the scope of completing the check-in procedure (check-in staff asked my mobile number in order to call me once the room would have been ready). The time we waited was well worth because we had a room located on the 18th floor (one of the highest) with a beatiful view of the Hollywood sign (this was another request made when I booked the room). A bellman went with us and showed the basic features of the room. The room had two very comfortable queen beds and was quiet spacious (about 30 sq. mt)., no particularly luxurious and with no state of the art technology features (no plasma screen). The soundproof system wasn't exceptional but the BIG con I found in this hotel was the bathroom: it wasn't dirty but all the facilities looked VERY old and 1.000 miles far from what a guest can expect to find in a 4 or 5 star hotel. The location is great for people who want to stay in Hollywood or are not renting a car (two steps from the walk of fame and all the other Hollywood attractions). Finally, I colud check out directly through the TV system on the day I left the hotel; a good way to save some minutes. All in all the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel is a good option who is not renting a car and looks for a good hotel with all the services a guest can need (spa, swimming pool, etc.).

I loved this hotel and would highly recommend it. While it was out of downtown LA itself, it offered us the holiday we were looking for. It can be daunting staying in a city that you don't know sometimes as you don't know where to go, but there was enough on our doorstep to keep us entertained. The hotel room was fine, nothing overly fancy but a lot better than basic. We were on the 14th floor overlooking the pool. There was no noise whatsoever to be heard from our room. Another reviewer commented on the fact that there was no extractor fan in the bathroom. We stayed in 3 hotels on our trip and none of them had a working fan, which surprised me. The bathroom in this hotel was larger than our prevous hotel (Westin, Times Square, New York). The old-fashioned TV was a bit of a surprise but we ordered a movie all the same one night and no complaints. The lobby area was nice. You could get lovely ice-cold water from a dispenser which had lemons, oranges, grapefruits etc. in it giving the water a lovely refreshing taste. There was also a m&m dispensing machine, which gave free m&m's. Handy when you're waiting around the lobby! The hotel adjoins the Hollywood + Highland Centre which was just buzzing day and night. It was full of shops, eateries, cinema, bowling alley, the Grauman Theatre, Kodak Theatre. The Walk of Fame was right outside the Centre. The Centre offers an Elephant Card at the Information Centre on the ground floor, which offers discounts on a lot of the shops and restaurants. We ate breakfast and dinner in the Centre every day. We would head off an a trip for the day after breakfast. All trips departed from the ground floor of the Centre, which was practically on our doorstep. We walked the Walk of Fame as it was on our doorstep. We took the Starline trip to the Stars Homes, which was very good as it was only a small open top bus and the driver was very interesting. We took the Starline Hop-on-Hop-off bus which we didn't enjoy as it was a pre-recorded tour and was hard to hear. We took a train to the Universal Studios as it was just handier for us. The train is only a stones throw from the hotel. It only costs 1.25 for a on-way trip which is great value. Universal Studios was a fantastic day out. I would say that was the best money spent on our whole trip (having done New York & San Francisco also). We didn't have a car so we were very happy to have all the entertainment on our doorstep. We did walk up the street looking for somewhere else to eat but couldn't find anywhere. I wasn't taken by the area just up the street, but there was enough choice in the Centre for eating in, so it didn't bother us really. The only annoying thing along the walk of fame was all the people dressed up trying to get you to take a photo and then look for a tip.

We checked in at 3 and finally at 5:30 after we had been to the desk every 30 minutes after 4 p.m....they said oh, its ready. We'd been offered to down grade at the same expense and they could give us another room with a rollaway. Now, check the rates of this hotel and see if you'd like to sleep on a rollaway! As soon as we arrived we were asked to shop for an hour while our room was finished. We weren't happy about that, but agreeable and asked where to go and how to get there. So at 4 we returned and it still wasn't ready, that clerk asked about the rollaway and that it takes an hour and half to clean a room not just an hour. So we were asked again to go shop....we declined and said we'd sit in the lounge area not too far away. 4:30 came and went with no word on the room. I went back to the desk because we'd become invisible to all but the bellman who kept glancing at us while everyone else checked in and headed up merrily to their rooms. The new desk clerk said Sorry, it shouldn't be much longer. 5 p.m. (really 8 p.m. at home and in our brains and stomachs) still no room and the desk clerk called housekeeping and someone would physically go check on the room and see how it was coming. She assured me she'd come get me and let me know either way how it was going.....ready or not. Apparently she leaves at 5, so left without getting me or telling me anything. She did tell us our room was an Upgrade so she wouldn't change it if it were her....so not sure how the previous clerk thought a rollaway would be a great idea. 5:30, still no one coming to tell us anything and I went back to the desk...this time getting a room or we're leaving.....and was told your room is ready. Guess they didn't feel the need to come get us and tell us. There was no exceptional service at this hotel, no out of the way things done but we also didn't ask for anything. My goal after checking in was to never talk to anyone at the front desk again since 3 of the clerks I'd already met were no help.

Asked for a room with the view of the Hollywood sign and was given a wonderful high floor room overlooking the Hollywood Hills and sign. Room was clean and comfortable but our bathroom had no fan (my only complaint of the room). We choose to self park in the underground parking garage which is attached to the hotel and paid $10 to park overnite. U can reach the hotel by taking the garage elevator to the 3rd floor and briefly walking through the outdoor mall to the hotel entrance on the same level. The costs of going in and out during the day were anywhere from the $2 to $4 dollars but we never paid more than $10 so its cheaper than $29 valet charge. We ate breakfast several times at the hotel restaurant Twist and loved the menu - tried both the breakfast buffets and menu entrees and they are worth the price. Its also the same menu for room service from the restaurant so if you looking for something low budget there is Mel's Diner and IHOP within walking distance. Tried some of the restaurants in the adjacent Mall and found them to be very good. Especially The Grill (massive steaks) and Trastevere (upscale Italian). Went to both in shorts and polo shirts and saw people in t-shirts/shorts so although they appear upscale you can go casual and don't feel out of place. It's a Mall after all ! The hotel is within driving minutes of Universal and Burbank. (Burbank Airport is closer than LAX to the hotel so think about it if u can get a flight there from your hometown). West Hollywood is just minutes away down Sunset Blvd. and has lots of trendy bars, clubs and restaurants. WH is where the nightlife scene is - there is not much going on in Hollywood at nite. Santa Monica/Malibu beaches are about 30 minutes driving from the hotel and easy to reach. Beverly Hills is also easy to get too and about 20-25 minutes from the hotel. Tried Starline Tours for the movie stars homes tour and happened to catch Dr. Phil pulling into his driveway. Yes it was that Dr. Phil and he did wave back to all of us on the tour bus, lol For any movie buffs considering doing studio tours the best are Universal, Warner Brothers or Sony/Columbia Pictures. The guides we had were first class and knew the industry and studio lots well. We got to see many sound stages and sets.

He was booked a room here for part of a group booking for a work event. His work event was over at Hollywood and Vine and this was pretty close. For the last several years, his company would always book the Holiday Inn because their work event would be on a Thursday night and rooms would be around $150. But this year, the event fell on a Friday night and so the room rates were pretty close at the Holiday Inn so the event manager decided to book the Renaissance instead. I am glad they did as don't really care for staying at the Holiday Inn and chains like that. We arrived Friday early afternoon and valeted the car. I believe the rates for valet is around $20-25. Check in was fairly easy. In the entrance there's a lounge and little coffee bar. We got to our room quickly and since were were used to staying at the Holiday Inn, the Renaissance was a great relief. We had a view of the city and we could also see the pool. The room was nice, clean and modern. The bathroom stocks Lather products which are great. I know its handy when the products are good quality and smell nice. We were a bit hungry and I needed a pair of shoes for the event so we walked over to the behemoth Hollywood and Highland entertainment, dining and shopping complex. We had a Japanese cream puff at Beard Papa (awesome). There's tons of your typical shops in there. There's a movie theatre as well as a bunch of restaurants, Starbucks and a bowling alley. We only stayed a night and were out for most of our stay so I can't really talk about service, etc at the hotel. It was pretty good for our short stay. My husband used the pool in the morning while I went to Runyon Canyon for a hike with friends. The pool looked great and I wished that I had tried it. There were cabanas and a bar in the pool area so I am sure it can get quite lively. I definitely would stay again. There's obviously tons of great hotels in the LA area but if you want to be close to things like Hollywood, Universal Studios, etc. This is probably a good choice.

We ate in the hotel every morning for breakfast. They had a really good selection of cold and warm food and I would say it was well worth it. Staff were really friendly, rooms were a good size (what you would expect from an American hotel) and the hotel bar was quite small but nice to have an end of evening drink.

We went down at 7am and there was not another person about so we had the whole place to ourselves - fantastic. Everyone says about hiring a car but we found taxi's (and buses) worked for us. We used taxi's to get down to Rodeo Drive (about $20 each way) and then actually got the bus down to santa Monica Pier where we walked down to Venice Beach. The concierge in the hotel will be able to provide you details of how to use the bus and where to get it from. One of the highlights for us was having a tour of LA in a 1966 convertible cadillac. You get a private tour of the city and let your driver know where you want to go and he makes sure you see what you want to but then shows you some other sites that you may not have been aware of. Although this was $300 we thought it was one of the highlights of our trip. Another must is going down to Santa Monica Pier. We got the bus down here and then walked along the beach down to Venice Beach which is 'interesting' to say the least. One other think that we enjoyed was going for a early evening drink at Yamshiro's which is very close to the hotel. It is a Japanese restaurant set on a hill with great views over the city.

Also close to Universal Studios and Farmers Market which has the Grove shopping area. Actually, we had heard not to go to Disneyland because it was a distance from our hotel. We decided to go anyhow, and honestly it was only 40 minutes from the time that we left. The key is to leave early in the morning. We left around 6:30 in the morning and got there around 7:10. The park opened at 8:00 but we were able to park our car go to the tram and by the time we bought our tickets it basically opened up. I recommend this hotel for families with young kids, because it has a really nice pool. The temperature for the pool was perfect and the deepest part of the pool is no bigger then 5 feet deep. Also my kids seemed to enjoy the fact that the hotel had free m&m's for the hotel guest.. My kids everyday picked up some m&m's and loved it. I felt like the staff really treated my family great. They made us feel very special and my family really liked that. The only members of the staff we didn't feel that really went all out was the concierge area. They did what they were supposed to do, but I didn't feel that they took the extra step to make us happy. They were still very good, but after tipping them, I feel that they should take the extra step, to make us happy. For example, I asked them to recommend a restaurant. They recommended one but they didn't call the restaurant and make the reservation for us. Most concierge that I have worked with in the past, would make the phone call and reserve us a table. We stayed on the 15th floor and had a beautiful room, with a view of the hollywood sign. I just asked them if they had the ability to accomodate us with a room that viewed the hollywood sign and they said no problem. Overall the saying goes you get what you pay for. If you have the money to pay almost 300 a night, this is the right hotel for you, because you are treated like royalty. Last thing that was kinda negative. They have a valet charge of 29.00 a night or a self parking charge of 10.00 a night. We ended up paying the valet charge because we would go somewhere, come back and then go back out somewhere.

We would sit and admire the view in a morning and evening. The room itself was large, light and airy and very clean. Tea/coffee facilites were useful. The main attraction of the hotel is its location, right on Hollywood Boulevard with the walk of fame, chinese theatre, El Capitan theatre, Kodak theatre and other tourist sites. The centre is part of the Hollwood and Highland complex with plenty of dining and shopping available. In terms of dining, the hotel restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced and was probably our best meal whilst staying there. We happened to be there whilst the 'Love Guru' premiere was on so caught a glimpse of Mike Myers as he went in to the chinese theatre.

GREAT VIEW! ........ 7) SUBWAY - If you aren't renting a car - the subway is located right at the hotel and a great option for arriving from LAX Enjoy your stay!! We sure did.

I was told that instead I could get a take-out breakfast box and eat it outside on the street, or pay for room service. Finally, on my last night, there was a party going on in the room opposite me at 4am which spilled out into the hall. With loud music, people banging on my door, prank calling my room and shouting just metres away from where I was sleeping. I called security and reception several times and they refused to do anything about this. I then noticed that several guests at the party were Renaissance staff.

As we'd never visited LA I read a lot of reviews of what district to stay in as well as which hotel. In the end, following reviews of this property here we booked club level rooms at the Rennaissance Hollywood. Firstly I would say Hollywood is a pretty good place to base yourself for a first time visit to LA. It pretty is what LA is all about - we did the bus tour, a limo tour of star's homes and the Madame Taussads and Guiness World of Records attractions, which are right on the doorstep of this hotel. So it is very well placed. Self parking was $10 a day in the big parking next door - where there were also loads of shops and a cinema. The check-in staff were very polite and helpful. Room itself was pretty good - quite small for a 'suite' - once a single fold out bed was up there wasn't a lot of room. Also the door to the bathroom opened outward which was unusual, and automatically closed which the kids didn't like. The blind which covered the window was a bit tatty but still worked well to shut out the morning sunlight. Beds were very comfortable though The club lounge was good - with good snacks in the evening and a very good breakfast. Not too busy either. There was one member of staff in there but he didn't 'interact' with anyone, just sat watching his PC screen. I was talked into booking a stretch limo by the concierge to see the 'homes of the stars'. This was a rip off however (Topline I think it was). The driver wasn't that interested - we didn't see half the houses mentioned on the blurb and we finished 30 minutes early! When you're paying that sort of money you expect better. I fed this back to the concierge who took my details and said he'd be in touch although he never has. Overall I mentioned some of the negative points but our overwhelming impression was of a lovely hotel with pleasant staff in a superb Hollywood location. Would I go back?

They were very hospitable and thorough, but a few things were less than perfect. Allow me to explain. :) We stayed 2 nights. Upon arrival, I was very impressed. The decor of the hotel is fabulous - very modern and fresh. The rooms are okay as well, but not as nice as I'd expected from the pictures. Our room did have a very distant view of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA. Everything was clean and sanitary except for the tub, which had a grayish residue in the bottom of the tub. I think a little bleach and elbow grease would have taken care of that problem. Another thing that was frustrating is that high-speed internet was not available wirelessly -- only through an ethernet cord, and it's $9.95 per 24-hour period. Considering the price of the hotel room, I think internet should be included. And be careful if you do agree to those charges to pay attention to your bill. At first, they double-billed me, but I called the service desk (aka \"Delighted to Assist\") and they removed the charges. This hotel is in a great location. That's probably the best part. The Hollywood & Highlands shopping center is adjoined with the hotel. Grauman's Chinese Theatre is just around the corner, as is a Virgin Megastore, The Kodak Theatre, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Pantages Theatre (home of Wicked, the musical) is within about a 1/2 mile. Nearby restaurants include McDonald's, California Pizza Kitchen, Mel's Diner and the Snow White Cafe. The Twist (hotel restaurant) is very ritzy and I recommend making reservations if you wish to dine there. The hotel bar, located in the foyer, is nice and makes an excellent Long Island Tea, but its expensive as well. Also, transportation is readily available by cab. Cab drivers line-up out in front of the hotel, so you'll never have to wait on one! But fare can be very expensive if you're going to LAX airport -- something like $60 +/- depending on traffic. I recommend taking a shared-ride shuttle if you have some time to spare. It's $16/person. 1-800-blue-van or 1-800-red-vans. Make sure you make your reservations several hours ahead of time. Overall, I gave my experience 4/5 stars because everything was almost perfect.

The Mezzanine level of the hotel connects to the adjacent entertainment/shopping complex, so we could easily access restaurants, movies, and tourist attractions like the Kodak Theater and the Graumann's Chinese theater. We took a Starline Tour and walked the Hollywood Walk of Fame from the hotel. We were also several miles away from the Warner Brothers Studio VIp tour which we also took. The only complaint I had with the hotel was that upon check-in when I inquired about the rollaway bed I had requested I was told it would be sent right up. When time passed and it was not there and we were all wanting to go out I decided to go ahead with our plans and expected the bed would be there upon return. It was not. I called and this time I was told the person who would deliver the bed was on break, but that it should be there in twenty minutes. An hour later I called again and when the person on the other line said \"At your service\" I told them that he needed to answer the phone differently based on my experience thus far with the hotel staff. The bed was immediately delivered. When the man who delivered the bed saw there were four of us sharing the room he left and returned not only with extra towels, but extra coffee cups, shampoo and conditioner. I very much appreciated this attention to detail! We ordered room service one night and the food was delivered within the time promised and att he right temperature. The man who delivered the food said that the hotel was very busy and that we should just leave the table outside the door and not to call for pick-up. I was disappointed to see that the table stayed outside the room overnight and was removed mid-morning of the following day. The food itself was delicious and there were no complaints from any of us about it. The only problem we had was they only gave us two flatware services--despite it clearly being four distinct meals with four beverages, etc. Luckily, we had plastic flatware in the room from an earlier take-out meal so we \"made do\" using a spoon when a fork might have worked better, etc. The room was clean and the pull-down window shade blocked the sun nicely so we were able to sleep well even though we were on Eastern Standard Time and a bit out of sorts with the Pacific time schedule. All in all it was a good visit. The bell staff delivered our car in a timely fashion though I was a bit annoyed when at check-out two employees chatted away while we waited with our luggage needing to leave for the airport. The driver stopped, backed up, and then stopped so that we could not get to the car. I felt the reason he did this was that the bellman were busy loading the luggage of guests ahead of us and that if he pulled up we might load the car ourselves rather than waiting for the assistance of the bellmen depriving them of their tip. I don't know that this was the case, but it was annoying to me as we were watching the clock and anxious to get on our way. It was frustrating to see our car yards a way and the driver and another employee (the person who we had given our car receipt to for picking up the car) just joking around while we waited and waited and waited...... Other than that the staff was friendly and helpful. I used the concierge's service several times for directions and they were always on the mark. The gift shop at the hotel is very tiny and cramped, but almost anything you need is within walking distance to the hotel. There is a Starbucks in the adjacent shopping center and another right down the street, as well as another take-out place with fruit bowls, pastries, breakfast sandwiches, etc.-I think it was called Fatima's.

This hotel is fabulous! The staff was friendly and helpful. The check-in and check-out was quick and efficient, and we had a comfortable room with a wonderful view of the Hollywood sign and the Capitol Records tower. The complex that surrounds the hotel was great, you almost didn't need to leave the hotel complex if you didn't want to. There were restaurants, a movie theatre and plenty of shops to keep us busy. The Renaissance Hotel is a pick up spot for a lot of the tours of the surrounding areas. Also, there is a Metro Station on the back side of the hotel where you can catch a train that goes directly to and from Universal Studios for $2.50 round trip. We spent a day at the Universal Studios park and didn't have to worry about renting a car or taking a cab there. If you are going to take a Hollywood Stars Homes and City Tour, I would advise you NOT to take a Star Line Tour. The buses are filthy and unmaintained, they are unorganized, and the customer service is terrible. The half day tour that we took was so bad, we couldn't wait for it to be over. It was a hassle from beginning to end. At night the hotel complex comes to life with people strolling the streets viewing the stars on the Walk of Fame, taking snapshots of the Chinese Theatre, The Kodak Theatre, and watching the many street performers that come out at night to entertain and take pictures with the tourists. Our final night in the area, we went for dinner at a beautiful little Cuban restaurant called El Floridita. It was a five minute cab ride from the hotel and the food and ambiance was great. We had an excellent meal and enjoyed the live band and salsa dancing that the restaurant features on Saturday nights. All in all we had a wonderful three day stay.

We booked an executive king and a standard room with 2 doubles and requested connecting rooms and a roll away bed. All of our requests were met. The hotel is located atop of the Highland center with an array of shops, cafes, cinemas and restaurants to explore....fabulous spot. We were checked in efficiently and with a smile and told about the concierge floor offering breakfast for a $30 charge per room extra. We thought this great value and accepted this offer. Breakfast varied each day but there was cereal, fruit and some offering of either bacon, sausage and eggs each morning. They also had a variety of juices and starbucks coffee in the lounge. There were also breads and pastries on offer. In the evening there were snacks and during the day you counld pop up and grab a softdrink or water if you wanted also some pieces of fruit. Our rooms were very nice and clean, our executive king was also handicap accessable, so we had a huge bathroom and plenty of extra space. The room with the doubles had a smaller bathroom, but both rooms had mini bar, amoir and a large closet. We found the location to be perfect and used the train system which is located right in the Highland Complex, to get down to the Staples Center one night when we went to the basketball. It is a fast, safe and inexpensive way to get about, without the hassles of parking and LA traffic to contend with. An all day ticket is only $5 per person, and can be used on the trains or buses. When we finished with our passes at the end of each day we handed them on to some less fortunate folk, (which seem to frequent the Hollywood area)...who made use of them to get to where they were going. We booked tours through starline, which are just on the street in a kiosk at the bottom of the Highland center on Sunset. They will heavily discount for a family group...just ask, smile and be patient...we saved just under $100 for a family of 6. We did tons of walking and sightseeing around Hollywood and at all times felt safe. One day we walked from the hotel to the Beverly Center....we walked down Highland, onto Melrose and all the way to La Cienega and to the Mall....it took us 3 and a half hours...with stops for shopping, drinks and icecreams along the way...what a fabulous walk that was, enjoying Hollywood by foot is really something. ....I digress...back to the Hotel...we found the staff very friendly, the rooms spotless, the food delicious...even room service was very fast and arrived hot and fresh at very reasonable prices...so we took advantage of this a lot with snacks in bed while watching tv for everyone, almost nightly. The manager told me, when we were checking out that the rooms are due for a refurbishment, and that they were going to be fabulous, with flat screen tvs, new linens (nice already) and new pillows (which need changing), carpeting etc. The refurb is due to start early 2008. The spa is being built now too. Whilst there we saw, Judith Light in the lobby, we saw Tom DeLong from Angels and Airwaves checking in, we saw Jack Nicholson and Lindsay Lohan at the basketball, we saw the guy from Supersize Me...pushing his child in a stroller along Melrose and my husband saw one of the Baldwin brothers driving down Hollywood Blvd...but wasnt sure which one it was...so if you are into celebrity spotting....they really do get out and about in Los Angeles...we saw some and were kind of excited lol. We felt this hotel offered exceptional value for money, a wonderful location and very nice, helpful staff.

Adjacent to the Kodak Theater, Mann Chinese Theater, and Hollywood and Highland shopping center. 2) Cleaniless - Hotel was clean and comfortable. Bed was really nice to sleep on. 3) Public Transportation - The LA's red line light rail is located about a block away. The Red Line can take you to Universal Studios, Pantages Theater, and China Town (via transfer). 4) Great views from higher floors. Here are some of the things that I didnt like about the hotel. 1) Location - Its tough to get in and out of this hotel because the entrance to the hotel is along a small driveway that leads to the parking structure for the Hollywood and Highland shopping center. Hollywood and Highland streets are very busy and typical of Southern California gridlock. 2) Valet Service - Very busy hotel. Valet service can take up to 5 to 10 minutes especially in the mornings during check out. Be sure to call ahead. Expensive! Try and get a rate that includes valet service. 3) Bathroom - pretty small and nothing pretty about it. just a standard hotel bathroom in their standard hotel room. Sink, vanity, toilet, and shower are all located in one room. Pretty tight accomodations. You pay for location here. This hotel does not have the luxury amenities and features equal to its price.

One thing that I can say is that if you decide to stay here, definitely get a club-level room. The views will be much nicer and the breakfast, snacks, and desserts make the price difference well worth it. The breakfast - while basic - is more than adequate for a couple day's stay. The snack were pretty decent, and the desserts were quite good - although varied day-to-day and sometimes limited in selection. There are also water and soft drinks available throughout the day, which was convenient. However, don't count on the club during the weekend - from what I remember from the sign, it closes before noon on Friday and only re-opens Sunday night. The lounge also lacks a high number of comfy seats and also lacks internet facilities for guests (although staff seem more than determined to do high quantity surfing at their one desk while guests must ask for more food etc). The lounge was also strange in that many guests just came and grabbed stuff and took it to their room (presumably one reason is the lack of comfy-ness in the lounge). In other club lounges that I have been in, guests would relax and even mingle. In this lounge, that was totally non-existent. The room was fine. It was clean and I loved the natural light of the big windows. The decor was OK, but a bit \"busy\" and a bit non-functional (except the comfy chair) in my opinion. The bathroom was OK, but I hate the bomb-shelter feel that the heavy, self-closing door gives it. I also hated the \"big brother\" fridge - where you cannot put your own stuff in as it is completely slots... luckily at the club level, you can get free cold drinks until 10pm. There are a lot of wannabes staying and hanging around this hotel - this was a bit unpleasant, but maybe it does give you an insight into some people around La-La land. The staff are highly varied at this hotel. Some are quite good. Quite a few unfortunately cannot be bothered by guests apparently. Some of this is probably due to these kids having their heads in their star-life dreams.... things like bell-boys chatting about this-and-that while fully blocking the door for my wife who had to walk all the way around them and club lounge attendants surfing IMDB for endless hours while guest wonder if that is all the food there is. I also think that it must be due to poor training - this particular hotel seems so concerned about looking good that it gives the employees prepared things to say (e.g., saying \"delighted\" at the end of a conversation with guests) without concerning itself with whether the staff actually means it. I was subjected to so many fake canned statements that I wanted to puke......

On our arrival we were told by the female checking us in that they had no king size beds, this is despite the fact that I had telephoned approx 7hr prior from Mexico to advise of our late arrival. We were offered a double room as there were no king rooms left and when my husband explained he is too tall for a double bed we were moved into the disabled persons room (with a king bed) next to the elevator.

On each occasion we called housekeeping (or delighted to assist button on the phone) and were told they would send someone up straight away. We waited and waited and no one showed. Eventually on our third phone call over a 2 hr period, housekeeping eventually showed up. A message was left on our room phone message bank from the hotel advising they hoped our room had been cleaned and they wanted to ensure that our stay was special! The next day housekeeping knocked on our door and we said we will be 10 minutes and housekeeping said that would be fine and they would clean the room in 10 minutes. We left the room and arrived back 5 hours later and housekeeping had not touched the room. We called 'delighted to assist' and explained housekeeping had not been etc, the same thing had happened yesterday, they said sorry blah blah blah and someone would be up right away. 2 hours passed again before my husband called up twice more and housekeeping finally turned up at 4.10pm explaining to my husband they were not aware the room had to be cleaned earlier. Another downside, there is no laundry for clothes washing. The only alternative is dry cleaning through the hotel which is expensive. The reception/check in staff were not friendly (perhaps a reflection on the management) however the hotel did provide us with two beverage vouchers to the value of $16 each on our last day, however the same cannot be said for the restaurant staff at The Twist Restaurant at the hotel. The Twist Restaurant staff were friendly, helpful and ensured that all guests had everything they needed. We ate in the restaurant in the morning (The chilled buffet $16 is healthy and nutritious and delicious, American Buffet is $20) and the dinner menu is superb and the food delicious and fresh. Their wine list is excellent. The staff will chat to you and show an interest in you. We really appreciated their friendliness and kindness. The bellhops were really friendly and always ready to answer any questions we had. The concierge on the day we asked the gentleman a question, Tuesday 20th November was disinterested and unfriendly. The location of the hotel is great for all the tourist attractions in the area. Shopping is limited at Hollywood and Highland although there is a great DWS shoe store nearby. At nightime the area is questionable and sleazy at night and we would not recommend hanging around the boulevard for too long. It would not be a particularly safe place. We recommend Mels Diner for dining for either Breakfast, lunch or dinner which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel.", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel Weak on front desk sev.

This was our 2nd time at this hotel and it will definitely not be our last. We love this hotel and hope it does not change unless it is to become even better. You just cannot beat the location that is pretty much central to everything. Hollywood just outside your door, L.A (we love to go to the farmers market and Grove) and Beverly Hills min. away, Santa Monica- We love to just hop on Sunset Blvd. to the PCH, Universal about 15 min, etc. and there's even a metro stop just outside the door though we always use the car. Though Disneyland and Knotts were not the sole purpose of our trip, we did go one day each for those and the car ride there was not far either. In the 2 times we have stayed there, I have not encountered bad service. On the contrary, it has been quite excellent. The hotel and room are clean. We requested a roll away bed and mini fridge, extra towels and pillows and all came at no extra charge. Before your visit, if you book through them, they even email you a \"request form\" that includes things like early check in, fridge, extra pillows, etc. There's a pool area, at the time we were there they were adding a spa. It might be complete now. The Hollywood and Highland complex which the hotel is connected to is always fun with the shops, places to eat, bowling, and more. During this visit, one day walked out of the hotel and to our surprise Michelle Phieffer's Hollywood Walk of Fame Star ceremony was starting so we were up front and center! Actor Paul Rudd and Jeff Bridges were there as well and Jeff Bridges even took my camera and took a picture of the both of us for me!

Plenty of light in the bathroom. Water pressure was good. The hotel had very good gym with plenty of equipment. I did not use the outdoor pool. The Hotel is right next to the Highland Hollywood shopping complex which is convenient to find a place to eat.

Check in was incredibly quick, taking literally 1 minute to complete, which was a blessing as we were meeting friends for dinner less than an hour later and were pretty stressed out after a long drive through rush hour traffic from the airport! The hotel sends an email in the week before your stay asking if you have any specific requests, and we had requested extra towels and a refridgerator in our room. The pleasant receptionist noted this and said that they would be delivered to our room promptly. They arrived less about 10 minutes later. The room was reasonably sized and very clean, the bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. Our view from the 14th floor was of the pool area and into the Hollywood and Highland Center was pleasant enough. The bathroom was good, if nothing special, but the water pressure was good and the bathroom amenities were nice and replenished daily. Unlike some hotels the hair dryer was also moveable, and I was able to take this into the bedroom to use the mirror there whilst my husband was using the bathroom. Housekeeping was good, but there is a notice in the bedroom that says they clean rooms between 9am and 5pm, which meant that often when we returned in the early afternoon the room had not yet been cleaned. Nevertheless, they were efficient and unobtrusive. One of my few complaints with the room was that it was not particularly well sound proofed (although I am quite particular about noise levels). I never heard a thing from outside, or from the rooms either side of us, but people in the corridors could be heard as clearly as if they were in the room itself! Not that it happened regularly or was lengthy, but I was awoken twice by such noise. The air conditioning was good although, again, too loud for me, so I did turn it off during the night. We didn't use many hotel facilities, and didn't eat there. We did eat at Wolfgang Puck's Vert in the shopping complex attached which had a lovely ambience, great service and good food. One thing we did use was valet parking. It may be $29 per day, but for the convenience, speed of service and pleasant staff it was perfect for us. We also used the minibar for bottles of water, when we ran out, and they cost around $2 per bottle, which in terms of hotel minibars, isn't that bad. The hotel always seemed busy during our stay, with many conventions or events going on. There were all sorts of different people from business men, regular tourists to women in amazing evening gowns in the lobby and as such the elevators were slow and sometimes crowded. Overall, the Renaissance Hollywood is a reasonably priced hotel with good amenities in a great location for tourists. As a tourist who was meeting friends that were staying at different hotels around Hollwood, I can honestly say it was perfectly placed and of a better standard than many of the other hotels around the area. Literally a minute's walk through the H&H complex and you are on Hollywood Boulevard and right by the Chinese theatre.

I was not dissuaded from this view after seeing the guest rooms and meeting facilities. I was very surprised to learn that the hotel was a renovated Holiday Inn. It seemed to me that every surface had been replaced, renewed, or reworked effectively obliterating every trace of its former incarnation. My room was comfortable and attractive with all new furniture, bedding and carpet. It is a nice set up for business travelers with a large repositionable desk and comfortable desk chair. Unfortunately like many upscale hotels they charge for internet access ($9.95 per day). The bathroom was average size but had a nice marble counter and massaging showerhead. Tub, tile and all fixtures appeared to be brand new. The hotel is large - more than 600 rooms - and seems to cater to conventioneers. There are three floors of meeting rooms and most of the folks I saw around the hotel seemed to be wearing name tags. I was surprised not to see more tourists during my stay as the hotel is near the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Grumman's Chinese Theater. The attractiveness and newness of the hotel was in stark contrast to the surrounding area. As you sit in one of the Eames chairs in the sleek lobby and look out the front window, you see a run-down strip mall with a liquor store, tobacco shop and \"JuJu's Brand Name Fashions for Less\" as tenants. In fact, with the exception of the Highland/Hollywood shopping center next door, the area surrounding the hotel is primarily tacky souvenir shops and low rise apartments/\"residence hotels\" dating from the 1940s/50s. The Highland Hollywood block includes the hotel, the new Kodak Theater (home to the Academy Awards) and the attractive open-air Hollywood Highland retail/dinning complex. Unfortunately this new construction was not an impetus for any new development nearby and outside this one block, the area is very run-down. To be clear, the area is not blighted - we are not talking about abandoned buildings or broken glass - just tired, old, scruffy buildings. I did encounter homeless people sleeping on Hollywood Blvd, only a few hundred feet from the hotel. Dining options are limited. There is only one restaurant in the hotel - Twist - which is open for all meals. I had breakfast there and it was tasty but fairly expensive at $20 for the buffet or $12 for a simple quesadilla. The restaurants in the Highland/Hollywood center are primarily chains and fast food with the except of Wolfgang Puck's Vert. For a fine dining meal, you will have to travel a considerable distance. I stayed at the Hollywood Renaissance in mid-July 2007 for three nights in order to attend a business conference at the hotel. I paid $169 which was the negotiated conference rate. I thought the hotel to be a great value at this price. My interaction with the staff was minimal - check in was quick and easy, maid was pleasant, and waiter was cheerful. I was concerned that I was never notified that I had received a FedEx package. If the sender had not contacted me, prompting me to inquire with the concierge, I would have left the hotel without getting the package.", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cIn the Middle of All of the Action\u201d", "Author": "AustinTexan", "ReviewID": "UR8183636", "Content": "My wife and I, and our three children, spent two nights in the Renaissance Hollywood hotel (July 1st and 2nd).

Part of the blame must go the designers- I love IKEA but the hotel and room was dressed like an IKEA designer had suffered some sort of breakdown- where did all the money go that I read they spent on this place? Perhaps it was all spent on the original art that adorns some of public areas? Anyway, the hotel is part of the Hollywood and Highland retail complex, in the tourist heart of Hollywood. There are plenty of nearby options for food, including a nice little Italian restaurant on the 4th floor of the shopping center and even a little Starbucks at ground level where they will remember your order if you use it enough. Part of the problem is that the shopping center next to the hotel is not quite as glam as you might expect- too much concrete- and this detracts from the hotel itself. We self-parked our car which was less than the half the price of valet parking; drop off your bags first before parking though as it is a bit of a trek through the shopping center. The room style was cheap and cheerful; not particularly large but OK. The bathroom was a little drab but again OK, no separate shower though and a worn bathtub. Our view across the LA skyline was great and on a smog free day or evening was quite impressive. Security wasn't much in evidence and I recommend barring your room door before bedtime. Also check that the connecting door to the next room is locked (no that is not a closet!). Room service was on time and not bad.

To begin, the Renaissance is definetly a great place to stay as it is situated within walking distance to all the Hollywood sites such as the Kodak Theater, Grauman's Chinese Theater, Walk-of-Fame, etc. The hotel is connected to the these sites as it is a part of the \"Hollywood & Highland Complex\". Shopping and Dining are also available within the complex. Compared to other areas of Hollywood (very close to the Renaissance) it is one of the nicer and cleaner areas. The neighbouring streets can be a little scary to walk through at night, I was with a group of guys and it was still a little intimidating. The complex itself was very safe, and had security on duty 24/7. The hotel room was a good size and came with 2 queen beds, which were amazing to sleep on. Ask for a room on a high floor for a view of the city and the Hollywood Sign. The staff were very friendly and courteous as well. The Renaissance is pretty centrally loacted within L.A. and is within a 20 mintue drive to all of the sites. The Beverly Shopping center, a major mall, is about a 15 drive from the hotel, and Rodeo Drive, which I highly recomend a visit to, is about 20 minutes from the Renaissance. If you decide to do a holiday in L.A. definetly visit Santa Monica Beach/Mailbu/Laguna/and Beverley Hills. I would also highly recomend a car rental to take you to these areas as the taxis are expensive. You can do self-underground parking for $10 a day. Before I end the review, I would HIGHLY recomend a drive up the coast of California. Our group decided to fly into LAX and fly out of San Fransisco (about 10 hours driving distance from each other) but the drive was WORTH IT!!! Amazing views of the mountains and ocean.

Housekeeping was not as meticulous as I thought it would be for a hotel of its caliber. At any given time there would be room service plates on the floors and I thought that was tacky looking for a hotel of this calibre. I had to call housekeeping to do my room on the 3rd day because they skipped it almost two days in a row and I had NOT put up any do not disturb signs, so i don't know why my room was ignored.

It was a spacious room with a good sized bathroom, much bigger than the regular room we looked at. The room was pretty clean, but for a newer hotel, it showed some wear, especially the carpet. I don't want to be overly critical, because it's in a great location, lot of places within walking distance and close to the subway, and it is fine, it's just that the tripadvisor reviews make it sound so wonderful when really it's an average, fairly comfortable 31/2 star hotel, and for $300 a night, it should be at least that.", "Date": "November 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "Caro_Z", "ReviewID": "UR6141395", "Content": "We went to Renaissance for a business trip.

The hotel is in one of the best locations in LA if you want to be based around Hollywood. The hotel is part of a huge complex, which includes a shopping mall and restaurants and opens right out onto the Hollywood Boulevard. One exit actually takes you down onto the Chinese Theatre forecourt where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find sight seeing trips and film stars handprints in concrete. There are also countless impersonators hoping for you to have your picture taken with them for a few bucks. One evening we listened to a Nirvana tribute band playing on the boulevard. Whoever they were they kept us entertained for half an hour with a good rendition of Seattle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest. All this is within 5 minutes walk from the hotel reception. The hotel itself is nothing special but it is a nice modern well-run hotel with comfortable rooms and a great pool area. The only criticism I would make is that the internal design seems a little bland, especially in the lobby bar area. But hey it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no big deal. The hotel is also about 5 minutes drive from one of the freeways, which means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get out to the sights of LA even if it takes a while to get there.

Sady, our experience is different to that reported by some others. We were rather disappointed with the standard of some of its services and staff who seemed poorly trained and/or supervised, over-stretched or plainly inefficient. It has a good location. Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Kodak Theatre, Walk of Fame etc are all only a few hundred yards from the Hotel. There is also a Metro Train Station and several Metro Bus stops behind the Hotel. (A 'Metro Pass' for one day costs only three Dollars and allows unlimited travel by Metro Trains and Buses. We went by Metro Bus to Santa Monica and the Getty Museum; we went by Metro Train to Long Beach to visit the Queen Mary). The guest bed-rooms and the public areas of the Hotel are spacious and comfortable. Our room had clearly been very recently refurbished; it had grand views of the Hollywood Hills and Sign. The Venetian blinds were easy enough to pull up but tricky to let down fully. The room safe was also difficult to open and we decided not to use it. As the first room we were given had not been properly cleaned (there were nail clippings on the carpet and the safe was broken) we were given another room. Reaching for a towel after a shower, I discovered that the neatly folded towel on the rail was in fact soiled and had what looked like blood stains. That was disgusting. When I complained, we were sent a new set of towels. We were also sent a bottle of Champagne, compliments of the Management, which we politely declined. (Incidentally, the Champagne was brought into our room by a swaggering waiter who addressed my wife as 'my love' and seemed taken aback when we declined the gift; in case we had misunderstood, he said it was free !) Having settled our account prior to checking out, we noticed that we had been charged substantially more than the actual amount for laundry services. As we had the two original invoices in the room, we produced them to the dour woman at the Front Desk who examined them and said she would amend the charge she made earlier, but offered no apology. On the two occasions we had a look inside the Hotel's Restaurant ('Twisters') we did not notice any diners there but only the staff; its somewhat restricted menu choices may have been a little discouraging. We too decided to have our meals elsewhere. There are plenty of well patronised eateries nearby. This was in fact the last of several Hotels (in California and Las Vegas) we stayed at during this trip and we had no complaints regarding the accommodation or services at any one of those other Hotels. After allowing for the fact that the Renaissance has a rating of Four (not Five) Stars, we are still of the view that the incidents regarding the soiled towel, unclean carpet and (attempted ?) overcharging are unacceptable whatever the Hotel's rating.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cYou're paying for nice and convenient...\u201d", "Author": "HappyTravellerHK", "ReviewID": "UR5906722", "Content": "Stayed for two nights in September 2006.

Tips from previous reviews on this website allowed me to get an unbelievable rate using a promo code, and info on 'club level access'. Shortly after I booked online, I received an email from Marriott confirming my reservation and asked for any additional requests. I then requested 2 double beds, a fridge, extra pillows, a room on the highest possible floor with a view of the Hollywood sign, and club level access for an additional $30/night. We arrived on Sunday afternoon at 2pm. Upon arrival, the doormen/valets eagerly helped us with our luggage and led us to the registration desk. The desk informed us that we did get a room on the 19th floor w/ a view of the Hollywood sign, but it would not be ready for another hour. They gladly stored our luggage and gave us information on the shopping complex next door. The Hollywood&Highland complex is pure fun for first time visitors to Hollywood -- Walk of Fame, the El Capitan, street vendors, Batman/Wonder Woman/Capt Jack Sparrow and other characters all at your doorstep -- made our 1 hour wait quite entertaining. While the hotel lobby and public areas are furnished in modern leather furniture which can be found in any department store, I was truly disappointed by the room itself. The brightly upholstered furniture and bed covers screamed cheap 10-year old Ikea and the moveable desk straight out of Staples. Also, while the pictures on the website showed floor-to-ceiling windows, our 19th floor windows were large but only half the height. Also, I didn't like that the lights in the room were very bright and your only option for a 'night light' is to prop the bathroom door open. The bathroom was also quite small. This is not what I would expect for a hotel which normally charges over $250/night (even if I paid much less). However, this is only MY opinion. Our room did have a great view of the Hollywood sign, so I did not complain. My husband and 2 kids didn't mind or notice the furnishings and lighting and found them more than acceptable. The best part of our stay was the club level lounge, which happened to be 2 doors down from our room. My kids and husband found a variety of hors d'oeuvres and drinks served at the lounge shortly after 6pm that evening, and desserts and coffee served until late that night. In the morning, coffee, fresh juices, huge buffet breakfast and several newspapers (LA Times, NY Times, USA Today) were available for us to enjoy while we watched the morning news. Also, bottled water, soda and juices were available for us throughout the day. My kids were in the lounge constantly, and the staff was always friendly and accommodating. It made the hotel feel like home for only an additional $30/night, which is a fantastic deal for a family of 4 with hungry, growing children. You'll never have to wait long for an elevator at this hotel, as they are very fast. The service we experienced during our stay was stellar -- in addition to everything I already asked for, I called for extra robes and toiletries and received them promptly. There was a computer and printer designated for boarding passes at the concierge desk that we could use for no extra charge. The doormen, staff at the concierge, check-in and especially the club lounge were always very friendly and helpful.

This time the hotel has been rebuilt and is now the Renaissance with the Holiday Inn moving further up the road. As yo may know all hotel rooms in the USA have a copy of the bible. It seems the Marriott chain also carry a management book from their founder. It came as a surprise to me that of the 2000 plus hotels in the Marriott group, they actually only own about 20 or so hotels. They actually run hotels on a long lease. You can be sure that they know how to manage a hotel. The check in was a breeze and there was a genuine welcome. I was given a city view but I requested a view of the Hollywood sign and I got that without a problem. In fact my room also had a city view as well. The downside is that as it was an anniversary trip (and I am also a Marriott reward member) I got no offer of an upgrade or flowers or chocolates for my partner which was disappointing. The room was wonderful, modern and spacious. The bathroom was nice. The only strange thing was locating the safe which is located below the mini bar. The bell boy was very friendly and he not only suggested places to visit, but places to eat for breakfast as well as calling for a complimentary fridge so we could store our own food and drinks. Special mention must also go to the Concierge who was eager to help and assist. We wanted to take a bus to the Beverley Centre, and he downloaded the route and the numbered buses to take. It may not mean much to other people but just think of the amount of time where you are just given a leaflet at other hotels and told to go away. We had buffet breakfast at the hotel on several occasions. The range and quality was excellent. At $18 per head it was expensive. The restaurant service was good and attentive. As the weather was hot we used the pool everyday. I do believe it was heated because it was still warm in the evening. You can have good views of the H&H complex from the pool level and the Hollywood hills. I did think the pool's shape could be better. It could look crowded very easily with just a few people in the pool and I wished it was just had a rectangular shaped. They also needed to make sure that the towels were replenished during the late afternoons. They also had a good gym which was rather busy. The hotel tries to cover a lot of bases which it does very well. Its a family hotel for people on vacation, to a business hotel holding conferences to people having functions such as private parties and weddings. If there were negative points it was the valet parking attendants. Anyone entering the hotel forecourt were being moved on by the parking attendants rather brusquely even if they were just dropping or picking people up. The attendants are franchised to an outside company. If I have a friend picking me up (and remember I am a paying guest of the hotel) I do not one the attendant harassing my friend to move on. Remember we have visited from the UK to meet up with them. By the same token you can go to the H&H complex via the swimming pool level. There are security guards about who prevent shoppers from the complex to enter hotel premises. What I found strange that the security guard stopped me and another guest from walking the grounds just outside the hotel because he claimed it was the property of another restaurant. All we tried to do was take photographs of the view (there is a vantage point at another level but is crowded with tourists visiting the H&H complex) and we showed our key passes as proof that we were guests of the hotel. Its this type of pettiness that the hotel needs to look into and improve. Overall this is the best hotel you can stay at if you want to stay in Hollywood area. Its advantage is that it is part of the H&H complex. There is shopping nearby, food courts, bus stops, the metro station as well as lot of the other Hollywood attractions.

The hotel has 20 floors, with floors 19 and 20 being the Club levels. Room decor was modern, Charles and Ray Eames-influenced. Great movable desk with adjustable chair. One main reason I stayed in this area was because the Los Angeles Times recently called Hollywood the \"epicenter of the new hamburger explosion\", and I wanted to try the 3 places mentioned for the best gourmet burgers in town. All 3 places make a similar type of burger: brioche bun, arugula, 2 kinds of cheeses (usually a blue and a swiss), caramelized onions, garlic aioli, bacon. The meat may be Kobe. My personal rankings are: 1) Lucky Devils \"Lucky's Favorite\" 2) The Hungry Cat \"Pug\" burger 3) 25 Degrees (in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel) Burger #1. Horrible service at 25 Degrees. The Hollywood Roosevelt is across the street from H & H. This is a historic hotel that has been revamped into a hip, clubby Chateau Marmont wanna-be, complete with a pool area that becomes a nightclub with high security. The HBO series \"Entourage\" filmed here, and unless you are an \"Entourage\" type, you will probably be more comfortable at the Renaissance.", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Stay at a Cool Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Michelle2013", "ReviewID": "UR5630531", "Content": "We booked this hotel based on trip advisor ratings.

Well, it didn't start off so great. When we booked the room we asked if we could possibly get an early check in and were told that shouldn't be a problem, so we drove in from Huntington Beach and arrived at around 1:00 pm and were told that it would be at least 2 more hours before our room would be ready. That is regular check in time, well our room was not even ready then. It was over 100 outside but we walked around the mall near by had some lunch, etc.. finally we got our room. It was a studio suite at $315.00 per night. It was okay, the view was of the street in front of the hotel, not so great even though they told us we would have a great view. We were on the 3rd floor. I booked a limo with the concierge to take us to dinner at Spago for our 19th anniversary. He made the arrangements, gave me the price and I in turn gave him a nice tip! Well after our 3 hour limo trip to dinner, I was over charged $104.00 The next morning I talked with the staff who made the arrangements and he said he would take care of it. Today it is 9 days later, I have made over 8 phone calls to the staff and nothing has been done!!!! My credit card was charged $408.00.............when I called this am the staff answering the phone was completely rude! I was told the staff who made the arrangements would call back in 5 minutes, still haven't heard a word. At 4:30 am we were woken up by banging and sounds of moving furniture behind our wall in the bedroom area. It went on for a couple of hours. We could not figure out what the sounds were, but needless to say, we were awake very early that day. I called the front desk and ended up speaking to the night manager. He said he didn't know what it could be, but offered 2 breakfast vouchers- WOW, that was really nice LOL!!! We were suppose to stay another night, but opted to check-out. They couldn't even offer another room because it was sold out. Come to find out, behind our room was a conference room and they were setting up for an early morning meeting, too bad for us. There was one staff person Lisa who was so wonderful!!! She knew it was our anniversary, had champagne, strawberries, cheese, etc.. sent to our room with a card. And she really was a doll! She really tried to make everything right and her customer service skills were great! Everyone at that hotel should take lessons from her. I work in the Special Events industry and supervise staff that work directly with the public. I would never allow my staff to respond and react to customers as some of these people did.

Rooms nice and spacious, we could see the Hollywood sign from our window. Bathroom relatively small but smart and clean which is fine by me.

We went up to our rooms, the next thing I know Room Service are delivering my son milk & cookies and an ice pack for his bruised ankle !! - to my sunburnt brother they sent a pot of tea and some noodle soup to try and cheer him up - all complimentary with a note from the reception guy.

Quickly checked in around 11:30 PM and confirmed an earlier requested non-smoking king bed w/rollaway bed. We were given a room on the 16th floor, but it did not have the extra bed. When the bell desk brought up our luggage a few minutes later, I mentioned the rollaway bed and the polite young man said he would take care of that for us. I also mentioned that we had requested a refrigerator online. He said he would take care of that too. Within a few minutes both the extra bed and refrigerator were delivered to our room! The next morning the room darkening blinds and shades were lifted to reveal a perfect view of the famous Hollywood sign! I didn't want to pay a zillion bucks for a hotel breakfast, and we hadn't yet signed up for the \"Club Level access\" (more on that later) so we ate at \"Mel's Diner\" around the corner. Great food and very reasonable prices at Mel's! In fact, we ate there two more times for lunch and dinner during our stay. We poked around the immediate area and saw Grauman's Chinese Theatre with all the hand/footprints of the stars, saw the Hollywood walk of fame, went into a few souvenir shops, and explored the multi-level shopping complex attached to the hotel. We ate at Johnny Rockets for lunch (also decent food and reasonably priced for a touristy area). Back at the hotel I inquired at the front desk about the \"Club Level\" access. For $30 more per day, you can get a continental breakfast in the morning...hors douvres in the late afternoon/early evening...and desserts around 7:30pm. Only guests with \"Club Level\" privleges can access the 19th floor (via a card slot in the elevator) and the associated \"Club Level room. The hotel upgraded my room key and we went upstairs to check it out. It was too early for \"free eats\" but the \"Club Level\" room (also acessed via a card slot) has a larger TV, newspapers, magazines, sitting area, and a fridge full of various sodas and bottled water. I went back down to the front desk to sign up for a day of hi-speed internet access at $10 per 24 hours (noon to noon). You can sign up online or in room for internet access for your entire visit, but I only wanted one day's access. They also have some type of Intenet keyboard access via the TV for those without a laptop. After a jet-lag induced nap for me, we went back to the club level for the hors douvres. They had chicken skewers, coconut shrimp, fruits/veggies/dips/nuts and cheeses. Not bad! Later that evening they had assorted pastries for dessert. The room was darkened and lit with candles for effect. The next morning we had the club level breakfast which consisted of bagels/breads/english muffins, fruits, yogurt, assorted cereals, tea, coffee, danish. muffind, etc. They also had a hot dish which was normally some type of scrambled egg ( rotated each day to including western omelet, egg quesadilla, soggy omelet \"mcmuffins\") All in all, I felt the \"Club Level\" access was well worth the $30 daily room charge (especially for a family) considering the decent breakfast selection and other food and beverage choices. Afther breakfast we were kind of in a hurry to get to Universal Studios. We had booked the Universal Studios Hollywood VIP Experience and our reservation was for 10:45. For some reason, I couldn't open the safe in our room, so I called guest services and they sent security to our room within a minutes or two ( I told them we were running late)! The security guy was very pleasant and helpful! The LA Metro is right next door to the hotel and Universal Studios is only one stop away. Very convenient! When we got back from Universal Studios around 8:45pm, we went to the Club Level for dessert. Unfortunately, all the dessert was gone and there were just a few people there watching the end of American Idol on the TV in the room. One of the people watching happened to be one of the America Idol contestants. It was Chris Daughtry! He was very nice and posed for a pic with us! The next day we did the \"Movie Star's Home Tour\" with Starline Tours. I was less than impressed, but my wife seemed to like it. I can't compare the tour to other tour companies, but our tour guide, Brian was fun and informative. Don't pay full price, though. When we were solicited to take the tour, the price dropped by $5 per person while we \"thought\" about taking the tour.

I enjoyed my stay, but for the first time at this hotel, I had several disappointments. I was there for 5 nights for both business and leisure. I stayed in a one bedroom suite on the thirteenth floor facing \"southish\" so I had a view of the city instead of the Hollywood Hills this time. The view was okay (the roof of the Kodak Theatre was right in front of me, though) and I missed seeing the Hollywood sign from my room, so I asked immediately if I could move. Even though the hotel was quite empty (compared to my prior two visits) they could not accomodate my request. That isn't that big of a deal, but I don't think the staff really tried. Also, I requested a refrigerator in my room online two days before I arrived and it wasn't there upon my arrival (another reason I felt like asking for another room). It took me three calls to the front desk to get one in my room after that! I also had to make more than one request for extra soap and towels. Immediately upon my arrival I noticed a light bulb out in my bathroom. It was quickly replaced, but you think whoever prepped the room for arrival would have noticed it. Also there was gum stuck in the bedroom carpet, which was also quickly cleaned up after I reported it. Also, the housekeeping staff varies in capability at this hotel. I tipped the same everyday, so I know that wasn't it. But on my last day the housekeeper took off the extra blanket I had put on the bed and left the heavy comforter wadded up on the floor. That night I also noticed gray marks on the edges of my bed sheets. I was too tired to report it and wait for the bed to be remaid, so I just went to sleep. I don't think the sheets were dirty, but worn sheets like that should not be put on a bed in a hotel like the Renaissance Hollywood. The housekeeper had to have noticed the marks. I valet parked everyday, which is the most convienient thing to do here. However, I ended up being charged $24 dollars a day instead of the $22 quoted. Not a big deal, but I hate suprises. The valet staff and bell-hops are extremely friendly at this hotel, unlike some of the staff at front desk. Not that anybody at the front desk was rude, just less friendly. And the concierge staff is even less friendly than they are. I think if they just think you are a tourist, they treat you a little less nice. Also, the food at the hotel is average. Whoever raves about the room service at this place must work for the hotel. It is simply ok. If you want to eat closeby you will fare better in the Hollywood and Highland Courtyard. There are good restaurants there both expensive and moderately priced. And lots of fast food choices out there also. I will stay here again because the location is EXCELLENT.

If you can't do that, rent a car (warning: Parking stinks in LA). Do NOT depend on taxis, which I did and I don't think I ever paid under $45 a trip (not including tip).

Tripadvisor was the main reason for choosing this hotel and it did not disappoint. First of all, by the official rates it is not a cheap place to stay but you will probably be able to do what we did and get a really good deal. Marriott have a \"look no further\" price guarantee where they will beat any other room rate assuming you've already made the booking direct on the Marriott website. It is not too difficult to find a far better rate at one of the travel sites and this is what I did. You have to send a screenshot as proof but I ended up getting a 60% discount on the published rate which I was very happy with. However there was a mixup, when they applied our discount they also erased all the requests on the room type/beds/smoking etc. Luckily I spotted this a few days before departing and I must say that Marriott customer services were really excellent in getting the problem sorted out. Just be aware... So we arrived at the hotel and I'm glad that I read someone else's review because you definitely should just park at the front, check in, drop your bags off and then move the car. The car park is a little inconvenient from the hotel but we got used to it and it is absolutely HUGE with spaces always available. The 17th floor room was superb, just as expected. We were on the north side of the hotel which overlooks the hills and the Hollywood sign and it is quite a sight to wake up to. The decor and bedding were in excellent condition. We used the high speed internet access which worked great. Beds are REALLY comfortable and big which gave me a great night's sleep. Bathroom is just the same as you'd find in any hotel of this class, nothing more, nothing less. We went to breakfast in the hotel for 2 or 3 times just out of convenience. It is expensive but good. Service was not very attentive though. One morning the waiter admitted that he couldn't find our bill and kinda shrugged his shoulders! Of course when I checked the bill at the end of our stay, he had managed to find it after all. Funny that! In the adjoining mall there are several restaurants (Burgers, Italian, Pizza) which we went to in the evenings, these were fine for what they are. As you'd expect the area is touristy which isn't really my thing, at night outside the mall there isn't really that much to do so you'd probably want to drive to another part of town. So to sum up, a very slick and comfortable hotel.

Negative aspect: The parking situation is horrible. First, when you get into the garage you must find the elevators up. Upon reaching the third floor, you find you are in a shopping mall and must take your luggage through the mall to the side entrance of the hotel. You then must find and enter the elevator in the hotel(M level) and go down one floor to the lobby to register. You can then access your room via the same elevator you just left. Parking costs are as follows: $10 per day for no re-entry, $15 per day for unlimited re-entry, and $22 per day for valet (tips additional). I would recommend the valet service to save yourself A LOT of exercise (and don't forget something in your car or you will spend 15 minutes getting it). The pool, although we did not use it, was beautiful. Noise was not a problem except for the three gunshots we heard from a nearby nightclub shooting at 2:30 AM. Yes, the neighborhood is a bit risky. Tours: We made the mistake of taking the Starline tour of the Hollywood homes. First, the van seats 13 tourists plus driver. The windows are very low so you must slouch to see out. The person on the aisle seat sees next to nothing. Second, the stars want their privacy (understandable) so almost all homes are obscured by high gates and shrubs. This was a very long and back breaking 2 hours. My husband nicknamed it the front gate tour. Consider a limo tour before spending $35 pp on this one. Great breakfast spot: located on Highland Ave. between Hollywood Blvd and Hawthorn Ave is Mel's Diner. Reasonable and good and only a block walk from the hotel. Don't miss the Cold Stone in the mall for ice-cream. I also recommend the Warner Brothers VIP Studio Tour. The cost is $39 pp ($3 discount pp with AAA). Very interesting. We even had the pleasure of a conversation and pictures with Martin Sheen, a very gracious and entertaining man. Information Center: In the mall, next to the entrance to the Kodak Theater on the second floor is the information center. Great for maps and brochures. Pick up a map of the stars located on the Hollywood Walk-of-Fame for ease in finding your favorites if interested. This hotel is certainly one of the better ones in LA.

We ended up booking the Universal Studios 2-night package which basically consisted of everything we needed: accommodations, park tickets, hotel parking, and breakfast all for $469. My ONE AND ONLY complaint is that when we got the bill, the hotel had charged us DOUBLE so our bill was over $1000!! Talk about having a heart attack!

The best thing I would say about this hotel is it's excellent location. The hotel forms part of a huge complex called Hollywood & Highlands - there are shops, restaurants, bars etc all connected to the hotel. This is good as if you just want to wonder round in the evenings there it lots going on right here and it's quite safe!!! The hollywood walk of fame is right here, along with the Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theatre and along hollywood boulevard there is lots of street entertainment and various filming etc so there is lots to see. We had a hollwood hills view room - if it's a clear day you can see the hollywood sign from your room which is great! The room was nice - we have stayed in many luxurious hotels (such as Burj al Arab) - but we were not expecting this to be anything like that - but the room was just fine. We ate breakfast in Twist a few times at $18 per person for a breakfast buffet. It was nice but if you are looking for something cheaper go to Johnny Rockets (one of the restaurants on the complex) and you can get the ususal cooked breakfast for around $6 per person or just around the corner is Mel's Diner which does breakfast at around this price as well. For evening meals we just ate at different places around the complex, had room service a few times and just ate when we were out shopping of at Univsersal Studios. Most people say that you need a car to get around LA - however we pretty much used the buses/train the whole time we were there. You can purchase an all-day bus/metro pass for $3 per person - this is soooo good!!! We bought these nearly everyday to get around. There is a metro underground station and a bus stop (directly opposite the metro station) just around the corner from the hotel which was perfect. We used the buses and metro to get to Universal Studios (only 1 stop on the Metro - about a 4 minute journey!) - you then have to get a shuttle that takes you directly to the park itself. Next to Universal Studios is Citywalk - here there are loads of restaurants and clubs etc. It's a good idea to go to Universal Studios for the day and then go to Citywalk after to spend the evening. We also used the bus to get from hollywood to Santa Monica (Bus number 217 was our main bus - but you do have to change). It is a very good idea to get some good maps and you will start to get used to the names of the streets where the buses go. It is very easy to get around but there may be a fair amount of walking involved too! Santa Monica took about 1hr 30mins to get to - if you tried to get a cab there it would cost you a fortune - but we used our $3 bus/metro pass to get there. Of course if you are hiring a car - that would be easy too. From Santa Monica you can hire bikes at about $6 per hour and then cycle down to Venice Beach which is great - they have got Muscle Beach & basketball courts etc. We took in a lot of studio tours: Backlot tour at Universal Studios (doesn't cost anything), Sony Studios tours (paid for this in combination with a LA tour) - this was a really good tour and we bumped in Steven Speilberg on this tour!!! And we also did the Warner Brothers Studios tour. These are really good if you are into your movies and you never know who you may bump into!!! The highlight of our holiday however has to be the LA LAkERS game that we went to. The game was great and we also saw Justin Timberlake, Jack Nicholson and Matthew Perry!!! Other places to go is the Farmers Market - there is also a shopping complex behind it - this is a good place to go in the evening - has restaurants there and a cinema. The Cheesecake Factory is also located here - the food is great here and portions are massive - oh yes and the cheesecakes are fab too - they have all sorts of varieties!!! Again you can get here by bus (around 15 mins) Sunset Boulevard is another place to head too - especially at lunch times - this is when you are likely to bump into stars - we saw Holly Valance having lunch. Oh yes you have to eat in Clafoutis (I think that's how it's spelt) - this is on Sunset Boulevard and there are a couple of other little restaurants/cafes near it. I have to say the food was absolutely delicious - we ate here twice! We had things like lamp chops, garlic spagetti, spinach quiche, mushroom soup. You think it would be expensive - but we had meals for around \u00c2\u00a325-\u00c2\u00a330 in total with coffees and a desert between us! All in all it was a fantastic trip and we would definatley go back and we would probably stay at the Renaissance again, mainly due to its location and easy access to other areas.", "Date": "November 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cHooray for Hollywood ...

Luckily I followed my insitinct and left early, as it took me 50 minutes to get there. Thirdly there was no hot water in my shower, and 30 minutes later when it finally got luke warm i realised there was no fan in the bathroom and the door to the bathroom does not stay open! Its shuts automatically. So I was totally unimpressed witht the bathroom. Finally after attending the event at Staples Center, my guest and I were a bit hungry and decided to order room service, it was 11.56pm.

It's also right next door to the Chinese Theather, where we explored all the famous handprints. It's also right on Hollywood Boulevard with all of the stars along the sidewalk, which is pretty cool to see for the first time firsthand. Hollywood Boulevard, besides these attractions, is kind of sketchy at night, so we mostly just stayed in in the outdoor shopping area, which was just fine!

Regarding parking - if you choose to self park, it's easy to do but BE SURE to FIRST CHECK IN so that they can give you the pass to park in their section of the garage!!! We made the mistake of trying to self-park first before checking in and were thoroughly confused as to why we couldn't get into the Renaissance gated-off parking section until we decided to check in and that's when they gave us the parking pass.

Located in the Hollywood & Highland complex, it was well kept and felt extremely safe, with the open air mall, funky bowling facility, and plenty of restaurants to occupy your time in the evening when the world outside the complex gets a bit sketchy. Valet service was lightening fast and pretty reasonable at $22, which was surprisingly cheap considering what we've paid in other metropolitan tourist areas. Front desk check in was quick and pleasant. The room itself was a typical king hotel room setup with bath, bed, tv/armoire, and desk. We had a view of the city which was very nice both at night and during the day. The decor is sort of retro, reminiscent of 50s contemporary styling. The bathroom was roomy with plenty of towels and bath products available. Everything was very clean and in good shape with the exception of the bedspread and pillow shams, which seemed a bit worn (not a big deal as we just throw it all off the bed when we sleep anyway). All the public areas are clean and have wonderful artwork on display. We had the breakfast buffet at Twist, the onsite restaurant and found it to have a good selection of quality hot & cold items, including cooked to order eggs and waffles. The service was top notch and we thought it was a pretty good value for $16 or so, even though we didn't eat a lot.

The room itself was clean and decorated in a style that is intended to be modern and hip. To me, however, it came across as austere and cold (although the room does include a fish in a small bowl so as to ensure that you have a friend away from home). The room and bathroom also seemed a tad smaller than typical, although they were certainly big enough, and the all-important bed was comfortable.

The small room did not bother us, because we were on the go from morning til night taking in the sights. Keep your eyes open for stars staying in the hotel. We saw Jack Black and Will Farrell.

The Renaissance is a new-build property, visible from several miles away, just up from the junction of Hollywood and Highland. It is actually part of the Hollywood & Highland complex, which is a 4-floor collection of small stores and restaurants. This is where the only negative comment I have about the location comes in - the parking. Parking your vehicle involves using the cavernous car park serving the shopping complex. You have to drive underground 3-4 levels and park up then make your way to the elevators or the escalators and make your way up again (with your luggage, of course) to the third level of the complex, then cross through the stores and enter the hotel (still at the third level) then take a hotel elevator down to the lobby, check-in, then back up in the elevator to your room...quite a trek! Seriously consider the valet, as I do now. Once you have recovered from the parking ordeal, you will quickly concede that the hotel is amazing. The views are spectacular. Either you get the Hollywood sign or the City of Los Angeles, either view is a winner. As several other people have commented here, the windows in the rooms are floor to ceiling and several nights I went to sleep with the curtains open so I could see the city spread out below. Beautiful. Bathrooms are large and have all the amenities you would expect. There is always plenty of closet space and the beds are wonderfully comfortable. Be careful of the mini-bar though - removing an item to even look at it seems to automatically charge it to your room! The pool area at this hotel is underrated also, a good sized swimming area, plenty sun loungers and several cabanas for those really hot days. The restaurant in the hotel I have not tried in the evening however the buffet breakfast is more than adequate - plenty choice of meats/ eggs served to order, cereals, pastries and fruit and currently $16 which is not so bad for the quality of the food and surroundings. As for surroundings, the immediate vicinity can be rather seedy at night although not unsafe. And the location is terrific - you could walk uphill to the Hollywood Bowl, the Hollywood Walk of Fame runs along the front of the shopping complex, the Kodak Theatre is actually part of the complex itself, Mann's Chinese Theatre is next door to the Kodak and the Hollywood Sign looks down on the hotel from the rear. Any negative points to this property? Just the parking - if you have trouble walking, it may be an issue. However bear in mind the hotel offers a rate of $15 a day with in-and-out privileges, whereas the carpark itself only offers $10 rate per entry with no in-and-out so book with the hotel, it should work out better for you.

However, I am also the one who invested in reading Trip Advisor reviews and actually going to the Chamberlain Suites (formerly Summerfield and being remolded at the time) and the Hyatt (the Riot aka Led Zeppelin) Hotel on Sunset, but finally choosing the Renaissance over all of them, including the Best Western across from the Hyatt and the Roosevelt across the Chinese Theatre. The bottom line is that the Renaissance is all about service and location, location, location. For starters, we had a 12th floor suite connected to a regular double standard looking out to the streets of Hollywood. Fortunately, we upgraded to use the \"Club Lounge\" on the 19th floor and that's where magic unfolded. Yes, we had the Hollywood sign to look at on the 19th floor, but also a cool lounge with a great plasma tv and music system not to mention this place serves breakfast and afternoon-evening dishes. But, this is also a place to meet people and where two young girls from Ohio told us about the Sandra Bullock premier that Wednesday night for Miss Congeniality at the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre next door. We also found out that Sandra was returning the next day for her Walk of Fame Star on Hollywood Blvd right in front of the Kodak Center. We got pictures, autographs, and even spoke directly with Miss Congeniality, who, by the way, is not only nice, but also quite stunningly beautiful in person ... but Jesse James kept his back to us. George Lopez was great, too, so were all the co-stars, including Captain Kirk, William Shatner. The pool on the 5th floor was awesome for the kids, too. It's long, but not too deep, and very spread out with a huge patio area with about 4-5 cabana's and a bar area. It also had an incredible view. The work-out room was just inside on the 5th floor, too, and had 180 degree views as well. Kids, and parents, will love this hotel, the Kodak Center, and all the dressed up characters that patrol Hollywood Blvd near the center. This is not the Hollywood I went to in the early 80's to go clubbing. There are still plenty of clubs nearby, but also a great enclave for family fun and Hollywood history. The shopping is superb and first class and the ining in the center and hotel are fine, too. The \"Grill\" on the 4th floor of the Kodak Center is cool, too, and where the Warner Bros and entourage dined after Sandra's Star ceremony. I have to say that we were able to be flexible, but so was the hotel staff especially the manager on duty that Wednesday afternoon. We arrived early, like 2pm, but the hotel said we have a suite available at no extra charge if you don't mind smoking. Needless to say, we did, but we liked having the suite more with connecting rooms. These folks at the front desk, housekeeping and lobby area, including bell and valet, were awesome and friendly. We got calls from the front desk asking if we received our extra tooth brush and rollaway. If you have a family, it's probably the best value for the buck and the best value for entertainment within a walking distance. Check with the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, too, for upcoming events like a premier and Walk of Fame Star.

It is nothing special. I had hoped for a separate water closet or even a separate bath/shower. Also, it is odd that the bathroom has no active fan so the mirror instantly fogs. The one vent in the shower doesn't do enough to exhaust the steam. It is important to note that the hotel and Hollywood & Highland in general are NOT in the best area. I've lived in Downtown and urban areas most of my life. The run-down buildings that surround the complex didn't bother me. However, I walked about seven blocks to the Pantages Theatre and saw my share of homeless, hookers, and many boarded up storefronts. Not everyone will fell comfortable walking off the complex.

This hotel is superb. We had a speedy check-in and were helped by a team of really keen and enthusiastic staff. We were greeted by a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room which had a view of the Hollywood sign, Geffin Park Observatory and the Capitol Records tower - such a lovely treat after a 10 hour flight from London Heathrow!! What can I say about the hotel that hasn't already been said in all the other reviews?... it's clean, spacious, virtually brand new, the rooms and the hotel in general are really well equipped and the staff are always \"delighted\" to help in any way they can. Can it get any better?... well to top it off you're right smack in the centre of everything with the Kodak Theatre, Manns Chinese Theatre, The Walk Of Fame, the excellent Hollywood and Highland Shopping mall (with some great eateries!!!) right on your doorstep - literally (just to mention a few of the many attractions that are within walking distance!!). The Metro underground rail station is pretty much on your doorstep too and you're only one stop from Universal Studios!! We packed loads of stuff into our honeymoon and we found the Renaissance to be the perfect base to allow us to see all the attractions and landmarks that we wanted - all within either walking distance or a reasonably cheap taxi fair ($5 - $25) away. We found the hotel and the Hollywood and Highland complex to have a really pleasant atmosphere to come back and relax in after a day of sightseeing. We felt like the Renaissance was our \"home\" for the fortnight and we were really sad to be leaving it behind after such a fantastic stay - definitely the trip of a lifetime and a honeymoon to remember!

The staff were helpful and friendly (apart from the lady in the shop, she tried to short-change me in the shop, and she wouldn't listen to me. Took my mum to persuade her otherwise!), especially in the restaurant. Lovely food there, but a bit pricey and the menu isn't exactly varied. Although, there are lovely places in the Hollywood and Highland complex, which you can get into through a short walkway in the hotel. Some evenings there are VERY LOUD bands playing different music, and there is a very relaxed and safe atmosphere there at night unlike Hollyowwd 3 years ago when we never ventured out of the hotel after 8pm! The metro is about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel, and it's extremely cheap to get a train to Universal Studios, then it's just a short walk to a shuttle stop to get to the park. If you do decide to visit Universal, it may be worthwhile buying a queue-jumping ticket which allows you to get in the front of the line of every ride and show, and gives you reserved seats at all shows, although it may be worthwhile getting to shows a little while before it says to get there on the ticket, especially if it's a busy day. Although it's $50 more than a standard ticket, it's definately worth the money!!! Chinese Mann's Theatre is a short walk away, as is the Walk of Fame and the Kodak theatre. If you wish to visit the latter, visit the leaflet stand at the hotel, as there is a discount voucher there. When we went, it was a quite day so we got to sit in the chairs that celebrities sat in, and we also got to stand on the stage!

The rooms were huge and I had a great view of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign from the 19th floor. I nearly drowned in bath towels - so many were supplied in my bath room. My only complaint I couldnt store anything in the hotel fridge, if you took anything out of the mini bar you were charged. I like to have real milk in my coffee not the powdered stuff. So that was a bit of a pain. If you are into American Idol this is the place to be. The 12 days I was staying coincided with the American Idol finals and whilst I am not a fan of the show (wrong age bracket) if you are a fan you would have seen many of the Idol contestants and the judges coming in and out of the hotel. In fact if you are into doing the whole \"Hollywood\" thing celebrity spotting etc this is the hotel for you.

Wolfgang Puck owns it and rents it out for parties. While I was there the noise was so loud into the wee hours of the morning due to a HOOTERS convention. I was assured that this is not a regulat occurance and adfter a call to the front desk, it quieted down.

I booked online through swa vactions so basically, it was about $200.00 cheaper than booking the flight/hotel separately. When we got there, I asked about upgrading to the executive suite since it has an \"oversized\" bathroom. They upgraded me for free (even after I said I would pay the difference). Our room was on the Hollywood Hills side (where you can see the Hollywood sign from your room). The reception group (bellmen, concierge, the entire staff) could not have been nicer. We are not rich by any means, and I'm sure the staff at the hotel could tell that, but they never looked down upon us. Some people have said some things about the service, but I can't complain at all. We tipped housekeeping $4.00 a night (I don't know how much you're supposed to tip - I usually just do $2.00, but since we had a bigger room...) Even then, I don't know if that's high, low, good enough??? We planned on going to Universal Studios, seeing Ryan Seacrest On-Air, and hoping to catch a glimpse of stars (The Whole Ten Yards premiere was at the Graumann's Chinese Theatre while we were there). If you go to see Ryan, get there by 7:30. We went 2 days and barely got in the first day (7:30 arrival in line). The next day, I got in line at 7:00 and was 6th in line (sat front row-make a creative sign and they'll sit you up front). Ok, back to the hotel. The bathroom in the executive suite is oversized, but basically, they just added a table along the opposite wall from the sink. The problem is this: I was hoping for 2 sinks - there was plenty of room for 2. Plus, I was hoping for a separate shower. Once again, there was plenty of room for this. This suite was definitely bigger than a regular room, but no big deal. In order to watch TV, you basically had to move the couch to be in front of it; otherwise, you had to watch it from an angle (from the bed or the couch). They had a chair that faced the TV, but if more than 1 person wants to watch TV, then this layout is useless. Still though, it was great, and in the end, the 2 sink thing and separate shower thing didn't bother me. This hotel is in an absolutely perfect location. We did not rent a car since we didn't need to go sightseeing outside of the area. Some people say you should rent a car, others say no need. If you don't mind spending $20.00 a day to park your car at the hotel plus the rental fees for the car, plus paying for parking many other places you go, then go ahead and rent a car. We ended up spending $100.00 total for a cab. The subway ($1.25 per person per trip or $3.50 per person all day) is 1 stop (5 minutes) away from Universal Studios - and it's not \"scary\" to ride. All in all, the money spent on this hotel was well worth it. We planned this trip perfectly. The Whole Ten Yards premiere was on 4/7/04 at the Graumann's Chinese Theatre (right by the hotel). We saw Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, and many others. Matthew Perry even gave us his autograph. We also saw John Travolta and Uma Thurman shooting on the set of Be Cool (they were shooting in front of the Graumann's Theatre). Like I said before - PERFECT LOCATION.Pros: Many things are very very close by: The walk of fame Graumann's Chinese Theatre (where premieres are held) Kodak Theatre Numerous shops and restaurants (best eatery is Fresh Fire Kabobs - don't miss it!!!! Johnny Rocket's wasn't all that good. Metro Railway (subway) - goes to downtown LA, Universal, many other places - even within free shuttle distance of LAX (we used it for Universal only) Ryan Seacrest On-Air Cons: 1. Twist Restaurant at breakfast. We ate there on our last day - $16.00 each for the buffet (including drinks). Unfortunately, our waiter never came back to refill my OJ - he actually didn't show up again until he brought the check. He didn't care that we were there. We should have gone across the street to get donuts. 2. $40-$50 for the cab ride to/from the airport (LAX). This is true, of course, for anything since LA is 30 miles away from LAX. Burbank Airport is closer, so you might want to look into that airport.All in all, I give this 5 stars - You can't beat it. It is absolutely the best hotel I've stayed in (of course, it costs more than any other hotel I've been in). We don't stay in $60 hotels any more - they suck. I find hotels that cost $90 or more. This one is $200 a night. Well worth it. When I go back to Hollywood, I have no doubt where I'll stay.
