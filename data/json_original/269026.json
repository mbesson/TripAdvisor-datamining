It is safe and clean. The rooms are very basic --- no luxury here-- but are very cheap. Don't get breakfast in the restaurant!

The rooms are extremely basic - and small - but still, quite clean. The wifi is very weak and I suggest you to go to a caf\u00e9 rather than take breakfast there. I especially had two misfortunes that lead me to meet a few people of the management, whom, shouldn't forget that they work in hospitality! First of all, I brought a friend in order to watch a movie on my computer. This lead to a scandal as the front desk clerk accused me of basically going to sleep with this girl, which was \"impossible as I had a single room\". They treated my friend as a prostitute, which was extremely rude. Again, it was just a friend, for a simple DVD night. My second bad experience is that something has disappeared from my room and I believe that the maid took it. I mentioned this to the management and had a very intense talk with a manager, who was extremely rude and, instead of just saying sorry or trying to find a solution, accused me of being a liar etc... Nonetheless, if I try to stay honest, the hotel is good if you're not looking for luxury and if you're seeking a good location and good value for money... but do know that you'll be judged!

Negative The hotel is basic and some of the rooms we saw were very small and pokey. The inner rooms seem smaller than the outer rooms. It is above local bar/clubs but the noise stopped around 2am (not particularly loud) The towels are very hard and I had to remove an outer balnket as it scratched my skin through the sheet but I have sensitive skin, hubby had no problem with it. We had breakfast one morning 4Euros for toast, coffee, cake and Orange Juice which we thought was areasnable. Lady who served was not on happy pills and we felt that we were a pain for being there. We found a cafe on the main shopping street 5 min walk from the hotel and a large slice of toast and coffee 2.45Euros so worth a walk to. Walking back to hotel late can be daunting as its near the main prostitute (outside Macdonalds) area and you are in a loacl bar area so we did feel very 'touristy'. Good points Local, cheap and you get what you pay for. Get the metro ticket 10 Euros and head from the airport. We paid 35 Euros in a taxi which we thought was extortionate.

The staff are helpful and the lobby has a computer that you can use to do a quick check of your e-mails. The only thing I didn't like is its location because it is situated near the gay/lesbian clubs and was pretty noisy during the nights when they're partying and gay/lesbians couples kissing on the streets might introduce bad influence towards the younger children. The plus side, is that the security is very well done there with 24 hr security men staying in the lobby and cameras in the elevators and corridors. Also the price is also very cheap for this convenient location in the centre of Madrid.

The twin rooms we booked were adequate without being stunning, but they were very clean and gave the impression of being very secure. As we were only there for 2 nights, it's really difficult to draw any bad conclusions from the hostal. As has been said before, the fact that you're just off a main thoroughfare makes it a bit noisy in the evening (a Madrid evening starts about 11pm and finishes about 6am the next morning).

We left, and went thru the lobby together (they have the elevator rigged so that you must always stop on the lobby level, and they can see in the elevator), where they require you to leave your key... I was soon to find out why. The lady who checked me in gave me and my friend a strange look. When we returned 2 hrs later, she began to immediately tell her co-worker something, and then they refused to allow my friend to come up to my room with me with out us paying an additional 40 euro ($64). Obviously I was shocked, and asked why. They said the room was reserved for one person. I tried to explain to them that my friend lived here, and offer his ID, but they refused any visit and said I either pay or stay in the lobby. So, we left and went to a bar. I couldn't believe how cheap this place is... what hotel doesn't let your friends in your room for a bit? How many times have you traveled and just met people and invited them over? Or had someone come hangout for a bit in the room before going somewhere else? Later, I was using the cpu in the lobby, and noticed several other couples enter together, and no questions at all were asked. It then became obvious to me that the management was under the impression that I was just using the room for an hr by hr type of thing... Very rude... I would never stay here again.

Think well before you book.\u201d", "Author": "Debora M", "ReviewID": "UR7570279", "Content": "Our experience in this hostal (not a hotel !) proves that the best location should not be always the main reference when we plan where to stay. The cleanness is probably the best label that Hostal San Lorenzo has to offer. Unfortunately, in the whole appreciation this good remark is ruined by a \u201cbouquet\u201d of bad, even intolerable behaviour, showing us that the hotel industry is not for everyone. Adding to this we have to list the location. The team management and the staff of this place have a lot to learn in order to understand that hotel business is incompatible with some, let\u2019s say, \u201cgreedy\u201d actions. I\u2019d like to encourage both (the staff and the managers) to read, for instance, what J. Marriott teaches in his Spirit to serve: the Marriot\u2019s way. It would be useful, once it seems that they don\u2019t know the real meaning of these services. Let\u2019s go to the facts: 1) We\u2019ve booked a double superior for 6 nights. They assigned us room 211. This room was only a normal double (1st trap), but we were so exhausted that we\u2019ve decided to postpone the matter for the next day. The following morning, after complaining in the front desk, they reassigned room 109. In fact it was a double superior; but far away from the example showed in the website! (2nd trap) 2) The price for a double superior room is \u20ac 89,00, if paid in money. But if paid with credit card you have to add 7% (3rd trap, once they should clearly mention the real price in its website, with or without taxes). 3) Other considerations: a) Each use of the safety deposit is charged with \u20ac 1, 00! We\u2019ve been in hotels in Europe and outside, and this was the first time we faced this creative talent to make money. (When we moved from 211 to 109, of course, we lost our euro). b) About the staff: - They tried to argue that the 211 is a double superior! They had the impertinence to try to convince us that the square meters from each room are different from one to another. No doubt! But Room 211 definitely is a normal double, not a superior. It\u2019s very small for 2 people and there is not space for the luggage. You have to open it over the beds. - The majority of the staff is not very friendly. But this is, more and more, normal in Madrid (restaurants, bars, hotels, museums, shops). We prefer to say that they need professional training in order to receive the customers with sympathy and cheeriness, essential attributes to this profession. - Last but not least: the place is very noisy, and unless you sleep like a stone, you\u2019ll wake several times in the night:. Causes? The street noise until late and the disco sound until 5, 30 in the morning. Wherever you sleep in this establishment, it\u2019s hard to avoid it.
