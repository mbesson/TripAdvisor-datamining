For those of you who hope to attend the Christmas Eve service at St. Peter's or the next day's Pope blessing, a close hotel location is essential since it is next to impossible to find transportation once the service is out at midnight. Hotel Prati is literally 5 blocks from the Vatican. So, we booked our room (triple) and it was perfect at a very reasonable cost. The room was very clean, small but efficient, the beds were comfortable (sheets/duvet), TV included BBC news channel (only English channel), and the bathroom equipped with all essentials. Free WIFI and breakfast was included in the room rate. The staff were so kind to make calls on our behalf while we were at the hotel trying to locate our missing luggage with the responsible airlines. They called taxis on Christmas Day for us and even offered to hold our luggage in their lobby closets for free after check-out. They were exceptionally friendly which was appreciated. So, in summary, plan your next Christmas vacation in Rome and plan to stay at this hotel. Request your Papal Service tickets in advance (they are free and do not expect to find any tickets on Christmas Eve) and enjoy the inspiring Christmas Eve service and then you can easily walk to your hotel to have a good night's sleep to hear the Pope's speech/blessing the next morning.

I was not interested in frills, or a lot of services, just in having a good place to stay. At check-in I found the front desk staff to be friendly, and they were kind when faced with my limited Italian skills. Check-in was quick and efficient, and I was given a very good map of Rome with directions to Vatican City and a couple other points of interest outlined for me at my request. The maid service was well-done, my room was very clean when I checked in, and the breakfast was laid out and accessible. It wasn't a continental breakfast with a large spread, but that wasn't what I was exepecting to begin with, and it was nice to sit and drink a cup of coffee and eat a pastry whle I looked at my day's plan. The hotel has a very European feel to it, in that great work has been done to maximize the efficiency of the existing floorplan, and I liked the layout. My room was very small, and had just the basics, but was nice. I didn't need anything other than a bed and facilities, and the room was actually well done for a solo traveler. The shower was a bit on the small side, but was a shower wand, so it worked well. The towels were different, in that they were of an absorbent material other than the traditional terrycloth. I'm not sure what they were made of, but they worked for me just fine, they were just different. I'm mostly bald, so I can't speak to the condition of the hairdryer, but it appeared to be newer. The bathroom's tile job was nicely done, and it was neat and clean. The bed was firm and comfortable, and I was able to rest well. There was the sound of traffic outside, but it didn't get in the way of sleep, and I actually enjoyed hearing the city. The closet and drawers were surprisingly spacious. The room itself is under an electricity control where you place a card on your keyring into a reader, and the electrical service is available; if the key is taken out after a minute or so the power goes out. That was a good way to ensure energy efficiency, and it took a little getting used to. The electrical control box is mounted on the wall, and it did put out a buzzing sound. The location of the hotel is excellent - 5 minutes' walk and I was standing in St. Peter's Square, 10 minutes' walk and I was at Castell San Angelo (you really need to see it - I didn't see a lot on it in the guidebooks, but the grounds are beautiful, you can walk around it in a park area, and it is a great looking building), 5 minutes away were a few good restaurants, three minutes away and you were in a great shopping district. It takes about 8-10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the Metro station, and the bus stop is basically across the street about a block up, so getting around from there wasn't a bad experience at all. If you prefer, there is also a trolley station about 4-5 minutes away. The neighborhood around the hotel is largely residential, and there wasn't a lot of foot traffic right there, so walking down the sidewalk was easily done, and it was a nice route to take of an early evening. I noticed a lack of the graffiti that is plaguing Rome these days, and that speaks well of the neighborhood as far as preserving their streets and keeping them nice. The bottom line is that this hotel is a great place to stay for 50-100 Euros less than other hotels. If you must insist on the creature comforts, and you feel uncomfortable with not having a large room, this is not a good fit for you. If you are looking for a nice, safe place to stay that is near what you want, buon giorno! I do not recommend this hotel for a larger family, simply because there are no rooms large enough for them. If they wanted to split to different rooms, though, it would be fine.

Towels were linen rather than terry, though staff provided terry upon request. Both did the job. For the record, I encountered the same linens in Venice in a more expensive hotel, so this is clearly not something unique to this hotel. Restaurant was under construction, but discount was given, and information was provided upon arrival (rather than as a surprise upon check-out). Breakfasts of cappacino and croissents and other pastries were available at a number of cafes less than 1/2 block away. Hotel location was fabulous - walking distance to the Vatican, from the train station, etc. The staff were the friendliest, most helpful people that I came across in all of Rome, Florence, and Venice combined. They provided accurate directions to various destinations, and numerous ways to save money and hassles. Their customer service was very much appreciated. Looking at some criticisms, I must conclude that many people are frustrated if they travel outside of their country and find things done differently than at home. One must wonder what such individuals are doing travelling at all!

I was traveling alone visiting my son his last week at college (study abroad program). When I say small I mean small. But, it was perfect. No need for room when you are by yourself. I stayed there for 4 days in the single room. Then when my son was finished with his semester he moved in with me and we upgraded into a two bed room. It was fine for our needs. We had a slight medical emergency and the hotel staff was more than helpful helping us get in touch with a doctor at midnight. The location is fine for walking to any of your standard tourist spots in Rome. Also, there is a bus stop not far from the hotel which is helpful when you get the hang of the bus system. The Metro is not far away either.

It is NOT the most comfortable hotel if you plan to spend a lot of time in a large, comfortable room - but then, there is so much to see and do in Rome, that we only used the hotel to sleep in between our many outings. The location is fantastic - one can walk to most of Rome's major attractions - and if you want to go a bit futher away, the Metro (subway) is located within a less than 10min leisurely walk from the hotel. Shortfalls: the rooms are very, very small as well as the bathrooms - but, all is clean and well maintained. There is a new elevator (lift) installed which makes moving the luggage quite comfortable. The \"towels\" used in the bathrooms are \"Italian style\" which to some travellers made feel odd. They are very absorbant thin sheets of cotton similar to a bedsheet - so don't expect the usual thick, soft, plushy hoteltowels. IF you book a double room - do not expect ONE bed (such as American King size or Queen size) - but simply two twin beds pushed together. The location as great as it is - maybe a bit noisy at times (major intersection) - but during late-night (sleeping time) it's very quiet and fine. The staff is very helpful - especially Franco who helped us much! They speak reasonably good English which also helps a lot when having questions about trips and attractions etc. Highly recommend you see the Sistine Chappell and the Vatican Museum - and of course St. Peters Cathedral - all just minutes walking distance from this hotel. Major other attractions such as the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and the Panthenon are within about 20-30min leisurely walk from the hotel. The Collosseum and Forum Romanum/Circus Maximus is about a 20min ride on the subway.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stavanger, Norway", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "mermaid086", "ReviewID": "UR10513362", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Prati in Aug. 2007.
