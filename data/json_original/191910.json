The hotel stuff was very attentive and caring, I felt very secure and comfortable. Secondly the hotel has an absolutely perfect location. I was travelling from Heathrow. It took only 15-20 min to get it by tube and approximately 15-20 min to get central London. When I was flying back to home, I had a very early flight, the taxi cost me just 14 pounds which is nothing for London prices! Besides, the location was especially good for me because my daughter lives in that area, and it was so easy for me and for her to visit and see each other that made me absolutely happy! And finally, the prices were very affordable, it was a very good value for money, my stay in Boston Manor significantly saved my finances.

The staff were courteous and very very friendly (if not a bit shy) and very helpful as well, the hairdryer wasnt included but they dug one out especially for us and gave us directions everywhere (H) The Bad well there wasn't much wrong with it i mean it was a budget holiday, under the beds could be a bit tidier and maybe looked at once in a while :P and my boyfriend expected a bath ( i dont know why) but he was disappointed about that. Overall we loved it we wanted something cheap and thats what we got we only stayed for one night but i would of stayed longer, you think about what you pay for so its not going to be amazing but it was still good value on that account.

Many chain hotels in London now refuse to store luggage due to security reasons. We were also given complimentary Internet for our room.

The best (and nearly only) choice seemed this hotel I picked it mainly because it was the most convenient for the price, close (ish) to the piccadily line & close to a night bus route from central London. In these terms it did everything it needed too- but I have stayed at far more convenient (and better) hotels for less. The public areas of the hotel were dated, tired and in places not overly clean. I too laughed like the previous reviewers at the 'Luxury suite' signs! I cannot imagine what definition of Luxury they have used! The room itself was similar- the delightful net curtains were a lovely shade of yellow & the windows were dirty. I would also bet that this room has recently been smoked in (is this not banned now?). The sheets were worn but were clean & the bed was on the hard side but one of the better hotel beds to sleep in. The bathroom at first appeared clean, but whilst sat on the toilet (sorry!) I noticed nasty looking stains on the door frame (erghh!). The busy road mentioned before didnt affect me (except the drunks at 3.00 am) and I had a decent nights sleep. Breakfast was OK actually- OJ was OK, cooked brekkie not too cheap & nasty- apparently branded cereals. The staff didn't speak much English, and there was a highly embarassing incident on an adjoining table (the customer wanted wholemeal toast- this was incorrect 3 times, ignored twice & then finally it was deduced that they didn't have any!) Didn't make breakfast second day unfortunately but nothing at all to complain about on my part....... Hotel itself is about 10 mins walk to tube one way (with a (shock) decent Harvester on the way if you are hungry. The other way some pubs (polish or Irish- take your pick!) & places to eat. There is also an Indian Restaurant in the hotel itself, but didn't try this out... In the context of London hotels I feel that a 2 rating would be mean for this hotel- I reluctantly give it a 3 because I have stayed at a number of London Hotels in this price range & really it is not bad in comparison.

On arrival, there was no parking, so I had to park on the road - and this is not a good neighbourhood. I planned to walk to the tube station the next morning, but it is a LONG way, through a less desirable area. Reception was lovely, but as I climbed the stairs, I realised it was like a terrible B&B. The lock to the door of my room was precarious, and as a lone feamle traveller, I was not impressed! There was a disco in my bathroom, with the light flickering and water running. The room was so cold, because the windows didn't fit the frame, and every bit of road noise could be heard - there'd have been no difference if I'd opened the windows! The carpet was so dirty, I didn't dare take my shoes off, but on the plus, the bed did seem clean. However, the lock of th door was the final straw, so I rang around and found a Travelodge for a very similar price close by, and left.

We had two rooms booked for us and two kids: they upgraded us to a room big enough for all 4 (one full and two twin beds) but refused to let us exchange our reserved two cheaper rooms for that one more expensive one (which would have saved us some dough) even tho we ended up not using the kids' room (they wanted to stay in ours because theirs was far away through a lybranthine arrangement of poky corridors and staircases). The room we did use was cramped with all those beds and the bathroom barely big enough to turn around in. The whole experience was pretty creepy and unpleasant.
