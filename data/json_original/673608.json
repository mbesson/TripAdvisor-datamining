The bed sheet is yellowish,the bathroom is not so clean. the most terrible things is the door lock, they only provide a small lock outside before u enter the room. the door type is really balinese style in side where only a skiny wood to cross over. May be we are staying in a standard room, the window is without a curtain (no privacy) but a old  unfunction blind, still able to see through from outside. No bug or ant in our room, but luckily I bring a mosquito repellent cream, cause mosquito is everywhere.Although it is in a strategy place, but the hotel is too deep and quite dangerous  dark to walk out to the main road. We are getting harder to walk in the tiny road when there are both side of vihicles come forward (including the horse ride), so afraid to kick by the horse when they come near, haha.Anyway, the staff there are friendly. Although the breakfast is not much to choose, the scrumble eggs is yummy. I think the portion is enough for an asian.over all, it is budget to stay. but if u plan for a short stay, u rather pay a bit more for a comfortable staysoon, malaysia", "Date": "Sep 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR104313019", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "soonMalaysia"}, {"Content": "Awful place!

Hotel guests are very social, so great for anyone travelling alone or otherwise. The rooms do lack maintenance and need updating. The fish ponds at reception need a new pump..can't see the fish generously donated by a guest! The new operations manager is not as good at socialising with hotel guests as the previous manager. Hotel has lost a bit of spark. They did fix my airconditioning immediately when told first morning it wasn't working.Would have been nice if it was working upon arrival. No sleep that night...too hot.The pool is great, massage girls lovely.Reception staff are friendly. The barman at the pool bar are just fantasic, and it is a great place to just hang out. Can't commend them enough.Would stay there again because of the atmoshphere and location.", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR370751802", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Tracey98"}, {"Content": "Nice Baliness style hotel Stay at the Champlung Mas hotel For 14 DAYS.
