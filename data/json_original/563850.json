We stayed a full week around Capo D'Anno and could not have been happier. Location was ideal! Best part of ROME! Room was clean and cozy - and provided all necessary ammenities. Prima collazione (breakfast) was perfect- small, Italian style - just like we like it, and the nice lady making our cappuccino's in the morning was lovely. We had a great room - it slept 3 - and we were never cramped. Our luggage fit right below our window sill and we slept soundly through every night as the street was quiet!

I'm 6ft1 and only just managed to be able to squeeze into the shower cubicle let alone move once i was in there!

Stayed at Domus Tiberina for 3 nights and I would have to say that calling it an Hotel is a big overstatement. While the location is excellent as its within walking distance from the Colosseum and other attractions the quality leaves much to be desired. 1) Although I had a double room reservation when I arrived they tried to send me to a different hotel called \"Hotel Trastevere House\" even when we explained that we wanted to stay there was we had friend already at Domus. When we got to this other \"hotel\" they gave us a single room without any windows and on the \"basement\". We refused to stay and only after we demanded our documents back and threaten to leave they took us back and gave us a room... They were lying when they said they did not had rooms and were trying to capitalize by sending guest to this even worse hotel that is owned by the same people. 2) The room we stayed was right next door to the reception. There was no sound isolation. To give you and idea I could hear the receptionist at night reading the newspaper... Every time someone entered the hotel we could hear them speaking. Only managed to get some sleep because I was so tired of walking all day long. The curtains were smaller than the windows so I would always get a \"sunshine wake up call\". 3) TV was not working. I had to reconnect everything and when I finally managed to get it working it was sad to find that there were no international channels. There was a lot of telesales though :p 4) The day we left we had to leave at 07:00 so when we asked for an early breakfast they told us we could only have it at 08:00... On any other place they would provide something in the room or at least some juice and coffee. Unfortunately the night clerk was lazy and did not help. In sum what was best at this \"hostel\" was its location as it was close to Trastevere. There you have the best night live and restaurants. For the price they charge you would be better at a real Hotel.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "finland", "Title": "\u201c\"very familiar atmosphere\"\u201d", "Author": "fingirl67", "ReviewID": "UR46100614", "Content": "I went alone to a hotel at my first time.

The location is absolutely amazing. You can walk to all the important sightseeing locations or jump on public transportation 3-5 min from the hotel. The quadruple room with private bath is small, but clean. We got a room with an outside view. All the attendants are amazing! They help out in every form! Breakfast is brought to your room at the time you request... and it is AMAZING (especially the cappuccino)! You won't need to eat until dinner after you eat breakfast. Shower is a little small, but bathroom size is decent. There was a problem with the cable when we were there, so the TV didn't work.

I expected a clean, basic room. I knew we were not staying at the Four Seasons. However, it was pretty dirty. I've attached a few pics of the carpet and stains. Everything had a stain on it., even the towels. After our first day of exploring Rome, we returned, took a shower (not too bad...plenty of hot water) and started to slip into bed. I pulled down the comforter and there were curly little hairs all over the blanket and pretty big stains. I wanted to sleep in my jeans the entire time. We requested a new blanket, but it wasn't much better. The a/c works very well and the dark windows kept us asleep. There are several restaurants very close, as mentioned in some of the other reviews. The night prior to leaving we talked to the guy in the lobby. We requested a taxi and confirmed it would only be 40 euros. (All the taxis are required to post the fee for the drive to the airports). He said it wouldn't be a problem and he would call them in the morning for us. Well, we walked down the stairs in the morning and walked into a big pot cloud from the same guy working the night before. He started to make the call and we hurried outside to escape the cloud of smoke. About 10 minutes later, a black van arrives. We didn't order a van. So, we asked how much it would be. 80 euros. We tried to talk to the guy in the lobby again, but he kinda just stared at us and didn't want to deal with it (He spoke perfect English so that wasn't the problem). We gave up and paid for the ride, but really just wanted a taxi. I think I would be too embarrassed to recommend this hotel to a friend or co-worker. I guess if you are single and just need a bed, it MIGHT be okay. We wouldn't return to this hotel.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedfordshire", "Title": "\u201cFreak!\u201d", "Author": "Acompletefreak", "ReviewID": "UR7714158", "Content": "We decided to book a last minute short break to Rome, once the flights were done we turned our attention to a place to stay, we initially need two double rooms at the same hotel and suffice to say at short notice this was easier said then done! The Lonely Plant Rome Guide pointed us in the direction of this hotel; the original booking was made via the telephone with a really helpful young lady, who was very patient with me as I don't speak any Italian at all. Just seven days prior to our stay we had to cancel one of the rooms and this was done with complete ease. Prior to arriving we had checked out the previous reviews that trip advisor has for this hotel and had we not been a little desperate I am sure that they would have completely put us off and we would have booked elsewhere. We arrived at the hotel to be met by a charming and very helpful receptionist, as we had arrived quite early in the day our room wasn't quite ready, so after getting a quick but really helpful overview of the area we left our bags and headed out into the eternal city. On arriving back at the hotel we were given Room 23, we were both pleasantly surprised and somewhat relieved with what we found. Our bathroom had a really big and very powerful shower, with constant hot water. The room was a little small with twin beds that were made up as a double, so the actual sleeping area was larger than a normal size double. The room was very clean and tidy, simply furnished but it had everything that we needed! One morning we did try the television, we were not at all disappointed by the lack of English speaking channels as the city (and my company) were so fantastic that we never turned it on again! The air con worked perfectly, and kept the room nicely chilled. The blackout shutters and double glazing made for a perfect night's sleep also. The reception area was staffed around the clock and we found all the staff members to be perfectly helpful and approachable. Breakfast was simple but ample and afforded us a quick getaway each morning to see more of the city. All in all the hotel was perfect for our requirements, it is a quiet quarter of Trastevere. There are a few restaurants in the Square to the side of the hotel and once you have spent your whole day sightseeing and having a perfect time, eating somewhere relaxed, affordable with excellent food a stone's throw away is a splendid way to end your day. On saying all of that the hotel is just a short walk from the main Trastevere drag, and everything that the area has to offer. Only having got back today, I might still be feeling fairly wonderful as my whole weekend was perfect. Rome is just amazing and absolutely the best short break I have ever had in Europe, the hotel was in a excellent location and was everything we needed at a really reasonable price for a city like Rome and lastly my partner in crime (PIC) was completely splendid (you know who you are)! Can't promise that my PIC will be available for your trip, but if you choose Rome and this hotel and you only have half the fun I had, and only get half the amount of wonderful memories you will still have had a fabulous time!", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cDon't do it\u201d", "Author": "NoahIS", "ReviewID": "UR4142581", "Content": "You might as well spend a little more money and stay in a decent place.
