This is an ideal hotel for group to stay in. The hotel and rooms are clean and decent. Staff were friendly and helpful. It's a 2** hotel! Some of the decor could be more attractive (although the breakfast room is very nice), but more importantly it's clean - how much time do you spend in your room when you are in Rome anyway? (Also got clean fresh towels every day.) The location is excellent, great access to the metro and buses. I would definitely use this hotel again with a group. It can be noisy at night, but the windows shut out the noise and the fan keeps you cool (ish)!", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fife", "Title": "\u201cNot fit for purpose\u201d", "Author": "BrainsFife", "ReviewID": "UR85621671", "Content": "Arrived with a party on a school trip only to be told they couldn't accommodate all of us in the one building!! The person on the desk seemed surprised when we told her that we found this to be totally unacceptable. She was not in the least bit interested in our opinion. We had a total of 55 in our group and nowhere in the hotel is large enough to gather that number in one place - we told her that we would use the breakfast room which would be large enough but she angrily refused to consider this. We eventually persuaded her to place extra beds in some of the rooms to ensure we were all under the same roof but those rooms then ended up with wall to wall beds and no floor space!! The rooms themselves were poor quality and mine stank of sewage. (The smell was coming from the drain in the shower. I placed a plastic cup over the plug hole and weighed it down with a shoe to seal it. The smell disappeared after an hour with the window open fully. Next day, the maid moved the cup and the smell was back!! One of the walls in the corridor had nails sticking out and one of our group tore her shirt on it. We insisted the company find us alternative accommodation. We were out next day. This is definitely not suitable for groups.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel good location\u201d", "Author": "bbindal", "ReviewID": "UR69410346", "Content": "My first impression upon entering the hotel was that it was not as advertised on the website. The lobby was grim and so was the man behind reception. The room although was clean. The hotel is well located, just a short walk from Termini station. Breakfast was OK. The staff is not very welcoming. Dont expect much assistance from them. Overall I felt for the money I paid I couldve gotten a much better room at the same location. I would say this place is worth about 60 euros and not the 85 I paid here. There are many many hotels around the same area which can give you much better value. On my next visit to rome I would probably choose another hotel in the same area.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong", "Title": "\u201cHandy to Central Termini\u201d", "Author": "RetireeBob", "ReviewID": "UR67049107", "Content": "The Dei Mille is about 5 min walk from the Central Termini in a safe area.

The rooms were beautifully decorated, clean and well equipped with a safe, a fridge and a beautiful ensuite bathroom. They were largely spacious and had four single beds. There was a large double shower and we were provided with plenty of toileteries daily. Our rooms were located on the first floor and we did notice that the rooms on the ground floor were considerably less attractive. They were still clean but had bunkbeds and were slightly smaller. A small sacrifice considering the location for this hotel - right next to Termini bus and metro station. The food at breakfast was also nice and more than enough was provided. Some negative feelings I have only concern the staff of the hotel. They never seemed to want to help and were civil at best with most of my group. On the whole, I think this hotel was great and would definitely stay there again, however I would be requesting a room on the second floor.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cRoom 251 was haunted\u201d", "Author": "chx86", "ReviewID": "UR33983883", "Content": "My review is only to say that we stayed for 1 night at the Hotel in room 251 and there is something there, we got scared at 5:00 am by some kind of doll that appeared at the room.

Online the hotel had beautiful pictures of their facilities. Our room looked nothing like the pictures. Also they serve a \"breakfast\" which is included. Online they describe having fresh fruit, meats, cheeses, and breads. Ok - the fruit was canned fruit cocktail! How's that for fresh fruit? One meat - ham, no cheese. It was a huge disappointment. The bed was hard as a rock - you could have been as comfortable on the floor - and you could feel every spring in the bed. The bathroom shower was tiny! I weigh 160 lbs and am 5'3\" tall - I barely fit! You couldn't even bend over in there! To say the least, my daughter and I were extremely disappointed and the staff did nothing to make up for the false advertising, nor would they reduce the cost.
