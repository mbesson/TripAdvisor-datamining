Please don't be put off by some of the reviews, having said that it is a fairly cheap hotel for its position and you get what you paid for. Free computer and internet use is a great bonus. I found everyone there most helpful. I had the single room overlooking the quiet canal, except when the delivery man/boat arrived at 8.00am but this was fine, not point in lying in bed all day when you have only a few days in Venice. It was such a change to not have cars and bikes etc whizzing passed your room. The hotel was small but I would liken it to our Guest Houses, very much more personal than big hotels. I wish it had been warm enough to sit on the little balcony overlooking the canal, what a dream for a single room, its own little balcony. Yes it is small but I quite liked the cosiness of the whole place. The breakfast was very adequate, juice, coffee/tea/or hot chocolate; slices of crusty bread, a croissant, packets of toasted biscuits, packets of sweet biscuits, pineapple or peaches, lots of jams/honey/soft cheese triangles. I don't eat cereal or yogurts but they were also there. I found the review from the lady in Oregan very helpful and to be honest everyone around was very helpful if you got lost, my first night a young couple walked me all the way back to the hotel as I had turned left from the Rialto instead of right, which would have brought me back within minutes! instead I was about half an hour away. The little shop just round the corner was handy for buying water and wine and the little cafe opposite that (ran by some Chinese people) were very accommodating to give make my hot chocolate to take away on my way home after walking around Venice all day. I took the 10.00am slow train two and half hours) for \u00c2\u00a37 to Verona which is lovely but paid extra (\u00c2\u00a320) for the express train back, a good compromise and well worth the visit. I bought a return airport to Venice Aliguna ticket for the 1st and 5th day and a 3-day Vaporetta ticket for the middle 3 days. I did visit Murano but if you only do one other island go to Burano........ I visited the Academia which is fantastic, particularly on a windy cold day and the Guggenheim which was interesting but annoying when groups of people walk around with one information device on loud speaker! My only bad comment is the attitude of the boarding staff at Marco Polo airport, especially as I (rather stupidly on reflection!) spent around \u00c2\u00a320 on 3 pizza cutters as pressies and had only hand luggage.

This review reflects a two-night stay in late July 2011 involving four adults and two rooms. To say walking in and around Venice can be challenging is an understatement, and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on-line map is of minimal value. Nonetheless, once you get oriented, the walk between the hotel and the San Marco vaparetto station is less than 10 minutes. With luggage, the journey will be longer given the narrowness of the alleys and the various cross-canal bridges. The hotel is very small \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no more than six rooms located on the second floor. The hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lobby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is immediately off the sidewalk. There is no elevator/lift (although a single-seat chair lift is available). The stairway to the second floor is narrow and curvy. However, the gentleman at the front desk did assist with carrying our luggage to the second floor (a great welcome given a very long journey from the United States West Coast). The layout of the second floor is basically one large \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd space (chairs and tables) that also functions as the breakfast area. Off this main area are the individual hotel rooms. There is also a free computer/internet station here. We had two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms. Basically two single-beds pushed together, small desk, TV, and valet/chesterfield. The ensuite bath includes toilet, bidet, sink, and shower stall. (To say the shower stall is small would be an understatement). The rooms were clean and quiet. Both the mattresses and the bath towels were better than found in other European hotels (Rome, Paris). The rooms are air-conditioned. Room lighting is controlled by room key. Breakfast was included in our room rate. The selection included pastries, cereal, yogurt, and cold meats. Coffee, tea, milk, and juice. Quite tasty and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast lady\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was perhaps the highlight of our stay. Our rate was $180 USD/night/room, which included breakfast. Overall the rooms were clean, and the hotel location is certainly convenient to both Piazza San Marco and the Rialto bridge. There are several affordable restaurants nearby, as well as a gondola \u00e2\u20ac\u0153station\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, the three-star rating (even by continental European lodging standards) is a stretch.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greeley, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cCozy and a little quirky\u201d", "Author": "Glenmere7", "ReviewID": "UR115331608", "Content": "I stayed 3 nights here while visiting the Biennale. There are a few oddities to the place, but I had no major problems and enjoyed the balcony room. I like the cozy atmosphere of a smaller hotel, and I thought the price was reasonable for the amenities and location (about $100 per night through hotels.com.) I had booked a single room but was initially placed in a double room and was asked to pack my bags the next morning so the staff could move them to the single room. The double room (#101) had no appreciable view and was overcrowded with excessive furniture. However, the bath was a decent size. The single room (#108), in which I spent the last two nights of the reservation, was smaller, especially the bath, but had much more natural light. This room also has a beautiful tiled balcony with potted plants, a metal table and two chairs. The balcony overlooks a quiet side canal and the fondamenta onto which the hotel fronts. The Good: The hotel is quiet and clean with a helpful English-speaking staff. The air conditioning works well. Some find its relative proximity to San Marco to be an advantage, though I am not among them. I usually find lodging farther away from San Marco when I am in Venice. Fortunately, however, Locanda Canal is still far enough away from the square not to be caught up in the commotion and crowds. A pleasant discovery for me was that one can walk from this location to the Biennale in the Giardini Pubblici and Aresnale in 20 minutes, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also only two vaporetto stops away, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather not walk. There are a number of excellent street cafes, restaurants, and other smaller places to eat within easy walking distance, and on my first night in the city I enjoyed a wonderful late supper sitting outdoors at a restaurant a few corners away from the hotel. I slept well in the beds, and the linens, pillows, and towels are of acceptable quality. The hotel provides pressed linen hand towels and terrycloth bath towels. The bath towels are of modest size. As is the case in Europe generally, if you like to bathe with a wash cloth, bring your own from home. Hot water was prompt and plentiful. Rooms are (over)furnished with ornate pieces, and I found the old silver-backed glass wall mirrors fascinating (possibly they are antiques). Breakfast is not robust, but I found it to be quite adequate. It is served in a small room with four tables. (The locanda is so small that some of the guest rooms open directly onto the breakfast room.) The morning meal consists mainly of the usual small basket of bread slices and rolls and a choice of coffee, caffe latte, or tea. Additionally, a boiled eggs is available along with a cold item such as sliced meat or cheese, as well as fruit juice. At one end of the breakfast room a computer with internet connectivity is available for guests to use free of charge. The tiny lobby and front desk are on the canal level, and all the guest rooms are upstairs from there. Theoretically there is an attendant at the front desk 24 hours a day. (One night, however, I woke up a gentleman who was snoozing behind the counter with the lights off as I came in late from a concert. We were both startled.) In practice, the front desk is vacated regularly during the day so that the attendant can cover another property elsewhere that is managed by the same folks. I presume from the hotel stationery that the other establishment is the Casa Pisani Canal. There is often a sign on the door indicating an imminent return; however, guests are given keys to the front door and may come and go freely, regardless of the level of staffing. One of the best things about Locanda Canal is the balcony, if you can get a room with one. This was a delightful, quiet place to relax at the end of the day, and a couple of times I had my evening meal there after buying a couple of panini and a bottle of wine. The Bad: As has been noted, this hotel is hard, but certainly not impossible to find. I discovered the best way is to start on the west (San Marco) side of the Hotel Danieli, which faces the sea, and press persistently inland (I used the Calle de Le Rasse). You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to make a couple of ticks to the left along the way, preferably while fondling a St. Christopher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medal for good luck. In only a few minutes you will indeed see the modest sign of the Locanda Canal. A larger hotel called Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dei Conti is nearby and may serve as a helpful landmark. After the initial pioneer experience, I found getting to and from the hotel to be easy. The place has some quirky aspects to it. They apparently got a good deal on chairs, and as many as possible have been placed in the rooms. Chairs also line the hallways, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no shortage of places to sit. Though I was not shunted off to their other property, as has been reported by some guests, I was not able to occupy my reserved room the first night and had to repack and so I could be moved to a nearby room the next morning. This was not a major disruption for me, however. For some reason the bedspread on my bed disappeared in the midst of my stay and was never returned. Possibly it was needed more elsewhere. I just chalked it up to the eccentricities of the place, which up to a point, add to its charm. The bathroom in my single room was so cramped that one literally steps from the shower into the basin of the bidet. The shower cabinets are very small affairs constructed of rickety plastic. They are outfitted with a panel of numerous jet spray heads mounted on one wall of the cabinet, but I would have preferred having a little additional interior room in the shower rather than the water sports. Notes on staff and service: For the most part the staff are a cheerful and well-meaning bunch, if perhaps a bit bumbling on occasion. It was no problem at all to leave my luggage there when I arrived before check-in time and again to leave it at the hotel for several hours after check-out. A day clerk was also helpful in booking me a ticket to one of the baroque chamber concerts offered at the Chiesa San Vidal by the performance group Interpreti Veneziani (recommended, and a good deal for 25 euros). I encountered two breakfast matrons during my stay. One was exuberant and generous with offers of second helpings of everything; the other was reserved and had a decidedly more restrained concept of hospitality. Maid service was adequate, but I noticed that after the first night I received no replacement for the modest squeeze packet of shampoo provided in the bathroom. The bedside tip I left was, however, very efficiently retrieved. Notes on shopping in the area: If you would like to buy a bottle of wine to have in your room or on your balcony, you might consider purchasing it from the canal-side vendors out on the Riva degli Schiavoni or at popular crossing points such as Accademia. I was surprised to find good quality wine available for 9 or 10 euros from these vendors, and many of them even have refrigeration to keep the white wine chilled. (The local pinot grigio can be wonderful.) The panini and other food options in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are very reasonably priced and very tasty, but the same wine there often costs twice as much. For this reason I ended up often purchasing my take-away food and my wine in different places. Also, there are a number of shops only a few corners away from Locanda Canal that sell popular items such as glass from Murano and lace from Burano. You might check the prices in this area or even in other more distant parts of the city before migrating to the shops in the immediate vicinity of San Marco. My experience is that the farther away from San Marco one is, the less expensive such items become. All things considered, I had a wonderful time at the 2011 Biennale and in Venice, and the Locanda Canal is part of that positive experience.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockville Centre", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "MarcRockvilleCentre", "ReviewID": "UR106159566", "Content": "I'd read that people arrived and then got bumped to another hotel so I emailed ahead of time and told them i'd heard this and was certain they wouldn't do it to us.

We arrived in Venice and tried to find the hotel from the map that we were given on the hotel's website. We got terribly lost. Every shopowner we asked looked at the map and said \"no this map is terrible, its wrong\". After walking around for about twenty minutes and asking loads of people, we eventually found the hotel. Yet, it wasn't the hotel. We were met by an empty reception and had to holler up the stairs for someone to come down. We were met by an extremly flustered man who told us \"everything is going wrong\", not a great start, and that our booking was mixed up. No, it wasn't but we, like a couple of other reviewers, got taken on a journey to the annex hotel. An extremly small hotel, interestingly further away from St Marco (did we pay to be nearer - I think we did). We had to lug our luggage up the very narrow stairs with carpet tread on it which was, nothing short of filthy, with the carpet tread up in places which would have had a Health and Safety Inspector having kittens. We came to our room, the Junior Suite, which was basically a double room with a put up bed in the corner for our son. At this point, I lost my temper and felt that we had been conned on the location and conned on the room. The bathroom itself was tiny and it had pink plastic soap stands! There seems to be a theme running in these reviews here, so if you book this hotel, be very wary. They seem to move people around for no apparent reason. The Junior Suite had a four poster bed. Basically, some curtain material held together with velcro. We were shown the balcony that we could sit at - oh, sit on those cushions which are ripped - no thanks. One of the windows had a net curtain, the other did not. I went to open one window, and the frame nearly fell on my head! The breakfast was so so. The reason for writing this review - when we went back to get our cases, I asked if I could use the toilet - the answer - a resounding \"No\". This, all for the extortinate price of \u00c2\u00a3113.

The Locanda Canal is a three-star hotel, and the rate quoted was 120 euros a night. As things turned out, the hotel was perfectly suited to my needs. It was a five-minute walk from the San Zaccaria vaporetto stop, and the walk was entirely level (with no ups and downs over canals) so that I could wheel my luggage all the way there. It was my first visit to Venice, and the map provided at the hotel's website was a godsend. (This matters. During my four days in Venice, everywhere I looked I saw lost tourists, toting huge amounts of baggage, searching in vain for their hotels.) As well, the hotel was only about a two-minute walk from Saint Mark's Square. The room was a typical size for a three-star hotel in Europe (and considerably smaller than a typical North American or Australian hotel room, of course). It even had a small terrace, with a table and two chairs, overlooking the canal below. It had a full tile bathroom which was a bit cramped, particularly to access the shower stall, but spotlessly clean. The room was elegantly furnished, as were the public spaces including the breakfast room. Breakfast was a perfect start to the day, consisting of croissants, fruit, yogourt, and coffee, served on small tables with linen tablecloths. There was also a public computer at which hotel guests could check their e-mail. At check-out, the price I was charged for the four nights was exactly 480 euros. There were no surprise last-minute charges of any kind. Without question, I would stay there again and would recommend it to others.", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFabulous single room\u201d", "Author": "John Beasley", "ReviewID": "UR7427471", "Content": "Venice is not a cheap destination so I was pleased to find a quiet single room close to St Marks square for 75 euros a night B&B. My single room on the first floor was reasonable size nicely furnished and spotless - as was the modern ensuite bathroom. The window overlooked the canal and within minutes of my arrival a gondola full of tourists floated serenely by. The biggest treat was the small private veranda off the room which overlooked the canal. (complete with table and two chairs) which was ideal for a quite rest from sightseeing. TV reception very poor - take a book or stay out late. Breakfast was okay. Normal stuff, juice, cereals, yoghurt, coffee etc - didn't see any eggs - served in the spotless dining area. Some rooms were straight off the dining area and my guess is that their view would have been of the side alley. Overall the single room I stayed in could not have been better.

The room was small and clean and the bathroom was great. Really clean and comfortable. The only problem was that our room was at the top of the stairs and so was very noisy in the mornings. Seemed like nearly all the rooms on the first floor were around the breakfast area so would also be that bit noisy. For the price, 120 Euro for a double room, it was quite good for Venice and was very centrally located. The staff were friendly and we had no complaints. The directions given by the hotel on their website from the vaporetto were very accurate and if you have a Venicecard map, you'll be able to figure it out quite easily. We'd stayed first in the Holiday Inn, Quarto d'Altino (E80 per night) which was really great but you couldn't just stop by in the evenings before going out again.

Before we left for Australia for Italy at the end of Sept 2005, we booked Hotel Casa Pisani for 3 nights stay. Because of the comments by various reviewers at this website about the switching of hotels, I was careful about getting confirmation by email from the Hotel that the accomodation is at Hotel Casa Pisani and not Locanda Canal. But guess what surprise, surprise, when we arrive at the check in at Locanda Canal (note: the check in for Hotel Casa Pisani is at Locanda Canal)we were told that Hotel Casa Pisani is not available for the 1st night and we had to stay at Locanda Canal for one night and then move to Hotel Casa Pisani for the other two nights. After travelling for 3 weeks, I was not impressed with this at all (i.e. having to move hotels). So we decided not to stay at Locanda Canal and looked for an alternative hotel next door. When we left the hotel, the guy from the hotel followed us and kept hassling us until we reported the incident to the police. He then left us alone. The police got involved and told the Hotel owner that they should not be charging us for not staying at the hotel as they have not delivered on their commitment on providing us with accomodation at Hotel Casa Pisani and after more discussion by the police and the owner on the phone, the owner agreed with the police that we would not be charged for not staying at the hotel. Surprise, surprise when we arrived back in Australia, the hotel charged us Euro 170 which is equivalent to one night room rate. I am now disputing this charge with VISA card. As a matter of principle, we will fight this one. This is very bad practice by the management of Locanda Canal. It may be that this hotel is conveniently located however, we do not wish to support a hotel that is engaging in deceiving practices.

The receptionist was very friendly, spoke perfect English and he suggested we leave our luggage in the upstairs rest area on departure from the hotel as our flight did not leave until the evening. I loved the hotel and the location and if I get the chance to go back to Venice I will try to book the same hotel.
