Firstly, I must say how helpful the hotel were in providing us with map and details on getting to the hotel: they were spot on. The hotel is in a great location in San Marco; less than 10 minutes walk from Rialto bridge and St Mark's square. One thing to bear in mind with this area is that there will be lots of tourists lugging their suitcases around: I had to shut the windows at night as it got a bit noisy, and I had trouble sleeping. The breakfast was of the usual continental variety: good choice of coffee, pastries, yoghurts and sad looking fruit. Don't having anything negative to add really: maybe the bedroom walls could do with a lick of paint to freshen up the room. The bathroom was nice and clean, although couldn't get jacuzzi bath to work!

The hotel is small, and can be a bit tricky to find, but the hotel had sent us a map prior to our arrival, so we just followed the twists and turns quite easily. With the exception of one small footbridge that we had to lug our suitcases up and down, the rest of the way was flat and easy to tow our bags behind us. Our room was very clean, and the bathroom was lovely! We had a jetted spa tub, and the marble floors, walls and vanity just added a beautiful touch of distinction to the room. The beds were very firm, but I much prefer that to a soft mattress anyway. The bedspread was a bit \"dated\" looking, and If I could offer one thing I would change, it would be that. Our breakfast was included, and we really appreciated that fabulous selection available to us each morning. There were hard boiled eggs, sliced meat, yogurt, fruit pies, quiche, canned fruit, toast, croissants, cereal, and lots of other choices, as well as coffee, tea and juice. We were able to have a lovely breakfast and then start right in on our days of exploring the beauty of Venice. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We also really appreciated having the little elevator to take our bags up to our floor. Many hotels in Europe don't have elevators, and I didn't relish the though of lugging my heavy suitcases up one or two flights of stairs. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a special boutique-hotel experience in Venice.

The only problem we had was that the AC stopped working on the last night that we were there. Since it was not too hot, we did not see it as a big problem and did not ask for help. The noise was not an issue at all at this hotel, this calle is relatively quiet compared to what I have seen in Venice. The bar across from the hotel is not a typical busy bar, and it closes quite early (when we get back to the hotel in the evening around 11 PM, it was already closed). Breakfast here is very good, better than most in Venice, even than the one we stayed in our last trip which was a much more expensive hotel than this one.
