Next, this isn't the only noise that interrupted our sleep. Being down an alley and thus near the utility area of adjoing buildings we got to hear staff coming and going from other building, deliveries, etc.. Another problem with our room was that mobile phone coverage and data reception was terrible - to the extent that we couldn't use our iPhones for either calls or internet. And we are with one of the two major providers. Finally, when checking out we were charged a 1.5 percent surcharge for using a credit card. Who doesn't pay with credit cards nowadays?

The shower does have a big step to get into but there are plenty of towels. The location is superb, right in the heart of Sydney. You're a three minute walk to the free bus that takes you throughout Sydney and I highly recommend that. You can also walk comfortably from Darling Harbour or The Rocks. It's about ten minutes to either location. The hotel's entrance is down a very small, one block street that I see has bothered other reviewers but I had no issues with it. It was perfectly safe. There was a trash pickup of the next door office building each night but a little bit of noise between eight and nine at night is not an issue for me at a downtown hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. As is usual with international arrivals, I got there very early and my room wasn't ready but they stored my luggage and did checkin. So when I returned in the afternoon the luggage was neatly placed in my room and all I had to do was get my key. The person working the desk even remembered my name and room so they just handed me the key, a very nice touch. They also had maps and other information that newcomers to Sydney might want. I needed a cab and they got one to me right away. I highly recommend this hotel because of its location.

The shower was a good pressure, but it took a while to reach the right mix of both cold and hot due to the temperamental nature of the taps. It seemed though the chambermaid had arms of steel, because, before our day's adventures we often had to succumb to leaving our poor shower head dripping, but every afternoon, without fail, when we returned to the apartment we were greated with a quiet stillness (beyond the bustling hum of Sydney outside,of course) and found the shower head completely dry, without leakage. It was quite amusing, and I give credit to the chambermaid, but do hope the maintanence people attend at some point to the taps.

The room also came with a small carton of milk which was ideal. The location is also ideal - just seconds away from Martin Place and the downtown shopping hub. The major problem for me was the noise at night. You have to expect that a downtown hotel will be noisy, so I can't really complain, but in the interests of full disclosure, I woke frequently to street cleaners, garbage trucks, breaking bottles, trucks backing up, and on the Saturday night, drunk people screaming in the alleyway (probably fighting over the car parks!) and an extremely loud bang (I can't have been a gun but sounded like it). I didn't mention the noise to management. We stayed on the first floor, so I would recommend a higher floor to perhaps avoid some of the nighttime noise. Although the suite was great value, next time I would probably stay at the slightly more expensive Medina on Crown St in Surry Hills.", "Date": "September 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ganagirl", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service\u201d", "Author": "Ganagirl", "ReviewID": "UR16363112", "Content": "Not your average review BUT I feel it should be written. I booked for 2 nights and was upgraded to a 1 bed apartment. Great location for getting about in town and pleasant, efficient reception team. On the second day I had a very unexpected, very serious illness while in the hotel and the hotel team were absolutely amazing. I was traveling alone and it was all very frightening for me. They simply rose to the challenge and responded with calm, genuine care and thoughtfulness making it far less traumatic than it could have been. I was so impressed with the lady who sat with me until the emergency services arrived - yes it was that serious! - she helped me call and locate friends in Sydney, stayed calm which helped me in turn stay calm and was incredibly kind and supportive throughout I know we should expect this, but everyday in the news we see that this doesn't happen, that people aren't helped when they really need it...so I am very very grateful to this team of people and this hotel chain, who instill this kind of customer care. Very grateful.

Room was huge and a lovely internal balcony the size of a room. Room was a little dated and I thought it was clean until i discovered toilet paper unflushed. That was a small issue as I loved the space and the full kitchen. Didn't have much time to spend in the room but the continental breakfast basket was nice. Staff allowed me to store my bags until my flight which was good. Good apartments for business or if you like the space and very close to Martin Place station.

Arrived in Sydney in the early hours of the morning. The taxi driver had no idea where the hotel was and had me lookin at a map book for it, after riding round the streets we eventually got there at around 9.30am. Check in wasnt while 2pm but we thought we'd go and see if the room was ready. We were greated by friendly reception staff who immedatley contacted the cleaner to make sure our room was ready and was allowed in - a big relief as we were so tired. We were in a studio room - 404 on the fourth floor. The room was large and spacious, there is a chest of drawers and a large wardrobe, then a bathroom with a laundry room, Then was the kitchen which was very well equipeped. Fridge freezer, dishwasher, microwave and then a large living space with double bed. The view wasnt of much - a man sat at his desk in the office opposite, didnt bother us tho as we were out all the time. The room was very clean, in a previous comment it was mentioned that the carpet was dirty as was the bathroom, we didnt have this problem the room was spotless, The room was cleaned everyday! It can be noisy outside with rubbish trucks etc but its not a huge problem. The only problem i had was the fridge could be noisy at night but you soon got used to it! The hotel is on a side street and you do worry a bit as you walk to it but once your on the main road the location is ideal. Martins Place is the next street, and the train station is there too. Circular Quay, darling Harbour etc are all close by (10-15min walk). Hotel is central so can be busy with workers. Loads of places nearby to eat and a coles supermarket a couple of blocks away! All in all a great central place to stay especially if you can get it at the right price, we paid \u00c2\u00a365 a night!

I find the rooms to be very very noisy, it is situated up a lane way and during the night you have the garbage trucks emptying the bins, this includes the emptying of glass bins, and that is very loud. The hot water in the shower takes a long time to kick in and the shower head is so small that you need to perform some sort of magic trick to get all your hair wet.

We arrived on Saturday morning before check-in time but I was relieved when they allowed us to go to our room right away. The lady who checked us in was very friendly. Coming from Hong Kong, where space is a premium, I really liked the large living room, open kitchen and large bathroom. I thought the bedroom was a little small but who cares if you can hang out in the living room? If you're petite or if you're a kid you might need a stool to climb into the bathtub (which comes w/ a shower). They gave us everything we needed in the kitchen - large refridgerator, stove, pots & pans, cutlery, etc. They even gave us lots of menus to choose from if we wanted to order dinner from the neighborhood delivery service. The best part of the hotel was the location. Although the hotel is located in a dead-end street it's a 1 minute to Chifley Plaza, a short walk to David Jones, Myer.... the shopping district. My husband and I spent Sunday walking around and made a few trips back to the hotel to drop off our shopping bags. We lost track of time and returned to the hotel 2 hours after the check-out time. We couldn't get into our rooms because our \"keys\" (cards) had expired but they re-activated our cards and didn't even mention the fact that we had forgotten to check-out on time when we checked out!
