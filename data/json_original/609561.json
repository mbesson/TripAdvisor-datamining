The hotel is perfectly functional, attractive - even stylish, & in a good location near a metro station & the Atocha train station, but it has a somewhat cold, business vibe. We arrived late our 1st night & got stuck in a smallish room overlooking an alley. There's a night club down the street from the hotel so when it shut down in the wee hours of the morning the alley was used as a short-cut by the clubbers & was very noisy. Moved the next day with a bit of a hassle at the front desk which kept trying to get us to upgrade [at an additional cost] to the executive level. Finally, we were given a slighter larger, front-facing room. The hotel is immaculate & superbly maintained. Staff were efficient, if a bit aloof. We felt the breakfast was overpriced so we walked across the street every morning where there are a number choices. Internet also overpriced - free wifi can be had a noisy, over crowded McDonalds down the street or at Starbucks across the street. The location's very convenient though I'd probably choose a different neighborhood next visit to Madrid. Being across the street from the Reina Sofia Museum (fabulous museum!) was great. It's a pleasant, 20 minute walk to the Prado & Botanical Gardens. Did a day trip to Toledo (a must!) & being so close to the train station was plus. Be aware that the nearby metro station has a lot of very steep stairs - would be pretty impossible to deal with luggage up & down those steps... Overall a pleasant enough experience.

The hotel is very close to the Reina Sofia art museum and an easy 10 min. stroll to either the Prado or the Thyssen-Bournemisza along a shady wide boulevard. The hotel itself is a bit of a jewel on a somewhat shabby street. Nice lobby. Very helpful staff. The morning buffet was extensive . There are very few places to eat elsewhere nearby for breakfast if you need to eat early ( I was taking a couple of early morning departure day bus tours) so I did select the pay the additional charge for the buffet. The room itself was average. My room was located on a side alley, and I found it a bit noisy. But then again, all of Madrid was celebrating the Euro soccer win at the time of my stay. The hotel does have a restaurant but I did not eat there. It was a bit of a challenge to find places to eat dinner that were a short walk away from the hotel.

The location is about a 10 minute walk from the main train station. The only drawbacks I noticed is that you aren't centrally located to a main metro (most of the time it was easier to walk to most of the places in Madrid) and the local restaurants near the hotel weren't very good.

Sharing this just so you all can be careful with your stuff during your visit.

We like to walk a lot when we travel, so walking to Puerta del Sol, the Royal Palace, Salamanca, and many other Madrid attractions was very easy from this starting point. The rooms are very clean although I found some of them to be a tad on the small side, so I would not recommend more than two people per room. The bed itself was more like a double, but we learned that there are rooms with king size beds because we had to change rooms on our final night due to a problem with the air conditioning. Unfortunately, the room with the larger bed also overlooked the street and there was also some traffic noise, but it was a tolerable level on the 4th floor. Husa Paseo del Arte offers a very nice buffet breakfast complete with eggs, bacon, breads, luncheon meat, fruit, pastries, juices, coffee and even wine. Smoked salmon was available on some days. It was undoubtedly the best breakfast buffet we experienced in Spain. My only complaint about this hotel is they charge extra for WiFi access (6 Euro per hour) unless you pay for a Superior room, where it is included in the price. Even some two star hotels we stayed at offered free WiFi. English language television is rather limited as well, but this seems to be a common theme in Spain. The NBC Evening News was available on CNBC at 12:30 AM, but there was no volume on this channel so CNN, BBC and one other network were broadcast in English. There were about 4 channels in English.

The beautiful Buen Retiro park is also just a few minutes' walk away - perfect for a stroll in the morning, before heading to the airport in the afternoon.

When searching for an hotel, you check the pictures and so on, but you really don't know what you gonna get!! In a group trip I was in charge of finding the hotel in Madrid, because I speak fluently Portuguese and if you do so, you almost understand all Spanish. When we arrived, the entire group, but particularly me, was pleased because my judgment and decision making process matched accurately with the reality I found at Husa Paseo Del Arte. Yeah, this hotel is good, I felt really well every time I returned to my room!! The architecture, decoration, cleaning, amenities, were all good. I cannot talk about food because we took our meals in the nearby restaurants (which are so many)!! My only complaint is about the internet connection. Maybe because of my room location, I couldn't get the wi-fi signal, so I got my money back! This was not a big deal to me because I was connected all day at the Congress venue, and I could skype my family on a daily basis!! One other thing I noticed, was the way the people talked to the customers at the reception. The day we arrived, there was a charming old man (which even spoke some Japanese) that was very friendly!! But the others I found the other days talked in a \"cold face\" mode. No smiles!! It was like giving commands to somebody or give and take orders - like in the army!! I found the same behavior with the waiters in the nearby restaurants!! No \"emotion\" dropped in the process!! So maybe, it is a cultural trait (of the Spanish people) and that is the \"correct approach\" they find when dealing with customers!! In fact, it may be!! The things we find \"correct\", \"ethical\" and so on, have to be understood at the \"local level\"!! By that, I mean that all these issues are \"relative\" and they certainly vary from place to place!! I live now for more than half a decade in Japan and I travel extensively, both locally and throughout the world, due to my research work. So, when I apply my \"sociological and anthropological eye\" (I have a sharp one, hehe, but this is not the field of my work) I do it very carefully!! When we judge others, we do it based on \"our standards\"!! But they may not be theirs!! I wish I could stay longer in Madrid to mature this view, but the busy week I spent there last summer is enough to give the accurate picture I'm giving here about this Hotel to prospective customers.

To get to the hotel stay on until the last stop, Atocha Station. Look for the roundabout and a McDonalds across the way. The hotel is just down the street from the golden arches and past some sort of all ages night club. I google street viewed the hotel earlier and was able to recognize it right away. We loved the location for its easy access to old Madrid. You're across the street from the Reina Sofia and a short walk from the Prado. During our stay we walked to the Prado and bought passes for a Madrid City Tours hop-on and off bus and were able to cover the majority of sights quickly and easily. Never had to use the subway. We also were able to walk all the way to the Royal Palace and back easily. The proximity of the hotel to the main sights made it easy to duck back into our room for a siesta or bathroom break in the middle of the day. The hotel room was fantastic. We had a nice view of the courtyard so never really heard any traffic or city noise. It was clean and spacious. No carpet which is a big plus in my book... sorry carpet lovers. We absolutely looked forward to coming back to our room at the end of each long day of exploring. It was also in proximity to plenty of restaurants and shops so there was always something nearby. My only gripe is that wi-fi is not free. If you're lucky you can go to the McDonalds near the hotel which has \"wi-fi gratis.\" I was able to connect a few times but the signal was pretty weak. I managed to send out a few iMessages in the brief time I had access but don't expect to be able to FaceTime or do an heavy browsing. If you want to get back to the airport the same bus that got you here can take you back... it only picks up at Atocha Station.

We left on a Sunday morning and there were still a good number of people out and about, either going home from a club or staggering about the street. Taxis were everywhere and abundant. Not sure how an early morning weekday would look though. Pretty sure we would have found a taxi but we just opted for the private driver.

Busker entertainment in the underground is amusing, the transport is relatively clean and safe (though you still have to watch out for pickpockets wherever you go). The hotel is modern, tastefully decorated, nothing overdone. The rooms clean, tile fooring; mattresses (very) firm, (probably could have used an extra blanket the first night); good lighting in the room, though the reading lights were non-adjustable, so pretty useless--nice attempt, though; bathrooms super clean with lots of glass and tile, walk-in shower w/ lots of hot water, no tub. Bidets included. Fresh white towels that smell good. Little tchochkes that people like to stash in their bags (soap, combs, shoehorn, sewing kit, etc) are also included and replaced ever day.(I personally liked the mini ball point pens with the post-em note pads). No coffee machines in the room, but you can bring your coffee up from the bar downstairs. We stayed in room 434. The drawback to this room was the disco below--on Sat/Sun we had to close the window during the night it was so noisy till the wee hours...and the place to receive deliveries seems to be directly below, too. But this is a city, so what can one expect? The neighbors across the way can look directly into your room if you don't draw the curtains, but you can look at them (and their laundry) too and see how the Madrileinos live... The staff was okay.

The cleaning lady super sweet--leave her a tip! The place was well staffed during late night hours, too, and always felt like a safe place to be at any hour. Breakfast was a real smorgasbord--really good, fresh edibles, hot and cold, Nestle coffee machines, everything nicely arranged and never looking as if the food had been out too long. Beware though--it's a pricey treat if you have to pay extra for it and did not include it in your package deal. Places we'd recommend: a little bar called Malaspina (drink the Ramon Bilbao crianza!), the Villa Rosa bar for the late Flamenco show, and the restaurants on the Santa Ana Plaza for tapas. The Rastro flea market is only open on Sundays. And be sure to use the audio tour thingies to go tour the palace and the Prado. Do not go into any place that employs someone to drag you in there.

Our double room on the fifth floor was cosy enough, with a good sized, well-equipped bathroom - the free shoehorn was a nice touch. Very clean and nicely furnished. Probably the best thing about it is its location; although Madrid is an extremely accessible city anyway (the most efficient and cheap Metro service I've ever come across), the Husa Paseo del Arte is well within walking distance of Atocha station, the best art galleries in the city and the Retiro, a spacious and handsome park that is perfect for strolls no matter what the season. These attractions are all within Madrid's Bourbon quarter, arguably the most beautiful part of the city. Fountains abound, and the wide boulevards are a pleasant change from the narrow labyrinthine layout of the old centre and La Castellana in the north of the city. In all honesty we didn't spend much time in the hotel, what with all the fun times to be had exploring Madrid. However, as a relatively inexpensive, convenient and comfortable base for sleeping and showering, the Husa is perfect. Staff at reception are efficient and more than happy to look after your bags after you've checked out if, like us, you had a few hours spare before your flight home. We would recommend transit to and from Barajas airport via the Aeropuerto Expr\u00e9s shuttle bus service - this only has three stops in the city, the third being Atocha station, which is handy in the extreme. It is probably about as quick as a taxi and most importantly, much cheaper at 2 euros. The only negatives I can think of are the hotel bar, which is ludicrously overpriced, and the hotel's proximity to a nightclub slightly down the road which is open from 12am to 6am - early morning revellers could just about be heard on the street below, but this would probably only affect the lightest of sleepers.

You can just pay the driver when you get on (stops at every terminal) and Atocha is the last stop). At Atocha station, you turn left once you get off the bus and walk up the street about 5 minutes to the plaza. The hotel is just up Calle Atocha (look for the McDonald's on the corner). The hotel is modern and the rooms very clean. While not large, they were a good size compared with other European hotels. Our only complaint with the room itself was the lack of electrical outlets. We could only find one in our entire room. Service at the hotel was so so. No one was super friendly. Also, as other reviewers have said, sound was an issue. This was similar to what we have experienced at other European hotels. The hotel does not have free wifi but you can just go to the Starbucks or McDonald's next to the hotel for wifi. The Starbucks is right outside the Reina Sofia and has fresh squeezed orange juice (turn left out of the hotel and take a right at the first light down the small street on the side). You have to ask for a wifi password when you order. We were able to walk to most attractions from the hotel. The Prado is just up the next street, Retiro Park is also very close.

Fue extraordinario. 1.- check-in: llegamos de valencia con el AVE a las 10:48 a Atocha, y a las 11:05 ya est\u00e1bamos haciendo el check-in. fue muy r\u00e1pido. hab\u00eda 3 personas atendiendo en ese momento y nos facilitaron una de las 2 habitaciones comunicadas que ten\u00edamos reservadas que ya estaba lista a esa hora de la ma\u00f1ana. 2.- habitaciones: la habitaci\u00f3n grande, 621, hace toda la esquina del edificio recayente a la estaci\u00f3n. la vista es estupenda, y las dimensiones de esc\u00e1ndalo. no bromeo cuando la califico como una habitaci\u00f3n de 5* en un hotel de 4. la cama es enorme y comod\u00edsima, tiene un sofa de 3 plazas muy grande y un butac\u00f3n (muy mullidos ambos), y adem\u00e1s en el otro extremo de la habitaci\u00f3n, un escritorio muy amplio. el cuarto de ba\u00f1o es tambi\u00e9n muy amplio y est\u00e1 muy bien decorado (como el resto de la habitaci\u00f3n), y dispone de todas las amenities. ni en esa habitaci\u00f3n ni en la otra se o\u00eda ning\u00fan ruido molesto de la calle que nos impidiera dormir ninguna de las dos noches que estuvimos (mi\u00e9rcoles y jueves). cuando salimos a pasear por madrid tras haber descargado las maletas descubr\u00ed que la 6\u00aa planta era de fumadores. entonces record\u00e9 haber le\u00eddo alg\u00fan comentario al respecto. les he de indicar que mi hija es asm\u00e1tica (no podemos acceder a locales de fumadores por prescripci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica), y no percibimos ning\u00fan olor a tabaconi en la planta ni mucho menos en las habitaciones. nos habr\u00edan tenido que cambiar de habitaci\u00f3n por este hecho. la habitaci\u00f3n grande compart\u00eda una puerta exterior com\u00fan con la peque\u00f1a donde nos cab\u00eda el carrito del beb\u00e9. esta habitaci\u00f3n estaba tambi\u00e9n muy bien, aunque no ten\u00eda las dimensiones de la otra. era imposible correr por ella. pero todo estaba en perfecto estado y tambi\u00e9n muy bien decorada. 3.- limpieza de las habitaciones: las 2 habitaciones estaban impecables. el chupete de mi hijo que no hab\u00eda manera de encontrarlo lo encontr\u00f3 la chica de la limpieza. muy servicial. el 2\u00ba d\u00eda al verla por la ma\u00f1ana a las 11 le dije que ya pod\u00eda limpiar la habitaci\u00f3n peque\u00f1a (620), pero mis hijos jugando dejaron en la puerta el cartel de \"no molestar\". el resultado fue que llegamos a las 21:15 y la habitaci\u00f3n estaba sin hacer. llam\u00e9 por tel\u00e9fono a conserjer\u00eda y a las 21:45 (mientras cen\u00e1bamos en el restaurante), nos arreglaron la habitaci\u00f3n sin nig\u00fan problema. al d\u00eda siguiente la chica nos pidi\u00f3 excusas, y yo le dije que si estaba el cartel que deb\u00eda estar tranquila. 4.- gimnasio: est\u00e1 en la \u00faltima plantay se disfruta desde alli de unas vistas inmejorables. perfectamente equipado y con una dimensiones apreciables. tiene aparatos muy modernos de todos los modelos y el suelo de parquet. yo dir\u00eda que 12/15 aparatos: 2 cintas de correr, remos, bicicletas est\u00e1ticas, pesas, espalderas,.... est\u00e1 muy bien y a su lado est\u00e1 el solarium con unas hamacas muy c\u00f3modas 5.- desayuno: sal\u00f3n bastante amplio. el caf\u00e9 es de m\u00e1quina de nespresso (pero menuda m\u00e1quina m\u00e1s grande, ya la quisiera yo en mi casa). de caliente hay revuelto de tortilla, bacon y longanizas. fiambres y quesos diversos, tambi\u00e9n frutos secos y cereales . una amplia variedad de fruta pelada y ensaladas. y en cuanto al dulce, hay yogures, mermeladas, nutella, mantequilla, pan de diversos tipos, para hacer tostadas y una amplia variedad de tartas. la boller\u00eda buen\u00edsima, sobre todo los croissants que est\u00e1n rellenos de crema, la tarta de santiago y la de manzana muy buenas tambi\u00e9n. 4 o 5 sabores diferentes de zumos. o sea que si desayunas fuerte, puedes aguantar hasta casi la merienda. acaba a las 10:30, que empiezan a recoger las bandejas. 6.- cena: quisimos cenar una noche en el restaurante para probar. est\u00e1 todo exquisito. probamos la dorada, las carrilleras, las minihamburguesas de ternera y unas patatas rellenas. todo servido en platos enormes. el pan se pod\u00eda escoger entre diversas variedades: yo escog\u00ed el de queso que estaba muy bueno y mi mujer el de aceitunas. los postres que tomamos fueron crema catalana y una seleccion de pasteles. todo genial. en cuanto al precio no s\u00e9 si fue demasiado caro porque no tengo referencias de los precios en madrid de este tipo de restaurantes, pero la calidad era excepcional. no me pareci\u00f3 un atraco a mano armada. 7.- para nosotros es la tercera ocasi\u00f3n que nos alojamos en este hotel y lo hemos encontrado mejor que la vez anterior que fue hace 3 a\u00f1os (julio/agosto de 2008). evidentemente, la pr\u00f3xima vez que volvamos a madrid no tendremos ningun g\u00e9nero de duda en repetir. es una magn\u00edfica elecci\u00f3n para quien viaja en

It was very tiny. We don't do well in tiny rooms as we tend to get in each other's way and there is no place to leave more than one open suitcase. We went down to the front desk and I explained what we had been expecting. They were exceptionally nice and told me an executive room with the 2 sinks in the bathroom, which I had expected, would be ready a little bit later if I'd like to leave my luggage with them. They said the room would be about the same size though. We opted to wait. And we were glad we did. We were pleasantly surprised by a room with much more floor space so we wouldn't be tripping over each other. The bathroom was much larger and more spacious over all other than just having 2 sinks. Most people wouldn't like the view from this room as much as the other room but we loved it since we could see the trees in the botanical garden and the wall of plants from a distance - a wall people like to visit and take pictures. All the large balconies were equally nice. The wifi worked great although it required log in every time we returned to the hotel. It was included in our package. We are walkers so we didn't find the walk to the old historic area to be at all difficult. At first I had wished we had stayed in the other area but in the end I was glad we stayed here. We were near the museums which were great fun and so interesting. And I always thought I wasn't a museum person. We walked to the train station pulling our own luggage and caught the high speed train to Malaga when we left this fun and beautiful city. It was an easy walk for us. Our room was perfectly clean and very stylish in a modern way. I'd definitely stay here again. I'd hope for a larger room but I'd accept a smaller room now that I know this could happen.

Our room was large by European standards, pleasant and clean, plenty of hot water in the bathroom. The hotel was in a great location, an easy walk to the Atocha station or the Prado. They falter at the detail level, however. It started when we checked in. When I made the reservation I'd requested a floor away from the street so we wouldn't have street noise in the room. We were given a room on the first floor. Facing the street. When we got into the room, it appeared well-soundproofed so we decided to keep it, but I don't know why my request was ignored. The room had a laundry list of frequent traveler pet peeves: no unused electrical outlets, only 2 drinking glasses per room, exorbitant rates for the Wi-Fi (there was a charge even in the lobby). I highly recommend a snack at McDonald's around the corner for all your connectivity needs. One light bulb was burned out. (It was replaced while we were out the first day after we informed the front desk.) The beds were configured for maximum flexibility and ease of vacuuming, but not for creature comfort: the headboards were fastened to the wall but the beds were on rollers, so if you rested your back against the headboard the bed crept away from you. Our double bed was 2 singles rolled snugly together. There was a thermostat on the wall. It didn't work. Our visit was during pleasant weather and it's possible they turned off the heating/AC but there was no air circulating in the room. Worse, there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. The only way to get fresh air was to open the window, which let in the street noise. (The windows did an excellent job of shutting out street noise.) During the night that option was completely out of the question because of a large spotlight under the window that would have lit up most of the sleeping area. The hotel has a gym, but I didn't check it out- it was beautiful weather for outdoor running, especially if you're going a long enough distance to reach El Retiro, the former royal park. This is the only hotel with excellent recommendations on TripAdvisor where I've been disappointed.

There was no welcome to the hotel by the staff - not even directions to the elevator. The bar staff were extremely unfriendly and disinterested.

The airport is an architectural delight too and very efficient. As we live and work north of Alicante in a rural tourist area, we like to go for a break to other parts of Spain for culture and a change of pace. This Hotel was chosen mainly for its proximity to the Prado and other museums, its modern style, the reviews on here, and the good package offered from Expedia of a flight and hotel. We booked 3 nights there. Check in was super- the Hotel was very clean ( we are fussy) , the standard room booked was lovely- but they offered an upgrade for only a little more, so we took it. We stayed in a suite on the 7 th floor- way above the noise with good double glazing over the very busy main road ( 24hrs -lots of sirens, car horns, people shouting especially when a nearby disco was emptying at 4 a.m. and later!) .If you dont like noise then ask for a quiet room. We found a lovely terrace, huge bathroom, large comfy firm double bed , tea & coffee makings supplied, minibar , bathrobe,slippers( for 1) , hair dryer, wide screen TV with different language channels and free wi fi. It was chilly at night and the heating was excellent, lots of hot water too and the toiletries and extras there were excellent.. Everything we requested ( more towels, map, best place nearby for good tapas, getting us taxis etc) was provided and the staff were very helpful and charming. Negative points- only small- the wardrobe in the room was very small but we travelled light. If you have a lot of clothes there were only 5 hangers and a small area- a few shelves, with no drawers at all. The minibar only had beer and soft drinks, no wine, so you have to order wine from room service- although its not on the list- which closes at 11 p.m. ( this is very efficient by the way) A couple of times we came back just after midnight and the really nice Bar downstairs was closed so no night cap! The pillows were not good- 1 large hard one and a small lumpy one each. We didn't eat in the Hotel as we don't do breakfast and ate out every night. The hotel situation was perfect! The Prado was our primary aim. We spent nearly a whole day here- going out for lunch and returning.Ahough it was very crowded ( lots of school trips ), overall the children were very well behaved. This, other museums and Retiro park are just a short walk from the Hotel. The old Town was a 10 min walk up the hill. We took the staff advice and went to an area where there is a lovely square ( Santa Ana) with great atmosphere and some delightful bars and Restaurants. Also the Palacio Real and Cathedral was a few minutes taxi drive too. ( The queue was too long for the Palacio to wait- so we went in the Cathedral museum and up into the dome- at 6 E it was well worth it for the views along) The open top bus tour for 2.5 hrs was great value for money with a head set in English giving you the history and all main things worth seeing. You can get off and on when you like. We got off when we saw another square where it looked interesting and found a brilliant restaurant called La Cuevas- the place, food and service was amazing. Also worth seeing- in Santa Ana square is Restaurant Villa Rosa- where they offer 30 mins free flamenco 2 x a night. It seems a bit touristy when you go in ( fab historical setting though) and they try to get you to eat., bur we just had a few drinks ( the wine was not good quality!) and saw the show. It was well worth it- as the dancing was brilliant ( and we have seen a lot of flamenco in ours years of living here) All other venues visited had lovely quality food and wine and great service. Overall we would highly recommend the Hotel- ( and both of us with work have stayed in many Hotels all over the World) and wish we could have stayed longer. We may well go back as there is so much to see and do. We adore living in Spain and everywhere we go we have enjoyed and generally been treated very well, although it does help that we speak reasonable Spanish.

Lighting was a bit dark next to the closet/entry area, which was a shame since you could not use the mirror on the wall to apply makeup. Bathroom was also spacious, but bath tub could get very slippery and also there was no place to place the soap or personal shampoo bottles except on the floor. Staff at reception was friendly and helpful. Hotel location was convenient to metro station Atocha just across the street. From the aiport we took the #200/#204 bus for 1 euro to the bus station at Parque Avenidas. From there we took a taxi to the hotel and it costs us $19.50. The meter read $13.30 when we arrived but apparently there is a surcharge for luggage (we were 3 people with 3 small pieces of luggage) and also for evening rides (it was past 10 pm). On the way back, we took the metro at Atocha for 1 euro, connected at Pacifico to line 6, and went to the bus station at Parque Avenidas. From there we took the bus, again 200 or 204 depending on which terminal you are going to, for 1 euro and it took only 15-20 minutes. The hotel area is not exactly the best, but the location is convenient. We walked everywhere \u2013to the old town is about a 20-30 min walk, also around the corner starts the Paseo del Arte walk up to the fountains of Neptune and Cibeles and the Retiro Park is just 5 minutes away.

We had the breakfast buffet on our first morning and while it is pricey, it is a very good taste of many common Spanish foods like manchego cheese, jamon, chorizo, quince paste, tortilla, pan con tomate, local fruits, etc. Heck, if you like wine (red, white and cava) for breakfast, it's there for you to drink as part of the buffet (we stuck to the fresh squeezed orange juice and excellent cafe con leche). If you're not a brave eater, there's eggs and bacon, toast, cereal, yogurt and other common breakfast items. We really weren't hungry again until it was tapas time. There are many reasonably priced restaurants in the area. If you're an early bird during the weekend, you're probably going to need to find breakfast elsewhere (there's even a Starbucks around the corner that opens at 8 am if you don't feel comfortable at the local diner-type restaurants across the street) The hotel staff is fantastic and helpful.

HOTEL/CONCIERGE: The hotel itself looked new and modern, the common areas were great and there was a solarium on the highest floor, the hotel seemed to be good for business trips as well, I just think it wouldn't fit families traveling with kids, since it has no pool and not many options for children leisure. The concierge was able to help us at all times. STAFF/SERVICE: Room service was great, the staff was always ready to arrange tours and the service in general was impeccable. LOCATION: The location was the high point of the hotel, it faced the Reina Sofia Museum, where is Picasso's Guernica, and it also had many small restaurants around, as well as tour bus stop right on the corner. It was by the side of a large city park and museum so it's a cultural spot, if you're looking for sightseeing and some history it's a great and cheap option.

The room was a decent size in comparison to other European hotels, but small when compared to American and South East Asian hotel room sizes; at the end of the day, if all you want is somewhere to sleep, then this hotel is more then adequate. The room was immaculately clean, air conditioned, the bed was extremely comfortable and the in room facilities were excellent. I loved the fact that they provided dove cream shower wash and even a little sponge to shine your shoes. The staff could have been a bit friendlier, for the most part their attitude was indifferent, but in general Spanish people can come across as being that way, it's not that they are trying to be rude, it's just that they like to get straight to the point. However, I would suggest that you check the mini bar contents when you arrive as we left the seal on it and on the third day it had been opened, a can of peanuts had been eaten and the empty can had been put at the back of the fridge. We complained and were not charged for this. The area was a great base camp; we were within walking distance of Atocha mainline train station, Atocha metro station, Atocha Bus terminal and a Madrid tour bus stop. If you enjoy walking around a city then this hotel is also ideally located for walking to all the main sights and museums. In one day we were able to walk around and see all the sights, as well as stopping regularly for a coffee or a ca\u00f1a of beer or (my favorite) some churros con chocolate. For the best churros head to the Chocolater\u00eda San Gin\u00e9s, it's located on Pasadizo de San Gines, just off the Calle de Arenal near Plaza de la Puerta de Sol. It can be a bit hard to find at first but it is well worth it, you'll be back again and again! It's normally at it's busiest in the late evening and the early hours of the morning when people are heading home from a night out. We booked room only, I think that this is the best option as it would have been an extra \u00a315 each a night for breakfast and with so many wonderful caf\u00e9s around I would recommend going to one of these. I would highly recommend the Museo del Jam\u00f3n for breakfast; there is one around the corner on the Paseo del Prado and another one at the top of the road that the hotel is on. I was able to get a chiquito de jam\u00f3n (a small cured ham roll), a freshly squeezed orange juice and a coffee for only \u20ac2.40 to eat at the bar (generally things are cheaper if you eat at the bar). Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, I booked it through Hotelopia.co.uk for only \u00a3404 (including a 10% discount that I got buy doing an Internet search for a discount code) for 2 adults, for 8 night\u2019s room only. August is a bit of a low season in Madrid; this is because the average temperature is 38\u00b0C during the day, so the Madrile\u00f1os go on their holidays at this time of year.

'lastminute.com' had a great deal at this 4 star hotel, offering something like 40% off the usual price. The reviews we found for the hotel were good enough, so we thought 'why not?' We were not in the least disappointed either! The reviews had been very helpful: they suggested that we ask for a room not facing the street and the view as it could be noisy due to road traffic and people queueing for the night club on the street below. We followed this advice and we were extremely grateful! We arrived very late on Saturday night, we could see the crowds of people, and yet when we got to our room it was silent and wonderful! The room was a good size, the bathroom was excellent and it was all clean and very new it seemed. The only thing I would say is that if you like a firm bed (or something akin to sleeping on a slab of concrete!) then you'll love the bed - if not, be prepared for a few aches in the morning! We requested a cot for our son when we booked, and amazingly enough, it was there waiting in our room! (we've had experiences at other hotels where this is not the case). On our first morning, we ate breakfast in the hotel and while the buffet is very comprehensive with a mix of hot, cold and continental items, it was very pricey at 19Euros per person. There are at least 2 or 3 excellent restaurants/cafes accross the road literally where we had coffee and pastries for 16Euros all up! The location of the hotel is ideal for the botanic gardens the Prado Museum, the Retiro Park (which is huge and a fantastic place to take children!) and also the Reina Sofia art modern art museum. It is also very close to the Atocha metro. Also within a short walk is the place where the tour busses depart from (very useful for getting an overview of the city and its layout). It is also close to the major train station. Although the hotel advertises itself as being near Plaza Mayor, it is in fact about a 20 minute walk to the Plaza, but on a nice day, that wouldn't be so bad (the weather was a bit cold and showery for us unfortunately). The staff at the hotel were very friendly and in fact, as people traveling with a young child, pretty much most restaurants and cafes were happy to see a child! It helps though if you teach your little one to say 'hola' and 'adios' - gets plenty of smiles! Be aware though that if you are traveling with a child that needs a high chair (we can cope without these days if we have to) many eating places do not have them, despite what the guide books say!

I found the staff to be very helpful and my every request was met in short order and with a pleasant manner. There are two fine examples of this. When I first showed up after an overnight transAtlantic flight, I was a few hours early for check-in. The manager took personal care of setting me up to have a coffee in the restaurant while waiting for my room, despite it being closed to those not having pre-booked breakfasts. He then went about having a room made ready within half an hour. While the second example will seem an odd compliment, I tell it anyway because of the pleasant way I was treated. On my last day, I called reception and asked them to confirm my flight to Barcelona and order me a taxi for the following morning. I was advised it would be taken care of right away. When I still had not heard back 2 hours later, I called down again to enquire. However, the person I spoke to the second time, did not have as good English as the first. She told me that the hotel could not/did not do that and I would have to use the internet to check my flight. Most confused by this, I went to the lobby to use the internet. Fortunately, I managed to speak with my first contact, who most pleasantly advised that everything had been taken care of . Near as I could tell, the second person knew that they had already confirmed once and that was why she was telling me to use the internet. While it is true, that the miscommunication could easily have been avoided had the front desk called me to tell me all was in order, I still felt it was handled well and most of the confusion was mine. And for what it's worth, the bellboy always greeted me with a smile as well as most efficient handling my bags both on the way in and on the way out. I mention this because this was not the case anywhere else we stayed. The breakfasts were incredible and not to be beat anywhere on the rest of our trip around Spain. I wouldn't hesitate to take the breakfast package again. I never needed to worry about lunch. Though one could probably save a little money eating breakfast elsewhere, there's not chance that it could be better value. The hotel is more modern and trendy than I'd initially wanted for my Madrid experience, but later in the trip, we spent 3 days at the Palacio San Martin, near the Opera house and that satisfied my desire for a more elaborate room in keeping with the historic. My room at the Paseo was on a side street with no view of note. However, it was very quiet and that's just what I requested and needed. I never even heard any other guests. I went up to the sundeck (well, during my time there it was the rain deck) and gym, to take some great shots of what can be seen from the top front of the hotel. While the Paseo is not located near the Plaza Mayor nor Plaza del Sol, where there is so much more energy, it is very well situated for the Prado and Retiro Park. I regret that the weather did not allow for me to enjoy the walking about. A metro station is just up the street (or at Atocha) and I bought a 10 ride card for $5 Euros (half the price of buying single rides). Having met up with my travel companion in Barcelona and once back in Madrid, we both made good use of the card. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Paseo again. I had a most pleasant experience with the staff and find it surprising that others did not have the same. A small bonus was an actual double bed, instead of the usual offering of two twins shoved together. All that said, I would probably split my time again between staying at the Paseo and another hotel closer to the action up at Plaza Mayor/Plaza del Sol.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cBest breakfast I have ever had and lovely overall\u201d", "Author": "AndrewAustralian", "ReviewID": "UR7795910", "Content": "My travel agent got me this place for around 100 Euros a night, bed and breakfast, for 2.

Found a great Irish Bar near Plays Sol where we went to end our evenings. Served a very very large G&T for 5 Euros!!!! Can definitely recommend doing the open top tour on the bus, especially the historical one. There are some amazing buildings in Madrid. It cost E15.30 for a one-day pass and E20 Euros for a 2 day pass. We bought our tickets from the hotel reception. Didn't enjoy the modern one quite so much but we did get to see Real madrid's stadium (which I found quite ugly from the outside actually). The only annoying thing was everytime we sat down to eat we were surrounded by street musicians who then promptly shoved a hand in front of you for money. Think they soon got the message to move on. Had a fantastic time and hopefully will return in the near future.

Was very impressed with the hotel and all Madrid had to offer. From the airport it took about 30 minutes on the Metro to the hotel. Checked in at noon with no problems at all. Booked holiday through Travel Republic and would definately use again. The hotel was modern and very clean, and the buffet breakfast had a great selection. The hotel is located about twenty minute stroll from the Sol area, where most of the shops are. From the hotel its a ten minute walk to the Plaza Mayor where there are some very nice Spanish restaurants. There are two nearby Metro stations, Atocha which is about four minutes away across a busy road, or Anton Martin which is a bit further away, but on the same street (Calle de Atocha). Getting round Madrid is a breeze with the a ticket costing 1 europer trip. Visited the Prado Museum which was 6 euros and a great way to spend a couple of hours (and only minutes from the hotel), and The Royal Palace, which was free to EU citizens on a Wednesday with your passport. Both highly recommended. Just one negative, a Thai restaurant called Thai Pad, on Pase Del Prado. If you like your food tough, and badly served, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, it was a superb trip. To leave a waterlogged Luton on a Monday morning, and return 3 days later with a tan is always a good result.", "Date": "June 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHappy with our stay - lived up to expectations\u201d", "Author": "Julie032", "ReviewID": "UR7697310", "Content": "Our room was 305, a small non-smoking room which overlooked a side street.

Don't let this comment play into your decision. If I'm not mistaken, they are referring to a place that is several blocks up the street, across from the Tryp Atocha (where we stayed at the end of our trip).

Overall it was OK, the rooms were fine, recently decorated and the reception area was modern , the overall effect however, was a cheap attempt to look modern/trendy. What I really wasn't happy about was the lack of friendliness and downright indifference of the staff. They really made no effort whatsoever to be helpful or welcoming or even to interact in any way with us. I was also disappointed with the location which while central enough, was on a very unattractive main street and a few steps away from a live sex show theatre (the only one that we saw while in madrid) which made for a slightly uncomfortable walk home in the evenings. This hotel wasn't cheap and I really didn't think it was worth it.

The location of the hotel was right in the heart of the art district within 5 minutes walking distance from the Prado, Thyssen and Reina sofia museums.

There are a number of 4 and 5 star hotels. This was a 4 star hotel. But as they were part of a chain of hotels I found them very professional and hospitable. It is located very conveniently near most attractions in Madrid. 3 museums (Prado, Thyssen and Rene Sofia) were located within walking distance. There is a Metro station (Atocha) just around the corner (1 minute away) which will bring you basically everywhere. The hotel itself is located in a busy street. There are numerous shops opposite and a number of Tapas eateries. There are always a lot of people on that street loitering around but it always felt safe. The rooms were of good size and the bathrooms were clean and had good showers. The rooms were cleaned everyday. There was an electronic safe in the room which is very handy. The hotel had flat screen TV in the room but only a limited selection of English channels (mainly news channels like Sky and CNN). We had no problems with air conditioning and had a pleasant sleep. There were no coffee/tea provided in the room. The breakfast was a large spread. It could get very busy but there was always space available. The staff could understand English and were very helpful. They were able to recommend places to visit, give directions and even recommend and book a Flamenco performance for us (with a group with which I believe they were affiliated with). Overall this was a very professional hotel. It is rated as 4 stars and I would agree. Probably one of the only so called 4 star hotels that actually compare to what I perceive to be 4 starred. The price was very reasonable and in a similar range to other so called 4 star hotels.
