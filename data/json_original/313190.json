This was my third trip to Rome and this was the best hotel. There were two people at the reception and both of them were friendly. This is not always the case, when talking about hotels in Rome...! For some odd reason we were pretty demanding and had to call the reception several times, asking for different things. They provided them each time, without any waiting. Our room was really clean and the sheets were changed everyday. The were plenty of choices at breakfast, which is also not always the case, in italian hotels. There's a metro station close to the hotel, so it's easy to get around. Also a supermarket and a decent restaurant can be found near by. There's an bar/restaurant right next to the hotel. We never ate there, but it was packed with people, so I'm guessin' the food has to be good.

The only things I would change about it are that sometimes the staff were not so friendly (it could be the language barrier), and it was not near the city center. However, it really was just a short walk from the Piramide metro station, and the neighborhood, while being described as \"up and coming\" or whatever else they call it, was safe. I was a bit wary of staying here after reading all the reviews and descriptions of this area being \"up and coming\" or \"renewed\", because in Austin, the areas that are described as such are still unsafe and not very nice. We were pleasantly surprised. There is graffiti everywhere, on all the buildings, so it gives the image of being much more dangerous and gritty than it actually is. But the people around were kind and we never felt unsafe. Also, a cab ride to Trastevere (and great restaurants there) is only maybe 7 to 10 Euros, which was great. The staff were nice, and always answered our questions, but sometimes we felt as if we were bothering them. It may have been because we don't really speak Italian, and only English. Still, the customer service was good. Our room at Abitart was spectacular. We had the clouds/sky suite (room 504), with a private balcony, huge bathroom, and large, comfortable room. The artwork in the room was beautiful, and the furniture and lighting just added to the ambiance. We had no idea we were going to get a room like this, as we booked a \"superior double\" and not a \"junior suite\", but maybe we were upgraded? Either way, it was amazing. My only complaint about the room was that it was dark at night, since there was no direct overhead lighting available in the bedroom area. Some pluses include a digital \"Do Not Disturb\" button, door lock button, large bathroom with beautiful blue tiles, big LCD flatscreen TV, and good dark curtains in case we wanted to sleep in. The breakfast at the hotel was nothing great, but it was free and did the job in the mornings. The eggs were tasty, although they were usually cold or had just run out. Stick to the mini pastries or bread with salami and cheese, juices, cereals, yogurt, and tea/coffee. All in all, we were pleasantly surprised by this hotel and its decor and comfort. If I ever return to Rome, I will definitely be staying here again. It was an excellent value for the money, and it was great to escape the tourists to a quiet, beautiful refuge in Ostiense.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "HK", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it...Need some renovation\u201d", "Author": "SmartTravellerHK", "ReviewID": "UR79452480", "Content": "Hotel definitely not hip.

We did not use taxis and were able to walk from the Coliseum to Spanish Steps etc. Breakfast was simple, but exactly what we like ... good strong coffee, cereal, yogurt and dolce. The Ostiense train station is the closest when coming from Rome airport. When you exit the train station, head to the left and go down the street (bit of sloping street going down and I don't know the name). At the bottom of the street, turn left and go under the overpass. At the next light you will see the Abitart across the street and a bit to your left. Not hard to find.

Being Italian this was easier for them - other people just got turned away. FINALLY, we were offered 2 rooms in a hotel in another part of Rome, and a dinner on the house (for 6 of us). The hotel we were sent to - River Chateau in Flaminio area - turned out to be very nice so in the end we got an OK deal. At the time it wasn't amusing and I'm sure we only got this because we mentioned the word 'avvocato'. Again, perhaps the fact the hotel knew that we were Italian meant that we could actually put our money where our mouths were. It's a shame we didn't get to stay there.
