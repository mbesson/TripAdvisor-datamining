{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Bespoke service at the Regency Just returned from a two night stay in the Regency. What a pleasure it was - from our first meeting with the concierge, to staff advice on how to get to the airport when we left, our 48 hours there were a delight. We stayed in one of the smaller rooms, overlooking the front of the hotel and the park. The queen size bed was very comfortable, and the antique table and chairs were a nice touch. The marble bathroom had a fantastic monsoon shower plus bath, both of which were much appreciated after long days wandering around the sights of Florence. The turndown service was especially appreciated after nights out with friends - coming back to the bedroom bathed in gentle golden light, slippers laid out on each side of the bed and a card telling us the expected weather the next day were lovely additional touches. We thoroughly enjoyed using the lounges on the ground floor for super relaxing drinks before heading out for dinner - the local white wine was truly delicious! The hotal's location is pretty much perfect - it's located on a quiet square in a residential area, so it's quiet and a peaceful place to relax away from the crowds. However, it's only about ten minutes' walk from the Accademia, and maybe 15 minutes walk from the Duomo/Piazza Repubblicca etc., so provides the best of both worlds. The Regency isn't cheap - especially with today's euro/GBP exchange rate - but it is excellent value. If you can stretch to it, it's a romantic and intimate base from which to explore this beautiful city.", "Date": "Dec 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR699155961", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "angelesque13"}, {"Content": "Quaint and Intimate in Florence The Regency is a small, charming hotel.

Breakfast in the dining room (overlooking a lovely jewel box sized garden with outdoor seating) is very nice. If you are looking for an upscale, intimate hotel experience, this is the place for you.

We received a very warm welcome as soon as we arrived and our room and its amenities were super (Room #405). The room was comfortable and had three small balconies that overlooked the park. The bathroom was big with nice toiletries (which were freshened daily), fluffy towels, and excellent water pressure. We enjoyed drinks in the garden courtyard and also had an excellent dinner at the hotel. Breakfast was fine and morning room service for coffee was always right on time and excellent.The concierge(s) were top notch and provided excellent restuarant reommendations (don't miss Leo's!) and private tours with the Mercurial group (excellent and small groups). Although the hotel was a slight walk from the downtown sights, it only took us at most ten minutes and the traffic was fine.The only possible negative, and it's hardly a complaint, is to separate the key pick up/drop off from the Concierge desk.

They were extremely kind, handled any request with poise, and provided thoughtful recommendations and reservations at a wide range of restaurants depending upon our mood.
