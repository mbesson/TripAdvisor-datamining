The standard of our room and the quality of the buffet breakfasts were still high. The rooms are clean and quite spacious and still the most comfortable of beds. The staff were polite and helpful, we had free WIFI in the room and breakfast was included in our room charge. My only criticism would be the shopping mall on the lower floor of the building. It was rather gloomy, rundown and most uninviting, though I understand this is not a hotel management responsibility. Definitely an update needed here. We did see some 'ladies of the night' hanging around down there, we were not bothered by them but it was just a bit 'sleazy'. The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station which connects several of the lines. We used the MRT quite a bit this time - it was hassle-free, cheap and by far the easiest way to get around Singapore.Take a short ride to Chinatown, just a couple of stops and enjoy a large bottle of icy cold Tiger Beer for S$5.90. There are also plenty of bargains and places to eat too. A pleasant walk up Orchard Road takes you to more shopping malls and eateries than you can imagine. The Concorde is close enough for quick access to the shops but far enough away to be out of the huste and bustle. We visited Little India - a very interesting experience and Arab Street where you can buy the most beautiful fabrics - I have never seen such a variety of colours,patterns and types of fabric - if you like to make your own clothes don't miss Arab Street. There were also many shops selling scarves, clothes and some amazing carpets - most places will ship your carpet home for you. Must-dos include the Night Safari and Sentosa Island. We decided to spend the S$68 each for Universal Studios and enjoyed every minute - the Transformers ride is a must!

They have recently introduced included wi-fi which was a deciding factor in our decision to stay here - it was however slow and not always reliable. The location was good, near the south end of Orchard Road, very close to Plaza Singapura, which provides a good cross section of Singapore shopping and many eating options. After being in Malaysia for two weeks, we particularly enjoyed Carl's Junior (bottomless soft drinks, which is rare in Singapore) and look forward to its arrival in Australia! The hotel is very close to Fort Channing, which includes a substantial park with nice walking paths. If visited early or late it is good for running with no effect from car fumes. From Fort Channing it is also a nice uninterrupted walk or run down a path beside the river to explore the Clarke Quay and Marina Bay areas. There was a free coach shuttle to Universal Studios available from the hotel but is for tourists only so you need to carry your passport - alternatively the taxi was SGD12 or less. One substantial negative to the hotel is the entry and exit points by foot - you need to go down below the lobby by either one or two levels and through what the hotel describes as a shopping mall to get out to Orchard Road. The mall area is tatty, grubby, deserted and smelly and not a pleasant experience - it would be far nice to be able to directly exit the lobby but the design of the hotel does not allow this. Some reviews say that some refurbishment has taken place but our (entry level) room, although nice, had not been refurbished and was quite dated. We had a new flat screen TV with quite a few channels but reception was poor compared to the digital quality to which we are accustomed. As well as the standard international news and local channels, four mainly movie channels were provided but the movies were mostly by no means new releases. The room had a good desk area. The room's window overlooked a very large park-like area which has a high fence and warning signs involving guards with guns prohibiting access - we found out that it is a Presidential Palace, which opens to the public occasionally. The room had good sound proofing and double glazed windows and very effective air conditioning. The people at reception were fine but we were given the standard 'up-sell' which I thought was unnecessary. The concierge Robert, was good in that he happily stored our cases before check in and after check out.

There is something that I need to bring up which is the downside of this hotel. I suspect there are a number of night clubs in the shopping centre right below the property. At night, I wanted to walk around and get a light dinner. I was quite taken by surprise to see a few ladies dressed promicuously waiting around the elevators at Level 1.

There's also a supermarket a few minutes away and a food court downstairs. The pool area was pretty shabby, not inviting.

To qualify, I had just spent the day flying from Adelaide SA, to Melbourne VIC, and then a seven and a half hour direct flight to Singapore arriving just before midnight, Singapore time. Add to this some fairly serious medications (prescribed) and I think I was looking for something/someone to criticise. Well I found it. That \"something\" was the state of the room and the lack of attention to cleanliness - or so I thought! The next morning after a good night's sleep and a more thorough inspection of the room I realised the room wasn't too bad at all. Everything was clean - except the old stains on the carpet which really weren't that bad. Everything else was fine and dandy - clean crockery (ie two coffee cups and six water tumblers), cutlery (ie tea spoon), bathroom and bedroom/sitting room. The Concorde does not have any rooms with balconies. Although our room faced onto the always busy Orchard Road we did not have any traffic noise issues thanks to the double glazing on the rather large window. Don't know about you but I rather like watching humanity pass me by in the plethora of vehicles available to the Singaporeans. The food available in \"Spices\" (third floor of the hotel) was very acceptable. Breakfast was provided daily between 6:00 am to 10:30 am and catered for most nationalities' idiosyncratic tastes. I say most - don't expect Vegemite to be seen anywhere at any of the sittings. We tried out their dinner special of seafood platter with lobster for SD$45 ++. The seafood was superb. My only criticism is the lobster meat, or lack thereof. The portion was so small. Two small mouthfus and it was gone. Also, chef could have been less heavy handed with the bread crumbs on the lobster. Now for the reason I did not give this rating a straight five. I had noticed that when we had our ritualistic cup of morning coffee and put the empty coffee cups on the bathroom bench the cups would attract minute ants - and lots of them - to the bench and used coffee cups. In order to stop this home invasion each morning I developed a strategy whereby I would rinse out the cups after each use and place them upside down on a clean, dry face washing towel. Please note no detergent was provided in the apartment for the purpose of household cleaning. The strategy worked and I patted myself on the back. On returning to the room after a stroll one morning the cleaning staff had been through the room and achieving their usual high standard of cleanliness - or so I thought. There, still in the same positions as I had left them were the used and still stained coffee cups. The staff had completely overlooked the fact that the cups needed cleaning with detergent. Alas, that was not all that had been overlooked. He/she had not bothered to return one of the pillows to the bed. The pillow had been left on the floor to contemplate its own navel. Obviously a hurried phone call was made to Room Service. Within a couple of minutes the Room Service Manager, none the less, was standing at the door enquiring as to the nature of my complaint. I showed him the stained coffee cups and the depressed looking pillow. He informed me that a cleaner would be despatched to our room to conduct a full cleaning regimen. This was duly accomplished in a precise and detailed manner. Apart from the aforementioned lack of concentration regarding cleaning of the coffee cups, my family and I have agreed that should we ever find ourselves in Singapore in the future we would like to stay at the Concorde Hotel.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cSurprise\u201d", "Author": "chopeta", "ReviewID": "UR125215077", "Content": "Don't be deceived, from outside the hotel looks ordinary & un-appealing maybe due to the stores at the hote's basement.

The reception was holding us for 5 minutes and checking with the night DM about the registration from us with the absence of passport from my finace. After the 'MONKEY\"way of discussion in front of us (which i do not think they should do it in front of the guest ), that is when the female night manager (Aliza or something, cant really remember the name ) approaching us with an arrogant face telling that its a rule and regulation to have both passport of ID to be present. I should have agree if she told me in a manner way, but along our conversation she was showing her rude tone and the way she looked at me was extremely disrespectful at all!! ( guess because i was wearing my party dress n ran to a hotel in the mid of the night? ). But is this how your staff treat the walk-in guest, or depend on what they wearing..?So i suggested that i would like to check-in first without my fiance since i have the ID and most important i was not feeling well ! And my fiance will pay for me everything before he going down to take his passport from our car as we had parked it quite far away. But the night DM was rejecting and said NO right away. Frankly, i was working in hotel industry before,and it is no way that there is no third party payment for the hotel room...its ridiculous. And i did told this lady and ensure that my fiance is not going to check-in till he got his passport back in a short while but i need to go in the room first as i did have my ID with me, and most important i was really not feeling well!! .What is wrong with this DUTY MANAGER?? All she did was with her sinister smile and said: NO. My fiance was very angry and i hold him back behind to comfort him, but just when we about to approach them again to compromise them, the night DM was raising her voice and yell: \"hey, whatever u both discuss, i already know your motive, no matter what i need both your id TOGETHER and check-in TOGETHER !Or else, sorry !! \". OMG, is this how a manager rendered services or even solving a guest problem..??? I was quite shameful at that time as all the staff looking at us but this night DM just showing her SINISTER face and said..\"I know your motive. so dont try to do anything\". Dear night DM, my motive is to check-in first since i have my id and i am not feeling well, but my fiance will only check-in after he bring his ID from the car ! At last, i have to wait alone in the lobby for 15 minute for my fiance in order to get in to the room first. May i know what is the difference of me check-in first with my ID..??

I decided to stay there, because I do really know the quality of Concorde, as we stayed sometime at some concorde hotels, and since I was traveling alone, I should stay somewhere that I could trust. Anyway, it came to my surprise that everything was not the same as I thought. The location of the hotel is quite shocky, as lots of little shops on the ground floor, and I had to pass by dark isle if I had to go out from the hotel to Orchard Rd. When I came, the reception, greeted and assisted by a very nice Japanese girl, very polite, however it took her ages to check me in. When I paid my deposit by cash, I made a mistake, because it took me longer than normal one. Since it seemed that she did not get use with the sequence or something, she asked her supervisor/manager (the man in the suit), to help, but it seemed that he was a bit \"i am too busy - DND\" I have noted that I requested for smoking room, then he rudely told me that, \"i give you smoking room, but you have to smoke at the balcony\" Well, I just ignored his arrogance, I just need to rest because I just had long flight. So, someone escorted me to the room, which is thousand miles from the elevator, exactly at the corner of the corridor. When I came inside, the room was old, and the balcony that he mentioned, was a dirty outdoor space, with a very \"nice view\" and not to mentioned a very tricky-almost impossible to open - sliding glass door. Again, I just ignored it. At the bath room, it was time to soak myself to the tub, but I cancelled that, since the tub look a bit moldy at the edge, and when I looked up the ceiling, it was rotten! Anyway, i had a great sleep, because I was super tired. At the breakfast, they were super extremely feeling busy, so, you may a bit invisible for them. The only two-thumbs-up that I should give was to the very super charming man, I guess he is the bell captain, who always assisted me with the taxi and last the luggage. He even selected me with a very \"proper - looking - driver\" since I was alone. Last but not least, the check out time, I had to (again) wait long because (again) there was unknown problem. However, I just pleased my self, because I could meet my cousins and partner after almost a year, and we were so happy to move to Sheraton Hotel.

Reception staff member on duty was a little cold to start with and it took some time to get checked in, even though I had given exactly the same details at the booking office at Singapore airport. 40 minutes wait with two phone calls to reception for my luggage to arrive and yet the hotel seemed very quiet. I booked a deluxe (?) room, above the normal standard anyway. The room was a reasonably good size with all the normal equipment and comforts that a 4 star hotel should offer. Cleanlness was of a good standard in the room, even the aircon/extraction vents looked clean which is often overlooked by cleaning staff and management alike. The room looked out onto the hotel pool which I didn't use, but it looked perfectly adequate and clean. Balcony was dirty and hadn't been cleaned for a long time. The flower/plant beds which are part of the balcony wall, could do with livening up with a bit of colour and cigarette ends should be removed. The bed was was very comfortable, possibly one of the most comfortable I have slept in for a very long time. 2 bottles of complimentary water were a refreshing change to the often extortionate price that hotels charge. Free standard tea and coffee was also a nice touch. The bathroom was simply unacceptable. It was very small, there was rust around the vanity mirror and mould all around the bath wall. The sealant between the bath and wall had been renewed several times in places (Message to the management .Next time a bath is leaking into the room below, remove all of the sealant and start again, don't patch it up. It looks visually bad and is a waste of time). The mould also (obviously) makes the bathroom smell. The extraction fan was broken, which, once repaired, must surely be the best remedy for a mouldy bathroom. Breakfast was acceptable with a constant supply of coffee and tea being offered by pleasant waiting staff and a charming breakfast chef, who took time to explain some of the dishes aswell as asking how I was enjoying my stay (reception staff take note regarding customer interaction) The concierge service was adequate, if a little vague at times, but pleasant at the same time. I managed to get more information from the enthusiastic bellboy.Shame about the delay in luggage delivery and collection. Location was excellent. Someone was moaning about a lack of access to Orchard road on one of the earlier posts. Take the lift from the reception, cross the corridor at the bottom and you are on Orchard road.

These individuals made me feel welcomed and were genuinely interested in how my day in Singapore went. Dislikes Staff maning the reception was cold. After making eye contact with me and after I had informed him I was checking in, the next word he uttered was passport. Not attempt at small talk, no asking how my flight was, no asking if i needed help with my luggage. Could tell from his tone and body language that I was another customer he had to serve which he wanted to get through ASAP. (I was the only customer checking in at that time) Noticed that the premier lounge was located at the ground level. If i was a guest at the premier floor, would have hated going all the way to the ground level to access the lounge As already mentioned by other guest, there is no direct access to orchard road.

I rang the front desk and asked where they expected my daughter to sleep (i was willing to accept the two single beds for my husband and i) i was advised that we had booked a twin room and therefore the two single beds. As my secretary had made the booking i was willing to sort of accept this mistake, however it was clear in our booking details that there were 2 adults and 1 child.......again i asked where my daughter was expected to sleep, the response was well we can send up another bed but that will be $50US per night extra....WHAT!!! 3 people were booked into the room at the advertised rate and only 2 beds were provided!!! After much discussion regarding the extra bed...I asked for a fourth time (after refusing to pay extra for the bed) where was i supposed to put my daughter to bed at which point i received the curt reply \"wherever you want to\".

And most annoying is the strong smoke odor. The clean lady gave fragrance spray, but the smell is still strong. We then called to the reception, ask for room change, to a better room. They said, it will be possible. However, the second room (4th floor, facing Orchard road, the east wing) was worse! The smell was like damped and wet cloth, humid. It might be from the old carpet they have. The smell is intolerant. Another clean lady said that they will put like an air-refresher machine for half an hour and the smell will be gone. We gave it a try. When we came back after a walk at about 3pm. The smell was still there. Nothing changes. So we called in to the reception again to ask for a room change, or at least air refresher with fragrance. After calling again and again, and waiting for 30 minutes, a Chinese lady who can not speak English came to the room and spray here and there. But of course it doesn't affect anything. To add on that, the attitude of the reception staff were not helpful and instead disrespectful in attending to our request just for a decent room. After the complain, all they care is just sending a housekeeping who can't even speak English, so we couldn't even communicate there. The reception say it's not their job to go to the room and to see how the room is not proper. We called to the reception, ask for room change. They said the room was full. I told them the room just opposite us is empty. And they say, it's booked and all the reasons. She said she will get a room for us. And I told them we could wait till 7pm, before we are going out for dinner. We wait, wait, and wait. No news, very professional. it's just when we came back from dinner, at about 9.30 pm there is a message saying that there's a room available for us. It's 12 hours after we checked in and they have a (may-be) proper room! I directly called them saying that it's too late for a change already. At about 10.30 pm there still a paper message slipped to our room saying that there's a room available (timed 9.32pm). It shows lack of coordination internal the hotel. Also, they said there will be concierge helping us with our luggage from the first to the second room. We waited for 15 minutes, and ended up with dragging by ourselves all our luggage.

This is downtown along the busy Orchard Rd., so do expect some noise. However, if it's really a concern, then just request a quiet room upon making your booking like I did, and all will be just fine. Regarding the entrance to the lobby for pedestrians. Yes, it can be a bit strange to be walking past the karaoke bars and massage outlets, but it's not as dodgy as some make it sound as everyone is very friendly. I did get to peek into other rooms, and noticed that mine was one of the ones that hadn't been renovated yet, but it's still all good. The room was a little dated in its decor, but spacious, comfortable, and clean. And at the bargain deal I got on my room, I really can't complain. The best part however, is the location. There are excellent malls and restaurants very nearby so you really don't need to be in the heart of it. For eats, there's the top floor food court at the 313 mall across the road, or an abundance of other types of restaurants to satisfy your gastronomic desires....just a bit expensive, which is expected for anything along Orchard Rd. However, if you're on a budget, you can save by eating really really cheaply at the Singtel building food court just a stones throw away....where on earth can you still get a bowl of noodles for less than S$2.50 anywhere near Orchard Rd. these days?!.....Yea,the Singtel food court!!!...Just make sure you go before 11.30am to beat the office crowd! Too bad it's only open at lunch times though. There were times when I just wanted to get a light dinner at the hotel's main restaurant, but there was always a long line, or I overheard the host asking if the guest had a reservation? I guess this was Christmas time and people were packing in for the holiday buffets. Hopefully it's not like this all year round. I ended up eating at the hotel's Japanese restaurant, which wasn't bad, just quite pricey. The other convenient thing about being so close to the 313 mall is that the Somerset MRT is located at the back, which you can access through the mall too. So getting anywhere is a breeze. The gym was pretty good sized and well equipped, although the equipment's a bit dated, it's all useable for a good work out. The pool was nice, peaceful, and a good size for decent swimming and tanning. The only gripe I may have is that the daily internet rates are a bit high at S$0.85 an hour or a maxumum of S$24 a day. Thank goodness I happened to venture into the new Mandarin Gallery mall at the Meritus Mandarin Hotel close by. It's a nice cozy mall with nice shops, comfortable public sitting areas, AND with actual no password required FREE wifi!!! However, I'm not sure if this is temporary till the whole mall is fully operational though.

Our room was spacious, furnitre modern, clean and bed very comfortable. And ofcourse the location of this hotel is unbeatable! You are right on Orchard road which is very convenient for shopping and you're close to two bus/hop-on stations which was also perfect.

However, there are so many let down points that I was left thinking 'why not go elsewhere?'. So I did. After an awfully tiresome dispute with the rude staff, I moved to the Elizabeth Hotel just down the road- exceptional value by the way, but lets get back to The Concorde. Don't be sucked in by the hotel's boasts of a central location as there are loads of better hotels for the same money all along Orchard Road. I booked for a weeks stay and wasn't advised that they were undergoing extensive renovations and therefore there would disruptions to normal service. A minor problem, but a niggle nevertheless as it became the standard excuse for all their shortcomings. I went to great lengths to establish that the rooms had a WI FI capacity and was assured that they did (this is essential as I need it to Skype my contacts back home in privacy and comfort- something I explained and something which can't be done in the lobby). Mine didn't. It was late evening when I discovered this and so I telephoned the number for the Business Centre downstairs only to be informed that internet access is limited and can be accessed AT GREAT COST and via an ethernet cable (they wanted around $40 singapore dollars for a hi speed connection per day! This was irrelevant as I had an iphone, not a laptop; a fact that the receptionist was aware of). I resolved to take this up with reception in the morning, along with a list of other things that I had been misinformed about. These were: the fact that i'd booked a smoking room but in actual fact, the hotel has a no smoking policy; my 'double' room was actually two single beds and the housekeeping standards left a lot to be desired- was I actually paying four-star prices for this circus?! The following morning and after a disappointing breakfast buffet, I went to reception to speak to the lovely lady who had given such a gross misrepresentation of my dingy room when I booked in the day before. Having worked in the service industry myself, I took great care not to be confrontational or rude, so instead I calmly laid out my issues. I thought there would at least be a basic level of customer service. Wrong. Her plastic smile quickly morphed into what must surely have been the devil incarnate and she went from unhelpful and obtuse to just plain hostile. She began raising her voice and shouting over the top of me, proclaiming her innocence and admonishing me for not having checked the room first (I had a quick scan behind me to see if there was a dog in the room, but no, she was actually talking to me). I'm sorry, but i didn't realize that we weren't supposed to trust the word of hotel receptionists now days! The real trouble came when I asked her to either relocate me to a better room or upgrade me or discount my bill (at least offer some compensation to an unhappy customer). Her perfect english had vanished and could now fail to even qualify as pidgin english as she began a shameless and ignorant display of surly behavior, akin to the worst teenage strop one could imagine- she even turned her back and walked away as I was trying to remonstrate with her! That has to be the worst customer service I've ever seen and I was made to feel utterly embarrassed. At least I think that was her intention- instead I''d say I was left bemused by it all. Needless to say that i checked out there and then. If you want a cheaper yet far superior room and hotel, go to the Elizabeth.

From the hotel, you won't mind walking about 600m to the nearest MRT station (Dhoby Ghaut) because of the wide and clean road. Aside from what you see on travel guides, you shouldn't miss the Singapore Flyer, Creatures of the Night Show at the Night Safari, Songs of the Sea at the Sentosa, Eating time of the Polar Bear, and the Splash Show at Singapore Zoo. We took a Mercedes Benz cab, from the hotel towards Singapore Zoo for about SGD40 and rode back on an ordinary blue Comfort cab for about SGD20. Also, don't forget to redeem your 7% Goods and Services Tax at the airport on your way back home. For every SGD100 or more of your purchases, ask a GST invoice from your merchant and present it to the Customs official at the airport, together with the purchased item. We were able to redeem about SGD100 for a purchased Laptop. In totality, the Singaporeans are courteous and environment-friendly people.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moffat, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA bit tired, great service, good location - great value for money\u201d", "Author": "tartanryan", "ReviewID": "UR30147109", "Content": "Visited Concorde Singapore for 3 nights for a stop-off on my way back to the UK. Booked through expedia who were offering a good deal for 3 night stays. The hotel has recently changed it's name but used to be Le Meridian, Singapore. The new owners appear to me on a mission to improve standards across the board. The hotel is access from Orchard Rd through a shopping centre which is a bit tired and down market and the lift used to access the hotel starts you worrying as it's pretty grim but panic not, once you reach the lobby, the hotel recovers just fine. It's worth a few pounds extra to upgrade to an executive room which gives you a complimentary breakfast and access to the executive lounge. Check-in was very good with an excellent explanation of hotel facilities, dining etc. The member of staff was very friendly and welcoming. The room was good with loads of space. The bathroom was huge! Only negatives were a poor shower fitting (not good for anyone above 5.5ft) and some dated equipment and fittings. There was also limited storage space and hangers in the wardrope. The executive lounge was great and the lounge hosts were extremely friendly and attentive (special mention to Bernadette who is a star!!). Each evening complimentary snacks, cocktails, beers, wine & spirits were provided. There is also a PC with internet access in the lounge for guest use. Well worth the upgrade. Use the gym which is well equipped but very tired. I put this on the comment card when I checked out and was surprised to receive a letter when I was back in the UK from the general manager of the hotel advising the gym is to be refurbished in the next quarter so this hotel does take the time to listen and respond to guests. Breakfast in the main restaurant is also good but be prepared to wait to be seated at the busiest times as this hotel seems to be used by tour groups who tend to eat at the same time. Would definitely recommend and will return when I am next in Singapore. This hotel is only going to improve with the present management & owners.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cChoose somewhere else!!\u201d", "Author": "JenB78", "ReviewID": "UR30111506", "Content": "Concorde was a big disappointment! We stayed in deluxe interconnecting rooms - (not as yet updated) with our three teenage children. Apart from restaurant everything is dated and tired. Staff (except in restaurant) were not particularly interested in helping or ensuring your stay was a good one. Room was spacious but very tired - carpet needs updating, furnishings are very dated and shabby. Bathroom was not particularly clean with the last guest's hair still in the sink and bath- was not a good start. Requests to staff at reception were ignored - and I wouldn't say we were particularly demanding travellers. Breakfast was also a disappointment - dishes often empty and not refilled quickly, soggy items, bacon blackened 3 mornings running, juices and fruit uninviting. All rooms our situated around a central \"courtyard\" - so any noise from the reception area comes straight up to your room - we were woken on the first morning by squealing children waiting downstairs. Location on Orchard Rd is good and only a short walk to train station, bus stop is at front of hotel and tourist info centre is a block down Orchard Rd. However, to get from street level to your room means a flight of stairs, a lift to lobby level, then change to another lift to get to room level - this does get a bit of a pain and not all the lifts were working so it sometimes took up to 10 minutes to get from Orchard Rd to your room.

I've seen a lot better and for the price that you pay, you'd expect a lot more. Not good value.

My Husband and I stayed at this Hotel in February this year, and we were both very impressed with the facilities and with the upgrade that we received upon booking in. We stayed on the 9th floor, and had a beautiful room, which has apparently recently been refurbished. There were robes and slippers for us to use, iron and ironing board, jug, mini fridge, an umbrella of all things, and being given the upgrade, free use of their Executive Lounge daily. We could have tea/coffee/soft drinks/cookies, water/ use their laptops, have cocktails and nibblies every night, which we never did get to, as there was too much else to do. We paid for the breakfast to be included in our price of the room, and it was certainly worth it. There was enough food there to sink a ship, and you really didn't need lunch at all.The staff were super friendly every morning, and the service was spot on. You could choose a hot breakfast - eggs, bacon, sausage, croissants, pancakes,waffles,toast, baked beans, cereal, juice, tea/cofffee, and an assortment of other food which I never did get around to eating. One morning I had a coughing fit, and I was instantly handed a glass of water and a handful of serviettes from two of the staff. In Australia, they would just watch you choke!!!! The pool was to die for. I usually spent some time every day doing laps. The plan was to actually go to the gym, but it was too hot, so I swam instead. Someone had to do it. I think I was a disappointment to the staff serving drinks and lunch, as I only ever asked for a glass of iced water,never food. The lounger chairs each had two towels for you to use, and umbrellas, as well as tables and chairs under cover for dining. Another bonus with the room was two bottles of water per day for our use. We usually put those into our fridge, and took out the cold bottles every day. There is also tea and coffee as well as sugar which is refilled every day. I took my own coffee and tea bags and sugar, as I hate running out, and also I wasn't sure what type of tea they would have. My Husband accidentally dropped his mobile as we were getting out of the taxi as we arrived, and when we noticed it was missing, we called down to the front desk. Luckily one of the staff had handed it in, and when we described it, the phone was delivered to our room. We had some paperwork to fill out, and our peace of mind was restored. We had a night arrival, which was actually good, so our body clocks weren't messed up. We were also given fresh orange juice as we were waiting to book in. The day of departure, we had a late flight home, so we were offered a late book out, 3pm I think, and we had the offer of a shower room before we left for the airport. Being soooooooooo hot in Singapore, I spent the afternoon in the pool, after our marathon shopping expedition downtown, and we asked for the shower room, where we freshened up before our flight home. Overall, we couldn't have been happier with our stay. Downstairs, and out the front of the Hotel, there are stalls with souvenirs, and beware of the Camera shop, where my Husband seemed to keep getting stuck in. Actually the shop owner was very nice, and must have been extremely happy with my Husband's continuous visists. There is also a tour desk, where we booked the Zoo, Sentosa Island, and a city tour. The buses leave from downstairs at the back of the hotel, access is down the escalators. My Husband and I were the only ones booked for the Zoo, so we had the driver to ourselves, which was great. Be warned about the Elephants' bath time. Very smelly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't think I need explain any further. We also had breakfast with the Orangatans, and our driver took us to a table where we had a wonderful view of them.We were so close we cold almost touch them.
