We were traveling through Indonesia, making reservations as we went along. By the time we booked our flight to Bali, places with real-time online booking were full or exorbitantly priced. We found a villa booking agency's website that listed several Seminyak villas, and called the agency. Within 30 min they had found space at a couple places, including Heliconia. Sounded fine, but when we arrived we knew we had a great deal. I was a little worried that our villa might be far down some country lane (I love having lots of convenient food choices) but was relieved to find it set back about 100m from the best restaurant row we saw in Kuta, Legian or Seminyak.The place is very quiet, clean, and is apparently about 4 years old. Great landscaping. Yes, the staff's English is limited, but that didn't keep them from serving us well. I can see that the breakfast choices could get boring after a week or 2. We enjoyed the breakfast our 5 days, but might have asked if we could get something different for a longer stay. And of course there's a kitchen w/toaster, rice cooker, coffee pot, and all the other kitchen stuff you need to make your own breakfast. There's a reasonably-priced restaurant menu in the villa, and the staff will bring you the food for a small charge (I think it was 1,000 Rp; 10 US cents). A couple of times we got take-out food from an Indonesian restaurant down the street and brought it home. We saw no need to cook our own food with great local dishes priced at about US$1. My one complaint is that the wi-fi was so slow as to be unusable with my laptop. We'd definitely return to Heliconia.", "Date": "Aug 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR690584516", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "correfoc"}, {"Content": "dissapointing Heliconia villa is overpriced, furniture is quite old, bathtub was leaking, weakest showerhead i've ever come across, they were quite stingy with the tissues  toilet paper and the cable tv had bad reception. We stayed for 11 nights and the complimentary breakfast grew very tiresome as there were only 3 choices. We requested a late check out due to our 11pm flight, but were required to pay half a night's stay for only an extra 5 hours. Most staff spoke very little english (if any) and were very pushy to sell us the in-house massage  laundry service. The only decent aspect of the villa was the private swimming pool and that's about it.

This is our favourite place to stay in Bali and we have stayed there a number of times and have never been disappointed. This is where I tell my friends and family to stay but have not written a review fearing that once the secret is out I may never be able to get a booking again. As I have made my bookings for the rest of the year I feel the staff and owner deserve a review of their villas.We have stayed in both the one bedroom and two bedroom villas and both are wonderful. The kitchens are wonderfully stocked with the utensils that you would need in case you feel like cooking lunch or dinner at the villa or if you order food in, then there are plates etc to eat off. The staff are wonderful, friendly and helpful whilst not intrusive. This is important when you want a villa experience; privacy when you want it but all the help you could ask for when you need it. They deliver breakfast in the morning by calling your room and asking you to open your entrance door and then come in and set up your cooked breakfast.The location is another wonderful feature of the villas.It is located on Jalan Laksmana (Eat street) but to enter the villas you take a small road off Jalan Laksmana (about 50 meters). This ensures peace and quiet throughout the villas but just a short walk to some of the best restaurants in Bali. You can even hear the sound of the waves crashing on the beach some nights. We don't use the beach in Bali as the pool is right there but I imagine if you can hear the surf it's not a long walk to the beach. The villas are serviced every day and are kept very clean. Helliconia villas are not the newest, biggest villas in Seminyak but they are the most charming, uniquely Balinese villas for the price and location in my opinion in Seminyak. Give them a try before the secret is out!!", "Date": "Mar 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR224297763", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "claky"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d633716-r19842588-Heliconia_Villas-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "633716", "Price": "$195"}}
