This hotel is not expensive and for the price it delivers a very good quality. The people at the reception are very nice, willing to help. For example I was there in February 2012 with outside temperatures of minus 14 Celsius. My room was the last of the hotel. Probably the heating was not sufficient with these temperatures to keep the room at a high enough temperature. When I asked for another room I got one without any problems. The continental breakfast is very good compared to the price. I have paid 2x more in other hotels and the quality and choice was less. All kind of bread, eggs, 5 to 6 different choices of meat, cheese and all kind of sweets. I do not favour \"Wurst\" but even that was present. This hotel lays in one the nice parts of Berlin. Around the corner is the Kurfurstendam with a lot of shops and in the Uhlandstrasse there are a lot of different restaurants with different food at different prices. Connection to other part of the city with U and S bahn, busses is great. All together it is a great buy, value for money and I enjoyed my stay.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chennai (Madras), India", "Title": "\u201cBudget and Central Location Hotel\u201d", "Author": "saravanan G", "ReviewID": "UR124127970", "Content": "The hotel has a good and central location for hoilday.

Then I parked near the hotel half blocking an entrance to a car garage. I waited there for about another 10 mins. Then I was very lucky to have someone leave and I moved into their spot right away. The Parking is on the street (not on site) with a parking card they give you to use. You have to let them hold your drivers license or passport until you give back the parking card. Good luck finding one of those tight parking spots if you show up between 9:00am and 6:00pm. I hated leaving my rental car along this busy and crowded street for the 5 nights I booked online and stayed here. It survived without damage though. It is very, very, very busy here! A lot of traffic, tight streets, and pedestrians. When you walk in the (semi-dirty looking) ground floor and the 1st floor are apartments then you get to the hotel part on the second floor. None of the 4 different staff that I talked to while we were there spoke any English but, hey, I'm in Germany and I should speak their langauge. On the 2nd floor it was clean and appears to have been recently painted in the large room we had. The 2nd floor also seemed to be slightly unlevel so watch it if you have too many of those great German beers! We (my Wife and I) came back to our locked room after the 1st day out at 9:00pm. I opened the lock (without any bind, pressure, or force) on the only luggage bag that I had locked before we left and the lock fell onto the floor in 5 pieces??? This lock was new and not defective! It was one of those cheap ones that comes with the American Touristor luggage, but after turning the key, onto the floor went one complete half, the curved locking bar, and the other half was broken into 3 pieces?????????? Nothing that I know of was missing from my luggage or the room. I kept my valuables in the car or with me. I mentioned it to a staff member who took me to a guest's room for interpretation purposes. When he (the guest) opened the door, he was wearing bikini underwear and zipping up his pants (he apologized), in the background in the room was another male in bikini underwear. The man spoke great english and basically the women said it was a family business and doubted the cleaning person or anyone had anything to do with my lock falling apart. So, puzzled and unsure as to why my lock fell into pieces, I accepted her response and went back to my room for the night. Wow, an unsolved mystery!!! The rest of my stay was ok. This hotel is close to public transportation, good food and drinks, shopping, etc. The hotel staff was nice and helpful and the buffet breakfast was great. We only paid 60 euros a night. We both aren't that hard to please and would not stay here again!", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Land of Oz", "Title": "\u201cbasic, clean, and fun\u201d", "Author": "sacolao", "ReviewID": "UR7637286", "Content": "Quite large place in a great part of Berlin.
