The breakfast buffet was large and different kind of food was served, however sometimes it was a little bit crowded. The Internet connection (WLAN) in my room was fast for Dubai and login was working without problems. The hotel is at the World Trade Centre which is near the beginning of the Sheik Zahed Road. The hotel can easily be reached by taxi (Airport 15 Minutes) and also the next Dubai Metro station is near. For business purposes I would recommend this hotel.

Instead of offering more comfort, it was just the opposite. A part from a dirty plastic curtain,the shower cell was actually not seperated from the bathroom floor and showed a suspliciously small hole for water evacuation.

The hotel features a nice swimming pool, which I was going to use at the end of the day: they closed it because some company organised their party at the pool.

For those that know Dubai's history, know very well that the first ever skyscraper in Dubai, for that mattter the UAE, was the World Trade Centre. Host to many of the most famous exhibitions in the region. This building from the 80s still stands and maintains its value amidst the glamourous steal and glass structures. The convention centre and trade centre is the location of the Novotel I am rating here. The reason for this introduction is to give credence to the hotel's location. And then when you consider that it is central to the current Dubai this location is great. The hotel is 4 stars, breakfast is very nice, rooms are small but considering that most hotels these days are not family friendly forcing a small gentelman's family of four, to take two rooms, this hotel has a wonderful policy which I encourage, they consider kids to be 16 or lower. And the really best part is their room has a double bed and a sofa bed that unfolds to a double bed. The staff are very nice, good service reasonably fast and friendly. The spa is nice, checking in was quite reasonable and check out was really quick. If you rent a car they have a complimentary valet service for guests. Of course the hotel does have one drawback and that is the convention centre next door to it, there are large groups coming to the hotel and it can get intermittently crowded, but since the hotel is well used to this you will not feel anything in the service even the lifts up and down, no hassle. But like I said the crowds may not be your cup of tea, I mean groups of 50 and more signing up in the lobby etc. All in all we liked this hotel and for one more year if we visit we could stay since our kids are getting close to the 16 age limit.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it even for expos\u201d", "Author": "sherif27", "ReviewID": "UR125265923", "Content": "I stayed here more than 5 times over the past 3 years and only because it was business related and to attend expos.

This is my first time in this hotel. In usual Novotel fashion, the entrance is grand and inviting, giving the impression of better to come.

The rooms: I think Mr Novotel must have got a \"job lot\" of beds from somewhere, because they are as hard as the ones in all his other Novotels! If you don't sleep well on a hard bed, then don't stay here!! The room facilities: It's nice to have tea/coffee in the rooms, the other amenities are the same. Cleanliness was OK. Internet: Luckily for me we get internet included in our contract, it is fast and reliable. Not sure what they charge normally, but I do disagree with over-priced internet! Breakfast. Average. Very very busy with semi-attentive staff, they are constantly on the go so have little time for \"customer service\"!! Location wise it is excellent. AED15 (\u00a32) in a taxi to the Dubai Mall where you will find everything from designer to basic and plenty of restaurants. The Gold souk is a bit further AED 30 (\u00a35) but always worth a visit if you want good prices and like bartering!

So at the arrival I have showed my hotel voucher (I have booked it from web) to reception. The receptionist started searching for 15 minutes and couldn't find my reservation. I have told her that I have booked and payed for hotel accommodation a week before arrival. After a while I was told that my reservation was not approved and I have to look for another hotel, also the site I have booked through is not reliable (although the website I have booked through most of you guys know). After my threat that I will sue them in court, front office manage came. She has told me the same thing that hotel is overbooked and they can not place me. I have called the hotline number of travel company in order to find out what was the problem. They have told me to stay in hotel and that they will contact directly with Novotel reservation department to fix the problem, and that the payment was sent to Novotel. After waiting 2 hours in lobby, finally they gave me a room in \"fully overbooked hotel\". How could I get a room in hotel where no free rooms were left? After getting a room, I thought that all problems were solved and I can enjoy my staying. I was wrong. In the morning we came down to have a breakfast. The same story here again, the lady carefully checked the list and asked me \"How you wish for paying the breakfast?\" I have told them that the room I have booked includes breakfast, by showing her hotel voucher where clearly says that it's included. During the check out the receptionist have told me that I have to pay for hotel room, due to the fact that they haven't received the payment from my travel agency. Of course I refused to pay, claiming I did it already. In other words, I have never seen such a rude and unfriendly stuff anywhere in the world. My advise do not book this hotel and I will tell you what kind of unpleasant surprises you will face. - There is a Blue bar in ground floor, so if you are hoping to sleep quietly, forget about it. Non stop loud music will keep you awake. - Rooms are pretty small, and smelly. I have stayed at Four Points Sheraton Sheikh Zayed Road before, where rooms were much better. - Hotel personnel is so unprofessional. I wonder where they gather all these people. - Breakfast is average. Limited choice of food, and the same stuff everyday. - No free internet even in the lobby. The rates are way to high.

The hotel itself was kind of disappointing. It looks modern in the lobby and from outside, but the rooms are a bit tired and decrepit, the bathrooms especially. The staff were mostly unhelpful. The concierge (Cherrie) was singularly unhelpful, expert at telling you what she couldn't do and then offering no alternative suggestions concerning what she could do. It made us wonder if the hotel or she knew what a concierge was. Jenny, at the front desk, was similarly unhelpful and had some attitude. In speaking with her, as with Cherrie, I felt like they lacked a basic understand of customer service. It was as though they believed that customer service was a favor you do for someone and not really their job. They didn't seem inclined to be helpful. Not all of the staff were unhelpful. A lady with short blonde hair, whose name I wish I had asked, was very helpful upon check-in, in answering our many questions about what's nearby and what services the hotel offered. She was based at the Priority desk, but then I didn't see her again during our visit. The other staff were o.k. All in all, though, instead of staying here, I would recommend staying at the nearby Ibis on the other side of the convention center. It's a fraction of the price of the Novotel, and just about as nice in terms of facilities and amenities. Plus, it's closer to Caffe Nero, Sheik Zayed Road and the metro.

Our room attendant was excellent. The furnishings are cheap throughout and the bed is rock hard. The linens though we're decent. There is free Internet for guests throughout the hotel. Then there is the food..unless the microwaves a regular part of your culinary regime, this is not good food. Breakfast was the worst, lunch marginally better, we did not risk supper. It is 85 durham per peson and not worth half that. We tried eating supper in the Blue Bar next door, atrocious...we sent both dishes back and refused repeated requests to replace it with more crap. We tried the manhattan strips...overlooked, unseasoned, flavourless strips of a very thin steak. SO ordered the crab cakes...worst ever. The concierge is not a conscience, he/she is merely the bellman who happens to be standing there. Theynhavelittle useful information as it is clear they have no opportunity to go to the places they are trying to recommend. Nice enough, but no useful knowledge. Taxi service is odd. Although the is a hotel sign noting taxis are only for guests, we w told on more than one occasion that taxis we not supposed to stop there. They are supposed to stop at the other end of the conference center and off the property. What an odd situation. It took a long time to get one most times. Beware of the private cars with no meters....mind you some did have meters as we discovered on one occasion where the trip was almost three times the cost of the return trip. Sometimes the hotel staff will check for you whe. The taxi pulls up, but not,always. The hotel is close to the metro and we took that when we could. Clean, fast and well run.

The iron was also old and leaked a little. +The lobby, resto&breakfast are first rate. +The internet was high speed wifi and it worked well. All in all, I stayed here because it was walking distance to DIFC where I had business to do for a week. Next time, I will look for better deals which would justify what the value really is.

Complimentary valet parking, welcoming and efficient (though slow, as we arrived at a busy time) check-in and a clean comfortable room. Genuinely friendly and obliging staff at all levels. Big, bright dining area, great buffet breakfast with plenty of choice and eggs cooked to order. Even though there is no pork, \"turkey bacon\" (actually much leaner) and chicken sausages are available! Attracts a cosmopolitan clientele, young and old, with a mixture of business people and tourists, also used by airline crew, including pilots. Very relaxing leisure facilities, including a lovely outdoor swimming pool and steam rooms in the spacious, separate changing areas for men and women - very quiet when we were there. Not really worth hiring a car in Dubai if you are not leaving the city, as (without SAT-NAV) you can quickly take a wrong turn, even with a decent map - the traffic is very fast and the roads have many lanes. Turning back in the opposite direction usually involves taking a U-turn, as in the US. Similarly, few people walk very far. Do not try to walk from the hotel to the Burj Khalifa as we did. The entrance is inside the Dubai Mall, you will find it more easily if you take a taxi there. Taxis are very cheap. There is also a highly efficient (and like everything in Dubai, new) metro and it is very easy to get the metro direct from the airport to the Trade Centre station and then get a taxi on to the hotel (not far away, but too far to walk with luggage). The only thing I would really fault is that free Internet is not available at the hotel, at least not without wifi - not sure if this was free as we did not bring a laptop. We had to pay about the equivalent of \u00a35 (can't remember exactly how many dirhams), minimum charge, to use the Internet in the hotel's Business Centre for 2 1/2 hours, without the option of being able to spread this time over several visits, quite frustrating as we just wanted to check email.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gosport", "Title": "\u201cA big disappointment\u201d", "Author": "meezfit", "ReviewID": "UR97091231", "Content": "I am glad we only booked a night there.

The next morning the breakfast buffet was very acceptable, but it was also quiet. In a large hotel, when there are not so many people about, it makes the atmosphere feel a little strange. The room was fine and clean, the bed hard but comfortable, but the doors are thin and there seemed to be alot of noise in the hall late at night.

We had a king size room which was lovely. A substantial size with king size bed which was so comfortable. Good quality linen with good pillows. TV, mini bar, bed settee, work station, internet connection, phone, tea/coffee. The bathroom wasn't huge but it was very clean with all the amenities you could wish for including a lovely shower. Our room attendant could not have been more acccommodating and kept the room spotless. We wanted to go to the beach and as there were no beach towels he made sure we had surplus quantities of bath towels to take with us. We used the cafe for afternoon snacks which were of good quality with a wide selection of food available including the most scrumptious cakes. There is pool with loungers and a business centre should you wish to use the internet. The staff there are very helpful. The only downside to this hotel is that it is valet parking only and whilst the staff are very quick and efficient, there are times when you have only popped back to the hotel for a very short time but there is nowhere to leave the car and it has to be parked. We found the location of this hotel to be ideal. You are about 30 minutes from The Palm and the same from The Souk. There is a shuttle bus to/from the hotel which arrives at the hotel at 30 minutes past the hour at hotel shuttle stand 2 and leaves for the airport on the hour. It does not have to be pre-booked. There are also shuttles to the beach and to the malls. Taxis are expensive with a trip to the Palm from the hotel about \u00a324 return - you can hire a car for \u00a319 per day. Also the beach the hotel bus takes you to isn't the best, the free one is beautiful and I believe called Jumeirah Beach. Do check that you can take photographs on the beach as there are a lot of signs that say you can't and also if you use the beach the bus takes you too, there is a sign that says Mondays are for ladies only - I cannot confirm that this is correct as we used the free beach on the Monday.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ystad, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money by Dubai standards\u201d", "Author": "aviator1945", "ReviewID": "UR27229837", "Content": "Stayed here five nights while on a business trip to the Gulf area.

The room seemed new with modern furnishings. Both of us liked the bed, which was unusual because he likes a soft bed and I prefer firmer. We took advantage of the free airport transfers (look for the person holding the Ibis/Novotel sign) and the free shuttle to the beach and malls. Our departing flight was through Abu Dhabi, and the concierge arranged for a taxi for us. The staff were very helpful, especially the pool staff who appeared instantly to help us move the lounge chairs in/out of the sun. This is by no means an inexpensive hotel, but was an excellent value for Dubai. I originally booked the Ibis, but kept checking the Novotel's website and eventually came across a rate that was only a little higher than the Ibis'. After spending a little more time on the Novotel website, I was able to find a rate that included breakfast and internet for the same price as the room-only rate. Yay! When checking out of the hotel, the front desk claimed that internet is never included, but fortunately I had the reservation confirmation printed out, which stated that internet was included. The front desk agent removed our internet charges without any problems.", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "Title": "\u201cShiny\u201d", "Author": "Isla72", "ReviewID": "UR13372133", "Content": "The hotel is part of a large convention centre with its sister hotel the Ibis in the same complex.

Undoubtly, the Novotel, together with Ibis have the best location since they are in the premises. Can\u00b4t beat that. Having said that, I will go directly to pros/cons. PROS: Location, location, location. Jazz bar is cool. Restaurant is ok, but quite expensive. CONS: Crazy prices, AED 1500 (during this show) per night, very expensive internet (AED 110 per 24hs), small and crowded gym at peak hours (7-8AM), cold pool, rooms are quite tight. In summary, if you have anything going on at the World Trade Center, you will love staying there. Dubai\u00b4s traffic is impossible and the advantage of staying there is incredible.

I arrived at about 9am to be told that there were no rooms available yet, which was fair enough. I left my luggage with the concierge and went to sit by the pool, getting hold of one of the last few sunbeds, spending a relaxing few hours waiting for my friend to arrive laying on my sunbed while watching scores of other people turn up to the pool to find there was no-where to sit. There were a number of sunbeds 'reserved' with towels for a couple of hours or more, and i felt that the hotel should not allow this to happen given how many people were waiting to use them. When my room was finally ready i was told my luggage would be taken up and i returned to the pool. It was still sitting in the middle of reception a couple of hours later when i headed to the room. I didn't find it acceptable that luggage was just left on trolleys in the reception area for anyone to wander off with, or that no-one bothered to take it to my room in a two hour period. We had a few other niggles with service - mainly housekeeping. We returned to the hotel one evening to find that the maid had left some of her cleaning equipment in the bathroom, and had removed the toilet rolls and not replaced our towels. On phoning housekeeping we were told 'there's a shortage' (they didn't explain if this was on towels or toilet rolls) - not the kind of response you'd expect - although replacements were brought within half an hour. Apart from these niggles, we found the room clean and nicely presented, if a little small, the only real problem being that there was very little storage space - no drawers for clothes for example. The bathrobes were a nice touch though. There was a good selection on the buffet at breakfast, although we found it a little strange that some mornings bacon was available and some it wasn't. The poolbar offered nice snacks and was reasonably priced. We never had a problem getting a taxi from the hotel, although having to drive half way round the WTC to get back on to the road got a little tiresome and we found it easier to hail a taxi on the street. All in all, if you don't mind staying in an area where you have to take taxis or drive to get anywhere, and where you might have to get up at 7am to get a sunbed, then this hotel was very good value for money - our room was about \u00a385 a night including breakfast.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manama, Bahrain", "Title": "\u201cGood cheap option if you can get out\u201d", "Author": "baliblue", "ReviewID": "UR12576716", "Content": "Stayed here during the Dubai 7's and found the place to be great.

Public areas are good and the bar is very good, particularly on days where live music is played on stage. The restaurant is ok, but service is not really quick or attentive. The rooms are the downside - expectations from the public areas in terms of decor, style and amenities are not met. The rooms are rather small and with simple furniture, the bathrooms are quite simple as well.

My sister and I stayed there for 5 days on a shopping /sightseeing vacation. The hotel is at a higher standard than other Novotels , decor-wise ( in Dubai everything goes up a level). The lobby is huge ( everything in dubai is supersized ) and classy- the hotel website photos are very accurate. Loved everything about this hotel. Not too far from airport, it is actually annexed to the World Trade Centre but the good thing about novotels is that they cater to both business and leisure travellers alike. There was a tourist info desk and the staff were very helpful- there was one hic-cup when we had to wait for a safari jeep after we had paid, they thought we were not on the list ,but it was sorted 15 mins later. The Restaurant is chic and the food is really great- a combination of French as well as typical Emrati dishes. There were also themed food nights- i.e. Japanese, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern. There a bar/lounge and a night club on site as well. There is a souvenir/ sundries store in the hotel. The hotel is not in the city centre , neither is it near the creek or shops but there is a shuttle which drops you off into the centre of town this takes about 20 min, depending on whether the shuttle has to pick up guests from the Hotel Ibis (which is the partner hotel) or traffic. The shuttle also picks up guests from the airport and drops guests off to airport. All in all we had a great time. There is a gym, pool with pool-side bar , business centre ( you have to pay for the internet) . Would defintely recommend this hotel for business, short stays/ shopping expeditions. The food is great and the design is sleek. The bedrooms are the generic ' novation' design for all these newly built novotels.

If you need a visa (foreign passport holders) and you are going to Dubai as an individual then DO NOT book this hotel (learnt the hard way). They said that they do it then after paying and booking they then said \"only for business persons not tourist visa\" We had paid for my husband and I and he was not able to travel so because of their error we wasted his airticket and part hotel costs!! Both hotel and Expedia have not paid the money back so be warned!!! Apart from that as he could not travel with me (i had to go alone) when he left msgs with the hotel or on voicemail I never got the msgs. First day they said they have vm probs so any msgs left on the system before the vm went down would have gone!!! and the second day they said i should have a msg under my door and showing on the tv. Firstly, i told them that i was watching tv and no msgs showing, and secondly that i was looking under my door and again no msgs there. All in all, no msgs recieved, which I think is 'Poor for a Business hotel'. ALSO, Card keys did not work had to be recoded, which is painful if after getting to the 11th floor having to go down to have it programmed and back up to the 11th floor. All in all though, I did have a word with the hotel mgr to see if they can do anything about the 'misadvice' and they appear to hear me out. Will let you and the WWW if nothing materialises there as if they did not misadvise then we would not have booked Dubai. Pleasant hotel and nice ambience.
