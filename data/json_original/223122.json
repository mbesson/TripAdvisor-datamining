Although recently renovated.. seemingly just the rooms, because the Main Entrance leaves a LOT to be desired. First when arriving no one was in the reception area to greet you...no one. Secondly you stand at a wooden box with nothing on it, not even a pen to sign with. Very odd. Check out is at 11am and Check in is at 4:00pm however, several Customers had to wait another 45 minutes to get a room. One person told us the cleaning staff was short, and the Manager (finally appeared) said that was not true. Giving them the benefit of a doubt due to hurricane Isaac, they seemed very unorganized, and poorly managed. Being aware of the hurricane issues, myself and other guests called ahead and was told everything was running normal, power had never been off and they were at full capacity, and to \"come on down\". The experience was quite different. They seemed very understaffed and befuzzled. We were told they were trying to help locals who were out of power, but doing so by giving them our booked,...paid for rooms, seemed a bit unfair. I don't want to be too harsh here, because helping others is good, but i get the feeling this hotel has problems. Your room is stocked with everything, and this is because they have no offering of vending of any type. They also have no coffee makers in the rooms, no iron or ironing boards, and best of all with heat and humidity that NOLA has, NO ICE MACHINES. Now you can get anything you need by calling the front box, however, then you must go down and get it, OR wait for them to bring it to your room. Modern....???? Seems modern would have had current ammenities and then some wouldn't you think. I'm kinda of speechless on this place. I was on the 10th floor which made needing things a bit tough. Jennifer was very good at explaining why rooms were late getting into, however, why no ammenities? Very few people wants to pay for mini bar prices in their rooms. Oh, and lastly, the view from my window were the local homeless drunks, sleeping under the statue of General Lee. How nice. On my second night there, one was sleeping just feet from the Hotel entrance. You be the judge,...I'm just sharing my experience.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "new orleans", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT GO!

At almost 8pm I found availability at this hotel and called the hotel directly to confirm availability. The man that I spoke with quickly informed me that there were indeed 3 king rooms available. When is asked if the price was the same as the Orbiz quote, he suggested that I confirm the room on Orbtiz as there was a price difference. We arrived about 10 minutes after receiving the confirmation email to a very friendly valet. He walked us into the hotel while explaining the check in process. Shortly he was joined by another man, presumably the concierge, who told us to wait in adjacent sitting area and offered us a glass of wine. There was a choice of chardonnay or cabernet sauvignon and both were very high quality. For those who don't drink that was lemon infused ice water. A woman came over to us and asked for our information; as I explained that we had booked our rooms less than 15 minutes earlier, she apologized for the other hotel's incompetence and asked for my name to locate our rooms. She returned in a short time and informed us that we were checked in and she hoped that we enjoyed our stay. The style of the hotel is modern, but eclectic and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The room was small and clean. The decor was simple and linear, but the addition of stacked books, a small oil painting of a swamp scene, and a decorative glass candy bowl continued with the modern/eclectic vibe. The minibar is overpriced but that is to be expected. Thankfully there is a gas station on the other side of the circle which has a large selection of beer, wine, and hard liquor at very reasonable prices. Add a bucket of ice from room service (there aren't any ice machines) and you have a party! The shower has good water pressure and the C.O. Bigelow products, lavender and peppermint, were fantastic after a long day touring. Our room was on the second floor above the bar/night club. The music was very audible in the bathroom, but less so in the room. The club is open until 2am, but it seemed like the music continued until 2:30-3am. We were not disturbed by it as we returned to the room after midnight, both nights, and were exhausted from walking the Quarter all day. However, it was loud enough that it may disturb other guests. Also, it is quite a long walk to the French Quarter. It took about 15 minutes to get to Canal street, which borders the western edge of the French Quarter. We were usually game to walk, but did take a taxi on Saturday night at the reasonable cost of $12 (for 4 people). All in all it was a very enjoyable stay and we will certainly be back.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, California", "Title": "\u201cMy new favorite NOLA hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Catherine A", "ReviewID": "UR135491727", "Content": "At first glance, this new hotel doesn't seem very \"New Orleans,\" though it is located on Lee Circle and has taken the spot once occupied by a famous NOLA establishment. I don't know whether they call themselves \"boutique,\" but their sharp stylishness seems to invoke Park Slope rather than the Belle Epoque. The hotel is new and everything is lovely and fresh. (I swear our room had that \"new hotel smell\".) \"Boutique\" means the rooms aren't huge, but they have lots of clever features, such as moveable side tables, to compensate. It's all about style and service--striking color schemes, fresh white beds, refrigerators, etc. The Modern's hipness is apparent from the minute you enter the place--your \"check-in desk\" is a simple table and the process is very personal and warm. Hipness continues in Tamarind, the new restaurant attached to the hotel. The Asian-French fusion food would make the eatery destination dining in any world capital. The free breakfast is the usual juice-coffee-pastries deal you get, but because this IS New Orleans, the pastries are gorgeous, little fresh, filled croissants. You can come down for coffee or request a coffeemaker in your room. Location is great, with museums just around the corner. And Commander's isn't far! So--if you associate New Orleans hotels with gently crumbling facades and lots of period touches, the Hotel Modern doesn't fit the mold. But it is true that when you check in, they offer you a glass of wine. And how many hotels have a scarlet parrot, named \"Scarlett,\" in the lobby to greet you? The personal service is exceptional, the vibe is chic high-style, and there's room for eccentricity. Maybe it IS New Orleans after all! Having been lucky enough to marry into a New Orleans family, I get to go a few times a year.

It has quickly become my favorite hotel in a city that I visit often. The reservations manager Jenn was so helpful and put us in a great room overlooking Lee Circle. Since the recent name change and remodel the hotel has become a mix of European sophistication and Southern hospitality. The staff is so friendly and knows so much about the city, places to eat and things to see. It's an easy walk to the French Quarter or an $8.00 cab ride. You can also ride the historic New Orleans street car for $1.25, The car stop is right near the hotel. Our room was clean, the A/C was very cold and we had plenty of towels. Giavanna who works at check in was so sweet. Actually, the entire staff that we saw was friendly and professional. The only disappointment was that Scarlett, the parrot who lives in the lobby, is ill and so was not available to play with. She is taking a break and will be back soon.

The hotel is very well located, being almost halfway between the French Quarter and the Garden District, and also on the main trolley route. (I arrived in the city by train and the hotel is a ten minute walk from the Amtrak station). It's an easy fifteen minute walk to the start of the French Quarter and about the same to the Garden District. Although on a traffic circle the area is quiet. The National WWII museum is literally around the corner. Reception is unusual in that there is a very informal desk offering wine or a cold drink. I was met by a polite staff member for check in and the process was quick. The only concern I had was that my credit card was taken for incidentals, but instead of swiping at the desk it was taken around the back and out of sight - presumably because that is where the machine is - not best practice for the handling of cards. The room was on the small side but not uncomfortably so. There was plenty of space for bag storage by the door or in the cupboard. The room had a fully stocked minibar, but as usual the prices were ridiculous (especially when there is a convenience store right across the street). Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine. The room had a safe which worked fine. Good-sized TV with plenty of channels (but no list of channels in my room). Everything was clean. The staff was helpful and polite and let me access a PC on the ground floor to print off some documents. Wifi was available for free and was generally good in the room, although occassionally sluggish. The room service - provided by Tamarind, the restaurant on the ground floor - seemed limited in range to me, particularly if you don't like Asian influenced food, so i didn't use it. (I ate in the restaurant itself one night and it was a good experience.) There are few eating options in the inmediate vicinity of the hotel - although if you walk towards the Garden District there are fast food places and coffee shops and a few other restaurants. Going towards the French District there is less choice until you get to Canal St. Most days i didn't eat in the hotel area, but made sure i ate before heading back. The exterior of the hotel is not particularly appealing - it looks more like an office block - and you have to get pretty close before you see the hotel sign by the door. In summary this is a good option if you want somewhere a little more quiet and which is not in the thick of the action. It's close enough to walk to most places you'd want to see but also allows easy access to transport options.

The room was spacious and nicely furnished with a very comfortable king bed. Unfortunately our room was right by the door that connects the main building and where our rooms where, this door banged fairly loudly all night as guests go in and out and shook the walls and disrupted what otherwise would have been a very restful sleep on the comfortable bed. Upon arriving we checked and asked about the parking (there is valet, self park or a car park at the back) we were informed rather cooly by the receptionist that as the hotel was not affiliated with the car park at the back of the hotel they could not provide us any information on it. Whilst I accept this answer, at better hotels with better customer service, I am sure given the number of enquiries they must receive on parking they would be able to offer some advice or assistance. The biggest problem we had was the minibar, which was not refilled from the previous guests and was half empty. After being told it would be refilled straight away to avoid us being charged for the missing items, we waited and waited and waited. Housekeeping finally arrived but were unaware of the minibar and was only here for turndown service. The housekeeper left saying she would inform someone to come up and refill. We waited again and after some time we finally called reception to advise them of the problem. I was simply told that yes they were aware, they were not sending someone up (despite us being told twice this would occur) and that we would not be charged. It would have been nice for reception to call us to confirm this to us rather than have us waiting around unable to relax thinking someone would be coming up to our room at any moment. Unfortunately a week after our stay a charge for $120 appeared on my sisters credit card for the minibar! Luckily after a few phone calls they said they would remove the charge, however it was a mistake made by the hotel that caused us to have spend time rectifying!", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGood Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "AmandaS05", "ReviewID": "UR132043191", "Content": "Good place to stay, about a mile away from Bourbon St but easily accessible by the 24hr St. Charles cable car or a 20 min walk.

I stayed in the small room, it had modern upgrades but many important upgrade/ details were missing. - The toilet looked very dirty, with large dark stains in the bottom, which I believe were just stains but it looked like poo. - Their website listed listed Ipod docks in rooms, on arrival mine didn't have one. When I called the front desk they informed me the hotel didn't have enough for every room and would contact me the next day to let me know if one was available, never got a call or an ipod dock. Glad I brought a back-up charger - There was no menu for room service or the min-bar in the room. I called to request a menu, it never was brought up. The last night I called again for a menu, was told it would be right up. After 20+ min still no menu, called the front desk again. Once I brought up the issue of being the 3rd call I was hung up on. About 10 min later the menu arrived. Dinner was ok and reasonable priced, though nothing special. - No iron in the room, had to call for one. The board delivered had a large stain on it. - While waiting for a colleague near the front desk I asked for a glass of the wine sitting out. I was very sharply asked if I received one when I checked in, I had... apparently its only for guesting checking in, there's no wine hour so don't expect any additional wine. - Looks like new bedding, but the desk and dresser were old, furniture in the hallways was all scrapped up, along with scrapped walls needing new paint. - Overall the hotel cheaply upgraded to modern. Needs re-painting, furnishes replaced, and the customer is lacking. Another important note is there's no other hotels or restaurants near by. You can catch the trolly or a cab, so factor that into your hotel cost. But for the $100 per night price its still a fairly clean and comfortable place to stay.

I was travelling from Georgia to Texas and decided to spend the night in New Orleans on 4/17/12. My wife booked the room for me, so other than where it was located and that the parking was supposed to be secure, I knew nothing about the hotel. When I arrived at the Hotel Modern, I was immediately impressed with the appearence of the hotel and its surroundings. My work truck, which is packed with expensive equipment, was valet parked in a secure area which is monitored 24/7 for $18.00 a day. When I entered the lobby, I was immediate greeted by the staff. After asking my name and inviting me to sit down, I was offered a glass of wine while I was checked in. During the check in process, the staff members chatted with me and explained the various amenities and offerings of the hotel. I planned to do some computer work in the morning and check out somewhat early, so I asked about breakfast and room service and was told that they began serving at 7 am. I was assigned room 906, which turned out to be on the front of the hotel and had an impressive view. The room is small, but stylish and provided all the comforts of home except for in-room coffee maker and there are no ice machines, but if you call room service, they will bring a bucket to your room. The hotel itself is not in the French Quarter, but is right on a trolly line, which runs every few minutes, and brings you directly to all the areas of interest. That evening, I had dinner in the French Quarter and did some siight-seeing, and after several hours, returned to the hotel. I woke up about 6 am, did some business related work, took a shower and about 7:20 am, I began trying to order room service. From that time, until about 9 am, I attempted to contact room service and kept reaching a recording.

I love to walk, so walking form the hotel to the French Quarter was not a problem.

All of the uptown parades roll right by this hotel before making their way down to Canal. We brought two other couples with us who had never been to mardi gras. This was a good way to ease someone into mardi gras who had never been. The crowd in front of the hotel was never more than one or two person deep. The hotel was nice, the rooms were cute, bed was big and comfy. Liked the CB Bigalo toiletries. Lovely bar called Bellocq downstairs. There was a restaurant called Tamarind also on the lower level but we did not get to try it. Room rate was very fair priced for mardi gras first weekend. There were a few quirky things that I thought may need to be adjusted. I know the hotel just reopened as Hotel Modern, so maybe these quirky things just started, but for one thing, they didn't allow you to get ice. The ice machines were empty. You had to call the front desk to have it delivered. This got annoying pretty quick, especially during parades when you are constantly making drinks in your room. We were literally going up to the front desk and asking for ice for each new drink. Another quirky thing was the check in desk, or lack thereof. It was really just a waist high kiosk with some ice water sitting atop it. There was a girl who stood beside the desk, who did not appear to be wearing a uniform. She turned out to be the desk clerk. I thought she was hanging out, drinking water at first! The really nice man who opened the door for me a few times turned out to be the doorman! Again, no uniform was worn by him either. I did recognize the maid because she had cute french maid uniform on! none of these are bad things, just quirky. There is an adorable Macaw or some sort of parrot who hangs out in the lobby as well. He has a big bird cage beside the water kiosk. Overall, I would def stay here again for first weekend of mardi gras.

However, the other 4 nites scared me. I reluctantly booked our other 4 nites at Hotel Le' Cirque. Let me tell you...we couldn't have been happier. Apparently we were fortunate to get a room (BTW, using the previous reviews, we were smart enough to ask for a renovated room! Smart move) that was new all the way around!! New furniture, flat screen, fully tiled bathroom. The room was relatively small, but considering there were only two of us (and we didn't need it for a pit stop)...hello...how much room do you really need? It was very comfortable and guess what???? We were so impressed, we cancelled our other 4 nites at Harrahs and spent our entire 8 nites at Hotel Le' Cirque. The trolley stop is a half block from the hotel front and it wasn't scary walking at nite down St. Charles St. to the other quaint resturants (Delmonico's (yes, Emerils) E's, VooDoo BBQ, Sushi Brothers) or if you want, the trolley stops in front of all these resturants. The staff is wonderful (Magna, DJ, Melissa, Jennifer), but for the 5 star hotel clerk...you need to request REBECCA..absolutely, no better! Resturant and bar were still under remodel, but we still drank, got drunk and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! If ever in this town again...this will always be our 'go to' hotel!!!!

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boutique style hotel in the Warehouse District of New Orleans; it is a healthy walk to the cruise Port. We walked it with our luggage and took about 15 minutes; we had the time and wanted to save on the cab ride. It is located just out side of the hustle and bustle of the French Quatre which I particularly like and 1 trolley ride into the downtown core. This hotel is currently refurbishing its lobby, courtyard and rooms. Unfortunately nothing was noted on the site or mentioned when I called prior to arrival that the hotel was under construction however the reception staff went out of there way to over compensate for the make shift lobby and inconvenience. This hotel is located on a round-about on St. Charles Street, it's an intimate spot away from the crowds so would recommend for families with small children, business travel, couples and weekend get-a ways with friends. There are 10 floors with many rooms on each floor. The rooms have a simple contemporary decor and offer 1 king or double bed. My room had a clear view of monument of Colonel Robert E.Lee in Lee Circle and the trolleys that pass by. I didn't find it noisy, more on the quieter side of town, or wasn't bothered by the lights that light up the front of the hotel. Once the dark drapes are closed you won't know that you are New Orleans We had two rooms one was an older rooms on the 7th floor where I staid and the newer renovated rooms on the 5th floor where my friends staid. Each room had comfortable beds, spacious bathrooms, and basic amenities.The furniture more contemporary than the older rooms. I am lead to believe that the rooms are slightly larger than some of the Brand name hotels in the French Quatre. I would definitely go back just to see how Le Cirque looks after the reservations. It's a good location for groups travelling out of the New Orleans cruise port. It's walking distance to the Louisiana's Civil War Museum and The National World War II Museum. Also a good location if you're looking for a reasonable rate, the hotel is driving distance to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome as it's right by the US Route 90. The Door Man and hotel Manager recommended some great spots to eat, we tried them and were pleasantly impressed with both of their suggestions.

The experience I just had was so horrific I have to share. My boyfriend and I checked into le cirque for a 3 night stay. Check in went smoothly, room was fine- a little wear and tear but nothing we couldn't handle On the morning of our second day I was getting ready in the bathroom and turned around to see a GIGANTIC cockroach crawling along the bathtub. I was horrified, I never saw a bug that size in my life. My boyfriend was outside so I called the front desk to have someone come up and kill this thing. Ten minutes later a maintenance worker and what seemed to be a manager (no one introduced themselves so I'm really not sure) arrived with nothing but a rubber glove to kill the bug. They took care of the bug and just walked out of the room without an apology or even spraying or cleaning anything!! I was visibly shaken up by the whole thing and really didn't feel comfortable staying in the room. My boyfriend went down to the front desk to see what options were available for us. The front desk associate at that time was very understanding- she apologized offered us a different room and ensured it would be thoroughly cleaned. She also stated that she would make a note on our bill for a discounted rate for our troubles. The new room was ok- same as the previous room, no cockroaches that I could see so it sufficed for our last night. Upon checkout in the morning we spoke with a different associate and explained the situation and fact that a previous associate noted a discount due to bugs. This associate said there were no notes and there was nothing she could do to discount the room rate. She was very unapologetic and stated that \"cockroaches were par for course this time of year.\" Needless to say we had terrible experience and will be working with expedia (who we booked with) and the better business bureau to discuss.

By far, this one was the worst. The positive reviewers are guilty of hyperbole or work for the company. I booked a \"deluxe room\" w/a King-sized bed for 2 nights, but upon my arrival was assigned a closet sized room w/a full-sized bed. I opened the door and was immediately greeted by a strong odor, perhaps mold, but certainly an unpleasant dampness. The small room was depressing, w/only one small window facing an alley and the backs of several nearby buildings. There was a small area separated from the rest of the room by a dingy curtain; I pulled the curtain back to discover the \"closet\". The bathroom was about 1/3 the size of the entire room, which surpised me. The bathroom counter appears to have been actual marble, though I cannot be certain. The shower consisted of a tiled area marked off by a curtain. All the furniture was old and ragged. The desk chair, which was covered in vinyl, looked as if an animal had been chewing on it or a previous customer had carelessly peeled it off the seat and the back of the chair. The carpet, both in the room and the elevator, was absolutely filthy. I knew I would not be able to spend two nights in that room and went downstairs to request a room change. The ladies at the desk apologized profusely about the smelly room and said they would \"upgrade\" me to the room for which my office had already prepaid. I visited the new room before accepting it and it was only slightly better. There were 2 small windows w/the exact same view and the carpet appeared less disgusting. The room is significantly smaller and certainly not worth Amy extra cost. In total, I can say that this is the worst hotel I've stayed in the US. It needs major renovations of the rooms and an overhaul of it's decor and furnishings. My room's walls seem to be freshly painted, but the timy bathroom of my new room is painfully in need of repair and re-painting. It is worth mentioning that there is only one functioning elevator in the hotel, though there are two elevators. I can see adventurers, college students and people who can sleep anywhere being satisfied w/a place of this caliber; however, it will not suffice for anyone requiring clean and comfortable accommodations. The price is only a few dollars less than large hotel chains; chains I would have preferred if it were not an issue of lack of rooms due to several large conferences coinciding w/my trip to New Orleans.
