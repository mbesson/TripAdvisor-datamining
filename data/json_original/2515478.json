I didn't have a cell phone and they let me use the hotel phone free for all the cab calls and airline reservations I had to make.

Stayed in the kid's suite (room 109) so each person could have their own bed. The soda/vending/ice machines were right next door so each time someone went in to get an item, they slammed the heavy iron metal door which scared everyone in the room. I could not figure out which was louder: the planes landing, the trains blowing their whistles, the gridlock (car horns) from the busy intersection right out front, or the metal door being slammed every so often. We asked housekeeping to not clean our rooms and even put up the do not disturb sign. Lo and behold when we came back later that day, they not only did clean our room, but they took a personal item of mine and also replaced the towels that we had on the racks with new ones (the sign says they would only replace them if they were thrown on the floor), I at least got a sorry but that was it. They replaced the towels that were on the rack, but did not leave enough towels for everyone in the room and no washcloths were replaced. NOT happy about that at all. As others state the breakfast room is the front desk area so no more than 3 people could be in there at the same time and there is no place to sit down and eat. They had cereal, muffins and eggs. We tried the eggs the first day but they smelled and tasted sour so we spit them out and had muffins the rest of the stay. Other posts about parking are correct, we stayed Mon and checked out Thurs, Mon and Tues nights were fine but by Wed night the parking lot was full so we snuck in next door at another inn.

There seem to be just enough spaces for one car per room and we didn't have any problems during our stay but I could see parking being an issue for someone else) -noise (the inn is on a busy intersection, near train tracks and also near the flight path of the San Diego airport. You will hear passing cars most of the time, an occasional train and a plane or two fly over. It's not so bad...more like background noise. If you are sensitive to noise, bring earplugs for when you sleep. We grew up in the city so we are used to background noise and we slept like babies...without earplugs!)

In a way this is the price to be paid for the location \u2013 there are couple of other motels close by and they would have the same issues.

We were three adults and a small child, so I booked a room with two queen beds, and it worked very well. Yes, it was on the first floor, so you can hear all different kind of sounds and noises from outside, but, really, if you are just looking for a place to spend a night, it is fine. Booking tip: I went on the hotel's website to better understand the room types, and saw a \"register as a vip guest\" tab, promising better rates, etc, so, I registered. I got an email confirmaton immediately, but nothing else, really. So I thought, oh well, I'll just book tomorrow at whatever regular rates there are on the website. At that time, I was looking at $99 for the double queen beds room ($89 for the room + $10 for an extra adult). That evening, however, I got a phone call from a sales person from the hotel asking if I still wanted to book - as a VIP guest now - so I did - at the rate of $59 total for the same room! Not too bad at all!! Last, I should mention the complimentary breakfast. Honestly, it's not too bad either. It is served in the smallest-ever \"lobby\", but its plentifulness will surprise you. There was hot (instant) and cold cereal, hard boiled eggs, muffins, oranges, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and orange juice (maybe I'm forgetting something) that one can take without any limit.

I told her I didn't feel comfortable with that because there were signs posted everywhere saying park at your own risk. If I parked my car down the street, I wouldn't be able to see it from my room. She wasn't helpful at all and again was acting very strange. I did not feel comfortable staying at this hotel and the staff wasn't helpful. I felt like a hassel than a guest there.

We were greeted by Andrew who was very friendly with a welcoming sense of humor. He was very good about answering our questions and making sure we got everything that we needed. We were given room 207 which was tucked in the back hallway on the second floor. I've had the \"tucked away\" room in other hotels and have found that they do not always represent what other rooms are like, they are more like an afterthought or an attempt to get one more unit out of a former storage room. This room was decidely better than that. Room 207 is a King bed, \"smoking\" room. I say \"smoking\" in parentheses, because it is actually labled as a non-smoking room and had no ashtrays when we checked in. When we questioned it, we were told that it really was a smoking room and we were given ashtrays. I've had that happen a lot at other hotels so I mention it as a caveat to travelers who insist on a completely non-smoking room. The room was smallish, but very clean and appointed with a sizeable TV, end tables and a table and two chairs. The view was of the wall of the property next door, but I think that was a benefit to reduce the noise of the nearby train tracks. We are not really all that sensitive to noise and found no problem with the train or airport noise. Parking is kind of limited so I wouldn't want to check in too late on a busy weekend. The hotel will suggest off-site parking, but I think it's safer to park at the hotel. The only thing that I questioned was a little note in the bathroom that advised guests to use the red washcloth to remove makeup \"to avoid additional charges\". Apparently they are concerned about stained white wash cloths. I've never seen anything like this in any hotel and thought it was kind of strange. I use white wash cloths at home and find that any detergent works well to remove makeup stains on towels. The motel also assesses a $50 security charge which they refund when you check out. Not sure what that's for - perhaps it has something to do with the notice in the room advising that customers will be charged for anything that turns up missing. The notice actually lists the prices for what they will charge. I initially thought that was a little odd and sort of unfriendly, but I guess it can be a major problem if you're running a little motel. No harm, no foul really. The location is really the best asset of this property. It's an easy walk to the restaurants and attractions of Little Italy and also the Trolley station.

Having two queen beds and a separate bunk bed was great for our sleeping comfort! The hotel location was just right close to all the public transportation (trolley, Amtrak) and one block from the Comic Con bus route, which saves us rental car and parking money. You can hear the trains at times, especially when Amtrak honks its horn. However, we see it as a trade off of convenience and we would rather have the convenience. So overall, it was not a problem for us. I read the reviews by other customers beforehand and remembered John was mentioned as the most friendly staff member. Indeed, he was the one greeted us when we check-in and every morning. He made us feel right at home. The continental breakfast was sufficient for us to do a \"brunch\", there were muffins, coffee, OJ, milk, cereal etc., the best was the hard boiled egg. It was served at their very compacted lobby area, but everything was clean and well-presented. Probably the only thing I would comment is the newly painted kid's suite still has the paint smell, and it could become bothersome if you have the window closed. If you do not open all windows (3) in the room, sometimes the ventillation gets bad.

When we returned to the Marina Inn & Suites for our official check-in a couple hours later, Nisha upon inquiry added to our accommodations with a two-bed, smoking room at no extra charge.

The Marina Inn and Suites definately raises the bar and steps it up a notch. With lots of competition in the area, Marina Inns and Suites definately holds a bar even though it's a fairly small hotel, it still gives you the experience of a major corporate chain. I feel that on a scale between 1 to 5 stars this should be a 4.5 star hotel.

First, the pluses: -GREAT location. It's right off Pacific Highway, next to the waterfront. It's close to great Italian restaurants off India St., and very close to destinations such as the Zoo, Sea World, USS Midway, and Old town. -Tidy rooms. While it was not absolutely spotless, it was overall pretty clean and the furnishings were fine. -Excellent Rates. For under $70, we got a room that could sleep four people. You can't beat that. Now for the minuses.... -While it's close to major attractions, it's also off a busy road and the train tracks, so sometimes the noise at night can be a bother, especially if you are a light sleeper. -The rooms tend to have this weird chemically smell- not sure if it's the air freshener or what, but it was a bit off-putting when you first walk in. -The attendant at the front desk was a bit absent minded. While he was nice and tried to be helpful, he sent us to a sister hotel down the block to pick up discount tickets to local attractions, but it turned out they actually did not have any available. It wasn't a huge deal since it was just down the block, but he did mistakenly assure us it would be there, and this actually happened TWICE.

You could also hear the trolley/Amtrak when it went by from time to time. The hotel itself was fairly clean, but the bed was average and the bathroom was the same size as the bedroom. Not necessary I think - although it would be excellent for wheelchair accessible guests - as it was a room on the ground floor and had a good set up. The service at the front desk was excellent - always friendly and helpful. Make sure to check your rates though - on my weekend night I was charged a higher rate and then the next weekend night I wanted to see if I could get cheaper so I went down the street to the Pacific Inn - they told me they could not give me a good rate, but they could give me a good rate back at the Marina Inn.

Lots of good television stations and the shower and hot water situation was great. (The bathroom in my room was huge! Very nice.) However, it is a noisy location. I was concerned about the airport noise, but that wasn't a problem. The hotel is near the landing path, so the throttles are low and not noisy. The noise problem was with the traffic on Pacific Highway and adjacent streets. The train tracks are also right behind the properyt, but they didn't seem to run the noisy trains after about 10:00 p.m. I brought ear plugs, and those, with the room fan on high, drowned out the noise so that I got a good night's sleep. No complaints about that, but beware! The other thing to note is that they 'nickel and dime' you to death. Don't use the phone (all calls are charged, even credit card calls and 1-800 calls). Make sure you don't drink the bottled water, it's like $2.50 a bottle. Don't use the safe in the room, there is a charge for that!!! Luckily, there is no charge for watching TV or using the shower. I did have a problem with the TV remote, but since I know how to re-program universal remotes, I was able to reset mine.

The lights did not work. We moved to another room and unpacked but found water damage under a major part of the carpet. Vicky Patel told us that she would let us move to the Vagabond Inn, Mission Valley for the same price. Upon entering we were told the rack rate was $129 a night & with an AAA discount it would be $99. The internet displayed the AAA rate as $80.10. But Ms. Patel insisted that for us it would be $159 a night. I informed her that gouging is illegal (penal code 396(d)) & that I am an AAA member. She agreed to $99.

All the while, a six lane road with a never ending parade of vehicles is roaring by while the airport is literally a mile away and there is both a Amtrack line and a Trolley line running 100 yards behind the \u201chotel\u201d. The place was rumbling most of the time. Thankfully the rail lines seemed to not run between midnight and 7:00 am. I felt totally taken advantage of staying at this place. The management was impossible to communicate with and I could do nothing about it; I tried so hard to find another place during my four days here but the only thing I could find was 30 miles away in Carlsbad, CA. If you can tolerate dishonesty, filth, and noisy transportation going by all the time this place is for you; otherwise avoid it at all costs.", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cRough but Fair\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3607411", "Content": "Nobody is perfect, and when you are booking a $100 per night hotel in San Diego you get what you pay for. The service isn't sterling, but it's not outwardly rude either. The Keepers are simply functional in their job duties so if you keep your expectations level you won't be dissapointed. The room was probably a bit below average. I'd measure it at about 10X15 and was very average in it's appointments. The bed was large and fairly comfortable, there was no microwave or coffee maker, but they did give me an iron and board for my entire 5 day stay. Basically the room was cramped but not uncomfortable. The location has it's ups and downs as well. Planes land less than a mile away and the train runs about 100 yards in the other direction. Pacific Blvd is never quiet and the neighborhood isn't upscale. That said - I never felt as though my sleep was interrupted or that I was in a particularly seedy part of town. The bottom line here is that if you book this place you have no business expecting top tier appointments and service. It's a $100 motel in San Diego. I enjoyed my stay knowing that the extra C-note per night was spent on enjoying my time in one of America's best cities.", "Date": "June 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clovis, CA", "Title": "\u201cRude Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3533341", "Content": "The staff was rude on the phone and they hung up on me when I called to confirm my reservation (they reserved the wrong room type).
