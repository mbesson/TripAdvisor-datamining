There are so many reasons to recommend this hotel I thought the easiest way to sum up the hotel is to do a list of pro's and con's:- Pro's:- 1.) You can self park for free. 2.) It has a great and reasonably priced cafe - everything purchased was top notch - It also gives a cheaper alternative to breakfast if you don't want to eat lots. 3.) It's very family friendly. 4.) The Espresso Coffee machine in the room is by far the best coffee machine I've ever had in a hotel. 5.) There's no resort fee, as is charged in many other high class resorts. 6.) The staff are exceptionally friendly and professional. 7.) The rooms are very classy and immaculately clean. 8.) The beds are extremely comfortable. 9.) The pools are all heated and refreshments are served at the poolside. 10.) The grounds are large and are safe and excellent for family walks. 11.) There's lots to do for all the family - Horse Riding/Tennis/Swimming/Hikes/Special Events arranged by the hotel - in our case an egg hunt for the kids on Easter Sunday. 12.) Great Restaurant - We ate in Amaya and found it was excellent. 13.) Free Raspberry Lemonade (Tasted amazing!) / Peach Lemonade was served with biscuits in the lobby area from 3-5pm each day for free - a very nice touch! 14.) Free coffee was served by the concierge desk in the morning before 9am. 15.) Free Wifi. Con's:- 1.) It's expensive (But in my opinion worth it!). 2.) It's a drive away from Downtown San Diego. 3.) The activities are a bit on the pricey side. I would recommend the Grand Del Mar without hesitation as one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.

It is hard to capture the essence of this place in a review. This has to be one of the best hotels in America. I have stayed at Four Seasons, Ritz-Carltons and other five star resorts through out the country and have never experienced more sincere and exemplary service. Every staff member was warm, friendly, and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. The grounds are unbelievably beautiful and serene. Within moments of arriving there, I could feel the stresses and anxieties of everyday life start to melt away. This is a very upscale and luxurious hotel and initally I was afraid that it may be a snooty environment. It was anything but. I traveled with my three children and we were made to feel very comfortable and welcome. We dressed casually and never felt out of place. Some specific details about the hotel that may help as you make your travel plans are: * Very kid friendly and loads of kids activities. My kids simply loved the explorers club. However, we stayed during spring break and the place was teeming with children. I get the sense that there may be significantly less kids during off-peak times * several complimentary daily activities. We did a guided canyon to waterfall hike and a fantastic zumba class * The resort is not in a walkable area, however there is complimentary transportation to the beach and within a 14 mile radius of the hotel In conclusion, This is an amazing resort. It will exceed your highest expectations. The property is gorgeous and immaculate and the service is genuinely friendly and exceptional. I hope I get the opportunity to go back.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cRefined Elegance and a hotel that sweats the small stuff\u201d", "Author": "Lee C", "ReviewID": "UR127327459", "Content": "After a massive tour of SF, Santa Cruz, LA and then San Diego, the highlight of the trip was the oasis called The Grand Del Mar. San Diego is a great spot, and coming to a hotel that understands its location, surroundings and most importantly guests personas makes the premier hotel in the North SD area. Tucked away in Carmel Valley, this gem on the side of the hill, surrounded by an amazing golf course is like an onion you peel away and find better and better layers as you dive deeper. Location is one of the best in SD. Not too far for exploring and close to Torrey Pines and the best beaches in SD. Also you miss a lot of the \"merge\" of the 805 and 5 traffic. Hospitality is top notch. Service is super-friendly, not pretentious and everyone from the front desk to housekeeping was ultra friendly. I give this place the US - Uber-Service award. Smiles everywhere, and great attitudes. Amenities are outstanding. from the mango lemonade and cookies at reception to the chocolate covered Oreos at night by your bed. Rose pedals, complementary bottled water in your room and so much more. They really don't miss anything here and it seems so natural. One of the best beds I have slept in and the only thing I would suggest is that they upgrade the flat panel signal to HD. Food in the downstairs restaurant was excellent for breakfast and the complementary coffee in the little and yet very well stocked cafe area was a welcomed treat at 6:30a when reading the paper overlooking the adult pool. Yes there are many pools and activities, like a great spa, gym etc. Lastly I will say that I had the pleasure of staying here once before when Vh1 Divas was held in San Diego.

It is simply flawless. The service is perfect from the moment you bring your car to the valet, then on to reception, then on to the bellmen, houskeeping and the waistaff in the restaurants as well as all the supporting staff of a great hotel, spa and resort. The folks in charge of this establishment have created a superb culture of service that is consistently rendered with dignity, a complete lack of obsequiesness, and perfect performance and timing. My wife and I are travelers, high end travelers. We only stay at 4 (reluctantly) and 5 star properties. We have been doing this for 30 years. We have been doing this all over the world. We love to travel. We love high end properties. We both agree that this may be, overall, all aspects considered, the best property we have ever stayed at. This takes some thought and a good memory. We spent an entire evening reviewing our experiences and the meals we have had. We may have missed something but we stand by the notion that the Grand is, as it's name implies, THE Grand. If you are wealthy - you have nothing to worry about - you can stay here anytime. If you are middle to upper middle class - stay here while you can. Once the economy recovers and the reputation of the Grand builds, you will be priced out of this particular piece of paradise. And do eat at one of the two wonderful restauarnts. While the food at Addisons was, as espected, fautless, it was not our style. We prefer Amaya - a truely first class culinary experience that is without the minimalism that comes with many of today's absolutely top culinary establishments (which Addison's surely is amongst.)

Every aspect of this property is exceptional. We were immediately impressed by the level of personal service and recognition. When we drove up to the gates, the security guard inquired about our stay before directing up to the hotel. The valet knew our names from the note the security guard left under the wiper. The check-in attendant walked us to our room where our bags were already waiting with the bellhop who walked us through the room to introduce the ammenities and overall layout of the grounds. At the restaurant, the hostess inquired our names and actually remembered them throughout our stay. Wow... Our room was large, spacious and beautifully appointed with woods, granites and marble. Needless to say the room was spotless. There is a large flatscreen TV in the main room and a second small TV in the bathroom if you wanted to watch TV or listen to music in the bath. The closet was essentially a walk-in configuration. We had a third floor room with a balcony opening onto a court yard. The room was incredibly well insulated for noise. I'm sure we had neighbors, but I had no idea they were there, and we didnt pick up any outside noise through the heavy balcony doors. As a light sleeper, I can honestly say this was one of the best sleeps I ever had at a hotel. We were visiting over spring break, and the intent was to visit the several amusement / theme parks in the region. My son opted to skip Disneyland to chill-out at the hotel pool!! Now we have another reason to come back... The Grand del Mar is a golf resort. The grounds are immaculate and although we are not golfers, we were impressed with the course surrounding the hotel. Perhaps next time we visit, we will opt for lessons through their pro-shop. The hotel has 4 pools and two hot-tubs. One area is reserved for adults and cellphones are prohibited (discouraged), with a large pool, hot-tub and bar. The other area contains 3 pools including a shallow kids pool and a small hot-tub. This family area also has a full bar with meal service. The hotel offers a baby-sitting service while the adults go for a round of golf, and there is also a daily program for kids. For older kids / teens, there is of course golf, as well as tennis courts and an equestrian facility. Pony rides can apparently be arranged for small kids, while trail rides and even riding lessons are offered for older kids / teens. There is a spa which we didnt utilize on this trip. There are several restaurants on the grounds and a cafe / gift-shop. We dined at Amaya. Food quality and preparation was excellent. They have a vegetarian dinner menu and will make minor modifications to their dishes to suit guests tastes. The breakfast menu is more limited in terms of offering vegetarian or non-dairy options. Pool-side meal options were relatively extensive. As expected, the Grand is pricey, especially if you throw-in a bunch of activities and opt to dine on-site throughout your stay. But if you want to treat yourself to an experience, we recommend this property.

From the time we arrive and the time we depart, there isn't a minute that we don't feel pampered or treated like royalty. So many staff members recognize us and address us personally which is hard to find these days at many large impersonal hotels.

I want to preface by saying that I have stayed in a number of other top notch resorts (Ojai Valley Inn and Spa, Ritz Carlton, JW Marriott, La Quinta Reosrt and Spa, etc.) and none can compare. I will try to break it down for you all... Hotel and Checkin- This is a unique resort in that it is nestled in a gated community. I have never stayed here before and did not know anyone that has (much less heard of it). Upon driving up and valeting (pricey $30 per night), i was impressed to see a beautifully ornate lobby. Check in was a breeze. I requested a connecting room with the other family and that was quickly arranged. The receptionists actually greeted each of my children and offered them a toy from their treasure chest (never seen that before). He then walked us to the bellman and proceeded to lead us to the elevator. Very nice touch. Rooms: The rooms were on the 2nd floor. Beautifully decorated (made me feel as if I was staying in a palace). The bathroom was large and contained the closet. The bathroom was so large that we were able to put the pack n' play in their for my baby to sleep in. Each room had an espresso machine, as well as complimentary bottled water. Grounds: Immaculate. Very Very clean. Everything was in place. The pool area was very nice and even had soft white sand around the lounge chairs. They incorporated the golf course nicely and there were amazing views every where you look. Food/bar: We tried the snack shop (same kitchen as Amaya) once and Amaya twice (Dinner and Breakfast). The food was amazing everytime. Amaya for dinner had a great selection of food. I was not disappointed with anything that I tasted. They also have a huge selection of wine and scotch (my favorite). The lobby bar was great and I had my first taste of Absinthe there. The best thing I had was the complimentary cookie (and bottle of milk) that was provided during the turn-down service. Absolutely wonderful Golf: The course was in beautiful condition (even though it was at its prime condition). IT is pretty pricey but worth a shot if you are a golf fan. They included a fore caddie (my first experience with one) which made the experience wonderful. The practice facility was top notch (ProV-1 practice balls). Food/drink can be brought to you at anytime during your round. The course is private and closed to the public, thus the rounds are pretty fast pace and never crowded. Awesome golf experience. Spa: My wife is a self-proclaimed spa connoisseur and proclaims this to be one of the greatest spas that she has ever been too. Well ahead of the highly rated Ojai Valley Inn and Spa and on par with the Montage (Laguna Hill). She couldn't stop talking about the facility and service. Service: I have saved the best for last. The service is top notch. First class all around. I was expecting a snooty/snobby resort, but I could never have been more wrong. From the bellman to the waitress to the golf person to the cleaning lady, everyone was extremely polite and pleasant. Upon driving up, I initially laughed at the idea that this resort was \"family friendly\". I thought my family would be stared at and treated rudely, however, I could never have been more wrong. They bent over backwards to cater to my kids and family. They brought over a crib (with baby supplies) immediately. They found out it was my son's birthday and made him feel special the entire stay. They sent up a birthday dessert to the room. They gave him a gelato coupon (as well as one for each member of the family). He felt special the whole stay. There were also so many perks at this resort. I have also never been to a resort that offered 2 hrs of baby sitting (in the explorer club) while you are at your spa treatment. The wives and kids took advantage of the free shuttle (Mercedes Sprinter) to the local mall. Lastly, during our dinner at Amaya, everyone we encountered treated my family as if we were royalty. It wasn't the obvious things that caught my eye, but it was the attention to small details that amazed me. For example, my son was curious about our champagne, so the waiter went and put some Sprite in a decanter and pour it into a champagne glass for them (how awesome is that!). I can't say enough about their service... Sorry for the long detail, but as you can see, I thoroughly enjoyed our visit. I can honestly say that you will get what you pay for at this resort.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLike Italy in San Diego!\u201d", "Author": "1VintageRacer", "ReviewID": "UR124902202", "Content": "Five star hotel, dinners and golf.

They have a seven course tasting menu with wine pairing as well as a soft drink pairing - wonderful fruit juices specially mixed for each of the different courses. The food was divine. We stayed in for hours. The rooms were very reasonably priced. However, just one complaint, breakfasts were eye wateringly expensive. It was something ridiculous like $12 for a bread roll.

I was on the first floor and had patio access to a large shared lawn. Bathroom had bathtub, shower, and separate toilet.

I also had an excellent Cobb Salad in the Amaya Restaurant on site, with some of the best lemonade i've ever tasted. We had one dinner at Addison, their signature restaurant, which was delicious and coupled with great local wines. I would highly recommend a meal there if staying at the hotel. Afterwards, go downstairs to Club M for some music and drinks. There's a great selection of on-site amenities including several pools, hiking trails, gym, horseriding, and a fun golf course. The golf course should get a better selection of left-handed rental clubs, as i was left with a mediocre set, with regular flex shafts and missing a putter (later brought to me on hole 5). What stood out the most during this stay was the level of service. Staff are trained very well and very respectful and assist in all possible ways.

When I saw it was ranked #2 in US resorts (I believe that was the category) I felt I needed to weigh in. While this resort is very nice, it wouldn't be my top pick in the whole country. The room is beautifully furnished, but not that big. I don't know that I'd want to stay there for longer than a few days before I'd feel like we were on top of each other. The bathroom was certainly the best part of the room -- spacious and well appointed. But the opening into the room made no sense to me. Our \"shutters\" closing this opening kept popping open and we had to have housekeeping come and fix them closed. As other reviewers have noted, some of the rooms have no usable balcony, which was unfortunately the case with our room. Why would you not have a space in some of the rooms where you could sit and enjoy the lovely scenic grounds? Yes, the service is outstanding and they truly want to help you however they can. All staff was friendly, saying hello in the halls. About the halls -- our room was way at the end of the building so we spent a long time walking in freezing halls. When the temperature is only the low 70's I couldn't understand why they over air conditioned the halls. Thankfully we were here with a business group and someone else was picking up the tab. I inquired about additional nights and found it is very expensive. It is a very nice resort, but I didn't feel it was worth the price. The main reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that we were consistently disappointed by the food. We had a few dinners and cocktail parties, and there were flaws with each meal. Perhaps I am being picky, but if it's a top resort the food should be great too. We had better meals in the town of Del Mar. The activities they offered were a wonderful addition to our stay -- I took a canyon hike and had friends who took fitness classes.

Great Service, Though\u201d", "Author": "drustrange", "ReviewID": "UR122743353", "Content": "I stay in San Diego / Carlsbad are a couple of times a year, and I've had some disappointing experiences in the hotels; my guess is that with the neve-rending supply of tourists the hotels have a steady stream of customers no matter how bad they are. Over the years this has led me up the food chain of hotels in the area, culminating this past Thanksgiving with a 5-day stay at the Grand Del Mar. Location: Far from the city proper and the beach. Think of it as a retreat. First impression upon driving up: I know someone's going to tell you it's chic, but the Grand Del Mar looks like the architectural love child of Hearst Castle and a Rapallo waterfront hotel. Car valet: I don't grok the \"cars impart status\" meme. I drive a Subaru Forester - very practical. After driving down I-5 from San Fran, my car looked like a dirty little troll next to all the Escalades, Mercedes, Audis, and BMWs in front of the Del Mar. Whatever. Front desk: Impeccable service at check-in. We asked for accommodations near the adult pool. Because I'd asked for a suite and one wasn't available, they gave us a room with an unusually large balcony. Thank you, front desk man. A+ Room: The room was extremely clean and about 1.5x the size of a typical hotel room, with fresh furnishings and upholstery. The bed was too soft for my taste but other people will probably like it. The bathroom was modern and spacious as well - lots of stone and glass and mirrors but didn't tip over into the Vegas Zone. Shampoos and lotions were of good quality. Overall, the room met expectations given the price. Room service: Completely awesome. Everything we ordered was always correct, on time, warm, well-prepared, and well-presented. Pool: I often choose hotels because I want to do lap swimming. The Del Mar's adult pool (they call it the Quiet Pool) was definitely usable for this purpose. It's longer than 25 meters, super clean, and non-crowded in November (I was often the only one in the pool). However, it's way too warm for exercise. Also, there was new age music playing *underwater* at one end of the pool, which was a little weird till I figured out that I wasn't experiencing auditory hallucinations. After my swim an attendant unobtrusively brought me a glass of ice water, which was a first for me and a very nice touch. He also brought a menu, and if the day had been warmer I'd have ordered lunch and some sort of fruity cocktail - the pool area just puts you in that sort of mood. Overall, I'd give the Quiet Pool and its surroundings an A for design and service, B- for lap swimming. Grounds: Cutesy, utterly non-creative landscape-design. Very well-manicured. Lots of courtyards, fountains, gazebos, tiny privet hedges, rose trees, citrus in amphorae, and other cliche'd frou-frou, but it's restful to the eye. There's a croquet lawn with a St. Francis statue, and we often saw people playing, which was anachronistically delightful. I very much enjoyed watching the Brits turning croquet into an extreme sport... don't ask. B- for the grounds because they was sort of fun to stroll through. Once. Addison restaurant: We had Thanksgiving dinner at Addison. The food was very good but no way was it worth $600 for two people. Service was good but a little slow - I'd give them a pass on this because it was Thanksgiving, but the restaurant was over half empty. I checked the prices on the wines we were offered on my phone: they were selling $18 bottles of wine for $80+. Not unusual, I guess, but I wouldn't eat here again. Amaya restaurant: We had brunch and lunch on Amaya's heated patio several times - everything was delicious and the service was great. They even brought a water bowl for our dog, and let him sit under the table while we ate. Top notch casual dining! A+! Golf course: Dunno. The grass was green and rolling and there were holes here and there for balls to roll in and dudes dressed all preppy and plaid-y driving little clown cars around. Some people like this sort of thing. Hiking and horseback riding: Ok, this is not a hiking destination but we were traveling with our dog, and he's large and needs exercise. So I took him out on the Del Mar's horseback riding trails. I appreciated the convenience of having a trail on-site. The horseback riding is for the kiddies: just a couple extremely agreeable horses, and some short trails 'round the golf course. Kids under 12 will like it fine. Hiking D-, dog-walking A, horses B+. Dog friendly: Their website says they're dog-friendly, and before booking my reservation I called to confirm - we were showing up on Thanksgiving day and I didn't want to have any problems. The agent assured me that our dog would be welcome. And sure enough, when we checked in, nobody raised an eyebrow when we walked in with our 80-lb Rottie mix. HOWEVER. In our room, the binder of hotel services said that they only welcome dogs under 25 lbs. Nobody questioned us or gave us a hard time in the 5 days we were there, but we were *aware* that he wasn't really supposed to be there. It cast a bit of a pall on our whole stay. One big demerit to the Del Mar for not stating this on their website or when I called. Overall, the hotel was expensive but served up the value. The food at Amaya and from room service was very good. The room was nice and the pool was usable for lap swimming. The place is a tad clubby / smug with itself, but after 5 days I felt relaxed and as if I had been well cared for, so I might return anyway.

The grounds are immense and perfectly landscaped. Even the golf course has waterfalls, a stream, and colorful flowers everywhere. I love the fact that you can \"self park\" your car FOR NO CHARGE! What a wonderful option for those of us who are quite capable of walking to our car, and do not like paying $20.00-$35.00(Four Seasons, Vail)a day to park our car. Every hotel should have this option available, and not just tell visitors they have no choice. Hurrah for the Grand del Mar on this matter. The lobby has various designs of marble flooring, classical furniture and wallhangings, and fresh flowers.The intercom system has nice Spanish music playing, even in the elevators! Right off of the lobby is a formal living area, library, and cocktail lounge. Stunning! Check-in went smoothly, and I \"held my breath\" that our room would be in a good location. When we walked in we were overwhelmed with the grandeur and opulence of the room. We have stayed in several Ritz Carlton's, some incredible hotels on 4 Hawaiian islands, as well as gorgeous properties in Mexico, and this one was the nicest by far. We lucked out for sure with a perfect location. Alot of grand hotels have fabulous grounds and commom areas, but the rooms are just regular- not this hotel! The bathroom had a large marble tub, large shower, closeted toilet, two sinks with a television in between the mirrors, a chandalier, and pass-through space that can be opened/closed as desired, opening the bath area to the bedroom. Marble, marble everywhere- \"Wow\"! The closet is substantial, has a safe, and bath robes. There was a mini-bar in the room hallway, but no microwave. The room was large, and the bed was extremely comfortable. My very favorite part was opening the sliding glass doors to find a large balcony\" looking out\" onto a huge courtyard, with a view of some plush homes on the hillside nearby. It was as if we were actually on the French Riviera. Our room was on the 3rd floor, and we couldn't have been happier. Instead of putting a tag on the doorknob for privacy or service needed, you punch a button that lights up in the hallway next to the door. Green light-room needs cleaning/ Red light-privacy please. Brillant idea! Because we had eaten a late lunch before checking in, we decided to order room service for a change. It was tasty, delivered promptly on a cart with a white tablecloth and flowers, and just nice to enjoy our room that night. This was the only good food we had from the hotel. The next morning, after getting espressos from the hotel coffee bar, we decided to \"take a tour\".The property is so large, that it took us about 2 hours just to walk around ! We kept saying \"Wow\" over and over. The golf course is right next door, and there are some privately owned Villa style homes adjacent to the main building. If any of you are planning a very special wedding, I'd highly recommend the Grand del Mar!They have a quaint European style chapel right on the property, and many rooms to choose for a reception, not to mention the outside covered areas with fireplaces and firepits.. You will be \"living like Royalty\" ! There is an olympic size \"adult's only\" pool, which is next to the hotel spa. Servers bring out chair cushions, towels, and drinks/snacks.The family pool was in another area, and the children seemed to be having a great time. We stayed at the adult pool, then took a walk on the path that goes around the property-peaceful, quiet, and as if we were in Tuscany. The only disappointing part of this visit was the food in the restaurants. We ate lunch at the golf club, sitting outside to enjoy the cool,\" sunshiny\" day. Our cocktails were fine, but the fish tacos were terrible, and I mean awful ! There were 4 small uncooked white shells, with a few morsels of grilled fish on each, topped by some tasteless white cabbage. No pico de gallo, no sour cream, no guacamole, no red cabbage or special sauce, It was bland and tasteless. We were very disappointed. That evening we ate at one of the hotel restaurants, and again were very disappointed in the food. It was nice sitting outside near a firepit, being able to gaze at the moon and stars, and smell the fresh air. However I could barely finish my dinner. To be honest, I don't even remember what I had, and my husband call tell you that I can verbally recite every superb meal I have ever had, even 20 years ago, in full detail. Both of us disappointed again. If we are in the area again we will definitely splurge (over $400.00 a night) for two nights and stay here again, but will go elsewhere for lunch and dinner. You may want to \"check out\" on the internet nearby places to eat that are good. The concierges were extremely friendly and efficient, but were hesitant to recommend nearby restaurants. Naturally the hotel wants visitors to stay there and eat at the hotel's restaurants.. Everything was expensive, and the food just wasn't worth the high price. We \"saved up\" a few years ago to stay at the Highlands Inn in Carmel, which was romantic and unique, and now we also have special memories of this\" splurge stay\" at the Grand del Mar.

Our room was extremely comfortable with a wonderful bathroom and a view onto the courtyard. We ate salted caramel gelato every afternoon from their caf\u00e9. This caf\u00e9 also made quality pour-over coffee\u2026 excellent for the (very) early morning caffeine fix. This is really necessary when you have a toddler. They used Peerless Coffee, and I am going to look up the site to buy some more after writing this review. The fitness center was great. It could be better lit (I \u201cget it\u201d in terms of spa-ambience). They had lots of room and equipment. We\u2019ve stayed at The Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, Club Meds, Exclusive Resorts\u2026 I have to say that this is, by far, the best hotel we\u2019ve stayed at in the US... Outside the US, Exclusive Resorts -Costa Rica still beats it, but I think that\u2019s because of the other amenities and amazing food we had in Costa Rica (see below). A few things to work on: 1.The Amaya restaurant is okay at best. A little too bland and the portions too big when they\u2019re trying so hard. I ate the crab cakes benedict and it was\u2026 meh. That said, the staff was amazing with our son. They were so incredibly nice to him. I felt that they instinctively knew where the power really was in the family! The kids menu was simple and wonderful, and therefore, actually better than the adult menu. I think that Amaya would do well to focus on excellent.simple.organic.food. I wouldn\u2019t care if the prices stayed the same. 2.The staff at Club M could be a little more courteous. They seemed to be disconnected with the other eating establishments on the grounds in terms of quality of service. (A very hilarious side-note about the perception of Club M by my local friends from La Jolla\u2026 They referred to Club M as the perfect pouncing territory for \u201cCougars\u201d and golf caddies. So funny.) 3.We did valet every day/night. Complete ignorance on our part, but they had a garage conveniently attached to the hotel. We didn\u2019t find this out until our very last night. It was truly a \u201cduh\u201d moment. FYI: $25 per night. 4.The place is HUGE. It took me 2 days to finally understand how to get back to my room. I think it would be a great investment to work on better signage and the map provided to guests. Every hallway looked the exact same (gorgeous framed tile and oil paintings of sheep), it was a little freaky at first\u2026 but then I figured out the maze\u2026", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dana Point", "Title": "\u201c5 Star all the way\u201d", "Author": "Love_Dana_Point", "ReviewID": "UR120018032", "Content": "This resort is fantastic from the moment you step onto the property you know you are somewhere special.

I'm not sure how old the property is, but gives off a vibe that it is an institution that has been giving 5 star service to hotel clients forever. It is charming and yet grandiose all at the same time. Attention to detail is reflected from the staff (concierge, front desk, bellmen, wait staff, pool staff, etc) to the designs on the moulding on the ceiling of the room. They somehow manage to decorate boldly (gold, patterns, tassles) withOUT seeming gaudy or overdone. It's warm and welcoming. I tend to rate hotels based more on staff than amenities, so I will say that I received the BEST service at this hotel... at least as good as any hotel I've ever been in... and I have been in the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong, the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon (Hong Kong), Intercontinentals, Four Seasons, etc. Every person we came into contact with were both courteous and respectful. When they happened to ask you if you needed something, and you did NOT need something, they neither push for you to ask them if you need anything nor do they make you feel like you're wasting their time by sitting in their area and not doing anything. (it's a subtle line that they all seemed to do very well) Our family of three went (me, wife and 18 month old son) and they included a wooden crib in the room. When I had made the reservation, I included our son's name, and the crib had bedding that was geared toward boys. They also included a small bag of bath materials for babies, including soap, wash clothes, and toys ... these were complimentary. a VERY nice touch! Complimentary bottles of water were included in the room. They have 4 pools.... 1 adults only (18 and over), 2 large family friendly pools, and 1 smaller pool that is only 1 foot deep -- great for kids / babies. This is GREAT for kids. And yet, you never ever feel like this is a pool for families with kids running around. They seem to treat everyone like an adult with admiration and respect -- even our 18 month old! Upon checkout, they gave our son a small beanie baby toy. another great touch! We stayed in a Prado suite overlooking the golf course... it seems as though originally they were two individual rooms, and they knocked out a doorway. Made one half into a King size bedroom, and the other into the living room. Both bathrooms remained. The entire hotel is spectacularly appointed. The shops are overpriced, and there is not much to do there... We went to Sea World the next day and it was only about a 15 minute drive. I recommend checking in early, using the pool or spa or whatever relaxation facilities you'd like to use... enjoy the grounds, enjoy the hotel. Then the next day you can go off and explore or enjoy the San Diego activities as much as you like. It's not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of San Diego, and it's not near the beach...but in my opinion, as long as you'll have this to come back to at the end of the activity filled day, you really can't go wrong. You won't mind driving back here at the end of the day.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBrideshead for SoCal!\u201d", "Author": "MadeItBackHome", "ReviewID": "UR118679254", "Content": "This place is ridiculous.

There are more staff than guests, but you quickly get used to it being your own home. Another great thing about off-peak are the packages - suites normally running $700 go for $500 or less. There are two main restaurants: Amaya is \"casual\" but terrific, while Addison is over the top - inspired by the French Laundry with a 10-course degustation (6, 4 and 3 course options are available) and a wine list running fully 190 pages. I recommend stopping by the afternoon of your meal and borrowing a copy of the wine list - that's the only way you can spend the necessary time. They have bottles from $60 to $12,000 (1982 Petrus).

Every single one was very courteous and \"went the extra mile\". The one thing I chuckled about was the fact that almost every employee uses the word \"Absolutely\" and \"Perfect\". They do make you feel special there. We were celebrating our anniversary and within an hour of our arrival, champagne and a fancy little dessert were delivered to our room. Laura, the girl that delivered it, remembered me from our visit last year. Besides room service, we dined at Amaya, which was also very delicious. We requested Brian for our server. He waited on us last year and he was really a delight. My husband likes to \"talk sports\" and Brian was up to the task. Brian remembered us and recalled that we were from Las Vegas and even recalled a health issue that my husband experienced last year. The lobster bisque and butter lettuce salad was excellent, as well as their pretzel bread. Two nights we had casual fare in the Lobby Bar. Kellie was our server and was very efficient.

They will permit you to order from the Amaya menu and will serve you in the bar, in case you don't feel like dressing up a little for Amaya. Although, I have to say, that a lot of people were dressed very casual at Amaya. We did purchase some snacks and coffee drinks at Cent Anni, their coffee shop. I had the best iced vanilla chai latte. I had never had one before and it was great. The only thing we were not impressed with was their Concierge personnel. They did not seem on par with the level of service that we received from everyone else. Also, they gave us some misinformation regarding valet parking at a downtown restaurant.

A balcony overlooks the adult only pool area and is beautifully furnished. At the risk of sounding as if I am employed by the hotel, this is one of the nicest rooms I have experienced anywhere. Breakfast is a wonderful time of morning at the Del Mar. Choose to eat on the terrace and there will be no disappointments. The food is outstanding and fairly priced. Ditto lunch. As expected, the staff makes it perfect. The grounds are beyond belief. This property is perfectly maintained and a sight to behold. Two pools. I frequented the adult only side which is 25 meters long and perfect for laps. A large hot tub type pool is adjacent. The pool furniture is very comfortable. The pool food wasn't great but the staff was very attentive and professional. The gym is fully equipped with an excellent selection of free weights and machines, as well as cardio equipment. There is also a yoga studio with daily classes. Rest assured that the Grand Del Mar is one of the nicest hotels in North America.

The pool service was the only area that needed improvement as it did take quite a while to get a waitperson and she was not versed in the menu. It was just as well as I ended up having lunch at their 'casual restaurant' which had the best $14 hamburger I've ever had. The waiter was great. Served hot bread (rolls and breadsticks freshly baked) and fresh butter. His suggestion of the grilled garlic lime shrimp salad was wonderful. They use freshly ground angus beef (sirloin) and it came rare as desired and the bun was homemade. The dinner at Addison was also wonderful - the highlight being an incredible cheese gougere served as one of three amuse bouches. An explosion of cheese was like a mouth orgasm. Loved it. The lamb however - supposedly a 'signature dish' was oddly sweet and bland and lacked juice. Not recommended. The sweet pea ravioli was lovely - almost as good as Spago. All the vegetarian options were very creative and highly recommended. Excellent King Crab first course. The rooms were well designed, beds extremely comfortable - outfitted with Pratesi sheets. Great bathroom. There was an annoying green light above the bed (smoke alarm?) that was poorly positioned for people who like a dark environment. I would suggest that housekeeping provide eye masks on request. The feel of the place was like a wonderful Italian palace - lavish and opulent and yet warm and inviting. Perfect place to feel pampered and less than 2 hours from Los Angeles.

This is our second visit, but on the first we were with a corporate group, so we did not really get to experience the full treatment until this visit. We are already trying to figure out how we can get back here soon. My take on the place Resort - smacks of luxury from the moment you hit the gate and the long drive up the canyon. While located in an area that has various subdivisions, you never know it once you get on the property (save the homes dotting the ridgelines on either side). Fantastic golf course, tennis courts and pool areas - one adult, 3 family pools. Furnishings, marble, layout, lobby, restaurants, lounge - everything is done exceptionally well. A friend commented that some fine European resorts have taken decades to acheive the level that the GDM has achieved in only a few years. Service - top shelf. From the valet, to check in, the bell hop, everyone is just super. The teenagers wanted smores and they did not have any. Problem? Nope, they loaded them into the house car and off to the 24 hour Vons for smores fixins. Needless to say, the kids are ruined for life, but heck, its vacation. Room- We had a Prado suite which was even better than we hoped for. 1 bedroom suite, but the trick is it has 2 full size bathrooms. Critical when traveling with a teenage girl and a wife who each have their own bathroom routine. I would not get a bigger suite if it did not have that second batroom. Kid is on a pull out, but she says its actually more comfortable than she expected, Furnishings and details inside are all top shelf as well, Only letdown for the device laden family we are - not enough outlets! Food - Did not try their 5 star offering, Addison, but the Amaya was great. See separate review for it, Even the appetizers by the pool were well done. Wine list in the lounge is also quite good. Excellent list of single malts and they have cigars as well as a smoking balcony. Activities - you name it, they have it. Concierge arranged kayaking, snorkleing, horseback riding on the trails surrounding the resort, a beach trip (complete with umbrella, charis etc.). First class all around. I am a runner and if you like trail running you are in luck. The resorts own Shaw Trail connects into the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve on the other side of the south ridge. Lots of climbing but world class trail running, mountain biking and equestrian trails, Fitness Center - very, very good.

We take a family trip each year and have visited Maui (Kea Lani and Ritz Carlton), Grand Caymon (Ritz Carlton), and taken a Mediterranean and Alaskan Cruise with post-cruise stays at Four Seasons Vancouver. The level of service we received during our stay from top to bottom was head and shoulders above the rest. Upon arrival you immediately feel welcome and at check-in we helped ourselves to a snack of cookies and fruit juice and the delivery of our luggage was very prompt. A call to Housekeeping for more hangars took about five minutes at the most and they provided me with more than I requested. As we walked the beautiful grounds we were immediately relaxed and took in all of the scenic lawns, gardens and firepit areas. Our room was on the second floor (three floors total) and overlooked one of the firepit areas which I noticed in the evening would be popular with guests quietly sipping a glass of wine or just visiting. Each morning my husband and I would play tennis on one of their two courts and either had breakfast at Club M on the weekend or grabbed a quick bite at the Cent Anni Cafe. If looking for a quick and less expensive option, visit Cent Anni as one morning I had a bowl of oatmeal for $5, I believe, and it was served on white china with brown sugar, almonds, and raisins. Others in the family said that the sandwiches served there were delicious. Several of us also enjoyed Amaya for breakfast and dinner as well as the poolside lunch service. We did not try Addison. A few examples of their exemplary service include: 1. Opening Gift Shop up at 10 p.m. so that my niece could get aloe vera for her sunburn. 2. Locating a family member's cane which was lost somewhere within the Resort. 3. Delivering contact solution to another niece who forgot to pack hers in the suitcase. 4. Reserving a few areas for family pics taken by a photographer on our last day. I could go on and on but each and every Grand Del Mar staff member had an attitude of \"How may I help you\" and \"We can get that done\". The rooms are gorgeous and we loved the window which opens (or can be shut at night) between the bedroom and bathroom and, of course, my husband loved the tv built into the bathroom mirror. Housekeeping was very efficient and the chocolate covered oreos and gourmet chocolates left on the bed at night were a very nice touch as well as the comp. bottled water. Also, the beds were ultra-comfy. Mid-week they knocked on the door to switch out the padded seat cushions for our balcony chairs. They almost seem to anticipate your needs. One afternoon they set up tables, chairs, and umbrellas to present a wildlife display for the kids with an armadillo, boa constrictor, horned bull frog among others which amused not only my younger nieces and nephews but a few of the adults as well. The fresh lemonade served to all was a nice touch. The amount of activities available within the resort could keep you busy; however, if visiting the area for the first time you will want to visit the Zoo, Legoland, downtown San Diego, etc. They will provide you with precise directions if you drive anywhere or if it is within fourteen miles they can provide comp. car service. It is best to plan ahead so that you are able to reserve the shuttle or car service as I believe quite a few make use of this attractive amenity. Have to mention the mini hot tub for the kiddies. So cute and popular with my nieces and nephews. In closing the Grand Del Mar is the place to stay whether you just want to relax or as a base for sightseeing. We drove south to downtown San Diego and north to Carlsbad and both places took appr. 25-28 minutes as long as we were not driving during rush hour traffic. La Jolla is very close (fifteen minutes) and the village of Del Mar has a lot of nice restaurants and is a twelve minute drive. We went in between the San Diego Fair and Del Mar Thoroughbread Racing Season so traffic was not as congested.

It is attempting to be more gastronomic than it truly was. I think a different type of menu would be a good contrast to having the highly rated Addison and the chef isn't up to the menu presented. Also, the management of the restaurant was a bit off. We were kept waiting for 30 minutes for our reservation one night, yet there were many empty tables. Also, the large banquettes inside are horrible, awkward shapes for conversation with spotlights beaming down. The only people I would imagine enjoying these are the middle aged men with their 20 something mall chick girlfriends who were seated in two of them one night we were there.

Excellent artists, amazing sound system and attentive service. But, most of all what was impressive were the people - to a person they were all amazing - from the porters, valets, front desk, food service teams, golf pros and pool attendants to the housekeepers in the hallways. Somehow the Grand found every genuinely nice person in San Diego and has recruited them to work here! I thought it was high priced (compared to our usual trips) when I booked it but by the time we checked out I thought it was a bargain for all the value and warmth we received over three days. We will always look back fondly on our anniversary weekend spent here and will be returning to enjoy it again soon.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cGrand Del Mar\u201d", "Author": "clyons24542001", "ReviewID": "UR114252231", "Content": "Fantastic property set in the hills and grove lands of Southern California.

I loved most things about this hotel and we plan to return to stay here again. Most of all I liked the friendly staff. When you travel with two children you can always tell if the staff is trained to be kind and helpful to children. This staff has had top training and are wonderful. The rooms are very nice despite the decor which is fake Italian (i.e. mirrors made to look worn and distressed and lights made to look like dripping candles). It is true that you have to walk down endless hallways to get to them but they are nice. I asked not to have any air fresheners placed in our room and they listened. We had a little porch with two chairs facing a golf course. My father had a porch (facing a pretty garden) that was too small for even one chair. A big plus would be an addition of screened doors for the porch because it would be nice to have the fresh air without getting mosquitos in the room. The family pool is not huge but is large enough when the hotel is not too busy. We had it almost to ourselves in April. The landscaping is attractive. The staff is helpful with towels, etc. The first time we used the pool the staff started to clean with a loud smelly machine and we left. I thought they might have waited until it was empty. Also, there was a bit of a mold problem around the pool drain areas that needed to be attended to. The Amaya restaurant is a great place for breakfast and we tried to go there every morning. We liked to sit on their outdoor terrace. The waiters give top notch service and are super friendly. My kids loved the pancakes and the adults liked the salmon bagels. All were happy with the fresh squeezed orange juice. Once the gardner came around just as we sat down and kept mowing the same patch of grass in front of the restaurant. After several of our requests to make him stop a staff person finally went over to ask him to leave. The hotel should arrange that gardeners come after breakfast and before lunch to work in that area. At night the hotel provides a variety of musical entertainers. We stayed up one night to listen to an older guy with a great voice play piano and sing standards. He even obliged us with a request for Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" complete with harmonica. The hotel has several walks on it's property and the surrounding area. We were lead by one of the staff to the beginning of two trails that started past the horse stables. We walked on the one that turned right (the less traveled one) and soon noticed that there were ticks crawling all over every one of us! Disgusting. We felt that the hotel should warn the guests that they have a tick problem on these paths and told them so when we returned to shower and change. We took a stroll around the hotel property and were surprised when a dog came barking out of a ground floor room. The owners stopped it before it reached us. It made me think that I would not be very pleased to have a dog barking in a room near me. Not relaxing. The spa is good one. My daughter and I went for a massage at the same time. She liked hers (my only complaint with hers was that the lady had a cold) and I liked mine. For Easter the hotel made it fun for kids by having an egg hunt and other activities. Advice to fellow travelers: stay at this place if you want a relaxed and upscale hotel with great service. Advice for the hotel: Get rid of that awful scented candle that is in the lobby area. It smells very artificial. Also, please get rid of all the fake books and yard sale non-English books that are glued together in the \"library\" area. Instead, get real books in English that guests can read while visiting you and leave for others.

Four Seasons in many locations, Ritz, Capella Pedregal in Cabo, Kea Lani in Maui, many locations in Italy, Trump and Penninsula in Chicago, Atlantis in Bahamas, the Fountain Blue in Miami and most of the high end resorts in Vegas, and the Grand Del Mar is our favorite by far. We were back for our second visit and brought our friends who are also very well travelled and they were completely blown away. The resort is independantly owned and the owner lives in a home on the grounds. You can tell he (Doug) has amazing pride. Every detail was thought through. The first time we stayed here was in terrace room at the adult pool and my husband and I had a wonderful stay. This time we were with our family (3 children-4, 6, and 8) and our friends who also have 2 children. We rented a villa and it was completely rock star. Totally worth the nightly rate and we will be back many times. I am already planning my 40th birthday party there for a destination party with friends. Tennis (most amazing tennis pavillion with great instructors-both Rick and Lynn are great! I have played with both of them and I have gone on tennis trips to saddle brook in tampa), amazing golf course, the kids love the explorers club (free to villa guests), great pools, fire pits all over the resort, and a brand new equestiran center with beautiful retired race horses. We did a group lesson with the kids and a trail ride-very beautiful and the kids loved it and it is steps away from the family pool. We had a meal cooked for us in the villa on the grill and Matt from Amaya was a pleasure to work with and his staff was friendly (jose was great!) and the chef prepared our steaks and sea bass to perfection. what a treat that night was!! The resort will provide a car for you within 15 miles-so you can get to del mar or la jolla for a nice dinner out. For those travelling with kids-legoland was only 20 minutes away and we didnt scratch the surface of all the san diego sites..... We worked with Amanda to plan our stay and activies and she was a complete delight. She was totally accomodating even though we kept changing our minds on daily schedules and activies. I can't say enough. If you can get there either as a couple (I did a spa day the first time I visited and it was amazing!!!) or as a family.....it is a hidden treasure. You will be completely blown away by the beauty of the grounds. If you can swing a villa, the most amazing vacation rental villa I have stepped into....I could go on and on, but totally perfect. My only feedback to management (if they read this) is when you build another phase of villas--PLEASE make them four bedrooms!!! 5000 square feet.....you should have accomodations for 2 families....3 bedrooms just is difficult. That said, it was our favorite spring break and we will be back again and again and again...and if you build a four bedroom villa, we will buy a fractrional share...promise. Thanks for a wonderful trip to the entire staff at the Grand del Mar-especially Amanda, Jon, Jose, Rick and everyone who helped make it a memorable trip!!!

The Grand Del Mar was the best hotel of our trip by a clear country mile. The level of professionalism from the staff was truly amazing and I would return in a shot. The location is peaceful but only 20 minutes from downtown San Diego. The resort grounds are sprawling and gardens and pool areas are beautiful. Although it is clearly a modern hotel, the grounds are beginning to look well established and the pool areas are great. Different areas for couples and families so everyone can relax. The decor is over the top opulent which works really well in the public areas but is maybe a bit too much in the bedrooms but the rooms were spacious, quiet and exceptionally well equipped (great to have a Nespresso machine). What really sets this hotel apart is the service. Before arriving, we were contacted by a very helpful guest services manager who arranged a meal and taxi transportation for New Year's Eve over a week before we arrived. On arrival (it was our birthday), we received sparkling wine and a cake in the room. On New Year's Eve every guest was offered a complimentary bottle of wine from the in-room bar. You cannot imagine how surprised we were when my wife threw her deodorant in the bin before breakfast one morning, to find two new deodorants and a compliments card on the counter when we returned to the room. In short, they have an exceptionally well trained staff who really go out of their way to anticipate your needs. We were really pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and wine in the hotel. Amaya is no casual bistro and every meal we ate there was beautiful. We particularly appreciated the very well priced kids menu and the fact that we could enjoy fine dining with our children as a family. The restaurant staff were extremely professional and all remebered our names. This is despite the fact that this is a large resort. Attention to detail is superb.

If you wanted a light breakfast, there was a take-away coffee shop and the prices for food and drinks were very reasonable, the quality superb. Both my sons spent an afternoon at the kids club where the staff actually made things with them and played games rather than leaving them to get on with it with the playstation. My only criticism was that the valets were not the most charming or professional. They were prompt, but didn't have the same attitude as the rest of the staff.

The resort is a bit pricy, but it was immaculate and worth the money! Every single person that attended had only phenomincal things to say about the resort. I have traveled quite a bit and the service at this hotel was far beyond exceptional. I arrived a day early and was able to take the courtesy car within a 14 mile radius. The resort is right near Del Mar and La Jolla and I was able to visit the Birch Aquarium and relax in a beautiful spot on the beach. ROOMS - the rooms at the resort are enormous (see photos). I had a standard room that overlooked a nice courtyard. I found the bed to be very comfortable and the room, quiet. There were several plush pillows on the bed which were a mix of soft and slightly firmer, giving you a choice without having to call the conceirge. I slept very well throughout the week. The room had plenty of space for all of my belongings, so I was able to unpack everything when I arrived. I used my laptop throughout the week- the resort's wireless internet was very fast and easy to connect to. The patio was small, but comfortable and no matter where your room is in the resort, it offers a nice view. FOOD - Although I am a picky eater and have several food allergies, the food was superb and the staff was more than willing to customize any meal that I ordered. The menus offer many different options and one of the best things is that there is a cafe where you can order sandwiches, cookies, smoothies, coffee and gelato. This made it easy when I wanted to grab a quick bite and carry it anywhere on the resort to eat. MEETING FACILITIES - The meeting facilities were excellent and the staff went above and beyond to make sure that everything went as planned without any issues. They offered flexible options for meals, meeting space, A/V and other amenities that a group may be looking for. I saw some pictures from weddings that took place there and they were just gorgeous. GOLF & SPA - Our group participated in both and everyone highly recommended them. They prepared boxed lunches for the golfers which they were able to eat in between shots.

The amuse bouche & roasted cauliflower were incredibly good. I found the decor (upscale clubby) to be incongruous with the exceedingly formal service. The service was formal to the point of being silly - for example, when placing the napkin in my lap, the waiter actually held it with tongs, lest his fingers touch it. I prefer to put my napkin in my own lap but if the waiter is going to do it for me, are tongs necessary?

We had a Palazzo Suite that overlooked the golf course and it was really relaxing. The room was huge with 2 full bathrooms and a little kitchenette. They style of the room was not my favorite- very old fashioned. The lobby was festive with Christmas decorations everywhere and a nice touch was hot apple cider in the evenings. A few negatives: The room service was a little spotty. We got a salad one night with hair in it. When we told the In room dining, they sent us a new one and removed the charge from our bill. One morning I got caffeinated tea when I asked for decaf and an opened and used mini jam jar! gross. Another negative was in the design of the hotel- nothing to do with the staff- but it is really long and spread out. This would be fine if you could drive your car to the part of the hotel you were staying in or the rooms were in little bungalows. Our room was at the far end of the hotel from the lobby/valet/ restaurants so it took FOREVER to walk down the never ending halls to our room. Especially carpeted halls in high heels.

The hotel is in spectacular grounds and although it lends itself to weddings and corporate functions these were kept well away from hotel guests, with their own staff, so that there was no interfrerence or inconvenience. The breakfasts are excellent and a room and breakfast rate is well worth negotiating for as the food allowance is more than adequiate. The hotel is well placed north of the city and access to the beaches and smaller towns of North County coastal is very easy and well worth the effort where you can find unique shopping and small family run restaurants for evening meals.The sea is cold but walking is so easy and relaxing as the beaches are sparsely populated. The famous zoo is well worth a visit (and we are in our 50's). There are excellent factory outlet stores to the north and the local outdoor shopping malls are very pleasant to visit with plenty of different eating options. A Sat Nav proved to be a god send as the city freeways are very complex and driving proved to be so much more relaxed for being told where to go!We took our own, having paid for the maps for the western half of the USA before going.Hiring a sat nav is now easy but charges vary and some negotiation is called for.

This year after reading a number of reviews, and after correspondance with the Hotel we chose to stay here. Whilst a little more than we wanted to pay we made sacrifices elsewhere so that we could stay within our overall budget.(We were on a three week road trip). In summary: Pre-visit: We had excellent correspondance with Brianne and Josh in the Sales team ahead of our visit, with Brianne in particular helping to arrange restuarants, and Josh making a number of valuable recomendations. They continued to offer support and excellent service throughout our stay. Check in and arrival: After speaking with the hotel team we arrived at 12.30PM knowing that we could use the facilities whilst waiting for the room to be made ready. The valet, and Bell Boys did a great job and our first impression was extremely positive! The check in team were equally welcoming, and promised to get a \"rush on\" so that we could be in our room quickly. One we were told was almost ready. Great we thought, albeit the early check in did not arise, and I had to chase up the front office team. Jon the Front Office Manager got involved and recognised that there was a problem and made great efforts to get us into our room, and ensured that we recieved excellent service whilst waiting. This excellent service continued for the duration of the stay. Room: Many of the reviews on here \"wax lyrical\" about the rooms and we concur with all the positive comments. Hotel and facilities: The Swimming Pool, Spa, and Gym were first class, with the Service around the Pool the best we've come across. Jason and the team ensured a pleasant and restful time was add. Restuarants: With the exception of Addison we ate and drank at all of the Bars and Restaurants. We personally prefered breakfast at the Golf Club, Lunch by the pool, and Evening Meal at the Golf Club or in Amaya. We finished most nights in the wonderful bar area with a cocktail. At each location the Service was excellent and the Food Quality befitting of a Five Star Hotel! Golf: Whilst staying at the Hotel we played at Torrey Pines, and at the Grand Del Mar. The course here was in better shape, and a real test of Golf. All the staff associated with the Golf course were a credit to the Hotel. We particularly enjoyed using the practice facilties. General: What made an excellent stay into an unforgettable experience were the little extras. From the gifts in the room for special occasions to the courtesy car which we took advantage of. As mentioned by many what sets this hotel apart is the Service provided by the finest staff that i've come across on my travels. All of the Staff we encountered genuinely appeared to enjoy working here, and took great pride in the Service we offered. We arrived at the Hotel as Guests and we felt that we left as friends, no higher complement can I give.

We went into their website and after viewing the property immediately booked two nights. Upon arriving at the front gate of the complex we were checked by a security guard and given a valet parking ticket and allowed to enter. The driveway up to the complex and surrounding areas was stunning with the golf course around us. Driving up through the gates to the Hotel it was simply stunning, with the helicopter pad on one side and such lush gardens and surrounds. We were welcomed warmly in the driveway and our bags uppacked and taken to our rooms while we checked in and were offered wonderful home made lemonade. A wedding party was arriving as we checked it and the area was crowded but it didnt take away from gorgeous public rooms and flower arrangements. Check in was efficient and in fact at that time we had hardly seen any of the hotel other than the grounds and foyer but we immediately felt that we wanted to have our \"spare night\" at this property. We had booked a Grand King room, with breakfast each day (up to the value of $65usdollars) and this included valet parking and 20% off any retail products we purchased, it also came with an upgrade room. The hotel is gorgeous and we had an unbelivable room, with an enormeous bathroom, huge tub, double sink and plenty of vanity space, huge shower, separate toilet and walk in robe off the bathroom area. The hallway also had a wonderful timber wall unit with glass cabinets that held the glasses and mini bar products and also had a sink and water as well as the standard mini bar fridge, the good thing was it was not one of those automated ones, so we could store our own beverages in there, and as we still had champagne form our trip to the Napa Valley this came in handy. Also a bottle of champagne and a special desert was delivered to our room with a note from the manager wishing us a Happy 25th Wedding anniversay - very nice touch. The room was large and well appointed with a king bed, a separate make up dressing table, a large plasma tv another desk area and a lounge chair. Stepping out through glass patio doors we had a little patio area with chairs and table (although one chair was missing they soon found it). From there we went out a little gate and three steps later were at the Adults only pool. It was wonderful to have a pool for adults only as well as a spa as not everyone has children and in such a wonderful relaxing resorts its nice to have quiet time without other peoples children intruding on your quiet time. The family pool area was on the other side of the complex. The service from all the staff was exceptional and particulary around the pool area, where staff provided complimentary magazines, sun glasses, sun tan lotion, bottled water and frozen grapes. The restaurants are amazing. Amaya has wonderful fire places and great food try the lobster bisque and their other lobster signature dish, it was so good we had it two nights out of the three we were there. The other night we ate at their fine dining restuarant Addisons. The meal was wonderful and the service exceptional and also for a quality signature restaurant very reasonably priced compared to some of the other signature restaurants we have been in our trip. The hotel has a complimentary car service that takes guests anywhere they want with in 14 mile radious and we used this service to go into La Jolla, but they also took us a few mintues down the road to the restaurant in a lovely mercedes and then collected us after our meal. The hotel and its facilities were so wonderful that we didnt even get into San Diego we just enjoyed the resort so much and as we had been away almost eight weeks at this stage we deserved the well earned down time. If you dont have valet parking included in your room rate its a very reasonable $15.USD per day. This is one very special hotel and golf club and we will definately be back. We have decided never to stay in LA again but to hire a car and drive the two hours to Del Mar before we have to fly back to Australia.

We requested a crib and a high chair and early check in since check in was scheduled for 4pm and we were arriving around noon. I was pleased to see the email from guest services as it seemed to set a nice tone for our arrival. When we arrived (around 1:30pm), we were told our room wasn't ready. We were a little disappointed but didn't really mind waiting. When I asked how long it would be, she said she would request a \"rush\" on the room for us. I also noticed that our room rate was incorrect and showed them a print out of our confirmation with our room rate. They said they would have to check with a manager. An hour and 45 minutes later, I checked in with the front desk again to see if our room was ready and they said they were just finishing up. Another 45 minutes after that (at 4pm...normal check in time), our room was available. Since we had our 2 small children, a 2 and 1/2 hr wait and the \"rush\" that the front desk promised but we didn't seem to get, set a bad tone for the rest of the stay. I later received a call from the hotel stating that the manager would \"honor\" my confirmed rate which I found the the way they handled it funny because they acted as if they were doing us a favor even though I had print out of our confirmation clearly stating what our booked rate was. We stayed in a Prado suite and the room was great. They also had cute animal travel neck pillows as gifts for our children which was a nice touch. The pools were great and they would bring out complimentary treats (mini oreo shakes, frozen pineapple). The hotel had turndown service which included bottled water until we received a used bottle of water. We also had breakfast at Amaya (brioche french toast was probably the best we've ever had)...service was great until the server just forgot about us and forgot to bring us our bill. Finally to top off the trip, when we got home, the bill was incorrect and I had to contact them as they overcharged us. Overall, we were very disappointed in our stay especially considering we're paying $700/night. The staff was all very friendly, but they just didn't deliver or we were just plagued with really really bad luck.

We were very impressed by the room. It was extremely comfortable and quiet and exceptionally well cleaned. The bathtub and shower were both large and comfortable. More water pressure would be nice in the shower but I do understand the need to conserve water. The public areas of the hotel are very attractive as well. We played golf on the very nice golf course. Fortunately we were able to get the twilight rate as the regular rate is extremely expensive. The golf course was empty and I suspect that is because of the high prices. If you are willing to pay to golf bring your own clubs because the rentals are $85 for a round which is very steep. I spent two wonderful afternoons at the tranquility pool and enjoyed it very much. A chair cover and towels are laid out for you when you arrive and you will be offered a glass of ice water as well. Through out the day small drinks and frozen grapes are also offered. I had lunch out at the pool one afternoon and while good it was not worth $25 for a salad and a diet coke. There is a sign restricting access to adults only.

It is not very tranquil to have a loud one-sided conversion going on beside you. The polite people got up and left the area when they got a call. I would love to see people leave the phones in their rooms and enjoy an afternoon not connected. I had breakfast at the resort three mornings and was shocked by the prices. The orange juice was the best I have ever had but at $6 it should be. One day my breakfast was $34 including a tip for an omlet, coffee and juice (yes that is the price for one person). The service is outstanding but this is too much for a meal. Breakfast at the golf course grill is a better deal and just as tasty with the added bonus of the view of the course. The resort is quite a distance from other restaurants or I would have left the resort for my meals because of the excessive prices.

Our travel agent found us a fantastic package at this hotel which is only 20 minutes from our home in the SD area but it seems like a world away. The hotel is several miles inland from the ocean, north of the city of San Diego. Freeway access is excellent- a mile or two east of I-5. Our package included golf for two, overnight accommodation, breakfast credit, and a certificate to use at the spa. It was an amazing value and I will look for it again. The hotel lobby, library, bar,etc are strikingly handsome and comfortable. The staff could not be any more friendly (in a sincere manner) and helpful. The hotel grounds are immaculate. The room was probably the nicest one I have stayed in. Everything from the room size, furnishings, bed/ bedding, huge tub, marble floor in bathroom, TV's, balcony, and room safe large enough for a laptop were first rate. Seriously, this was nice. Our room had a comfortable patio overlooking (from third floor) the adult pool. The front desk staff asked which newspapers (you get two) we would like in the AM. They sent a nice note and a dessert in honor of the birthday celebration. All the staff members were really gracious and helpful. We had breakfast on the patio of the Amaya restaraunt. We have previously dined at their 5 diamond (pricey but totally worth it) Addison restaurant but did not go there this trip- it is fantastic however. There is also a grill room at the golf course and a coffee bistro that serves light breakfast and lunch in the main part of the hotel. The adult area pool has a large hot tub with these comfortable outdoor mattress lounges to rest on next to the water. The cocktail waitress was attentive and friendly. There is a separately located family pool (three pools including two pools for kids of various sizes/ages). This has its own bar.etc, The golf course actually functions as a private club with access for hotel guests. It is a Tom Fazio design and is a terrific course. We had to take a caddy (part of the package, excluding gratuity). The idea of the caddy was great although ours did not come across as too friendly or interested (perhaps the only negative of the stay) but others may be friendlier. The golf was really great though. Back at the hotel there was complimentary fresh raspberry lemonade and cookies in the lobby to refresh/snack after golf. The Grand Del Mar exceeded all my expectations. Honestly, I cannot remember staying anywhere that I found more pleasant. I don't usually gush during my reviews.... ok, I'm gushing in this one.

After staying one day (Sunday), we left the hotel for a two day stay at the Ritz Carlton in Dana Point (ocean view room). While the view of the beach was great, the older rooms at the Ritz Carlton don't compare to the rooms of the Grand Del Mar. The Grand Del Mar rooms are first class. They have free internet service, beautiful furniture, great televisions, super nice bathrooms, and in room mini bars. We ended up leaving one day early from the Ritz Carlton and returned to the Grand Del Mar. At the Grand Del Mar, we had a fairway view room both days that was great (standard king room). Our $435.00 package (room was a little more because of fairway view) included a $65 breakfast credit and free valet parking. The second day we got the same room for $325.00 with no breakfast credit. You should be aware that San Diego has a 12.5 percent hotel/resort tax that gets added to your bill. I didn't play golf this trip, but I will next time. I never saw a lot of players on the course. I believe it would be a great course to play because it looks like a top notch course and I doubt there would be much of a wait between holes.

After reading all the other reviews, I can say that the hotel is exactly as descibed by everyone else. The approach to the hotel is a long driveway. From the minute you see the hotel, the luxuriousness of the property and location is apparent. We booked a standard double king guest room. After much consideration, we decided to share the room with our two boys (normally, we get them a separate room but given the \"credit crunch\", we thought that may be slightly extravagant this year). We had the cheapest view in the property of the gardens, but we were more than happy with our lovely view. Given the location, all views seem to be gorgeous and we were glad we didn't upgrade to a golf view. The rooms are spacious but the bathrooms were MASSIVE. One of the nicest bathrooms I have ever seen, due to the size and design. The outside swimming pools are gorgeous and we took advantage of the heated pools to get our daily swim in even on Christmas day. Most of the staff thought we were crazy but coming from London the weather was very mild! I had a pedicure in the spa and the service was great - a really good pedicure. Well worth the money. We ate in the Amaya restaurant on Christmas eve and the food was excellent. My partner said it was the most \"melt in your mouth\" beef he had ever been served in a restaurant. We had a lovely festive christmas brunch on christmas day. All the staff were fabulous and the food choice was perfect. The most noticeable part of the hotel are the great staff that the management employ. Every member of staff we met was genuinely helpful and interested in making sure you had a fabulous stay in the hotel. There was a great sense of pride and professionalism amongst the staff. I would most definitely recommend this as the hotel to stay in during a trip to San Diego. Is the hotel expensive - YES!

If i had to make any criticisms of the hotel, I would make two. 1) it seems ridiculous to charge a \"valet\" parking fee when the hotel is so spacious ( our rate had this included but i would be annoyed at having to pay a daily rate to park in the middle of the countryside) 2) we thought that a 22% service charge on the Christmas brunch was very steep, especially as it was a buffet!!!!!!!!!!! Our service charge for Christmas Day was $68 and the meal was only $40 per child and $80 per adult, with one bottle of wine on top. As Europeans, we thought this service charge was too high especially as we were getting up to get the food ourselves. I did leave this in my comments to the management. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone and would not even consider Coronado or downtown San Diego with sucha beautiful location on the doorstep.

In the words of the in-room guest book: \"...inspired by the rich, decorative arts of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Morroco\"; \"colorful palette, graceful arched doorways, rotundas, vibrant tile, wood-beamed ceilings, ornate stone and wrought-iron accents, decorative columns, parquet flooring and gracious verandas.\". More simply put, you walk in and say \"Wow!\" - several times. First impressions were exceptional, from the eucalyptus-scented hand towels presented at the front desk during check-in, to the fresh lemonade, iced tea, and cookies and huge, aromatic, floral arrangement in the lobby. The concierge desk was very nice and helpful, especially Gabrielle and Lynette. We asked their advice every day. We requested and got a room with a fairway (golf course) view - the one downside is there's only a standing balcony, with insufficient room for chairs to sit and enjoy the view. We found the room to be very luxurious - all the amenities you could possibly want and more. The room (389) had a great layout, including a bathroom with a huge tub, two sinks, separate shower and toilet, and a folding window above the tub that opens into the main bedroom. There are lots of subtle, sometimes hidden extras, like a vanity with a top that opens up to reveal a large mirror and provide a compartment for your wife's things. The bedroom offered plenty of drawer space, slide-out table tops, a beautiful corner couch, cushions, and ottoman for relaxing, and a large flat screen TV on the wall. Two newspapers were delivered to the room each day, and we were asked if we wanted any others. Valet parking is the only available option, and they charge quite a bit for it ($30 plus tips). I complained because I didn't see this spelled out up front until my reservation was confirmed - the resort very kindly said they would waive the fee. Each time you leave the premises, the valet offers bottles of cold water for the road. Nice. A plus for us was that we rarely heard or saw any other people in the adjacent rooms - either the walls are nice and thick or no one was in them. A couple of relatively minor downsides: We only got turndown service on the first night of our four night stay. Not sure why. We loved it when we got it. We were offered and accepted an in-room coffee maker, but housekeeping just didn't seem to know how to handle this extra. They consistently failed to clean and provision it, even bringing coffee bags without filters on the last day. On a similar note, we requested extra towels (to their credit, the hotel asks before you arrive), but housekeeping had to be reminded to keep replacing them. We used in-room dining several times, but got tired of it. Would have liked some simpler, less \"frou frou\" options to choose from. We switched to muffins from the coffee shop (Cent'Anni) for the last couple of mornings. Speaking of dining, we opted not to eat at their highly touted restaurant, Addison - settling instead for \"second best\", Amaya. It was fine - great decor, nice waiters, good food, very classy - frankly it was hard for us to believe Amaya wasn't the best! I can't emphasize enough how pleasant and accommodating the staff was. We had the feeling they would do anything within their power to make our stay a nice one (and they succeeded). Also, the resort is absolutely beautiful. Be forewarned, though - it's about a half hour drive north of San Diego just off I-5, so it's not right in the heart of the city if that's what you're looking for.

I only learned of the resort while researching private golf clubs in the area, and was directed to the resort site. We have stayed or visited the 4 Seasons, LA Quinta, Rancho Bernardo, etc., and our experience at the Del Mar far exceeded any experience we have had at any of those. From check in, we were treated like royalty. Our trip was planned for our anniversary, and they not only knew of the event, they knew what year anniversary it was (not sure how they figured that out yet). We were given an upgraded room overlooking the quiet spa pool. The room/suite was beautiful; the amenities were top notch (4 flat screens, enormous bathrooms, comfortable furniture, great bed, etc.). The room was extremely quiet, we never felt crowded or rushed, and the service staff and employees are extremely polite and helpful, knew us by name, and catered to us. Also, we were surprised by a very generous gift for our anniversary the first night. We decided to take the \"shuttle\" to La Jolla the first evening. The shuttle is a Mercedes S550! There was no fee, no charge, the driver was great, and they dropped us off at the restaurant, and picked us up 2 hours later right in front. I could not believe it. My wife asked what they use if there are more that two passengers, and we were told that have an Escalade and a Luxury Coach for the bigger groups. We ended up taking the ride again another night, and the driver gave us a nice guided tour through La Jolla before dinner. We never touched our car the entire time we were there. We ate each breakfast, most lunches, and 1 big dinner at the resort. One very pleasant surprise was that the cost of the food was very reasonable by resort standards. We had a big breakfast each morning on our porch, and I remember thinking that the bill was about half of what I was expecting. The food at the bigger pool was great, and there was never a big crowd or a lot of noise. The dinner we had at Addison, their signature restaurant. We spent about a half hour at the bar talking with the bartender and manager who were both very generous and thoughtful. Once we were seated, we told the server to surprise us, and he did. The service was great, I think we had 6 different people attending to us, and the food was spectacular. We enjoyed 6 courses, and were delighted and surprised by each serving. Even after the drinks, the food, dessert, etc., I was again surprised that the bill was not higher. I golfed two separate days. The clubhouse and personnel were great, and the caddies were very helpful. The course itself was not in the greatest shape as they had recently over-seeded., and they were undergoing some maintenance on a few of the holes. After the second round, I thought I might mention something to one of the starters but never did. After another day, I mentioned my experience to the manger back at the resort. I told him the truth that while the course was not in \"excellent\" shape, I still played out my round and enjoyed the course. He told me how important it was that I mentioned it to him and thanked me for bringing it to his attention. He was very sincere, seemed genuinely concerned, and told me he would take care of it. Later that night we had a hand written note and an expensive gift in our room to thank us for telling him, and I learned on our final day that he had given us a significant credit to our bill to accommodate our experience on the course. I will say that this is by far one of the best experiences we have had at an exclusive resort. I have not even mentioned the great work out room, the number of free exercise sessions available to guests, the tennis clinic we took, the mountain bikes and trails right outside the gate, the spa sessions my wife loved, etc. Lastly, one other point of note-there was a large wedding at the resort on Saturday night. We had heard from some of the staff about the wedding, and jokingly told each other that it might be the one night that we would have to wait for a drink, seat, etc. Just the opposite. The wedding and most of the big halls are on another side of the resort, so that we never heard or even saw most of the group. I never would have known that they were hosting such a large event that evening. We live less than 50 miles from this resort, but will absolutely go there again and recommend it to everyone we know. We felt as if we were miles away, and it is one of those experiences were we were in vacation mode the minute we walked through the front door.

The room is a nice size, had two queen size beds with very comfortable linens, pillows etc. The bathroom is quite large, two sinks, separate toilet area, shower stall, tub and small tv, which the kids loved as they had never watched tv during a bath before! The small balcony was unfurnished, but when I called down for some chairs, they brought up very nice cushy chairs and a table immediately. We had a golf course view which was lovely. Our room was so quiet, there was no need to sleep with earplugs. Complimentary coffee was available in the lobby each morning with mini muffins and fresh lemonade and cookies in the afternoon. If you miss the morning coffee, there is a gourmet coffee shop with excellent coffee right on the main floor. They also have bagels and yogurt for those who prefer a light casual breakfast. The lounges by the pool were very comfortable and the servers were all very pleasant. There are a few pools here, one is adults only and is quite large and a huge hot tub. They lit the fire pit for us at night so we could roast marshmallows. They also offer s'mores through in room dining for $20 per person if you like. We had lunch at the golf club which was nice and they thankfully had a children's menu. The resort is very luxurious and the service all around was excellent, particularly the concierge. They were very helpful and knowledgeable about everything we needed. The resort is in not within walking distance of a town/shops. You need a car. It is close to attractions like Sea World, Lego land and Downtown San Diego - maybe 20 minutes to each attraction. Very close to La Jolla as well and various shopping malls. This worked out great for us as we struggled with whether or not to stay at the Four Seasons in Carlsbad. We are thrilled that we chose the Grand as the location was much better for us than staying further north and the resort was certainly on par with Four Seasons in all aspects. The Four Seasons is however closer to the beach and offers a Beach Butler service. I am not sure if the Grand offers this yet. The spa looked beautiful, but the staff was not too eager to let me look around. Since we were with the kids, I didn't get a chance to use the spa, but would not hesitate if we came back alone. I used the gym twice. It was very well appointed with many different cardio machines - treadmills, elliptical, step mill, bikes etc. Lots of free weights and weight machines, bosu and gym balls. Personal tv's on most equipment, lots of water, fruit and towels. I went for a run and upon my return was greeted at the front door with a towel and cold bottle of water! How nice! My kids used the games room once ($15/ child per hour). It is supervised and they have video games like Xbox, ping pong, lots of crafts. They staff there were super nice to the kids. It would be an idea for them to open in the evenings so parents could have dinner on the property while the kids are being entertained. So far they are only open til 5pm. The resort provided us with tennis racquets and balls. There are 2 courts. We really loved our stay at the Grand and will return if the prices don't rise.
