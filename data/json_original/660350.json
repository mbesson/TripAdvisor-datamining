I can only rate the value as average because the room costs were high due the the Mobile World Congress during the week.I think at any other time it woulds be a great value hotel to stay in.

The hotel has recently been renovated and you can tell. The rooms are modern and clean. We also had a room with no outside windows but only one to the inside hallway. We asked the front desk and they offered to move us but warned that the outside facing windows can be very loud at night so we stayed where we were. The only issue is that the heater was on for the hotel and so it got hot in the room and we had to open the window to the hall and actually bought a fan for the room. The staff was very nice and helpful the whole time. They helped with directions, the open bus tours, etc. They were very friendly the entire time.

We had read the reveiws of this hotel and in our opinion we found it a pleasent location to base yourself for seeing the sites. Our room did not have a window and this suited us as it reduced the outside noise of this very busy city. Beds were comfortable and the room big enough for our needs. The bathroom was large and kept spotless by the very efficent chamber maids. The reception staff were very helpful throughout our stay and greeted us every time we passed by reception. The air-condition was very good. A tip to all who stay here ask for an extra door swipe card as this card operates the electric supply to your room. By leaving this extra card connected in your room, the air-con remains on all day bringing you back to a very cool room. Avoid breakfast at the hotel currently charged at 15 euros per person. Their are many cafe's and eating places within meters walk from the hotel offering a good selection of food and drink at very resonable prices. Taxis taken from outside the hotel attract a supplement because of the location of the hotel. By walking the few minutes to the La Ramblas you can avoid this supplement. Taxis also attract a supplement after midnight,sundays and public holidays. WARNING-- Avoid walking alone at night in the narrow and dimly lit streets surrounding the hotel. Myself and the night porter witnessed a wallet snatch at 4am in the morning from the safety of the hotel foyer whilst having a cigarette. Three men and two women who all looked to be alone or couples distracted an american tourist looking for a street sign. Within seconds one approched him pretending to be drunk and fell heavily against him forcing him into a doorway. The other two women followed them into the doorway and pretened to help him. In the ensuing confusion the man pushed the victim to the ground and releived the gentleman of the wallet. The theif ran away into the distance whilst the other two men and women impided the american tourist chasing after him. The whole event was over in a matter of seconds. Those impeding the tourist quickly dissapeared into the narrow side streets leaving a dazed and robbed victim. The night porter invited the victim into the hotel to recover. He lost all his cash and passport.

The problem is they only have double rooms with windows to the outside. If you're in a designated single room (as I was), you'll have a window looking onto the atrium corridoor. It isn't terribly bad, but the windows don't open and the rooms don't get much air, which I think they make up for with scented air freshener which I found quite overwhelming. The plus side is that if you have one of these rooms on the atrium at the top of the building, you have no street noise and can't hear much so if you need a place that you'll get a good sleep in, I can confirm this worked for me. Apart from the whole lack of window/stuffiness issue, I found the room clean, simple and comfortable and got a really good wireless connection from there.

Read the reviews and was'nt sure about booking this hotel. This surely was'nt the same hotel trippers were griping about. But we booked it and were not dissapointed. Staff were very polite, rooms were clean and adequate with a free safe and a well stocked mini bar. breakfast was a treat with plenty of choice, also a nice roof terrace with good sunbeds and table and chairs. We went with another couple and they agreed with us, 10/10.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "ANIGIE", "ReviewID": "UR12206198", "Content": "I was pessimistic before arriving at Hotel Avinyo due to negative reports I had read. I found it to be a very functional and extremely central location. The rooms are small but ours were clean, we had plenty hot water, they were dark, (fantastic) and no traffic or outside noise distractions, so sleep wasn't a problem. The breakfast wasn't great but we had enough to eat none the less. Everything was cold but we were always the end of the queue anyway! Staff were pleasant not overfriendly but had no problems with them. The hotel itself is like an upgraded hostel, its void of atmosphere but basic and functional. The bar is usually empty, restaurant tables that are never used (we guessed they are for ornamental purposes). There if free internet (3 laptops) a big plus for teenagers, and we had one in our group, so big thumbs up to that. Overall, I would recommend the Hotel to others, like all holidays, we used it little, just for a base and the location in perfect, action on the doorstep and thats what makes a holiday!", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbernauld", "Title": "\u201cgood value....\u201d", "Author": "busgeezer1965", "ReviewID": "UR10735068", "Content": "My brother in law and I stayed here last week.We were over to see the football.The hotel room was dark, but who cares.It was clean and lets be honest ,you ain't paying 5Star are you?It was handy for the Ramblas, the beach and the Cathedral.I have read reviews saying the front counter staff wern't so good.It must have been a different set of guys we met.They went out of their way to get us a map and mark out which subway we should use,the porter also offered to get us tickets for the game.(we already had some).We never made breakfast but there are sandwich shops etc. nearby.All in all a good choice", "Date": "November 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Catalonia Avinyo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d660350-Reviews-Catalonia_Avinyo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$139 - $233*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avinyo 16</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "660350", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d7/2d/4a/catalonia-avinyo-piscina.jpg"}}
