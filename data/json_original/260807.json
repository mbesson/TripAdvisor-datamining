The reason I liked the Hemp Hotel is because if you are a smoker you can just be yourself and don't need to fear any sideways glances for having a doobie hanging from your mouth. All of the staff are herb-savvy, and can direct you to the nearest coffeeshops, or the ones with the best hash, and so on. The location is pretty good because you've got about 15 coffeeshops within a ten minute walk.

I stayed with my husband and 2 friends and after reading previous comments was a bit scared about what we might find! Check-in was at the bar/reception (rock-salt lamps, lit ganja pipes, off-it guy chattering non-stop with the most beautiful beaming smile on his boat-race), our rooms were 1 and 3, both with views of the park. The rooms were fab! Decorated in morrocan/afghan themes with beds on the floor, blue/yellow walls, lanterns, rugs and throws. Absolutely full of character. The area around the hotel is lovely, wine shop, nice little bars and coffeeshops, lamp and furniture shops, book/clothes shops and about a 30 minute walk along the canals and streets with plenty to see to Dam Square or a 10 minute tram journey. Eccentric owner Mila (Pip:- 'Are you alright now?', Mila:- 'Yes and by that I mean noooooooo'). The stairs are steep but they are all like that in Amsterdam. The room had a few cobwebs but who cares with a view of the washing-up-liquid-foaming-fountain in the park. The breakfast was non-existent but the coffee we served was delicious. The lad in the next room was a complete wreck-head but still managed to say hello every time we clapped eyes on him. It was fabulous and I loved it. Tram number 4 from Centraal Station and get off at Fredricksplein, look for the fountain in the park, the hotel faces it.

I would have to agree with a former commenter who said they need to relocate to a better spot and it'd probably be a better stay. The vibe of the hotel is very bohemian, and the little complimentary packet you get in your room is cool - the candies, the hemp soap and the Amsterdam map. BUT - the rooms are a real dive. Not worth the money you pay to stay there in terms of comfort. The bathroom is a disgrace and the toilet doesn't work half the time. It's noisy from all the activity going on outside. I woke up in the morning with bites all over me. I don't know if it's because of the mosquitoes, or if there were bed bugs, but I had tiny red spots everywhere. The floor in the bar sags a bit and strikes me as somewhat of a hazard. However, they've got the right idea. Their theme suits Amsterdam, and especially any hippie types who might be drifting through. It's way different from any other place I've stayed, so it was kind of nice to experience something unlike any other hotel. They just need a better spot, or to completely renovate the building. Now with that being said, it wouldn't be fair not to compliment the staff. They were extraordinary at making you feel welcome and insisting you come in to the bar after hours and socialize... which I did, since I was traveling alone. And I had a real good time with them. One of them took my rental bike back for me in the morning since I was unable to get it back in time before I left, and another staff member offered to drive me to the airport the day I left. I was really impressed with that. That made up for the crappy accommodations, especially since I didn't spend that much time inside.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton", "Title": "\u201cNot quite the Indian themed room one imagines...\u201d", "Author": "LoopyypooL", "ReviewID": "UR33441892", "Content": "I'd always fancied trying the hemp hotel so although it was a little expensive for a room with shared facilities, we thought we'd give it a go. They assured us on the phone that the loo was just accross the hall. It is for 2 of the rooms, for us it was up the vertical stairs. The shower a further floor up. From speaking to some of the other residents the top floor rooms seem to be the best, you get a balcony and are further from the bar noise. Not knowing this before we booked, we had merely opted for a room theme, we chose the Indian room, aka the cupboard under the stairs. It was directly above the bar which stays open til 3 or 4am. All the stairs wrapped around our room so we got to hear everyone thundering up and down the stairs at all hours. It's a very cosy room, the double bed just fits in, with no space bvetween it and the walls. You'll never be lonely with all the flys and mosquitos buzzing around. It was nice to have breakfast served between 11am and 1pm, we couldn't miss it being that late. Just wish the coffee was bigger. Check out was also by 1pm, which is again is nice to not be thrown out at 10 when there's hours til your flight.

I knew the reviews of it were quite mixed, but I loved the concept and after seeing a video of the owner, Mila giving a tour of her shop I was sold. We even extended our stay in Amsterdam for 4 days specifically to stay there. We arrived shortly after 15:00. We went into the bar (Hemp Temple) which was vacant aside from the attendant in the back. We had no problem checking in, and oddly we were not charged at the time, just given a key and told our room was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall the way up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Now I must say, neither my partner nor I are in bad shape, but the staircase at The Hemp Hotel can be a workout all on its own. To get to the top floor there are 3 staircases, 2 of which are practically vertical. For those with weak hearts I would defiantly recommend a room on the first floor. Our room was quite charming in a bohemian/ earthy style. There is a very interesting mural on one of the walls and a fireplace converted with a radiator heater (which worked well). The room was very simple and almost too small for 2 people and their luggage. There was a sink with a mirror and a small cabinet for clothes. Next to the bed and close to the window there is a small wall mounted shelf with a tiny little chair so you have somewhere to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwrite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Also there is a television that we could never get to work sitting on a min refrigerator that also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. However, I must admit it did make a very unique love nest. The hotel is situated in a nice area of the city. Just a short walk down from the Amstel, and steps away from multiple tram lines. The view from our window looked out over Frederiksplein park. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure in the spring & summer, it is very beautiful. All the trees had dropped their leaves by the time we visited, but it was still quite picturesque. The bathroom situation is a story all on its own. Okay, well we had a sink in our room so we were covered there. If you wanted to use the toilet, that was down one vertical flight of stairs in the hallway. This was the single tiniest toilet I have ever been in. You practically had to slide in. The lavatory on the airplane was actually bigger. The shower or WC was right outside our room, so no stairs. Being an American, we never really knew the term WC (water closet) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.but thanks to The Hemp Hotel I do now. And when they say closet their not kidding. In the wall about 2 feet from the floor there was a door (similar looking to where I might keep the towels in my hallway at home). But if you open the door and step up into it, bang you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the shower. TIP: the little box on the wall inside with a string coming out of it that looks like it might set off the fire alarm actually turns on the light. My partner took his first shower in pitch black because he was afraid of what might happen if he pulled it. The 11:00 breakfast was not really something to wait around for in my opinion. The first morning we were there we actually went out and came back around 11:15. The same attendant from the day before greeted us and made us breakfast. The meal consisted of a hemp roll, 2 slices of cheese and a mini muffin, also tea or coffee. It did make for a nice mid-morning snack however. The entire time we stayed at The Hemp Hotel neither my partner nor I ever saw another person at the hotel except for 2 attendants. We heard the cleaning lady, and every morning around 5:00am the hall (and our room) would smell of cigarette smoke. The entire experience was defiantly very different.
