It is very very close to Termini so getting to anywhere int he city is very very easy. Hotel itself was OK. Its on the second floor with an extremely narrow staircase. I had a single room which did have a bathroom in it but it was TINY!!!! And the bed was basically a cot so not very comfortable but I was there to explore Rome and not sit in my hotel room the whole time so it served its purpose of providing a decent place to sleep and a great location to explore the city. The service there was good. They were very helpful and nice. The price was excellent. Probably about a two or two and a half star hotel. Not bad but if you are looking for luxury etc...this is not the place. I would stay there again however to explore Rome some more.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade, Serbia", "Title": "\u201cClose to everything, clean and good value for money\u201d", "Author": "AleksandarVeskovic", "ReviewID": "UR115811331", "Content": "I have been in this hotel for 4 nights in March 2011.

Main station Termini is in foot steps away and from there you can go anywhere you want to go. I went there to see the city and practicly was in room just to sleep.

The hotel is located a block and a half from the Termini station which was by far it's best asset. The hotel is the first floor of a building composed of a restaurant on the ground level and three floors (three different hotels) of rooms above it. You need to be buzzed in to the building and the hotel area itself when you get to the first floor. I am warning you now, the \"elevator\" in the building is the smallest I have ever seen. Smaller than some dumbwaiters. We could fit two suitcases in it and nothing else. We had to load the elevator up and then run up the stairs and call the elevator to the first floor to get our stuff up there. When we got checked in we were given our key and notified that we would have to return our key every time we left the hotel. It was a traditional tumbler lock and key so I guess they only had one copy? We were given the tour of our room by the front desk attendant- a very defensive Indian man- as if we needed it. The room was tiny. To get around the bed we had about 6 inches of room at the foot of the bed. Another unfortunately small feature of the room was the shower. It had about as much room as the ice bucket to move around in. I am not a large person - 5'8\" and average size - and I could not turn around in the shower. Meaning I had to walk in the shower backward if I wanted to get out facing forward. The problem with this was that I obviously could not turn on the water. I eventually mastered leaving the shower backwards. One feature of the bathroom that was particularly efficient was the design. You could easily wash your hands while sitting on the toilet. We had water pressure issues the first night but the Indian desk clerk/maintenance man promptly switched the shower head which fixed the problem immediately. Booking.com said the hotel had no Internet but we were informed on checkin that there indeed was wifi. We could not reach a signal at all from our room but could from the lobby (25 ft away). One of the previous reviews mentioned clanking of plates which we also heard. The hotel offered breakfast at a place down the street for 3 euros which included cappuccino, orange juice, and a croissant. The double bed was actually two twin beds of unequal height that were pushed together made as one bed. It was very annoying. Also the tv channels were all in Italian and often froze or just would not change. The final oddity of the hotel was the window situation. We had two in our room. Well sort of. One was right off of the bed and opened to the alley/courtyard and provided a nice breeze. The second was behind the toilet. It was a fogged window but you could open it. When we did decide to do it we found bars on the other side keeping us out of what used to be the balcony. Some where a long the way some one turned it in to the laundry room. The place was not all bad though. It was clean and the staff overall was nice. They tried hard to fix the problems we did have. There is a great cafe across the street that offers very tasty food for cheap. 4 euro pasta plates, 1.3 euro breakfast croissant and coffee, and 1 euro for a 1.5 L water bottle. I would not stay here again or recommend it for a friend. There are much better deals for the price.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cFelt like we got ripped off a little\u201d", "Author": "drakie13", "ReviewID": "UR88475936", "Content": "We were given a room where the window opened to the alley, and there must have been a restaurant next door. The pots and pans were so noisy that we put the bedspread over the window to cut down the noise. In doing this, we made a very small hole in the bedspread, about as big as a nail hole. The hotel owners said a new bedspread would cost 160 euros. We offered to pay half of that, which would have been much more than the cost of repair to the blanket. They refused, and said we must pay the full cost of replacement. I'm guessing they did not repair it or replace it, since the damage was so slight no other guest would even notice it. Nevertheless, they demanded the full 160 euros.

I thought I had canceled this hotel with Priceline, however on the first day of my supposed stay got an email from Hotel Fenicia that they charged by card due to \"no show\". I called the hotel directly and explained what had happened and that there must have been intercommunication. I was fine with paying part of the fee but since it was only the first day of my \"stay\" and they had 3 more nights to rent out my room, I agreed to stay with them in November if they were to carry over 1 or 2 nights of my booking to that stay. The owner told me \"rules and rules\" and there was nothing they could do. As a result, they lost me as a customer and charged my credit card for 4 nights even though they likely rented that room out after the first night. This is borderline robbery on their side and I am extremely disappointed with how this situation was handled.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "pingucat", "ReviewID": "UR23376054", "Content": "When we got to rome, we stayed at what we thought would be a nice hotel off hotels.com. It was terrible. So my boyfriend and his friend set out to find a good place for us to stay and visited around nine hotels on foot. They returned and told us they booked two rooms at Hotel Fenicia. The hotel was awesome. It's a tiny group of rooms run by an older Italian couple. The rooms were tidy and small, but the twin beds pushed together were comfortable. The pillows were big and poofy. The desk was tiny and claustrophobic so we didn't use it. Shower was smaller than any i'd even seen on a cruise ship. You could tell that some of the blankets were worn and been repaired by hand. It's the care that the couple puts into the hotel that really makes it awesome. The internet at the hotel is wifi and free, but it's very slow and only allows a couple people to be connected at the same time. It's about a block from the train station and super convenient, and lots of little food places around there are open late. The tavern resteraunt about two doors down is staffed by some very friendly chefs. I'd heard that Rome (particularly near the train station) was sketchy, but this place felt very secure, and I wasn't worried about leaving camera gear in the room. I've already recommended this place to other friends who want to visit Rome.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cIt was not as bad as previous review states\u201d", "Author": "YunQi", "ReviewID": "UR7832230", "Content": "When I was searching a hotel for Rome on the web, I wasn't happy with the price that was offered. A friend recommended for us to try our luck to search for a hotel nearby Termini station once we were there. It doesn't sound like a brilliant plan, given we arrive on a bank holiday, nevertheless, we decided to be adventurous. When we arrive Rome, we were looking aimlessly aroung Termini station, there were tonnes of hotel around the area, suddenly a man approached us and ask if we are interested. We were a little hesitant, as his hotel is quite close to the station (the idea is, the closer it is, the more expensive it would be), but we went up to have a look. The lift was incredibly small, can only fit 2 person at most. The rooms are good, looked newly refurbished and very clean, it comes with air-conditioning, TV, and mini-fridge. And the price the owner offers were 90euros per night without breakfast. I think it's lower than the published rates. They offered us a room facing the main street, which we thought might be noisy, and they agree to change on the 2nd day as they have no vacant rooms on the 1st day. But it wasn't that noisy so we sticked to the same room for 3 nights. The owner preferred cash settlement at check out, but nevertheless accepted card when we explained that we do not have sufficient cash.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cDodgy....\u201d", "Author": "LeBart", "ReviewID": "UR5956545", "Content": "if i could give this hotel a lower rating, i would.... we arrived around 10pm in the evening and were confronted with a man telling us that becuase we had arrived so late in the evening that they thought we were not going to show up, so they sold our room on.

Thankfully for us, our partciular Visa card has enough security to prevent people using the number without the card. He then said that he had a room in a partner hotel across the city, but we would have to pay for it at his hotel. This is where things got really dodgy, i informed him that we would only pay at the hotel we were staying at and asked that he call them so i could ensure that they had a vacancy. He was very reluctant, but when he did call them, he insisted on speaking to them. Lucky for us we both speak resonable Italian and were able to ascertain that the room did not exist. At this point we simply up and left, and were able to find a really nice hotel around 500 metres away. I cannot comment on the comfort of the hotel as i didnt not get to see a room, but would seriously advise people to be careful if booking at this hotel as the owners are obviously dodgy.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fenicia", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d529982-Reviews-Fenicia-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$66 - $145*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Milazzo 20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "529982", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e0/08/e008d797a50b3dea3ab66bf4c274d7b01large.jpg"}}
