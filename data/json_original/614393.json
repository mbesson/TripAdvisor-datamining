{"Reviews": [{"Content": "not up to expectations We stayed at the Casa con Estilo in October this year. The description of it being a typical Spanish house is correct. The hotel is situated on the 6th floor. When we arrived the elevator was out of order, (not the first time this year). Our suuitcases where taken in the staff elevator, but we were expected to climb all 127 stairs everyday and evening of our stay. Definatley not reccomended for anyone less than fit. None of the staff spoke English. No water in the rooms. The Dining roon has one table which you share with other guests. There is a communial balcony, but there are no views as it has high hedges and is also very small. Breakfast is very basic. The hotel is on the main Balmes Rd which is noisy all night. It is close to the Trainline, about 100 yds. We did not find any entertainment in the area. The market square mentioned in the decription does not have a busy night life with resturants on every corner. Or not the market square within walking distant. Barcelona as usual is brilliant. But this hotel is just a bit far out of the centre. I am sure the staff were very friendly. But the language barrier was quite annoying.", "Date": "Oct 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR460558853", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "SHAZBOTCheshire"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Hidden Treasure! Casa Con Estilo was the perfect place to stay for a short break in the city. situated in a quiet area, but so quick and easy to la ramblas, few minutes walk from metro, direct to the main station. very pleasant area. got a bit confused with where it was, (take a lift up to the 6th floor with the help of the porter) then knock on the door! the owner was very kind and helpful. room was very clean and tidy, great atmosphere! room was very spacious and comfortable.had breakfast included in the price and this was also very nice, served on the balcony.

The place was beyond what we expected. My girlfriend and I booked the apartment with the private balcony and it was well worth the extra money. Wonderful service from the Maid. Good location for walking around Barcelona...bear in mind it's not in La Ramblas which suited us just fine. Definitely recommending it to all my friends!", "Date": "Dec 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR464023307", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "robvale"}, {"Content": "Nous avons \u8305t\u8305 tr\u732bs satisfait...   showReview(16729382, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR514485219", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d614393-r10080836-Casa_con_Estilo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "614393", "Price": "$176"}}
