The Metro is close by if you want to venture out further. There are wonderful restaurants and the entrance to the Metro across from the Eiffel Tower and several Museums and it is only about 5-10 minute walk. There is also a wonderful little turn around called the Place de Mexico where there is a Mexican restaurant and one of the best Italian restaurants both with a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower. The other thing we found at this turn around was a fantastic supermarket. On the days we just wanted to stay in for dinner and have a lazy evening we would just buy some bread, cheese and olives etc and bring to our room. The bakery next door had wonderful pastries and a Sushi Bar was across the street from the hotel. The room and bathroom were very modern and very clean. Breakfast every morning was a delight, and there was a fitness room. The stars of the Hotel were the staff. The staff made us feel like we were welcomed home every night when we would return from our daily adventures. When we discovered a big problem with one of our scheduled trips the manager of the hotel took it upon himself to help us out when our tour agent bailed out on us. Kiran Rangoo and his staff were not only pleasant but very courteous and helpful. They attended to all our needs promptly and always with a smile. We hated to leave them but we were off for more adventures in another part of town. We would stay there again when in Paris. We would also recommend the hotel to others.

We had a beautiful room on the sixth floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower from our balcony - fantastic! The beds are very comfortable, rooms nicely furnished and bathrooms well appointed. We had a deluxe room, so plenty of room for our suitcases etc. We only had one disappointment on our last morning - we had requested a late check out due to our flight - and luckily our room was available for an extra hour (until 13.00). We received a phone call at 11.57 on our last morning demanding that we checked out immediately (check out is usually at 12.00). My partner explained that we had had confirmation that we were able to depart an hour later, but the member of staff argued that this was not the case and was quite rude in his manner. We explained that we weren't packed or showered, but were given 15 minutes to check out. Thankfully we were provided with another room to quickly pack our things. Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the way this was dealt with - we completely understand that people make mistakes, especially in this case as the girl who gave us a late check out is new, however we were not given an apology by Reception staff, and one man was shooting us particularly nasty glares whilst we explained that we were simply not aware we had to be ready by 12.00 - letting us know that we had to leave immediately at 11.57 was a bit much! After we returned from packing in the other room, the Manager was on duty and did apologise nicely on behalf of the new member of staff - however we did not have an issue with the error - just the attitude of staff when dealing with it. Such a pity that this happened as we left Paris with a sour taste in our mouths (and slightly upset by the experience) - it really is a lovely hotel and the location is fantastic - lovely bistros nearby, a big supermarket, and of course, the Eiffel Tower so close!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIdeal for business stay, great location and good but discrete staff.

We went on Trip Advisor and found this place. What a wonderful find. We highly recommend this hotel, will return to it the next time we are in Paris, and will be telling all of our friends about it. Yes, the rooms are small, but that is normal for Europe. If you are not a frequent visitor to Paris or other big European cities, then you might be surprized at the size of the rooms - but chalk that up to inexperience. In our first room, the lights around the mirror blew, so they moved us to the 6th floor (room 604). That room was more spacious (but still small by US standards), but it had a couch, a desk and two balconies. Unfortunately it was not until our last evening that we stepped out onto the balcony and VOILA! there was the Eiffel Tower. I was wondering why all the other reviews said you could see the tower from the 6th floor. If you end up on the 6th - step outside, even if you don't like heights. You will be glad you did! The place is absolutely spotless. They have really nice towels, big and thick. The towel warmer is really nice - I have decided that I am going to get one for my bathroom at home. I will agree with other reviewers that the bathtub/shower needs a curtain or someting. The classic European style with the tiny glass water deflector does not work. We flooded the bathroom every day no matter how we positioned the shower head. It is a little tricky stepping out over the very high tub wall ontto the bathroom floor after a shower - especially when it was sopping wet. I always felt guilty having to throw 2-3 towels on the floor to soak up the water. I tried! The water temperature is a little flukey - don't run the sink or flush the toliet when someone is in the shower. The breakfast was really great. We were there for 5 days and never once did we have any issue with running out of food or anything like that. Plenty of room to sit, lovely wait staff, great coffee and the croissants............ to die for. Nice fresh fruit as well as chopped fruit. We got a free breakfast coupon off of TripAdvisor, which was great. They have free WiFi. It slows down under load (like in the evening when many people are in the hotel using it), but it was reliable and FREE. The only suggestion I have there for improvement would be to not require that you re- login everytime. It might not have been such a nuisance - but they issue you two long abstract codes that you then have to enter in each time. This is a minor thing, but after losing the little paper they give you with the two codes on it - I finally typed it into a word document and then just cut and pasted when I had to. Minor nuisance only - not a big deal! Nice gym. The rooms were very quiet (and we slept in two different ones). The neighborhood is very toney, we never felt unsafe. Oddly, a lot of the wealthy back in the neighborhoods (not outside the hotel - I mean 2-3 blocks away) have dogs and they poop all over the sidewalks and no one picks it up. I was surprized - just watch where you walk once you get away from the hotel. Outside the hotel is as neat as a pin. The location was great. There was a great taxi stand down at the Trocadero (2 short blocks), as well as the Metro that will take you all over Paris very inexpensively. About 2 blocks the other way is the Plaza de Mexico. There is a big grocery store down that way called Casino. It is on the left, across the Plaza (thrid spoke/road to your right), it is sort of inside of a small indoor shopping mall. The grocery store is HUGE - sort of like a Super Target or SuperWalmart - food, rope, socks, books, etc. Great place to buy foodstuffs if you dont want to have to go to restaurants all the time. There is a TERRIFIC little restuarant down off of the Plaza de Mexico called Skabetti's. It is an Italian joint that has really good prices for the area. If you are looking for low key comfort food - go there. Great ambiance as well. Right across from the Casino market. Also, take the recommendations for where to eat from the hotel staff. I would not take their recommendation for lunch at the Le Coq thought. It was very expensive and not good value. It was crowded and we felt out of place there. We chanced into the Passy Cemetary which is 2 blocks from the hotel. That was fascinating. Reminded us of the Recoletta in Buenos Aires (only no cats). The closest I will ever get to Claude DeBussey! Finally, everyone at the hotel was so nice and so helpful. There was a woman on the weekend who was incredibly sweet. I do not know her name, but she was from Madagascar. The guys at the desk were very wonderful and helpful. A really great experience there. We will be back. This is really a great place to stay.

Ask for the Amarone wine. Overall I would say our stay was pretty great at this hotel.

A beautiful location. Extremely close to the metro and nearby are many restaurants and bistros without the noise and clutter. Everything truly was a walk away from everything, stores, bistros, groceries, etc, Trocadero Square. The hotel is just lovely and attentive. Not like your typical \u201cchain\u201d hotels. The staff I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how wonderful and helpful they were. Kirian was fabulous as was George and every one of them. Believe me, we really used all their services for booking tours, breakfasts in rooms, questions, drinks, restaurants, you name it we asked and we always received great information and always happy and with a smile. The beds were VERY comfortable. My only \u2018real\u2019 negative was in the bathroom. We in the states are accustomed to a larger shower basin. The width of the shower was quite small and the shower head always went over the shower glass which only covered half of the length of the shower. The floor would always be wet. On the plus side, LOVED the heated towel rack! Taxi\u2019s were gotten very promptly whether outside and walking or in the hotel. Word of caution though: Kirian was fabulous as was George and every one of them. When you have the front desk phone you a cab from the moment it is called into the cab and dispatched their meter is running. So if the taxi is halfway in another arrondissment it doesn\u2019t matter, that meter is running till it reached the hotel. One Sunday evening we had the front desk call a cab and when we got into the cab to go the my daughter\u2019s apartment (she is studying abroad in Paris) and it was usually 10 euros, we got into the cab and it was 11 euros upon entering the cab. Just be aware of that, it is what it is. The breakfast that the hotel offers is really quite enough. Yogurts, fruits, eggs, croissants, jam, baguettes, juice and coffee. The last week we were there it was brought up to our room. Just a great way to start the day. Ask for a room on the 6th floor. You\u2019ll get a fabulous view of the Eiffel Tower (see pictures). Free Wi-Fi in your room and a computer downstairs in the lobby with a printer. If anything was needed to be printed out, all you had to do was go to the lobby. WE printed many tour tickets from downstairs. Notes: Bus and metro tickets are interchangeable. Metro is very easy to navigate. Bakery and fruit store are across the street if you find the breakfasts to expensive. If you are touring get the two day bus pass for the tour bus. It takes you to most of all the nearby \u201cmust see\u201d sights (Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, Champs, etc. You can get off and on any time and they\u2019ll give you headphones and you program in your language of choice. Take a day trip to Versailles. Just beautiful. If you have the time and are interested in history, go to Normandy. Moulin Rouge, the show was fabulous. You can save money by not having the dinner if you choose. They make you check your camera. BUT on a plus side, there is a photographer who goes table to table. Take a sunset or nighttime cruise down the River Seine. Just beautiful.

Nothing is bad, just different. Everything has its charm.\" We had a very good experience at this hotel in late October 2011. I would recommend it to anyone that can be a traveler. For tourists, find another cookie cutter chain hotel on the outskirts of the city with big sterile rooms and no personality. This hotel is a little city centric gem with lots of charm that is clean, comfortable and in a good location. Its 16th arrondisement location is excellent because the neighborhood is very quiet both day and night so you don't get any street noise when you are trying to rest. We learned that the 16th is an upscale and desirable part of Paris. We always felt safe when walking back from the Trocadero metro station late at night (about a 5-10 minute walk). We requested a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower in advance via email and were given a very nice room on the 6th floor. We could see the top half of the Eiffel Tower from our windows, which was quite a sight at night when it twinkled every hour on the hour. True our room was typically small, as are most city-center European hotels but the room was modernly furnished and the bed had a good mattress, down pillows and comforter providing a good nights rest. We had all we needed with the flat screen TV and updated, if cramped, bathroom since we didn't spend a lot of time there. The front desk and breakfast room staff were super courteous and friendly. We were always greeted with a Bon Jour or Bon Soir. One day I called the front desk to get the access codes for the free Wi-Fi expecting that someone would read them to me over the phone but instead the clerk printed and brought them up to our room in person. Very nice! It was convenient to have breakfast at the hotel - about 20 euro per person additional per day but worth it since it is a buffet. One cafe in Trocadero charged us 19 euro on our first day for ham, eggs, one croissant and an orange juice. The selection at the hotel buffet was very generous including eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, cheeses, fruit, yogurt, cereal, milk, juices, coffee and of course the heavenly croissants and pastries - as many as you can eat! Don't miss the nearby (two metro stops away) Marmottan Monet Museum if you like the impressionists - it has a little secret treasure trove of Monets and it is a small house turned into a museum so your feet won't be falling off when you finish!

The staff were nice and friendly. The hotel is really close to the Trocadero metro station, 15 mins from the Eiffel tower and is located in a nice upscale residential neighborhood. This was a plus since we got a taste of a typical neighborhood: bakery, grocery store etc. and it was nice and quiet. It's also close to a bunch of restaurants with a nice view of the tower while you are people watching and having coffee. Rooms were standard European style and clean. No complaints there. The electronic safe in the room was useful. Here are some tips to maximize your visit: * To get to the hotel from the airport you can take the airport bus to Etoille, take the metro for a couple of stops to get to the Trocadero metro station and walk to the hotel. Alternatively, you could just take the metro from the airport which probably would take you longer * Get the 7 day visitee pass for the metro. This will save you a lot of time and money and is worth it since we used it a lot to get around everywhere. The pass works on the bus too and we used it on the night buses as well * Do pick up the free map they give you at the hotel. It has a better metro map than the other free maps that you can pick up from the airport * There's a nice bakery as soon as you exit the hotel and is quite convenient. They make really good croissants! * There are two bank ATMs if you just walk down the street. I don't think the banks there charge ATM fees but your US bank for sure will for foreign conversion fees and for the withdrawal. Btw, make sure you call your bank ahead of time and inform them about your travel abroad, especially if you have Ally otherwise they'll decline your cash withdrawal * You'll quickly figure out that the cost of buying water is the same as buying wine or beer. So make sure you bottle up some water before you leave the hotel. If you go to the gym at the lower level, they have a water fountain that you can use * The hotel provides free internet in the room and also in the lobby. There's a computer in the lobby that is connected to the internet and has a printer. This was super useful to print out your tickets online if you are going to Versailles (you'll literally save hours at Versailles if you buy your ticket online) or Moulin Rouge * If you buy items that are eligible for a VAT refund, make sure that you get on the right line at the airport for the refund depending on the carrier you are flying back on. We were in line for 20 mins just to find out that they won't stamp our refund since we were flying Air France and we needed to go upstairs to the other VAT refund office that handles Air France and other airline passengers!

First, the location is perfect - in the upscale 16th arrondissement, very safe with a neighborhood feel, and just steps away from the Trocadero Metro station. The downside was that we felt far away from the tourist areas, which would normally be a good thing, but since we visited during the month of August, many of the local businesses nearby were closed. Tip, which we wish we had discovered earlier: if you're there during August, head down to Rue des Belles Feuilles (2 blocks away) to visit the boulangeries and other small shops there. There is also a large Casino supermarket you can shop at. The staff was outstanding - always friendly, and super helpful. Again, we had planned out all of our meals only to discover the majority of the restaurants in Paris were closed in August. So we compiled a new list and the staff graciously called literally over 20 of the restaurants we listed to check if they were open. In the end, they ended up making reservations for us at a couple nearby. I speak French, but the staff spoke very good English. The hotel is a boutique hotel - our room was small, but had a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower. It was very clean and modern, bedding was clean and was changed daily. The bathroom was quite spacious and updated. There is free wi-fi which is a bit slow, but was fine for the internet research we needed to do. Tip: 2 of our favorite restaurants on this trip were within walking distance of the hotel, in the 7th arrondissement (a scenic 20 min walk). Les Cocottes (no reservations), and La Fontaine de Mars (the front desk can make reservations for you and you will be treated like royalty). Both were reasonably priced and offered GREAT food.

Hotel is also located just 3 mins walk from the Trocardero station (on line 9 and 6). We got a little lost on the first day trying to find the hotel from the metro station but eventually found our way. basically, from the station, take exit 4 (Ave. Gorges Mendel) and once out of the station, turn right and walk till you reach the first line (Rue De Greuze). Once on the lane, walk down to No. 32 (takes abt a minute or so). Hotel was in a great central location and we walked everywhere! Arc de Tromphe was abt a 20 min walk from the hotel (you can also take the metro but walking was just so much more fun!) and it will lead you to Champs de Elysee. Aboout another 30 mins walk will lead you right to Place de la Concorde (with the beautiful obelisk) and if you continue you walk, you will go by the jardin des Tuileries right to the Louvre Museam. A long walk indeed but very do-able if the weather is perfect and you have good walking shoes. Don't bother with the breakfast at the hotel. There is a charming bakery just next door which have the most amazing freshly baked goodies. We had great baguette sandwiches and yummy pistachio tarts. It's closed on Saturdays though. Everytime we walked back to our hotel, we could not help but see the stunning Effiel Tower views from the Trocardero. Even more spectaular at nights! Do sit by the steps, with a nutella crepe (from one of the stalls at the area) and watch the blinking lights that come on every hour at the Eiffel Tower at night. The feeling is just magical. From Trocardero, you can walk down right to the Eiffel Tower and the River Seine (takes about 10 mins). We took the River Seine cruise (so romantic!) and cost us about 12 euros for the hour long cruise. The hop-on hop-off batobus tour also operates from there. Overall, an excellent hotel - rooms are a good size, clean and comfortable with free wi-fi access. Another thing, do visit the Chateau De Versailles if you have a day to spare. It's really worthwhile. Don't bother with expensive tours as you can get a free personal tour in the palace itself. Also, it is very easy to get there from the hotel. Take line 9 to the end (Pont de S\u00e8vres) and then get out at the bus exit and take number 171 to the end. A great hotel indeed!

Its just form and function and funny enough, thats what I really liked about it in the end - its simple-ness.

Generally the service is great if you attempt as much as possible in French...they really try hard to please and are very helpful. The front desk staff are especially helpful although one must realize this is a small hotel and they can't provide the services like the large chains. The rooms are surprisingly large....for Paris, with dreamy beds and really nice features. There is no mini bar or fridge (you can get ice in a bucket at most times) and you can't have a kettle in your room but and beside all those facts the rooms are great. Breakfast was a very good spread and very consistently well done.

The only complaint is that housekeeping doesn\u2019t replace used toiletries every day. These are high quality \u2013 Fragonard\u2014and perhaps they are scrimping. But they only give guests one set during the whole stay, which is fine if you are staying for one night, but not good if you stay for three or four nights. Lastly, the hotel is very well located. A few minutes from Trocadero metro station and jogging along the Seine or Champs de Mars (Eiffel tower); a few minutes walk from great shopping and conveniences on rue de Passy or Victor Hugo; and a few minutes walk from many business addresses in the 16th arrondissement.

We stopped at these stores a few times to pick up wine, baguettes and fromage to have ourselves Parisian style picnics. You will also find many cafes and restaurants within walking distance. As for the hotel, it is modern and tastefully decorated. The room was spotless, modern and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and modern as well. The room and bathroom were slightly on the small side but this is expected in Europe. The bed was comfortable, there was plenty of closet space and there was a flat screen TV with several channels, a couple in English but lets face it, you don't go to Paris to sit in the room and watch TV.

The room was cleaned meticulously everyday and whenever we needed something such as an extra towel or a bucket of ice, it was never a problem. There's no mini bar so the bucket of ice comes in handy.

It was located literally round the corner from the Eiffel Tower in a quiet street. There was a reasonably priced supermarket nearby which sold everything. The hotel was clean and tidy and the rooms although not huge were perfectly adequate. The breakfast consisted a range of cereals, scrambled eggs and bacon, cheeses, pastries, fresh (with pith) fruit juices, dried and fresh fruit. There was also a gym if you're into that sort of thing. The hotel was central to everything and there were plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes nearby. We particularly liked Cafe Kleber down Rue de Kleber which did really good food but it wasn't cheap - the same as anywhere in Paris - and the drinks (again as in Paris in generally) were extortionate. The hotel was at the Victor Hugo metro stop - 12 stops from La Chappelle (Gard du Nord - Eurostar). The metro was really easy to negotiate. We managed to do the top of the Eiffel Tower at night which was an amazing experience. However to avoid the queues book your ticket on the internet well in advance, ie several days or even weeks beforehand. We didn't and couldn't get any - we even tried to do it at the hotel but without success. We went about 8.30pm on the off chance of getting in and although we queued for about 30 - 45 mins (short in comparison to the day time queues) it didn't seem that long and although the summit was closed when we joined the queue it was open by the time we bought our tickets. The tower is lit up at night and twinkles like a Christmas tree for 5 mins on the hour - absolutely incredible to see. The Sacre Coeur is quite a walk from the hotel but then it's not central to anything and I would suggest staying around the Eiffel Tower to ensure you're reasonably close to the main sites. We walked everywhere but you can of course get the metro, open top bus and river boat. There are loads of lovely parks if you want/need some peace and quiet.

One word of warning though is to watch your bags and wallets - we saw a couple of people succumb to the pick pockets on the Metro and we were also scammed by a man at the ticket machine at Gard de Nord when we were trying to get out to Stade de France to watch the rugby. He appeared like he was a guard and offered to buy the tickets and we give him cash - given that there were thousands of people behind us and we didn't have a lot of time to think we agreed and ended up with two metro tickets which were worth about \u00a33.40 yet we had seen on the screen the tickets would cost twenty Euro and that is what we gave him! We were annoyed with oursleves but it all happened so quickly! Anyway - just a word of warning. There is a great little shopping area if you go out of the hotel turn left and walk up to the roundabout and then take any of the streets on the left, one is full of clothing shops and the other full of food outlets / patisseries and a small supermarket.

We had a balcony and a view of the Eiffel Tower that we could see from our bed. The room, while somewhat small, were simply fantastic; the bed was comfortable; the breakfast was adequate, the location was just about perfect, but it's the service that stands out above all others. As I said, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. I told them of this on Saturday, and they arranged for flowers to be sent (not only sent, but they staged the room with flowers on the bed and flower pedals all over the room), the champagne to be chilled, a delicate presentation of the glasses with pedals, and a box of chocolates. Simply AMAZING! My fiancee (by the time we entered the room), took one step in the door and started crying. It was a combination of effort from Daniel who ordered the flowers (and came WAY under budget while still ordering the extra pedals; which I didn't specify but am oh so glad that he did) and the manager (please forgive me for not remembering your name!) who staged the room to be so breathtaking that it brought tears to her eyes and caused her to drape around me and just finalize the most perfect evening.

The view however was of the flats opposite and what ever they were doing. we could also just make out the top of the Eiffel Tower if we leaned out of the window. The shower was one of the worst contraptions I have ever used. To use the shower you had to hold the shower on you rather than leaving it attached tom the wall as if you did it would only spray onto the wall, once I had mastered this it was very good, But I have not had to use a shower like that in years either at home or in a Hotel.

Sophie welcomed us and although we were early she kept our luggage and then gave us a map and advised us on how to get around. The tube map can look very intimidating at first but its just as easy as the London Undergound once you've been on it a couple of times and the service is really quick and the stops seem to be so close together you can move about town really quickly. This will sound a bit repetitive but, as the others have said, the hotel is 2 minutes from the Trocadero station which is also 3 stops from the Arc De Triomphe. We also went to Sacre Coeur and Montmartre both of which are unmissable and also only about 20 minutes or so away on the Metro. As we were only away for a long weekend it was difficult to see all the sights but we got a boat trip in and a trip to Notre Dame but missed out on seeing Versailles which my wife hasn't visited before. Breakfast in the hotel is plentiful; meat, cheese and a variety of cereals and yogurts plus a hot tray with bacon and scrambled egg. Again, service was always very polite and efficient. We had a deluxe room and expected it to be slightly small, as all European cities tend to be, but we spent little time in it anyway. It was still decorated and furnished very tastefully and the bed was extremly comfortable. I must echo the 'shower' problem. Its difficult to imagine how anyone came up with this concept but you should just acknowledge that you will be better off holding it rather than take the chance of swimming back to the bedroom...!! A special mention to Sophie on reception who was possibly the friendliest member of staff I have come across and it makes such a difference to be welcomed so warmly every time you enter the hotel. Overall, whilst I couldn't really fault the hotel, Paris is a very expensive place to stay. Most places we visited charged around \u00a32.50 for a coke, \u00a34 for a coffee and between \u00a36.50-7.50 for a bottle of beer.

Very hip, modern hotel without being pretentious. Located on a quiet street just off the Trocadero (four minute walk). We stayed on the fourth floor in a deluxe room that we could see the Tour Eiffel from if we leaned out the window a bit. We booked last minute so we didn't expect a higher floor with a great view, but I honestly have NO complaints about the room location or view! For a deluxe room it was small, but I know that's what to expect. I've been to enough European hotels to know. I'm afraid to see what a classic or superior room looked like though! Bathroom was a good size, lovely beveled subway tile, modern sink and amenities. Nice closet with robes and slippers. We had a space just for luggage, and there was a desk and a second sitting area. Nice flat screen TV, though only two channels in English. No biggie. Bed was comfortable and the pillows were giant fluffy clouds... The lobby was beautiful and is where they have a little bar for drinks or tea and a nice sitting area with lots of books. No mini-bar in the rooms, so this is the alternative. My wife got some wine while we relaxed before leaving for our flight and they brought it to us and gave us a little bowl of chips. Very nicely done. Breakfast room is very nice as well. Nice little continental selection. It was included and it was a nice start to the day. Decorated so nice we are going to mimic the style in our front hallway! The hotel is located about a ten minute walk to the Eiffel and about 20 minute to the Arc. A Metro stop is right at the Trocadero and the system gets you EVERYWHERE. We caught a double decker tour bus for 24 euro per person and it's good for two days. It beings you to the Louvre, Grand Palais, Eifel, Arc, Champs, etc. Good way to get around for a short trip to see some major sights. Ok....on to the personnel. Just like everyone else, we got nothing but OUTSTANDING service from the people here. The woman that first checked us in (sorry for forgetting her name) was a pleasure and extremely helpful. she made some nice dinner recommendations based on my wife's craving for a fancy French duck diner. They all went out of their way to speak English, give us directions and suggestions. Daniel helped us at the front desk and with our bags. Always smiling and very friendly. George went absolutely OUT of his way to help us. He was getting off work when we were headed to a shuttle bus a way's away to get out to the Beauvais airport, and he took us on the tram and the RER train line to our stop and even helped pay for our tickets!! What hotel would EVER have a staff member go out of their way like that?? NONE. Enough cannot be said for the graciousness of the staff here.

We arrived before the scheduled check-in time but were allowed access to our room on the 4th Floor. The room was clean, fresh and well furnished, after all when you are on a visit to Paris very little time is spent in the room other than for sleeping and showering. As others have said the shower heads do need to be carefully directed if you are not to spray the floor. ( We had used the toiletries after the 2nd day but they were not replenished, we bought our own) Apart from this minor gripe we had no complaints. The bed and pillows were clean and very comfortable making for a good nights sleep after a hard day trekking the streets of Paris. The air conditioning worked very well and we were able to return to a nice cool room during what was very warm spell of weather. The hotel is well placed and we managed to walk to most of the tourist sites without too much effort,(eg the Eiffel Tower can be reached in about 5-6 minutes) we heard no noise from the streets or indeed from other guests on the corridors. All staff were extremely polite and helpful and a credit to the hotel. The provision of their own map of places to see/eat with an idea of the budget required was very useful as was the wider map of Paris given to us on check in. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment. We took breakfast at a nearby brassierie within a minute of the hotel at the Place de Mexico which was very good value for money. We tended to eat in little bistros or brasseries in side streets as these were considerably better value than those located around the Trocadero who charged a lot more for food, beer and wine.

Transportation We drove to Paris for the weekend. We parked on the street through the advice of the hotel staff. There were no signs forbidding parking or any signs indicating anything of that nature and needless to say\u2026we got towed on our second day. We know from experience there is no such thing as free parking but we paid the price anyway. Getting our car back was a surprisingly painless process. It is much cheaper to park in the nearby garage Ave Foch. We walked around the city for the rest of our stay and used the metro twice (stations Trocadero or Passy). Neighborhood The hotel is in a residential area and not near any of the main tourist attractions. It seemed to be safe as we walked back to the hotel at night. The metro stations are about a 10 minute walk if you have to go further. Great views of the Eiffel Tower are nearby. The location was ideal as this was a return trip to Paris for us but we wouldn\u2019t have chosen it for our first time here. Room (photos included) We had a standard double room and our rate was \u20ac162 as an average per night for the weekend (including breakfast). We booked the hotel through the hotel website. The room was small and the d\u00e9cor was modern. The bed was a queen size and comfortable. The room was equipped with a desk, chair, TV, safe and wardrobe. No fridge was in the room. The room was on the warm side due to unexpected temperature for April and the air conditioner did not help keep it cool \u2013 we opened the windows and that helped. Bathroom (photos included) The bathroom was white tiled and modern \u2013 photos of it look great but you can tell it is cheaply built. Our bathroom had a shower/tub combination.

I had very mixed feelings about the hotel. It has a fantastic location. You are a block from Tracadero and only 2 blocks from the Eiffel Tower. However, the rooms looked worn and the room seemed expensive in comparison to what we received. In the end the wonderful staff and great location won me over on the hotel. After having a travel nightmare trying to get into Paris, we were greeted by a wonderful staff. We flew into CDG at 9 PM. Little did I know that we were flying into Terminal 3, a small charter terminal. We walked over Terminal 2. I must admit we were not very prepared for our arrival. I didn\u2019t have any Euros at this point because we had flown in from Prague, and we thought we could get a better exchange rate in the Paris airport. However, the only exchange place open was back in Terminal 3. We decided not to walk back there. I assumed it would be easy to catch a cab, but the only option there was the train or metro. We decided it would be easiest just to get on the metro since we had a metro map in our travel guide, but we didn\u2019t have any info on the train. I\u2019m sure the train would have been faster, but it took us an hour and one transfer to get to the hotel (while lugging around 2 big suitcases and 2 carry-ons). Once we got to the Tracadero stop, we weren\u2019t sure which direction to go to the hotel (it is down the street to the left of the row of caf\u00e9s facing Tracadero). Once we got to the hotel, I realized I had only booked the room for one person. The staff was great! There wasn\u2019t any problem adding my husband to the room. I also had them arrange for a car to pick us up to take us back to the airport. I was not about to try the metro again with the suitcases. We rode in a nice Mercedes taxi with a friendly driver. We chose not to pay the 18 Euros a person for breakfast. I wanted to try as many restaurants and caf\u00e9\u2019s in Paris as possible during our 3-day trip. I discovered a wonderful bakery right next door to the hotel. We would grab a croissant in the morning then walk to Tracadero to take our daily picture in front of the Eiffel Tower. I thought if we took a picture each day, we would have at least one good one. Also, previous reviews mentioned a supermarket down the street from the hotel. We saw several small markets, so we thought we found it. On our last day there, we found the actual supermarket. If you take a left out of the hotel, and go around the round-a-bout so you stay on the same street there will be a shopping center down on your left. There was a supermarket and a Paul bakery. We got a wonderful snack and some well priced wines from there. There is not a corkscrew in the room, so we just bought one at the market. We couldn\u2019t find one in any of the other shops around the hotel. Do be warned that the stores around the hotel are very expensive. Our taxi driver told us that we were in a very ritzy part of Paris. There were a ton of embassies and nice homes. Also, the hotel is difficult for taxi drivers to find. We would just tell them to drop us off at Tracadero, and walk the rest of the way to the hotel. We did some of the usual tourist things. We went to the Louvre. I had bought tickets online about two weeks before our trip. There was enough time to have them delivered to my house, and it saved us a wait in a long line. We walked to the Louvre from the hotel. It only took about 20 minutes. We had a nice stroll along the river and through the Place de la Concorde and Tuileries Gardens. The museum was very crowded so we only went through a few rooms and saw the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. After leaving the museum, we had my favorite meal of the entire trip. We went to Angelia. It\u2019s a tea house on the Rue de Rivoli. It\u2019s only a few minute walk from the Louvre. I had a wonderful quiche, and the best hot chocolate I\u2019ve ever tasted. My husband and I shared a small pot of chocolate and their signature desert called a Mont Blanc. It was more than the two of us could eat. One last warning on the hotel. I never considered showering an Olympic sport until I stayed here. The bathrooms are very modern. We had a showerhead like I had never seen before. It was tall and thin, and the water pressure would cause it to turn. This would not have been a problem, but in every European hotel we stayed in there was only a small glass door that was attached to the wall and no shower curtain. This one had the smallest door of them all. We would drench the bathroom every morning. Since the hotel only provided two towels, this made for an interesting morning. The hotel also provided a computer with free internet in the lobby and L'Occtaine bath products.", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a fantastic position\u201d", "Author": "ErikG", "ReviewID": "UR31542855", "Content": "We travelled by eurostar and arrived at Gare du Nord, from there a 2 min walk over to Gare du L'est to catch the number 30 bus which goes to Trocadero which is a couple of minutes walk to the hotel.

We slept with our one window open but were awakened early every morning by the noise of daily garbage collection. Our \"Deluxe Room with sitting area\" was a joke! There was a single straight backed chair shoved into a corner with a cheap table the size of a pregnant pizza pan, blocking the only mirror and preventing us from opening the window. We'd hit our shins on it unless we shoved it under the desk. For this we were charged an extra 22 euros per night. The staff was friendly but gave us bum directions to the RER station for a Versailles excursion. The desk clerk also failed to tell us until check-out that breakfast had been included in our room rate--too bad, too late! They had told our booking agency, Hotels.com, that breakfast would be an extra 15 euros per person/day so we ate there only once. I had even sent a fax inquiry before departure, but the hotel never responded. The hotel fails to list a phone number anywhere in their internet material. They did charge us 4.50 euros per cup for coffee at the reception desk. We had read a guest comment in TripAdvisor that the coffee at the desk was complimentary. Don't believe it. The bathroom was all style and no function. The lighting and mirror were poorly placed so hubby needed binoculars to see how to shave and I couldn't get close enough to see the back of my head even with a hand mirror. The shower looked sleek and chic but always got the floor wet and didn't spray very well. The hot water ran out and my shower turned cold one morning at 8:30 a.m. Two people can't fit in the bathroom at the same time, unless one stands in the tub, and you can't reach the towel rack without closing the door. The floor was sticky our first night, so I washed it with the tub mat. Storage space in the room was crappy--no drawers at all in the room or bathroom and the closet was cramped. But, the bed was comfortable and internet was gratis. Had this place not been billed as #19 out of more than 1000 Paris hotels on Trip Advisor, I would have said it was ok for a Paris hotel. But with such a high rating, we expected more and it certainly did not deliver!", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "park city, ut", "Title": "\u201cWonderful botique hotel, great staff, quiet neighborhood.\u201d", "Author": "flyjets", "ReviewID": "UR28175874", "Content": "A great hotel (about 43 rooms) very close walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and the Seine.

We were very pleased. The staff was consistently very helpful and kind to us -- and we asked MANY questions, all in English. They answered all my emails before I arrived and made reservations for us at a couple of restaurants -- one was particularly special. We left behind an item of jewelry and they called us en route to the airport to let us know they had found it and then shipped it to us promptly. I am very grateful to them for their gracious hospitality to us throughout the entire stay. The rooms were small but had everything one could want. The beds were very comfortable. The shower enclosure is small by US standards but one can figure out quickly how to position oneself and the shower nozzle to avoid splattering the room with water so it was not uncomfortable. I will say that the street outside our room was noisier early on the weekday mornings than I had expected from the reviews. I recommend keeping the windows shut on weeknights. On weekend nights the street was very quiet. The hotel serves a very satisfactory full breakfast for 15 euros and there are multiple decent alternatives within a 5 minute walk if one desires a change. That is true for lunch and dinner as well ( the hotel does not serve either but will arrange for a local deli to deliver items to your room). The hotel is on a corner (rue Greuze and rue Sablons) in an otherwise residential area, a five minute walk from the Trocadero, where there are several museums and a Metro stop for the 6 and 9 lines, and most of all, at the Trocadero, one is just across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower. Then, about 20 minutes in the opposite direction is the Arc du Triomphe and the beginning of the Champs Elysees. The hotel called taxis for us regularly and they arrived within a few minutes. If you do not speak French well, I recommend taking something with the hotel's address on it as it is not a well-known street.

I wanted to find someplace special that wouldn't cost us our house! After reading the reviews here, I was fairly confident that we had found the right place....and we did. When we visti other countries, we prefer to stay in places that will allow us to experience a piece of native life....the Plaza Tour Eiffel does that. The hotel is located in an upscale residential area. At 8 AM, watch the mothers and fathers walking their children to school; by 10 AM the older women are walking to the markets. If you head towards the Trocadera, you will pass the Thailand and Spanish Embassies. If you head toward Place de Mexico, you'll pass a local bakery, boutiques and fresh fruit market. We spent every evening sipping wine and eating cheeses at the various bistros at the Trocadera which is a few minute walk from the hotel. There are very few tourists there (relatively speaking), and you'll find yourself immersed in French spoken with the speed of the TGV. (Although all the waitstaff spoke fluent english.) The hotel is lovely. The personnel are helpful in every way, taking our bags from the cabbie and to our room. Our plane came in early, and we were at the hotel at 10:30 AM. we fully expected to leave our bags there and check in later. However, they had a room ready for us which was a treat as we had just come in from the States and were fairly \"fried\". Our room was a bit small because we had a corner room over the front door, but it suited us fine. The bathroom was spotless, of a good size and has a good hairdryer in it! The storage is primarily in a wardrobe - and it did fit the clothing of two people with no problem. The bed was extremely comfortable, as were the pillows. We ended up leaving at 6 AM to catch a flight, and they offered to check us out the night before so we wouldn't be delayed, as well as arranged for a taxi which arrived right on time. Overall, it was a great place to stay...I would recommend it to everyone and anyone. Should we ever be able to return to Paris, I shall stay there again. FYI, the Metro is less than a 5 minute walk away, the Eiffel Tower takes 10-15 minutes to stroll, as does the Batabus, The Arc de Triomphe is about 40 minutes to walk to via the Avenue of New York next to the Seine.

We went with two other couples to Paris, this is our second trip and the first trip for the other two couples. I travel abroad extensively as part of my job and am accustomed to staying in 4 - 5 star hotels. So when we were looking into this trip I had to consider the other two couples and their spending limits ... so to the web we went. We looked at at least twenty different hotels, going back and forth on cost vs. features, reading every review we could, consulting a travel agent, etc. until we finally settled on the Tour Eiffel. Once the booking was complete I was never really sold as I know what European hotels are like and you typically get what you pay for. The 4-5 star hotels are very expensive but you get the amenities of large bathrooms, comfortable beds, in house resteraunt, room services, etc. Well knowing all this I was expecting the least from the Tour Eiffel, even though the reviews have been good on TA. Anyway, now to the review; we booked the Executive Suite and it is small but with a balcony, view of the Eiffel Tower (top half) we really enjoyed the room. The bed is large and very comfortable, the linens are fresh and crisp and the pillows are full and fluffy. The bath rooms are small. The showers have the half glass partition and it is difficult (no impossible) to take a shower without getting the bathroom all wet. The hot water ran out on me a couple of times during peak shower time (I guess 7-8 am) In other words the rooms are what you would expect for the price and size of this hotel. BUT; the location can not be beat. It is just off the beaten path and you should take a hotel business card with you to tell the cab drivers the address of the hotel. But the Trocedero Circle is about a 5 minute walk with a Metro station and Taxis stand. Right across the street from the circle is the promenade to the Eiffel Tower, about another 5-10 minute walk. We spent a lot of time in this area, laying on the lawn with our brown bags of wine, sandwiches and enjoyed the scenery and weather. The biggest part of this review is to comment on the service of the hotel; the Staff is genuinely friendly, helpful, courteous and professional. They went above and beyond to accommodate us and serve all of our needs. I must especially compliment the front desk staff for this. I bought my wife a dozen roses at a nearby flower shop (Place de Mexico) and as I was walking through the lobby they asked if I need a vase. It was brought to my room promptly with water and sugar for the roses. We asked for wine glasses on one occasions as all three couples met in our room and from then all we had fresh glasses every day. One Saturday night me and the other two men stayed in the lobby until 5 am listening to a College game, they never blinked an eye and kept the bar open for us all night. Anyway, I don't know what else to say to convince someone that this is a great hotel to stay at. If you want creature comforts and 5 star ambiance it is not for you. But if you want to be in the local crowd , close to the Eiffel Tower and receive excellent service then I highly recommend the Tour Effiel. FWIW; we are now at the Intercontinental Le Grand for the last five days of an 11 day trip, the service is not near what it was at this hotel. Other hints; De Vino on Plaza de Mexico is a very good restaurant. Nicolas (wine shop) is off the Place, third street on the left about 100 yds down in a little mall like area. Pataserier is across the hallway for good pastries and sandwiches. The Eiffel Tower restaurant Jules Verne is worth every penny.

Overal a fantastic weekend at a big price, but highly recommended and I would certainly look no further than this hotel for a short stay.", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asia", "Title": "\u201cNice location\u201d", "Author": "daniel_chung11", "ReviewID": "UR17743805", "Content": "I book this hotel through www.tramazing.com able to find the best and cheapest rate compare to others.

The rooms were clean, the bathroom immaculate and the breakfast is well worth it. We arrived on May 11, 2008 and stayed 5 nights in a Deluxe Room. The area was very quiet in the evenings, which made it perfect for our early morning tours. We were within a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, and a 20 minute walk to the Arch de Triumph and Champs Elysees, so our location was ideal for us. Also, the Metro Station, Trocadero, specifically lines 6 and 9, were perfect when we wanted to go into other sections of Paris and see the touristy sights, then come back to our cozy room and relax at night. There is a perfect cafe just a few steps away from the metro - Cafe du Trocadero. You can have an excellent meal in the evenings, and from their outdoor tables you have a clear view of the Eiffel Tower lit up in the evenings and you can stay as long as you like - the waiters don't rush you out. We ate there twice and both times enjoyed watching the Eiffel Tower sparkle like a Christmas tree in the late hours. The front desk staff at the hotel are extremely pleasant and helpful. The fitness room is available throughout the day and is well equipped in my opinion as well as well maintained. Also, there is water available there and we helped ourselves to refilling our water bottles just before leaving on our scheduled day trips or sightseeing. For breakfast, there is a hot buffet available and it is refreshed regularly up until about 20 minutes before closing. There is also an excellent selection of juices, pastries and cereals as well as yogurt and fresh fruit, so every appetite is taken care of. The breakfast staff will provide coffee, tea or hot cocoa and the breakfast room is very clean and the table linens and assorted pictures of the Eiffel Tower bring elegance to the overall room design. The deluxe room is a good size and typical of European hotels. There are no drawers, but they do offer several shelves and when we requested more hangers for our clothes the front desk staff responded politely and promptly. Our hairdryer was not working in the room, and a replacement hair dryer was brought to us within minutes! I simply cannot complain about this hotel. They even offer room service late into the evening. The prices are consistent with local restaurants in the area, so if you have sticker shock over the Euro, I suggest that you budget accordingly and accept the fact that it will take nearly two US dollars for every Euro you spend. As far as this hotel is concerned, I would definitely recommend it to other guests. In fact, when we stayed it was quite crowded with guests, both American and European. It seems to be a well kept secret for great Parisian hotels, and I can see why. My husband and I loved Paris, and plan to stay here again on our next visit.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood for a Getaway!\u201d", "Author": "warproder", "ReviewID": "UR15935764", "Content": "> Hotel staff were eager to please > Rooms have been recently refurbished in a contemporary style and are very clean.

Plaza Tour Eiffel is around 5 minutes' walk from Trocadero Metro station, down a quiet street - not a picturesque street, but not a bad one, and when you leave the hotel and walk down that street to see a view of the Eiffel Tower across the Seine, through the Trocadero - it's not bad. The hotel itself is excellent - newly refurbished, with modern, understated yet sophisticated decor and excellent detail. eg. as you walk out of the lift, motion sensors outside switch on subtle lighting for the floor, including spots that illuminate the room numbers on each door. A small detail, but it's like this throughout. The room was not huge, but the most was made of the space; a cleverly located narrow floor-to-ceiling mirror in the corner made it feel larger. Everything was clean, and the flat-screen TV was great, with a range of French and international channels. The service was friendly. It's a small hotel, with 4-5 small rooms per floor, and one member of staff on duty during the day. I didn't try the breakfast. WiFi is free, with a free login slip from reception; the internet connection was pretty slow (probably a domestic broadband link), and I had to quit my firewall when connecting, as it blocked the login screen. The room is a bit small for the desk, seat, and bed to fit together - I was slightly cramped at the desk. Also, Trocadero is a bit of a journey from most things, if you're there on business, so this wouldn't be my first choice for a business trip, although it's nice to get away from the bustle for a bit.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cwhat a team\u201d", "Author": "tanner.smith", "ReviewID": "UR15072610", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 days with our 8 year old daughter.
