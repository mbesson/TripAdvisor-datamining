This was a great place to be if you want to walk around old Montreal. Staff was extremely helpful and polite. Our room was pretty with a nice view toward the water. The bathroom was lovely. The hotel does encourage conservation (i.e. reducing frequency of washing towels and sheets) which is great. But they should leave more than 2 towels for the shower. As one reviewer mentioned, there is a train that comes through late-night that might wake you. Other things this hotel could improve: breakfast, while included, is not great. I would rather have fewer choices (excellent coffee and local bakery bread/croissant) than several mediocre offerings. The complimentary welcome cocktail is a nice idea, but would be better if it were freely offered in the lounge, rather than giving each guest a coupon to exchange at the bar. If they offered it in the lounge, they could provide beer and wine and would seem lovely and generous, rather than having an awkward conversation between bartender and guests as they hand over their coupon in the bar (\"This is only good for house wine and draught beer.\") Aside from those things, we truly enjoyed our time here.

The hotel staff comprises of just two persons (concierge and valet), and the service they deliver is exemplary. However, there are two reasons we won't be returning - the uncomfortable beds and the pub-style breakfast that is included. We were in the new section the first night, and changed rooms to the original section for the remainder of our stay. The King bed in the new section was soft and lumpy, but the main reason we changed rooms was because the new rooms (added on last summer) are so narrow, with long walls, one could barely walk around the end of the bed. We felt like we were sleeping in a hallway. The older rooms are large and square, but the mattress in this Riverside King deluxe was completely shot - when you sat on it one side had no support at all. We had such poor sleep on this bed, and this combined with the cargo train that runs in the middle of the night below the hotel along the river, made for miserable sleeps. We did not complain to the hotel staff about the terrible bed, because we were told when we changed rooms the second day, that this was all that was available. The breakfast that is included is certainly not up to the expected standard of a four star hotel or boutique hotel (to those that say it is free - let me say that nothing is free- it is factored into the costs). The continental buffet consists of cornflakes, commercial sliced bread, and some days commercial mini croissants and orange juice, and packets of cheap jam and artificial honey (didn't know this even existed).You could also order a plate of bacon, eggs, fried potatoes. There sorely needs to be available on the buffet - yogurt, fresh fruit, artisanal breads that are healthy and interesting, and decent croissants/pastries, cheese, and quality preserves.There are many wonderful local bakeries in Montreal from which to source great products. Ditch the offering of fried potatoes and eggs. Let people order this extra if they want it. I don't eat this way at home, and when I travel I expect a four star will offer not only a higher standard of edibles, but also some smarter choices for their guests. The coffee needs an upgrade as well. In the end, there is no amount of spectacular service that can win me over without a comfortable bed and a healthier breakfast offering.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best boutique hotels I've stayed in\u201d", "Author": "BritishGuyInToronto", "ReviewID": "UR127556563", "Content": "Our friends recommended this hotel, having stayed there last year.

Michael at the front desk, was extremely friendly and very helpful. Free cooked breakfast was included, plus a free drink and free Internet access in the lobby and free Wi-Fi.

I wanted to express my sincere satisfaction and appreciation for services that were provided me by your staff professionals that exceeded my expectations. You should know that my profession is business development and I am a well-seasoned sales professional as sales-trainer. I have spent many years instructing staff as to professional service and follow-through always meeting and exceeding client expectations every single time, with every single guest, every single time...whether you feel like it, or not. As a sales professional and business development director, I know that the best way to make your clients happy is to meet their expectations. The best way to ensure client loyalty is to consistently meet or exceed their expectations. The best way to make your clients \"word-of-mouth-referral-machines\" is to provide them a memorable experience. The following professionals provided me memorable experiences worthy of great praise for their absolute attention to detail: Front-Desk, Trifon Boumbovski is the best experience I have had of a well-trained service professional in many years. He went beyond expectations in that he was attentive and responsive to my needs displaying a willingness to do whatever necessary to make me feel right at home. He gracefully managed 2-to-3 guests at one time meeting their needs while providing a sense of attention and focus. Trifon made a tough job in working with the individual needs of every single guest seem easy. He also has a pleasantly disarming sense of humor and respect. Mathieu Verronneau - Valet was attentive, responsive and anticipated my needs. There is a certain uneasiness that I feel handing my car keys to what moments ago was a perfect stranger. Mathieu immediately went beyond expectations in providing me comfort and follow-through of every minor request that I made. He gave me the immediate sense that all would be taken care of in regards to my car, my luggage and my initial walk-in to my room. Eric Bellavance - Restaurant - exceeded my expectations in tireless efforts to please and create a unique dinning environment. He was responsice yet not intrusive. He was eager to please and meet my needs while providing exceptionally quick service. These service professionals - Trifon, Mathieu and Eric - are 3 reason why I will refer guests to Auberge Vieux Port. You should be commended on your professional insight to work with and develop the talents of these service professionals. Their respective dedication to detail and excellence reflects well upon you as well as Auberge Vieux Port. Your operation is exceptional. I will recommend your hotel and will continue to return to Auberge Vieux Port for many more years.

We booked a Queen deluxe that faced St Paul Street in the back. I wasn't one of the \"old\" rooms that everyone raves about, but the room was very nice and modern with an interesting contrast of an exposed brick wall. The room had beautiful hardwood floors with modern furniture and fixtures and high ceilings. You could open the windows on to the street, which along with the brick makes it more unique than a big chain hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable, nice linens, robes and slippers, nice bath amenities, rain-shower (no tub). The room was a little on the long and narrow side, but overall very nice - you're supposed to be out and about anyway. One note about the gorgeous hardwood floors though is that you hear everything: cleaning staff in the halls, high-heels in the room next door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or above you. If you are a light sleeper (which we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) you might want earplugs.

I work in the old port and have driven by a thousand times and never new of such a gem untill my wife found the booking for us. Rooftop terrace is a bit unrefined but matches all the other rooftops around. Service was excellent at the desk, though when i called because the jucuzzi air jets would not turn off at 11:30 at night there was no rush on there part and i ended up just fixing it myself!! Suprised that its only 3.5 stars- The area in the blocks around is the place to be -rue des artistes and attractions galore- Perfect Location!!

(the pillow is a bit high for the neck but no other complaint on bedding) It is my third stay at the hotel and we have been staying in the new section, room 212. As of a few minutes ago, our electronic key card wouldn't let us in our room (which, i know, isn't a rare occurrence at hotels in general). Also, we did not receive a Newspaper at our door this morning. The room looks good but is narrower than the old one thus making it feel a bit small. The window and rock wall is also smaller. The rest of the room is well decorated. The new washroom looks good. Shower is well made with nice tile floor. There is some kind of publicity going through the TV at regular intervals which is annoying even when just watching the weather channel! Breakfast was a Fiasco! We got there at 10:30 and were received by a very busy waiter. He made us wait at least 10 minutes in the entrance to then be advised that breakfast was closing at 10:30 as the only cook didn't have time to prepare anything else since he had to get ready for lunch. We had the rest of continental breakfast which consists of toast, coffee and cereal, quite a let down. We were not the only clients disappointed by this. We were also surrended by dirty plates and bowls as the waiter didn't have time to clean after clients left. I can't blame the waiter for this problem but the hotel had definitely lost my business at that point. We then decided to go see the roof terrace as we wanted to shoot a few pictures. There weren't any signs indicating if the terrace was closed or not! The door was unlocked. IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, MAKE SURE THEY ARE SUPERVISED IF THEY GO THERE because deck is, for one, very slippery and there aren't any railings on the side which is very dangerous, let me remind you that the terrace is on the fifth floor! Besides the breakfast service, front desk, car valet and room service staff were very polite. I do believe that this will be my last stay at this hotel. At this price, the hotel is overrated and the roof terrace issue could be a major danger for your kids.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bozeman, MT", "Title": "\u201cA rooom with a view...\u201d", "Author": "geo2urist", "ReviewID": "UR121957370", "Content": "We just returned from 4 nights in Montreal at the Auberge du-Vieux Port in the old part of the city. We tend to stay in properties that are historic and give you a real sense-of-place. This property nailed it! Our room over looked the St. Lawrence River and seaport in \"Old Montreal\" which is definitely the place to stay if you are visiting Montreal and want to experience the authenticity of this city. Our room was cozy, historic (big wooden ceiling beams, wooden floors, high ceilings) with just the right amount of modern conveniences (the coffee maker was an espresso machine)! The in-room amenities were very nice especially the bathrobes (we had a River View King Premier room which included a great shower and jacuzzi tub). A full breakfast or continental breakfast was included every morning and served in the Gaspar Tavern which is attached to the hotel day (I don't normally like to eat my breakfast in a bar, but the atmosphere in this pub was delightful) The full breakfast included everything from eggs every which way to French Crepes and French toast. In the evening they serve a combination of very good French & English \"comfort food\" not to mention a wonderful variety of regional wines, beers and liquor. Other GREAT restaurants are within easy walking distance. The staff was friendly, efficient and fluent in several languages. This small hotel has a warm and welcoming ambiance, is very clean, and conveniently located. The old part of the city is known for its restaurants, shopping and general sightseeing and it certainly lived up to those expectations. If you want to venture off to explore other parts of the city, the subway station is within walking distance of this small (27 room) quaint historic hotel. The only \"downside\" that I could see might be that our room faced the rue de la Commune which may be noisy in the summer if you have the windows open but I would definitely stay here again! P.S. There is also a terrace on the roof which was not open at this time of year but it looked like a great place to relax and have a cocktail...the views from up there would be spectacular. P.S.S.

We were celebrating my birthday and chose your hotel based on a great stay we had there last year. This year's experience was however markedly differentl. We booked the same accommodation as last year, a deluxe loft, online and received written confirmation of our booking in advance of our arrival. When we arrived on Friday evening, we were however told that all of the deluxe lofts were booked and we were being upgraded to a larger room. When we walked over to this room with the concierge and climbed 7 floors imagine our surprise to find, while a much larger room with 2 bedrooms, a room that was VERY cold ( no heat was on and a window was open), the couch was soiled, the phone was not working and the bathroom was very outdated. When we asked if we could use the fireplace we were told - no sorry, not yet. Our concierge, recognizing the obvious disappointment on our faces, offered to see what he could do for us. Upon his return in 15 mins we moved to a smaller more modern room as this was our only other option, after another walk and climb up another seven flights. To add insult to injury, we listened to partiers in the laneway for much of what was left of the night and then the garbage/recycling trucks at 6 a.m. It was one of the worst sleeps I've ever experienced. We raised these concerns with front desk staff on Saturday morning and they offered us a room facing the river in the Inn once guests had checked out - and bumping some other guests who had booked this room. After two more trips to the front desk that morning, we did switch rooms and atleast this enabled us to get a good night's sleep. I asked the staff several times over the weekend if they could explain what had happened to our reservation and they were not able to, although they were polite and told me that they has asked the Asst Mgr.

The restaurant and bar were busy around 7, but everything was shuttered relatively early. Our room had a great jacuzzi with separate shower. The shower stall, however, was a bit tight. Strange, given the enormous size of the room, so hopefully any future updates will include a larger shower (walk-in would be great!).

The sunrises we saw from these windows were exceptional. Some of the most colorful we have ever seen, (see attached photos). The room was tastefully decorated. The walls were what appeared to be original old brick, very cosy looking. The floors were timber, so we made sure we took off our hard soled shoes at night so the guests below us would not be disturbed. The restaurant on the ground floor was exceptional. We had a wonderful meal there one night. We would have had more but there were too many other restaurants around us to try. The complimentary breakfast was served on the lower ground floor and was all one could ask for. Both the restaurant and breakfast area were very well decorated, comfortable and of a very high standard. It was only a short walk to a nice plaza and many other restaurants.

This time it did, and I'm glad. Montreal is so different from any other North American city I know, so I wanted us to stay somewhere that would remind us we weren't in Kansas. This place does the trick. It has an historic feel throughout, displaying many interesting relics from its past, some with narrative plaques. It's very intimate and cozy. There's one main inn, plus some lofts over a nice bar, where my friends stayed, just a city block away. My room was very spacious and clean, which can also be said of my friends' loft. Their loft could have slept 6 -- it had one bedroom, plus a sleeping area a few feet above a living room with a sofabed (I think). I could easily have crashed with them, except the loft/living room sleeping areas offered little privacy. You can see what the rooms look like from others' photos. I'll just add that mine was very clean, comfortable and quaint, if not ultra luxurious. It was a little too dark at night -- higher wattage bulbs, or at least a proper reading lamp would be a nice place to start, people. But my stay was relaxing, and the staff were ALL very friendly and polite and helpful to me. Hotels with character and charm typically have trade-offs. No A/C in the summer (if true) could be a problem. The front entrance is an awkward 3 stairs above the sidewalk. If Canada's accessibility laws are anything like ours, I assume they can accommodate wheels in the back entrance, which is on the charmingly cobblestoned and slightly touristy Rue St. Paul. By the way, the noise complaints are right. They should rename the above street Rue Bourbon; it is crunking loud, even on a cold November weeknight. The windows of this old hotel can keep out the weather, but not the shouting and singing. Easy solution: Request a room over the front of the building (port view), which will be much quieter. Not an option for me, because there happened to be renovation work on that side, but the ear plugs I remembered in my travel kit were enough to get me back to sleep. Nighttime revelers aside, we enjoyed the location. Chinatown restaurants and The Champ-de-Mars Metro station are just a 5-minute walk, although not in inclement weather.

The hallway to the suite itself also serves other suites that do not house hotel guests. I heard families coming and going and screaming in the halls at odd hours. The suite itself is large, has decent but not great furnishings and the condition was well below expectation. Maintenance was poor, and there was evidence of shoddy construction and upkeep. Walls are also quite thin, and because the sleeping portion of the loft itself hangs over the hallway, it was quite easy to hear everybody coming and going. Another problem is the design of the unit itself. Specifically the bathroom is on the main level and with the sleeping loft upstairs if you have to use the bathroom at night you must navigate a staircase in the dark. Very dangerous, in my opinion. Another problem related to temperature control in the suite. In short, there is no ability to control the temperature. There is a thermostat, but it is turned off and according to the hotel the temperature is regulated at the 'building' level, not the individual suite level. It happened to be quite warm, and because the windows were inoperable there was no way to cool it off. Also problematic is a huge industrial air duct located directly over the bed which is loud, cannot be shut off, blowing warm air 24/7. This is so loud it was literally impossible to sleep. When combined with the warm temperature in the suite itself it created a situation where I walked over to the main building at 2:30am and asked the hotel management if I could change rooms. Management was very accommodating, and at 3am I left the suite with my bags for a regular room in the main building. This regular room was much better, and consistent with what I expected. In summary, I would avoid the high priced suites and stay in the main building. But after this experience I'm not sure I would return. Also the internet connection in the room was unreliable and service was spotty.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cExcellent place to stay\u201d", "Author": "janester75", "ReviewID": "UR48538997", "Content": "I visited Montreal for five days for business and stayed in one of the lofts on Rue St Paul.

Exposed rock walls and wooden beams, two enormous windows that looked out onto a park and the St.Lawrence river (we were told this is the only hotel to offer such a view). Really, it was everything the pictures promised. There was a large mini-bar available and robes and slippers as well. From 5-7pm they offer free wine and cheese to guests, which we took advantage of each day. The bar/restaurant was outfitted in dark wood and dark walls which set a nice mood. And the breakfast!

We munched on croissants and chocolate muffins and fruit until our crepes or eggs arrived. We were blown away by the generous meal and the staff were very friendly, being polite when we tried our bad French with them. The auberge is close to museums, restaurants and an art market.

You can easily walk to restaurants. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 10 minute walk to the metro. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. We enjoyed our stay. But there are things you should be aware of if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking about staying in a loft. This applies only to the loft (apartment) number 603. The lofts are not in the inn, but two blocks from the rear door of the inn. Someone will help you get your bags there and back. There are no elevators. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out whether everybody in the building was a guest of the inn. It appeared that some were permanent residents, and that the inn just owned one or more apartments in the building. Loft #603 consists of one large (maybe 25 feet by 25 feet) room, a reasonably large bedroom, a smaller bedroom, a bathroom, an entrance hall and kitchen. Walls are exposed brick and stone; pipes and electrical cables are exposed. The fireplace doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, and neither did the TV in the large room. The TV in the large bedroom did work but you have to string an extension cord through the door and plug it into an outlet in the large room. WiFi worked pretty well. Lighting is inadequate: one person can sit next to the table lamp and have enough light to read comfortably, but others will find the light a little dim for reading. The cord for the lamp by the bedroom runs into the wall, then inside the wall to a spot several feet away where it emerges and is plugged into an outlet. This is beyond strange; it is a fire hazard. It can get noisy. The people downstairs had a party that included children playing hockey in the hall. Someone upstairs rose each day at 6:30, flushed the toilet 15 or 20 times, then woke the children and got them started practicing their Morris dancing. OK, I exaggerate a little, but you will hear every flush, foot step and (muffled) conversation. Luckily, with the exception of the party night, people went to bed fairly early and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really find the noise too bothersome. The large bedroom has a glass door, reducing privacy. The water heater has enough hot water for only two showers. Housekeeping makes the beds and changes the towels each day. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not cooking your own in the loft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kitchen, breakfast is in the inn and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $10 (not included with the room as it would be if you were staying in the inn.) Our breakfasts were excellent and the service was prompt and courteous. We arranged through the hotel for transportation to the hotel from the airport and back; it was reliable and pleasant. However, we were told by the hotel that the trip to the hotel would be $101 including tax and tip, and that the trip from the hotel would be somewhat less. We paid for both trips when we returned to the airport, and the bill was $232 not including tip. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 20 minutes each way; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bet a cab would have been quite a bit less. For comparison, here in overpriced New Jersey a roughly equivalent round trip was $100 including tax and a pretty generous tip.", "Date": "January 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cLots of charm - and a few quirks\u201d", "Author": "jampling", "ReviewID": "UR23292382", "Content": "This lovely auberge has a lot going for it: a brilliant location in the heart of vieux Montreal; very large and attractive rooms with bare beams, exposed brick, hardwood floors, and large windows - ours looked out over the river.

When we arrived, our room was extremely cold, in part due to a faulty thermostat and not helped by the faulty window sealing which allowed frigid Montreal air to whistle through. The brick wall beside the window was also crumbling in places, resulting in small piles of dust and brick fragments on the windowsill and floor. We also expressed disappointment to the front desk that here was no means to make coffee or tea in the room.

We checked in on September 22 until September 26, 2008. The main part of the hotel is located RIGHT on Rue de la Commune which is directly on the riverfront where romantic horse drawn carriages stroll by all day. Across the street is the wharf where the bateaux-mouche dock and the bike path begins. Around the corner is the Jacques Cartier Square ....... This is where we checked-in but we knew in advance that we would be staying in one of their off-site Lofts. However, from the moment of our check-in, we knew we were in for an excellent experience! Fredrique escorted us ((and carried our luggage)) to our loft around the corner on Rue de Vincent which is an EXCELLENT location. Our loft is in a 119 year old building. The lofts are all BEAUTIFULLY & rustically renovated warehouses ...... open ceilings, exposed brick, water pipes, etc ...... Next door is a fantastic Italian restaurant ((Galliano's)) where we had TWO delicious dinners. Although our loft ((#604 ~~ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)) was up SIX flights of stairs (with NO elevator), we would not want to ever stay anywhere else! #604 is over 900 square feet. Please see our scans to get a complete idea of how extraordinary was this loft! The side of the room overlooking Rue de Vincent had four floor to ceiling, double windows. Most of the walls are exposed stone and used brick. There is a WORKING fireplace, WITH wood provided! Although we did not need it, the loft is air conditioned and the heating works great. We didn't have time to prepare meals but the kitchenette is well equipped for our needs....... microwave....... frig .... everything .... There are two dining tables ~~ formal & informal. The furnishings are soooo comfortable and welcoming. Take a look at that fantastic BED!!!! Wireless, CD player, TV, closet space, bath ~~ all great. Comfortable couch and easy chairs..... Desk .......excellent lighting ..... The king size bed and linens are LUXIOURIOUS!! We had daily maid service ..... bath linens are great. At night, the view from our loft was breathtaking! While sitting on the couch, we could see the beautifully lit dome of the Marche Bonsecours down the street ...... Below us, Rue de Vincent bustled but was very quiet ...... we never were bothered by noise during our entire stay. Right next door to our loft is a washing machine & dryer but we did not need to use it. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT!!!!! We only paid $169.00 a night! Because we were not staying in the main Hotel, we were not entitled to a free breakfast ..... but it only cost us $10.00 and it was GREAT! Also, Loft Guests had extended breakfast privileges until 11:00. Because we are late sleepers, this worked out perfectly. As explained by previous reviewers, breakfast is served in a cozy restaurant below the Hotel Desk. Service was always excellent. We never felt rushed, food was always complete and plentiful and our servers were always friendly, professional and delightful. Our selections included omelets, eggs, waffles, pancakes, assorted breads & croissants, cereals, muffins, fruits, etc ... The Hotel Staff at Auberge du Vieux-Port was always extremely friendly and helpful. LOCATION! LOCATION! LOCATION!!!!!! We didn't rent a car and didn't need one .... so much was within walking distance and our four days were not nearly enough time to scratch the surface. One morning, we took a tour on the Bateau-Mouche..... relaxing and wonderful ..... Another morning, we rented bikes at Ca Roule ....... biked to the Marche where we bought picnic sandwiches, cheeses, etc & drinks ....... and then biked along the Lachine Canal to the Parc where we ate our picnic lunch on the banks of the St Lawrence River and then we biked back!!! Thirty Miles, we were told , but it was soooooooooooooo worth it (we are 58 & 60 years old and it was a not-too-miss experience.) I was taught by the Sisters of the Congregation de Notre Dame de Montreal (in New York) so I really enjoyed the Bourgeoys Museum and the Bonsecours Chapel. Even my husband (an Episcopalian) was impressed ...... One night, we bought tickets for a light show at the Notre-Dame Basilica. It was called: \"Lumiere Fut\" and was a little cheesy in spots but, overall, a FANTASTIC show! The Basilica (where Celine Dion was married) is gorgeous during the day but SPECTACULAR at night. Don't miss the Pointe-a-Calliere Museum (Museum of Archaeology and History) ~~ VERY well done. Montreal is very proud of its extremely important history and the Pointe offers a great introduction and over-view to it. Although very French, Old Montreal is completely bilingual and everyone we met was extremely friendly and fun.

Michael, an exceptional and very pleasant concierge, suggested restaurants as well as sights and always asked our opinion of the places we visited. He really went out of his way to be helpful, concerned and considerate. Because we arrived in September we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to have the rooftop breakfast, a service that ends August 31; however, the breakfast in the lower-level restaurant was very nice.

I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use my car during our stay. When we were ready to leave we were originally told by Daniel that it would take ten minutes to get the car.

When my car was retrieved I discovered it was parked, not in an underground garage, but outside in a tiny lot. We were eager to get on the road so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t question this.

The croissants at breakfast were truly some of the best we'd ever tried, which is a positive. What is odd is after such an up-to-date lobby (hip, almost, in black and fine furnishings), that the room was so dumpy. Our room (505) was large, but the bed was very worn -- flat matress, poly/cotton sheets and none of the plumpness or fluff you expect in high quality hotels -- the comforter was a standard issue floral print, with no charm. That led to an otherwise dreary appearance to the room -- done in simple whites with upgraded bedding and we'd have changed our opinion. The brouchure in the room appeared to have some updated rooms, so perhaps we just got a bad one...either way, it was a disappointment. And yes, the bathroom was large, with nice toiletries, but the shower was the dingy fiberglass and aluminum insert in the corner, with just a trickle of water, after you managed to work the button on the bottom, very odd. What is surprising is that this hotel is owned by the same folks as the Nelligan -- which was right around the corner and looked amazing -- and very upscale. Old City hints: Avoid the square around the corner and the restaurants there -- very poor examples, given the options further down rue St. Paul.

We agree that the location is great, rooms spacious, nice big bathroom and shower, bed really comfortable, and breakfast and ( a glass) of wine and cheese thrown in a bonus. All as you would expect given the prices. At floor 4 we overlooked A/C units on adjacent rooftops, so I wouldn't suggest paying too much extra for \"a view\". The real downside in our view was the lack of service that other guests (and the visitors' book on public display) seem to rave about. We first noted this in the Terasse at lunch - overpriced and limited food on offer; service very slow; and the rice on the \"prawn and rice\" dish failed to materialise. When questioned we were told the menu was inaccurate, i.e. 50% of the dish no longer existed- no apologies, no offer of a refund. One of our rooms wasn't ready until 4 pm- again no apology offered, despite check in being 3 pm. We encountered the same indifference when we ordered a bottle of (overpriced) wine on the hotel's street terrasse - when we eventually got the waiter's attention, he asked if we were sitting there waiting for a taxi! Wine appeared eventually and served very grudgingly, no further sign of the waiter so we had to pour refills ourselves, until he brought the bill (not requested, who knows, we may have wanted to order another bottle?!), where he overcharged us on the already inflated price- no apology was offered when we pointed this out. And whilst there were always staff lurking with walkie talkies in the (dark and dingy) reception area, they never onced offered to open the door for us, so we still have no idea of their function! The other annoyance if you're on a top floor is the fact there is only one lift, that also serves to carry staff and food up to the top floor restaurant, so when it does eventually appear, it is often too full of staff for you to get in - and of course, they don't offer to take the stairs to allow guests to travel up and down. So if you do stay here, we'd recommend doing your dining and drinking off-site and maybe also stay elsewhere, until the staff remember that they are there to serve the hotel guests, rather than decorate the place and chat to one another.", "Date": "August 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cWorld Class Hotel With Warmth!\u201d", "Author": "EllenAdena", "ReviewID": "UR3721843", "Content": "My husband, teenage son and I just returned from five nights at this wonderful Hotel.

Overall it was a very pleaseant stay.", "Date": "December 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cVery good - if you want to stay in Old Montreal\u201d", "Author": "LTJ874", "ReviewID": "UR2850933", "Content": "I stayed in one of the lofts at this hotel which provide the space and privacy of your own loft, with the back up of a full service hotel. But be warned, the lofts are in separate buildings to the hotel, and there are no lifts so you will have to walk up a few flights of stairs to get to your loft. There were some minor details in the loft such as a chipped sink and broken desk drawers that the hotel should have identified and dealt with itself. The website also said there would be a DVD player in the room, but there wasn't. Check-in was very efficient. The staff were friendly, but professional. Breakfast was one of the best I've experienced in a hotel, and I wish British hotels (particularly London business hotels) would learn from this. Ultimately, the decision to stay here depends on whether you want to be in Old Montreal. It is an area for tourists rather than locals and you will either find the area very appealing (think French town) or want to avoid the area entirely. For me it was safe and secure and allowed us to walk around the area first thing in the morning before the area becomes very busy with tourists.", "Date": "November 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2823393", "Content": "Our two night here with a wonderful Haloween parade were all we wanted and expected.

They met our taxi and took our bags into this small hotel facing the St. Lawrence, then invited us to go down to their restaurant Ramparts (downstairs) to partake of their evening complimentary wine and cheese for guests (from 5-6 each evening). We needed this..after our long day of travel. While relaxing with our wine, our bags were taken to our room and we 'checked in' after our wine. The rooms (we started first night in a 'loft' room as we arrived on a Sat. and the hotel was full), then moved to the hotel for the next 2 nights. Both rooms were very nice, but the loft wasn't for us ... too many stairs and we like to be situated in the hotel to really enjoy the amenities more easily. The loft, however, would be great for a family as it had a small kitchen and a very large sitting/dining area. The breakfasts were very good -- small buffet of baked goods, fruit, juices, coffee, cereal, plus you can in addition order from the menu. Robes and slippers, stocked bar and old world style furnishings made the rooms/stay so pleasant. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We mainly dealt with David at check-in and when changing rooms....and he was very nice and helpful. They volunteered to make any reservations we wanted. We highly recommend this hotel and especially Old Montreal -- if you want a relaxing, romantic and charming experience - surrounded by good restaurants!! (Bonaparts, Pavarotti are a couple. Didn't get a chance to try Ramparts which is in this hotel). We did alot of walking downtown Monreal on St. Catherines and were glad we didn't choose a hotel there -- location to many restaurants good, but the noise.....rap music playing very loudly -- not for us!!", "Date": "October 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cfabulous, quaint, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "garymiller", "ReviewID": "UR2752879", "Content": "we loved our Oct 3, 3 nite stay, get the rooms that overlook the river, high floor, quieter. large rooms, free high speed wireless internet, tasty free breakfast served in their below ground cellar where they also host a daily free wine/cheese hour. attentive staff, and easy walking distance to all sights, we enjoyed tasty Indian and Polish restaurants nearby, with many choices. loved the Botanical Gardens too, but you'll need car.

As an old warehouse, the building may look a bit uninspiring from the outside but the interior makes up with bags of character in abundance. The 1st floor room, with exposed brick walls and quality furnishings was quite special. A really comfortable bed fixed our jet lag. Service was excellent and the CD player with a good choice of CD's was a nice touch. Breakfast in Les Remparts was good and wholesome and always served with a smile. The Auberge is well situated in the old town and easy to find, even for us off a plane and the airport shuttle, followed by a metro and a short walk. There are loads of excellent restaurants close by (restaurant du vieux port is recommended) It's hard to criticise the Auberge - and it does not affect the excellent review- but the noise early in the morning from the cobbled street may worry some (we lived with it because the quality of the room was so good). Someone also commented that you couldn't see out of the dirty windows - that was solved by opening the huge windows to give views of the port. All the same, this place is excellent and recommended.", "Date": "October 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westfield, NJ", "Title": "\u201cThree Night Stay in August\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2495900", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Auberge the first week of August based on the reviews here and the location. We were put in one of the larger rooms on the 5th floor (towards the port) the first night and in one of the rooms on the other side, 5th floor, the next two nights. The rooms were both large and very nice and the views on both sides were nice as well. I sleep soundly so no problems with noise, plus we stayed up late enjoying the city. The beds were very comfy. I do recommend taking one of the horse carriage tours. Our guide pointed out a lot of the sites to see, cool bars, and good restaurants. Unfortunately, we didn't do that until the last night. The location is great, right in the middle of the old city with lots of things to see and do. A short taxi ride gets you to other sites in the city. We had breakfast each morning which was included in the room. Excellent breakfast. Service was good except one morning when one of the help didn't make it to work. Montreal is a great city; three nights is all you need. It's not Paris, but it's less than 1 hour away from NYC.

The bath was slightly smaller, but had a huge modern shower. There were no elevators, so we had to walk up 3 flights of stairs, but it helped burn off those extra calories from desserts. The staff was very friendly and helpful except for one of the concierge members, who seemed not to know much of the city apart from the \"usual\" spots. The maid service was good. The breakfasts at the hotel each morning were very nice and there was complimentary wine and cheese each afternoon at 5. My only complaint was the noise. Each morning (including the weekend) there was construction noise, garbage collectors, etc outside. The windows must have been very thin because 3 floors up it was enough to awaken you. Also the ceiling transmitted the walking noises from the people above you (the floors are all hardwood without carpetting) Overall, we'd recommend the Auberge, but if the were to do something about the noise, I'd return in a heart beat.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Auberge du Vieux-Port", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d155204-Reviews-Auberge_du_Vieux_Port-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$214 - $342*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">97 Rue de la Commune East</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H2Y 1J1</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "155204", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/31/e6/3c/auberge-du-vieux-port.jpg"}}
