Hotel staff rude when we called, I was traveling with a child and was very unhappy with the service. Schedule 12:30 shuttle to the Port of Miami, waiting in lobby at 12:15 alarm in lobby continously going off (loud). Everyone moved outside to wait, finally after several compliants from numerous guests we were told that they had to borrow a shuttle from another hotel because it was over booked. Finally they arrived at the hotel at 1:15 waited again over an hour, this in return only gave us less than one hour to go through the process of boarding the cruise ship. Shuttles in poor condition. Upon leaving that morning found little spiders all over the tv stand in our room. January 8, 2012 stay was put in room 318. Room smelled moldy and I requested to switch rooms I have an asthmatic child. Moved to room 316, curtains and chair were flithy and stained. Windows don't shut properly window sills dirty and modly. Carpets unvaccumed & stained. Pizza companys getting in secured doorways and putting fliers under room doors throughout the evening. Vending not properly stocked, frontdesk doesnt have proper change for vending. Toilet in room didn't work properly had to have them come plunge it.

The hotel has no bar and no dining room other than a small local for breakfast.The hotel is located in what appears to be an industrial part of Miami and has no restaurants worthy of the name in the immidiate vicinity. We finally found an Italian restaurant after a 25 minute walk, The hotel clerk advised us that the shuttle for the port of Miami would leave at 9:15 and 12.00 o'clock but that the ship would not commence boarding procedures before 1.00P,M. He reccomended that we take the last shuttle. The same info was given to others at the same time. What a surprise when we arrived at the port to find that boarding had been underway since 10.00A,M and that we were the last to arrive. We therefore lost 3 to 4 hours aboard ship ,time that was spent hanging around the hotel room needlessly, This hotel is definitly not up to standard for a Quality Inn.

However, the place is pretty disgusting. Personally, it's the worst place I've ever been in. Simple is okay, unclean is not. The furniture in the lobby is old and stained, the carpet in the hallways is stained everywhere. We had to change rooms after finding an old hair in the bathtub and pink stuff running down the back of the tub. The floor around the toilet was filthy and there was a stain on the bed...Just gross. This is unlike any other Quality Inn I've ever been to. The place needs a complete overhaul. The bedding is made up of cheap duvets without covers and a strip of coloured fabric at the end of the bed.... Our second room (after a long wait and a first attempt at a second room where the key wouldn't open the door) had a leaky faucet in the bathtub and the plumbing fixtures weren't clean. There were stains on the bathroom floor but it wasn't as bad as the first room. I went to plug my laptop into the wall outlet under the desk and noticed that the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed under there in awhile. The only thing I liked about this place were the pillows and getting the heck out as soon as possible. The area itself is bad. Nowhere decent to grab a meal. We were in a fast food chicken place nearby and the place was just as filthy. The women's bathroom hadn't been cleaned and a tile on the wall looked like it had been punched in. We found out there was a Starbucks down the street but were advised not to walk down there as it could be unsafe....not a good feeling.
