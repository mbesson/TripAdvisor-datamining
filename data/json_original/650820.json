The premises are beautiful and spacious, all the cute two-storied bungalows are set in a lush tropical garden (with lots of stone steps). The people who work there are friendly, helpful and reliable. We had bungalow #15, a bit set back in the garden. The furnishing of the rooms are also very nice, and there's a nice pool.In May 07, we paid Rp 150,000 for two per night (about 12.5 Euro/18 USD), a small breakfast included.I'm sure there are many other, comparable places in Ubud, but this one is definitely recommendable.Chris, Germany", "Date": "Jan 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR390599275", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "benti99"}, {"Content": "Lovely Chilling Place!! We Checked in to the Ubud Terrace after a few nights in other property because we wanted to move close to town. Ubud Terrace was just so perfect for us. We had a nice room overlook a small steam in the beautiful small garden so it made the morning so perfect with some breeze and sunlight.The room was lovely with a nice comfy bed and the room is quite spacious so that we can stayed 4 people but without any extra charge (only around USD 20 per night between 4). The bathroom wasn't so cleaned but was in an OK level. Room had ants problem but we understand that was not a 5 stars hotel so it was OK but a bit annoying. Morning meals is lovely, served at our terrace and the menus were changed every. We love the green banana crepe.Pool was lovely but inadequate of the sun bed.Ubud Terrace was in the perfect location, just right in the center of Monkey Forest St, many shops and restaurant were near by. There was the laundry shop just infront of the hotel. The Ubud Restaurant offered great food at the cheapest price we found in Bali at this standard, don't miss this restaurant as it was so near the hotel. It was our favourite hang out place.Would definitely be back and will recommend all our friends", "Date": "Jan 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR583250640", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "~LazyHammock~**"}, {"Content": "beautiful introduction to bali Just got back from a southeast asia trip for 2 weeks.

We had one of the family rooms--small but sufficient with comfy beds and nice tub with hot water. Glad we got a room with A/C. Bargaining over room rates is possible, though we didn't know this when we were making our arrangements online. The grounds are marvelous--we stayed all the way at the back--only noise was the din of the jungle and rice paddies at night. We had a view of a rice paddy from our bathroom window. Fortunately did not spend too much time in the bathroom. Steps a bit challenging with a toddler, but doable. Great breakfasts (a rotation of three, more or less)--excellent fresh fruit. Nice pool. Helpful staff. Good location for getting around on foot, but you can always choose from myriad other transport options. The hotel has its own fleet of new SUV type cars with seatbelts (good for the carseat.)

The hotel is so beautiful and perfectly maintained both inside and out- it was like being in a temple. Wonderful pool. Breakfast was great and served in a little pavilion overlooking jungle. The staff was great, too. I left my camera bag in the owner's car when he drove us to meet the tour, and e-mailed him to find out if he could find it. He quickly e-mailed me back that he did, and it was waiting for me when the tour went through Ubud. The hotel is in a great location on Monkey Forest Road but the hotel is very quiet.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR455264087", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Mickyryan"}, {"Content": "Great place to relax and enjoy Bali!", "Date": "Apr 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR132861484", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "littlemisstravel1978"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d650820-r18125100-Ubud_Terrace_Bungalows-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "650820", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
