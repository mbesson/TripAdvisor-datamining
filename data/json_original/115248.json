Room: Agree with one reviewer that hotel was not as lovely as the photos on the website, but it wasn't moldy or disgusting like the other reviewer said. The room was better than the price paid ($95/night). Bad: No service for Valet when coming in on Friday. (Although this is probably due to excessive amount of people checking in and UPS coming.

The situation was resolved but it left me wondering if the front desk staff would be handing out keys to other guests for our room also. We were in New Orleans for three days and I have to say the hotel's location and price were pleasant surprises. Unfortunately, not all of our surprises were so pleasant. On our second night there, as we prepared for bed, we found a large wad of chewing gum between the top and bottom sheets. It somehow got there when the room was cleaned that day. The front desk staff was very quick to respond but did not seem surprised at all. No apologies were offered---just a smile and a shoulder shrug. Later that evening, the bathroom was FLOODED when the toilet overflowed. Again, the front desk staff was quick to respond and, this time, was apologetic about the situation. The gentleman who showed up with a plunger shared that \"this happens quite a bit\". The safe in the room worked at times but was not consistent. Usually that would not concern us but we felt the need to lock up valuables since the front desk appeared to be handing out room keys randomly.

I used Hotels.com and came across a 4 night deal that seemed too good to be true..I grabbed it fast and saw that the location of the hotel was right in the middle of all the action AND the event I needed to attend..!! I pulled up to the hotel and was AMAZED at how beautiful and brand new the entire lobby was! It was clear there was construction going on but only to make the place even more beautiful than it was already is.. ! Of course I was VERY much earlier than check in time and the desk gal was more than willing to help me out and get me into a room that had been cleaned and readied so I could relax before I started my event..Huge PLUS ..! The room was clean and sparkling and every extra touch was right there waiting for me..including an iron and a wonderful new flat screen tv..Our room was even equipped with a frig and microwave tucked neatly away in an cabinet. I could make my coffee in the AM and there is a wonderful cafe attached to the place as well if you want to take time for a nice breakfast! Each and every employee of the hotel was gracious and over the top accommodating and I truly looked forward to getting back to the property at the end of some very grueling days! Beautiful parks all around and loads of great cafes and shops all along the short walk to any of the attractions all nearby.. And..the airport shuttle knows them well and gets you right to the door from the airport for a mere 19 dollars each way ..!! I only wish I could have spent more time there but can tell you as a first time visitor to the New Orleans area, that this will be my ALL THE TIME HOTEL if I am ever here again..In fact, I might even plan a trip that isn't work so I can spend a few days and know I have a great place to hang my hat!! As a business owner I can tell you first hand..ignore ANY bad reviews of this wonderful jewel... They will go above and beyond to make your stay a pleasant one and when the final construction is done, I know it will be even more enchanting!!

Ryan White was working at the front desk when i walked in and he did everything one could hope for to get me set up comfortably. He took his time and carefully listened and communicated so clearly about what the hotel offered. After that very kind introduction to the hotel, guess i was less surprised that all the people working there were interested in making sure this experience was an excellent one. All of the folks at the front desk were eager to accommodate and assist. Funny, i met the Chief Engineer in the elevator and even he showed sincere concern. (can't remember his name) The room was comfortable, clean, quiet, and light. The walls were almost all window. The decor both homey and ergonomic. The Housekeepers are quiet and not overly interested in rushing you out so they can get their work done. There was a quiet patience that permeated this entire building that i was unaccustomed to. In the end the the most important component of hospitality and comfort has to do with the way people make you feel. This hotel is full of pleasant, intelligent, kind people that understand what it is to be on the other side of the counter. The rooms are great and the people are extraordinary. Though i tried to meet him while i was there, understand the staff was mostly hired by or at least report to the general manager Manny Singh. This guy knows what to look for it seems. i don't care about points and diamond status - i care about people. I will return to the Parc St. Charles in New Orleans. These people made me eager to return to the city. Ultimately that is how it works. One returns to a place because they remember the way they felt there. Thanks to the Parc St Charles for doing this for New Orleans. i had never been before and had not planned on returning...but now i know i will...i took a stack of business cards to hand out here at home.

Other problems include a shower that is lukewarm at best, and peeling wallpaper in the bathroom.

They seemed awfully smug and acted like we were bothering them when we came in each time. The hotel room was OK - just OK - but the bathroom had serious issues. Our toilet leaked the whole time, so we had a constant pool of water on the floor. gross. The wallpaper in the bathroom was curling up and there was a weird mold patch on the ceiling that had a hole in the middle of the patch. It seriously looked like there was a hidden camera in there or something. I don't normally have allergies but I had 2 different allergy attacks while showering because of the mold. They also gave us fewer towels each day, so by the last night, we didn't have hand towels. I asked for more and they assured me they'd send more. They never did. We were using a few towels each day to soak up the water from the toilet, so we needed more and we didn't get more. The shower curtain was too short for the tub and even more water leaked onto the floor during every shower. We got TWO tiny pillows for our bed - which was only a queen sized bed. I thought I reserved a King. The room was small and humid and the only way to sleep and not hear neighbors next door was to leave our A/C fan running the whole night. We read another review that said to take a different elevator that was to the left when you leave the lobby. Glad we did. The other one was horribly slow. I would not return here again when there are so many other choices of hotels in NOLA. The Sheraton has had my business in the past and will again next time.

If you can ignore many factors going on here, it is a great location that is walking or street car distance to everything -- and yes -- maybe this property will improve once the renovations are done, but until then, I wouldn't bother except for the price. The rooms are fine except for torn wallpaper, paint peeling, the ironing board was falling apart, and a nice little drilled peep hole the was right above my shower! I had to stuff tissue in it. The exhaust fan didn't work, and I could hear construction and the cleaning staff chatting away in the early morning hours very loudly. There was also any number of tools, carts, and pieces of furniture left in the hallways. All of this I can ignore to a point. What I can't ignore is getting stuck in the elevator TWICE. Besides the fact it takes forever because you are sharing it with staff, it is just the scariest elevator to set foot in. I am handicapped so stairs were not an option for me. When I informed the staff of getting stuck twice, they really could have cared less. They said the manager would be calling me when I asked to speak to someone, and I never got the call. After the elevator being fixed once (supposedly) I came in asking if it had been resolved because there was no way I could take stairs. The man at the front desk said, \"um, I believe so\". It is either fixed, or it isn't! And guess what? It wasn't because it got stuck on it's way down. There is one tiny elevator that we were told we could use, and it fits about 5 people and is no less frightening.

So I said ok where is the parking garage, they said we do not have a parking garage but we recommend you parking at Howard Ave. parking garage and pay $25 a day - and mind you the garage is about ten to fifteen blocks away from the hotel and did not offer shuttle service 24/7. We had to call a taxi to take us back to the hotel because it was raining and cold. When we first arrived they gave us a room by the stairwell - the hallway was wet from the ice machine - the room smelled like mildew - and the all the towels were still wet and damp. We requested another room and was moved to another floor. This room was more acceptable - but for the price we paid for the room - we were very disappointed. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone during Mardi Gras or any other occasion. The hotel is old and does not have any updated features. The TV was plasma however the picture was not clear at all and showed fussiness. Checking out the hotel was the same issue we had to walk all the way to the parking garage with our luggage - we could not get a taxi because all the streets were blocked off and taxi's that did come by would not assist us. Just imagine four women walking ten to fifteen blocks with suitcases, clothes and bags in hand. This was a horrible experience and this was my first time to New Orleans.

It's on the corner of Poydras and St. Charles which puts you within in 5 blocks (and walking distance) of the French Quarter. St. Charles Avenue turns in Rue Royale once you're on the other side of Canal Street (in the FQ). Caddy-corner from the hotel is a street car stop for the St. Charles Line, which takes you into the Garden District (which is also not far, though not within walking distance). Parking: The parking situation around the hotel is not-so-good, so it is easier to valet (which was around $20 per night). However, the hotel outsources their valet to a private company that owns/leases(?) a parking garage near the hotel. We only requested our vehicle twice during our stay, once to get something out of it and the second time when we were leaving. The first time we had them pull the car around, it took about 5 minutes and was very simple. However, when we were leaving, it was at check-out time, which meant that 20-30 other people needed their cars at the same time. We waited nearly an hour and a half; there were plenty of valets, but there was a miscommunication between the hotel front desk and the valet and no one was dispatched for our car (until we asked about it again an hour later). Rooms: The first room they gave us was on the 8th floor and had an amazing view looking toward the Garden District. While the view was awesome, the room was tiny. There was barely enough room for luggage for two people. We had booked a smoking room and this one with the great view was not one, so they moved us to an interior room on the 4th floor. The view for this room looked down a narrow alley, and across Poydras Street at the Hotel Intercontinental. But what this room lacked as far as the view, it made up for it with space. Our second (and ultimately final) room, seemed to be 3 times the size of the first room we were given. Everything else to do with the room was very nice. The room and bathroom looked as though they had been remodeled within the last few years. A condensate line dripped into the shower, but whatever, everything else was nice. Elevator: Aside from the valet debacle after check-out, only one aspect wins the prize for Incredibly Inconvenient and that would have to be the lone elevator. The hotel is large enough to need at least two, and they could probably work on getting the one they have to move a little faster. Unfortunately, this is a difficult problem to solve for such an old building. General: One last inconvenience that would be much easier to solve is the bell cart situation. When we stayed there, they had one cart; which had been appropriated prior to our departure by some cranky lady who seemed to need it for quite some time. Overall, these small inconveniences I've mentioned did not detract from our stay so much that I would not stay again or recommend this hotel to a friend.

But no. The \"kids\" room did have a couple of holes in the wall - one in the bathroom and one behind the door. THe \"sitting\" chairs were not cleaned!! I begged the kids specifically not to sit in the chairs & keep their socks on their feet!!!! Our room was about the same. And the bathroom shower heads were NASTY!!!! I refused to take a shower and told spouse and children - DO NOT TAKE A SHOWER! Both showerheads were full of GUNK!!! A special showerhead cleaner should have been used by the staff/management. We took baths instead. The tub was clean enough to at least do that. It was a muggy 95+ degrees and a shower would have eased some of the heat and made getting cooler/clean quicker. The beds/pillows were comfortable, but it seemed as though the comforters in both rooms had a fairly large noticeable hole right on top of both of them either from a cigarette burn or something. But the bed itself slept comfortably. So some of the pictures that were placed in reviews by others that showed the holes etc. were true. I would usually think some reviewers just had a personal \"pet peeve\", but after being there for myself for this particular hotel, I found it to be true. HOWEVER, on the plus side -this hotel was a comfortable walking distance from the River Walk, Audubon Aquarium/Insecterium and other cool places. Saks Fifth Avenue- Mall etc. etc. There was a beautiful, elegant restaurant called the Palace Cafe - simply scrumptulicious! you could see the chefs cooking thru the glass windows near the bar area, the waiters had bow ties, and there were beautiful stairs where you could be seated on the 2nd floor - where we were next to the windows where you could see the activity going on ouside. Beautiful paintings were on the wall of \"old\" and \"young\" jazz and other muscians/singers. Highly recommend you try this at least once. Other than the exhaustive heat it was a nice little outing. I do not plan to use this hotel again. Hopefully I won't have to take the children again either!!!", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Parc St. Charles", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d115248-Reviews-Parc_St_Charles-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "Price": "$123 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">500 St. Charles Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New Orleans</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">LA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">70130</span></span> (Formerly &quot;Best Western&quot;)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "115248", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/08/d1/08d139fa07e0fbfc79810a1c257768cb5large.jpg"}}
