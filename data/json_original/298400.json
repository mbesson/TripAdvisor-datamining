We arrived on a Sunday morning at 10am. The first issue was that it was on top of a pub - I didn't quite realise that it was literally on top of a bar! Stupid me, maybe. The whole place was shut up and we couldn't get in. Luckily a cleaner, (what he did clean in there I'm not really sure but I will come to that later), lent me his phone to ring upstairs on the number left at the door (upon arrival my mobile phone didn't work and I was stood there after travelling for like two days with all my gear). I got an answer which said that check in was technically at 12 but he would come down and let me in. Poor customer service I think! 5 minutes later (after 4 other people had also turned up) a hungover and obviously 'just got out of bed' Australian comes down and takes us up stairs. There is no reception to speak of and the whole place was pretty dirty, dull and dismal and had that odour of stale pub. We were shown our room and the separate toilet and shower was pointed out. These were just tiled rooms so no problems there to speak of after just looking. We were told that they didn't except card payment and to pay in cash so luckily I said that we would need to get to a cash machine and would pay on our return. The room smelt of sweat and I immediately opened a window as it needed a good airing. There were unwashed tea cups and the bin in the room was still full of rubbish. I dared not even look in the bed at the sheets! The electrics to the room were operated by a remote in which the batteries were sellotaped into - safe, I think not! We then went and checked into another hotel for not much more money which we feel was well spent as we probably would have spent it avoiding staying there anyway! I have stayed in nicer, cleaner and better equipped hostels! I am not normally a person to moan about the service somewhere and this is the first review I have ever written on here but I just wanted to make sure that other people weren't faced with also 'doing a runner' to not stay here!

We had tickets to a show, all we needed was overnight accommodation.We found the room to be large enough for my self, my husband and our two children ages 6yrs and 10yrs old. the room was clean and comfortable. There was a television and remote in the room, there was a clean bar fridge, and a kettle, cups and coffee making facilities, no milk though.We arrived after 10pm after the show. the bar down stairs had a few patrons, not rowdy or anything like that, rather pleasant actually. We ate our dinner we had purchased outside, in our room. We then went to sleep. There was a slight amount of noise from outside in the street, traffic etc, but I was able to fall asleep in a reasonable amount of time. My children slept okay also. My husband is a fairly light sleeper, so he didn't sleep too well.There is no parking at the hotel, so we parked our car in a near by street. There was no parking fees after 10pm in the street, we had to move the car by 7am though. We moved the car to a nearby parking station, in the early bird section of the car park, we had to stay until 4pm to get the cheap fee of $24 for the day. We went back to the Grand Hotel and had some breakfast in the 'Breakfast Room'. We found the dining area to be neat and tidy. There was a complimentary continental breakfast included in the cost of our room. the breakfast on offer was ample for us, we had cereal,toast, spreads,fruit, juice and coffee. The only things that I would perhaps gripe about was the lift was a bit ancient, but okay, it works!! There is the option of the stairs of course.There was a slight smell overall in the hotel but nothing offensive, just old I guess.The shower hot/cold was hard to regulate, but I guess that is just everyone else using the showers at the same time, so quickly in and quickly out....no big deal!

The bath and toilet were adequately clean, although the shower curtain was mildewy. But for $95AU (that would be about $65 USD at the current exchange rate) the location CANNOT be beat. The hotel is near everything a tourist could want. When we travel, we usually don't like to spend much time sitting around the room, so if all you need is a place to sleep, I would highly recommend this hotel. The bar downstairs was popular for happy hour, and the included continental breakfast was fine--other hotels that we stayed at in Australia that were double the price didn't include breakfast, so give the Grand some credit there.

He didn't like the room at first (aesthetically) but got used to it. From our room, we could hear music down below one night but it didn't last long and was ok. Room size is standard, not big but not cramped either. It is near Circular Quay and is reasonably priced. It includes a continental breakfast which we found to be sufficient (a selection of cereals, breads and juices, tea/coffee, fruit). The room has some old furniture but this keeps with the style of the old building (furnished with large wardrobe, double mattress, side tables, lamps, drapes). The TV plug had to be awkwardly positioned to receive reception but worked fine. There is a fridge (a bit of mould but just needed a wipe) and a fanlight, both with remote. There's also tea/coffee making facilities, box of tissues, clock radio, a radiator and even a sink, which is useful for brushing teeth, washing cups & cutlery etc. There are about 7 rooms to at least 2 bathrooms (separate showers) / separate toilets which are close by. I liked the bathroom more than the room, they're quite nice. Also clean. There is also an ironing board in the hall. The hall was kind of dingy. I think it's better value overall than the Sydney Central YHA (for example) as although the YHA is newer with an ensuite, it's pretty much a bare room (no TV, fridge etc) from what I know (haven't stayed there). If you can stand the fact that some of the furniture in The Grand is old and there's a slight smell (though not that unpleasant), then the choice is yours. It's got cheaper weekly rates than the hostel as well. Only thing is it's not equipped with a self-catering kitchen. It depends on what your needs are (we stayed in the room alot of the time ;-)). I'm not dissing the YHA, I'm sure other people would still prefer them (I think one of the best things about any hostel are the self-catering kitchens). Reception is in the small pub downstairs. The lift is pretty heavy going (pushing the doors open). I've stayed here twice (was cheapest I could find in Sydney for the price/facilities/willingness to pay). Both times I booked through the manager, a nice englishman named Dan, whom I found to be friendly and helpful (he remembered me from the first time). I worked out a discounted price with him for my second booking but when I arrived, I was met by another manager (female) on shift at the time who quoted me a price of over $800.00, worked out on the daily rate (even though they have weekly rates and I was staying for almost 2 weeks). I explained the price agreed to with Dan but she said she is the manager on duty now (so it didn't matter) and seemed insistant that I pay the price she quoted. I refused and asked her to call Dan but she said he's in a meeting then apparently tried to call him but couldn't get through. Before all this, I found her quite professional and knew everything to say but my opinion started to drop dramatically when I asked if she could mind my bags so I could use the toilet. In a demanding tone with a facial expression to match, she scornfully uttered the word \"please\" (meaning I should say please, even though there was NOTHING wrong in how I asked her, just because I had not said please). I was taken aback by her rudeness but obliged without a word and even managed a smile. When I asked her to repeat something else, she replied I'd be able to hear her if I took off my headphones. I said I can hear her ok with them on (music was off). I thought the tone of that sentence and her voice was sarcastic and simply inappropriate. Consequently, I became agitated and upset by the time we reached the dispute over the price. I bore her attitude prior to that. She thought the price Dan gave me was generously low. I suppose it is when you balance that against the inflated price she tried to fleece from me, considering that (on her stance) she should have worked out the price based on the weekly rate, not the daily rate which is unfair. The whole point of a weekly rate is that it acts as an enticement/reward for someone to stay extra nights. I put this to her. She checked the price list and agreed there is a weekly rate (but I assumed she would have known as she's the manager and because it's basic information!). I referred to her earlier words to me but she replied she says \"please\" to everyone. I blurted out I that I don't care and that I'm not a child. It later appeared she was apologetic as conveyed by her actions (eg helpfully escorting us up to our room) or perhaps she was rattled by my earlier reaction, as she seemed nervous. Or maybe also an attempt to dissuade me from taking it further? In the end, I paid the price I had agreed on but not without the hassle. The fact is, she has no right to speak to a PAYING GUEST in that manner. What she does in her own time is her business but in the workplace, especially of a customer service-oriented industry, it was a display of unprofessionalism. I wished I remained calm in the situation but on the other hand, I should not have felt pushed to react that way. It was a dampener to my stay.
