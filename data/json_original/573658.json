The hotel is has a nice touch of luxury and it is really well designed and situated. My room has a washer and a dryer and a kitchenette, and that was just AMAZING! It was clean, its location is right on top of a subway station, and it is truly a very nicely designed hotel. I liked their fitness centre. Their equipment was top notch, and its location and maintainance was really good and inviting. Their Wi-Fi services were not the best and I didn't use them, but I found that they had a very well-situated work area, and I was able to remain productive for most of my time there.

I'll start with the plus - amazing room view, location and rate. However, there's other hotels with those perks. It truly was my worst stay at a Toronto hotel and I've had hundreds of stays over the years in this city. Here's a summation of my 6 days of utter disappointment in this hotel: - Room deodorizer nearly made me vomit. For four days I had the window open (freezing) to try and get the smell out and had to write a note every day for the cleaning staff not to use it. It wasn't just my room as I had a friend staying on the same floor with the same smell. - No tub and nearly killed myself in the shower. One TINY soap holder in the show and that's it. No rail to hold on to, no shelves. So I had to keep bending down to get my shampoo, etc. and just about fell countless times with nothing to grab on to. Serious safety issue. The shower head looked like it hadn't been replaced since the 70's or 80's. - The staff seemed to be the most apathetic bunch ever. And were just plain wrong and not helpful. I asked directions to use the PATH three times from the bellman's desk and was told that I couldn't get to my destination from PATH. I KNEW I could but couldn't quite remember as I hadn't used this section of PATH for some time. Each time, and with three different employees, they argued with me and just gave me instructions for using the street (which any idiot could figure out and plus it was freezing - thus my wanting to use PATH). Other employees gave me wrong locations of restaurants and assured me I didn't need a reservation to KI on a Sunday night - no kidding as KI was closed when I arrived. - Wake up calls were wrong two out of six nights - sort of important when on a business trip. And one night it took over 20 minutes to even get through for a wake-up call at all. - People calling the hotel trying to reach me told me that they gave up being on hold the hole time. Had to take all calls on my cell phone. - The internet was horrible and I needed a password everyday - not problem but I'd get put through to 4 different people, on hold and waiting at least 15 minutes every time I needed a code. - There is no way in the entire universe that this is a 4 star hotel.

But nothing compares to the frustration I've endured from the noise that the cleaning staff here produce during the day. Since this is a hotel, every suite is cleaned every day by a team of maids. They are extremely loud and inconsiderate people who act as though there are no other people within their earshot as they work. If you stay here during the day, you will regularly here banging, crashing, slamming, thudding mixed with shouting and even singing, every day continuously from about 8am till about 6pm. To put this in context, there have been on occasion what sounded like bachelor parties in the suites around me. From these kinds of affairs, I don't really hear anything in my room. But when the cleaners are working, it's louder than a bachelor party. I chose to live in this building because it was very close to the major banks and I operate a small business that provides consulting services to them. My job requires me to work at a mix between my client sites and my home. This building initially seemed like a perfect fit. Unfortunately the amount of noise I hear during the day from these people makes it almost impossible to focus on my work. Even when wearing earplugs these people are so noisy I can't even think. As I'm writing this, there are two cleaners having a shouting match outside my door. This is a regular a occurrence, sometimes it's just one of them yelling into a cell phone or someone with a walkie-talkie radio with the volume turned up full blast. Once a group of cleaners was having a heated conversation with someone who looked like a manager directly outside my door. Rather frustrated by their lack of consideration, I engaged the manager directly and asked him if they could continue their conversation inside one of the suites with the door closed. He responded with \"we're not shouting. please just relax\" This was someone wearing a tie, so I'm rather shocked by the lack of professionalism demonstrated here.

We very quickly realised that the other women in the bar were hookers and spent a fascinating hour watching them ply their trade. I think the layout of the lobby is unfortunate because it is a huge open area and the bar is by the entrance to the hotel rooms so you can see everyone coming and going. I am aware that all the hotels have hookers hanging out in them but it was a lot more obvious here because of the layout. The barman wasn't particularly friendly, he seemed more interested in serving shots to one of the hookers (I can understand why she needed them when I saw the client), and serving more drinks to a man who had already had far too many and could hardly stand up. Hookers were also coming in via the back door, being let into the elevator area by the hotel employees and then leaving after 10 minutes or so via the back door again.

The parking is actually $30 so not sure why they tried to charge us, when I queried it the guy at the desk apologised and removed the charge.

Up wide sweeping stairs, what is now a banquet hall was where all the tellers would have been, a very formidable room. The trek to our room took us down a maze of hallways puctuated with plaques showing old Toronto landmarks and giving a brief historical account of them. The rooms were modest in size, clean,well appointed, with a kitchen area. If not truly unique, it is rare to find a hotel so well situated at an affordable price.

I was on a lower floor, NOT in the high tower that has at least 45 floors. there are two elevator banks, one for each, and mine was very fast, no waiting. I have never had such a quiet room. There was no noise from above, from the next rooms, from the hall, and very little from outside. The room was elegant, big, comfy; bed was comfy with great linens. Towels were plentiful and good. Internet connection was with Ethernet, not wireless, which the front desk did not tell me initially, so hook-up took a bit of time and a telephone call. Here were the not-so-good things: small bathroom shelf and small vanity made it a bit crowded in there; low wattage light bulb in my floor lamp; front desk didn't tell me i could get a newspaper delivered in the morning; my windows didn't open although it looked as though they would and I wanted them to; TV was not flat screen nor as big as some. Good things: I had a separate shower stall and tub; front desk staff were obliging; admin was good (I had had to change my reservation details a couple of times); bar set-up was nice; valet service good. My heating system was very quiet, much quieter than many I've had, although a friend's in another room was very noisy, she reported. The room also had kitchen equipment in it.

So I can't say that I have shopped around for comparable rooms in the downtown Toronto area. To me, the room rate seems reasonable. BUT, there are so many inconveniences or oddities that make me think that staying somewhere else would have been a good choice. THE ROOM - the room is very oddly shaped -- extremely long, and very narrow. I actually ran laps in it my first night, since I couldn't go walking outside due to the rain. OK - not a big deal. THE INTERNET, part one - Like others had commented, only the lobby area is wi-fi; the rooms are hard wired. There is a small desk in the room where the ethernet cable clearly should be, since there is a port for it in the lamp. I look all over the desk area (which takes 2 seconds, because it's quite small) and then call down to the front desk. They then treated me like an idiot, as if I didn't know what an ethernet cable was. They sent their \"Tech Support\" up -- dude, I don't need tech support to find an ethernet cable. Anyway, it's the hotel maintenance guy who shows up. He doesn't see the cable, and then remembers that it's tucked away....behind the bed. He has to pull the bed out from the wall (crawling all over my sheets to do so) and he says I can use the internet from in bed. I ask for a longer cable, so he proceeds to crawl all over my sheets again in order to wind the cable across the room. I spend all of my trip with an ethernet cable draped across the room, as I sit in one of their uncomfortable chairs, with the laptop on my lap. Stupid. THE INTERNET, part two: connection speed - Terrible. TERRIBLE! And spotty. I don't know if this is an issue of #FirstWorldProblems or what, but it's not like I'm visiting a developing nation. C'mon, Canada! IN-ROOM AMENITIES - very plain. It was a pleasant surprise to find a washer / dryer in the room, not that I was staying long enough to use that. But were I staying longer, that could have been a great asset in terms of reducing the number of clothes I brought. The in-room coffee / tea service is cheap, cheap, cheap. I drank one of my bags of tea one morning (the caffeinated one, and opened the fixers packet to access the tea. I noticed that room service had set an extra bag of tea down for me, and I thought that was sweet of them -- giving me an extra bag of tea for the morning. In the morning, I then realized that the extra bag was the one tea I HADN'T had. And, the fixings bag was simply replaced as is -- torn open, and with the sugar missing. RIDICULOUS. KEYS - My keys stopped working after just a few hours. I'm not the only conference attendee to whom that happened. CONFERENCE SPACES - the plenary session is in a beautiful great hall, but the sound is also ridiculous. You couldn't hear a thing that the speaker said due to the echo. And the microphone and PA system (operated by 2 people?) was so cheap that it was heavy on the mids, making it blurry very difficult to understand. Cheap, cheap, cheap. TOWELS - cheap and over-used. Thin. But, you know, they get you dry, so, whatever. LOCATION - really good! Nice location, between lots of lively neighborhoods. Safe. Directly in front of a subway stop, on the street car lines. Really good location. THE PHONE - staticky. Poor connections, even within the hotel. And, the buttons don't connect you with the folks you are requesting. For example, the front desk button actually takes you to a switchboard for the wakeup call service. THE SERVICE - kind of grumpy, though the behind the scenes people were exceptionally friendly. It's the folks at the front desk who acted kind of snooty. THE SLEEPING - Very quiet rooms. You will have the hum from all the appliances in the room. The only odd thing is that my room overlooked a plaza with a fountain, and I think they are doing construction on the plaza. There were super-bright krieg lights down there that kept the room fairly illuminated, even with the curtains drawn. In all, I guess for the price, it was fine. But I'll bet there are much more convenient options around. I was not impressed and would NOT recommend to others. But if you are staying here, it's not the worst place I've ever stayed; it just has issues.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Kisco, New York", "Title": "\u201cDirty - stay away\u201d", "Author": "HankF99", "ReviewID": "UR120432885", "Content": "Great location, outstanding service, very good beds and pillows.

Granted, we did show up early, so it wasn't a surprise that our room wasn't ready yet. We went out and called a few hours later and were told that our room was ready. It wasn't ready and we were asked if we could wait another half and hour. We did and the room still wasn't ready. One of the front desk girls asked if I wanted a room on a lower floor and didn't understand what I meant when I asked if I would still get the \"guaranteed view\" I had paid extra for. She finally got it when she noticed that the ones who had taken my reservation had not made the proper changes. We still had to wait, finally getting the keys to our room past the 3 o'clock waiting time (their last excuse was that housekeeping couldn't find a mop---this was funny to hear as I watched one of the staff from the open-concept restaurant walking by with a mop while I was waiting). The room was nice but definitely not as big as the picture on their website led you to believe (although, beside the vase with flowers, it was accurate---it's just the way they took the picture---it seems like your room will be quite bigger). The worse of it all was when we went to check out. When it came time to giving us back the money the hold for cases of damages and the like, they accused us of smoking---NEITHER my husband or I smoke. What's funny is that my husband had noticed a can that said when we came back to our room after breakfast. He asked me if it was mine to which I said \"No\". When I noticed it said \"Smoke\" and something, I said maybe housekeeping uses it for the smoke on stuff or something. I also noticed the top of one (maybe even two) was opened (I think I would have noticed this before as I spend a lot of time looking out at the great views). Anyways, the front desk girl ended up giving us back the money. Then, another person from the front desk (maybe even a manager), comes back to see us and says that I told a front desk girl the day before that my husband was outside smoking, to which I replied that I wouldn't say that as my husband doesn't even smoke. They let us go again and as we are putting our stuff in the car, the same guy comes out again, now saying that someone saw the both of us smoking outside and that the valet said our car was \"reeking of cigarette smoke\"---which was funny because we told the first valet that we didn't want our car 'til we left---so the car would obviously have the odour of cigarettes if what they were saying was true. Of course, the guy refused to smell the car or any of the belongings we had. My husband even showed the tray from our car which was filled with change. We finally left. I considered contacting the General Manager of this Hotel, but after going thorough so much humiliation and dishonesty, I really don't think that the General Manager and the staff care about anyone else than their high-class clientele. If you are one of us \"average joes\" I strongly suggest you go elsewhere---I really wouldn't want to see anyone else go through the nightmare we went through at One King West.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Habra", "Title": "\u201cBasic Reasonable Price Down Town Toronto Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Enrico K", "ReviewID": "UR120160591", "Content": "We got this hotel from a travel site that did not show the hotel name.

The public areas of the hotel are beautiful, if not a little hodge podge. They're constrained by a very narrow plot of land on which the hotel sits, and so it seems the lobby bar is sort of in the way, and everything seems like it's just jammed in there. I received a premium view room with a nice view south and east. It was a spectacular view. However, while the front desk clerk said I would like the room more than my standard fare in Toronto, I think I'd disagree. It was probably modern in its day, but looking a little worn. Also, housekeeping wasn't as good as one would hope -- the glasses in the room had some crusty bits, hairs from previous guests on the bathroom toilet and in the sink, a bed that was made but not very carefully. Things you generally don't like to see in this kind of hotel. I think one of my biggest complaints would be that the air vent system, which seemed to be funnelled through one of the cupboards above the microwave, was very noisy. And it would run (perhaps for the hallway or other rooms?) even when my individual heating and cooling unit in the room was turned off. So it wasn't a very quiet room -- coupled with some car, street, and siren noise coming from 29 floors down on Yonge Street. Also, only wired internet in the room. And the desk is nowhere near the (tube) TV, so good luck working and having the TV on at the same time. It was a large room, but somewhat awkwardly laid out. Given the option to pay less, receive more and be treated like a VIP at my usual haunts a few blocks away, I don't think I'll return. Is it a bad hotel? Absolutely not.

One thing that did annoy me was I had asked for some chocolate covered strawberries to be in the room when we checked in and I told them exactly when we were checking in. They did not arrive, we were in the room for 2 hours before going out for dinner, upon our return from dinner and a movie at 11:30pm they were there and the chocolate was melted off them even though there was a fridge for them to put them in so I found this annoying.

If we gave the room a 10, we would give 0 to the people service. We stayed at Le Meridien the night before because One King West was full. We walked with 2 heavy luggages on foot to the hotel the next day. When we arrived, 2 bell service staff were outside, none of them came to help. They just waved their arms saying \" in there\"...pointing us the direction of the check in counter. When I was waiting for my husband during the check-in, none of the bell service staff inside the hotel looked my way. I was soaking wet (due to the rain) and had 2 luggages...standing beside the main entrance. They seemed to be so busy with whatever they were doing that they totally ignored me. It's a very small area...I don't think they didn't see me. We got the luggage up to the room ourselves. On Day 2, I asked the bell service to book a taxi to take us to a far away area that evening...the young man said it's taken care of...and I assumed it was. When we went to the bell service, they said there's no record showing that we had asked for a taxi. The young man we talked to simply said \"I was not here when you called, it was somebody else.\" What kind of attitude is this? No apology and apparently no training at all. When we came back later that evening, we got off the taxi and walked on the entry carpet that led to the front entrance...2 bell service staff were standing right in the middle of the carpet, facing our side, chatting to each other. None of them gave us a look. None of them had the courtesy of moving aside to let us pass. We had to \"detour\" to avoid walking into them. During the 3 days we stayed, I didn't see any one at the front desk greet us whenever we passed by....no eye contact....cold and stone faced. I guess it's like what my local friend in Toronto said \" it's majorly a residence hotel for long and short term stay, the service can be lukewarm.\" Honestly, it's colder than lukewarm to me.

The thing that really cheesed me abut it however was that they included a tip in the delivery price, but then left a spot for me to write in a tip only credit card slip. Which I did, because it was late and I was not paying attention, so I essentially tipped them twice. It seemed rather disingenuous to do this...almost like duping a tip out of someone.

We were relocating from far away, and hadn't seen the condo (having made arrangements online.) We found the unit filthy -- complete with dirty shot glasses, empty booze bottles and garbage. It had no AC and in no way met the description the landlord had provided. Again, this part was NOT the hotel's fault... But it is where they came in to save the day! This was a stressful experience for us, being in a new city, and suddenly having to find a new place to live (on a stat holiday) and knowing we'd lose our rental deposit... But, of course, none of this was the hotel's problem, which is why we decided to check in to one of their rooms so we could cool off, not have to move all of our luggage too far, and think about what to do. When I was talking to the young woman at the front desk, Karla, I mentioned our situation in passing, and she was so commiserative and helpful, I felt so much better, even though I was still in a tough place. I so appreciated her patient ear and outstanding service. She gave us an excellent rate as well, which I think was especially kind given that this was last minute on a holiday long weekend. She also wordlessly upgraded us to a larger room (ironically, the suite we walked into looked exactly like the pictures we'd seen of our supposed condo.) Over the next few days, all the little things were done well, like recognizing us in the evenings, nodding hellp and opening the automatic doors to the elevator bank so we didn't have to fish out our keys. Bringing us up extra shampoo within 5 minutes of us requesting it, and so on... Anyway, the hotel room was great; being new to Toronto, the location was also excellent for wandering around (in our case, wandering around looking for place.) Above alI, we just really appreciated the patience and service of Karla and the other staff at this hotel. We somehow managed to enjoy stay over the next few days...

I was a little unsure as in what to expect. I arrived their straight from a delayed flight from Barbados and went straight to the checking. I was checked into an interior room which by all means was very nice, well kept, clean, tidy and very spacious. But my gosh, that room was the most depressing and creepy room I've ever been in. Its kinda strange because you have a window to look out but its the shaft between the new and the old building so its kinda done to make it look like the outdoors. But being reasonable, i guess it was dissapointing to me because i live in Barbados with beautiful beaches, sunshine, and easy living so when i come to a big city i want to open the window and see Buildings! People! Pollution! Cars! Traffic! Lights! i want to see all of that!!!. The interior rooms will suit someone their on business or someone not in their room often because i would go into serious depression. The following day i did asked to be moved to a room of more substance and they weren't any rooms available so the front desk manager did tell me to check back a little later which i did and i didn't mind because i mean... he cant kick people out and he still wanted to accommodate me. So back from shopping i did go back to front desk and from the time i said my room number to a front desk agent they said my room is ready, which to me means that the front desk manager kept his word. The following room i went into was beautiful, but after 10 mins being settled front desk called and apologized for the air conditioning in the room that wasn't working and told me they can relocate me. #1 their was a problem with the room which is 'ok' because no one or nothing is prefect #2 he offered to send up the key and send someone up to transfer my luggage. That is what i mean by service unlike other Hotels that would tell me to go back to the front desk, so although it was an inconvenience, they did offer assistance in moving me and were extremely polite. Finally i got to my room and it was Fantastic! A high floor, Great views, Beautiful buildings, everything i wanted. Their was even a washer, dryer, dishwasher, sink, microwave, fridge.. was like a condo.

Our flight was 4 hours delayed and we got to the hotel past midnight. My kids, ages 3 and 1 were exhausted and extremely fussy. This is when all you wish is to get the room and crash. No such luck!

We staying on the 43rd floor and there was no central thermostat. Every hour a loud fan would would vent in air to warm up the room. I would never recommend this room. They gave us a couple dollars off the room which was a nice gesture. We also booked two rooms on the 8th floor which were much better and provided a thermostat to control the temperature. Those rooms were fine. I would recommend those. This place is really hit or miss. If you plan on staying here, book a lower floor room or one of their general rooms and don't have things delivered to your room. This place has potential but it really has some gaps in service that needs to be addressed.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location and Excellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "clecl", "ReviewID": "UR108483140", "Content": "I was in Toronto for a week on a business course and was looking for a comfortable place to stay that was also close to the location of my course.

In no time at all, I was equipped with my room cards, had a summary of where to find what I was looking for and was on my way up to my room. The staff were polite, friendly and informative. The hotel bar/restaurant caught me a bit by surprise, being that it forms a part of the hotel's lobby. In the end, this didn't cause me any grief at all and I actually enjoyed the central location. The food was good, the service was exceptional and the prices were right about on par with what I would expect in downtown Toronto. My room was not entirely what I expected (the view was non-existent) but I was in the historical part of the hotel and looking (I think!) across at the side of the new building that is attached. I wasn't there to spend my entire time looking out the window, so it didn't matter, but if I were going for pleasure and not business I would be sure to ask for a room with a view. Beyond that I can't complain about the room. The furnishings were comfortable, clean and not worn down. I had everything I needed for a week's stay, and then some. The room had a mysterious aroma of cooked beef at some times during the day, but I came to realize that much of the area around the hotel (including my course building) had the same thing. Cleaning of the room was prompt and effective. No complaints there! The staff have to be this hotel's single, biggest asset. I was called by name by any staff members who could have known my name. The bar/restaurant staff remembered my drink preference after one evening. Given that I only had two beers the night I checked in, I thought it was pretty impressive that they would remember which beer I like the next day. Every single staff member I encountered in the halls, in the elevator, etc, politely wished me a good day, evening, etc. Whoever trains these people on customer focus is doing a great job. Location is perfect. You are right smack in the middle of downtown and close to just about anything you could wish for.

There was room to walk around without banging into anything, and just big enough to not feel cramped (except for the bathroom, that did feel a bit cramped). We were surprised by the kitchenette that had not only a dishwasher, but also a clothes washer and dryer. We've stayed in suites before, but none that gave you your own laundry facilities. The room was VERY clean and comfortable. Like other reviewers have said, the television was old (flat screen, but not an LED/LCD/Plasma) but honestly, I didn't even notice until I remembered reading that detail in a review. It worked though! Plus, even though we did watch some TV during our downtime, we weren't there to watch tv! The only downfall to our room was that there was no long hallway from the door to the bed area (there is a separate room, but it's all open) and we were able to hear people entering and leaving other rooms very clearly.

After reading the reviews, we were expecting an unbelievable hotel filled with tradition but retrofitted for modern convieniences. We were deeply disappointed. The hotel lobby is extremly disappointing , and seems almost like your checking into a parking garage. it's very drafty, cold, and extremely lacking in common furnishings and standard amenities. The historic setting that could be an intregral part of this hotel is completely lost and the two architectural types that this buidling has, go against each other at every oppurtunity. The dinning area (not a seperate room) sits smack dap in the lobby entrance and is nothing more than 4-5 small table scattered in one corner. The dinning room is about 30 feet from the drafty front doors and main lobby desk. We had an upper room and while the views were fabulous the room was anything but. satisfiying. The TV was a small 24\" monitor that was posiitoned in an obsure corner that no actual person could even watch it. The room was extremly drafty and cold. The drapes moved on windy nights so much so that the effect was somewhat scary ,e specially being so high up. the wind whistled throught the cracks and windows which did not help matters. The carpet and overall furnishign are somewhat dated with nicked corners and stains throughout the room. We only had one chair in the entire suite, which was odd givent he room was considered a suite capable of sleeping four. The HVAC cojntrols were programmed, however the room was always cold and you couldn't adjust the controls as no maual was provided and the unit was definitely not user friendly. Bottom line with One King West is that it might be okay if your traveling for anight on business it might be okay but for families or just the two of you, dont' waste your money on this one.

I was searching for a place that offered a great location, spectacular views, a friendly staff, and all the things that would make me feel like home. Boy did they get it right! The first time around was a place that I wasn't really appreciating the fact that the staff is more than staff, they are family.

Once the operator transferred me to the reservation desk, my heart dropped out of my chest. Not only did this woman remember my voice, but she remembered my name.

Whilst I was there the staff seemed disorganised as the front desk was moved from one area of the foyer to another. I attach a photo I took of the entrance which showed the foyer on one of the better days of construction... - I was charged for internet in my room that didn't work (again because of the construction, apparently). The staff was unable to resolve this issue and asked me to call their internet provider to resolve myself. I was then charged a premium rate for the call I had been asked to make to the internet provider. - My bill was incorrect with some charges billed twice. - staff generally seemed lethargic and unwilling to help. - The suite was quite small for the price I paid. I ended up moving to another hotel (in Yorkville) where I paid $50 less per night and my room was significantly bigger. I think the hotel should advise renovations are currently under way as quite a few other customers I met at the entrance bar were also very dissapointed by the fall in standards recently.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "Lillian70", "ReviewID": "UR99518073", "Content": "Just wanted to say this hotel is worth staying in and very beautiful and clean.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGet treated like a \"King\" at One King West\u201d", "Author": "Travelling_Mike444", "ReviewID": "UR98723688", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel on several occasions.

Room service is a joke, its open from 6 pm to 6 am, so if you want to order breakfast in bed, you have to order it before 6 am and they will leave it at your front door by 6 am. They suggest warming it up in your in-suite kitchen but really, who wants to do that? Not to mention the meals are more expensive than most places ($16 for mac n cheese?) A cocktail and a beer was $20 in the hotel bar. Service is forgettable, when we were checking out it took 25 minutes for valet to arrive with our car! The location is good for restaurants and its a few steps from the Eaton Centre. If you want to go into the 'cooler' less touristy parts of the city, aka the West end, its too far to walk.

We just wanted to enjoy a nice day in the city - shopping downtown, etc. Let me first say, this hotel and its accommodations has great potential as a hip, modern downtown location for business travellers and vacationers alike, however, in its current state, it's a far cry from the 4 star rating it boasts. Please note, we had this room at a discounted price - never would I pay the general price to stay here. Pros: - We were assigned a room on the 44th floor with a breathtaking night view of Yonge St. spanning all the way across the city to the lake. - The hotel is situated in the \"middle of it all\". We were a mere five minute walk to the Eaton Centre and all surrounding hot spots. Considering the morning we were there the city hosted the annual Santa Clause Parade, the ability to get places on foot was essential. Now for the breakdown on the less than pleasing room itself. Keep in mind we're a young couple that's easy going. We don't sweat the small stuff BUT we take note of attention to detail (or in this case, lack thereof). So for those interested as a heads up, here's how it is. Cons: - While we did not have need of the kitchen area for our stay, I noticed that hotel basics for this layout such as coffee packets and detergent were not present. - The lobby bar/restaurant made the hotel feel like a nightclub rather than a classy hotel - A female mgr type at the front desk was anything but friendly with a scowl that would make anyone want to turn around and leave. - The beautiful view was sadly obscured by the countless fingerprints and forehead smears on the windows. It was clear the windows hadn't been cleaned..not in days but months. - As another reviewer noted from their stay, we were faced with a hideaway bed; \"Murphy Bed\" as a mgr explained on here.The ironic part being how the mgr clearly explained that these beds were allocated for guests staying long term for their convenience. We stayed one night. A hard futon quality mattress with little to no support. Not what you expect after a long flight. Also had pot lights previously mentioned with no switch and taped wires. - To further reiterate the above reviewer - LOUDEST, most HORRIFYINGLY NOISY heating/air conditioning system we have ever encountered. In the end we opted to turn it off which just made us aware of how paper thins the walls were - we could still hear the air units in the surrounding rooms haha - The floor hadn't been vacuumed and old face clothes had been left on the bathroom counter. - The shower head was so small it only offered a minor stream of water and while modern in appearance, the shower was void of shelving or trays to put soap, shampoo, etc. Lastly, it was surprising again that for a hotel portraying a hip, modern vibe....the room still had the old 90s big box tv.

In other words there was no privacy in there at all. Also, as a four star hotel, they should have newspaper delivery directly to your suite. The breakfast was o.k.

Our room was on the 9th floor of the older building, HUGE suite with great amenities, however no view whatsoever, we simply looked out on the wall of another building just a few feet away which made the room incredibly dark and the internal lighting was not great, this took away much of the 'roomy' feeling it should have had. I was a little suprised that there was no detergent or cloth to enable us to wash up and the maid simply kept piling the washing up into the dishwasher each day until we were left with no more crockery! Would it have taken much to just provide a couple of dishwasher tablets so it could have actually been switched on??? this would have been very handy for a 7 night stay. I was going to say that it was great to have FREE wifi in the room, but having read all the other reviews I can only assume that we were the lucky ones who managed to link into someone elses network as we were connected to 'Trendnet'! For a large suite, the bathroom was disapointingly small, with only a shower and no bathtub, for a 4 star hotel I felt this let it down. The room was generally kept clean though there was a couple of areas including the CD player next to our bed that clearly never got cleaned and were thick with dust! We were also unfortunate that a personal item went missing from our room while we were out, we spoke to the maid about it but she was distinctly not interested and we can only assume if she was the only person who had access to our room that she was responsible for the disapearance, however when we brought the matter to the attention of the manager he could not have been more helpful and even gave me his personal cell phone number to contact him on, although the missing item is yet to be found. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to most attractions, shopping and restaurants, with direct access to subway, street car and path (underground shopping) We were also picked up directly from the door for our excursion to Niagra Falls.

Comments I was swayed into choosing this hotel because of the positive feedback. Don't get me wrong, those reviews can be trusted but, sadly, my experience was different. Firstly, after getting our hopes up with the photos on the internet on their superior room, we were given a small room - which I think may well have been a studio room (a downgrade to what we had paid for). The toilet in this room (2205) was RIGHT NEXT to the bed (well, separated by a door). Secondly, when I had complained, I didn't receive the best of service from the front desk. If you want great service, hold making your request until \"Mac\" is on duty. Thirdly, no one helped us with our luggage when we were dropped off by the taxi, when we changed rooms and when we checked out. We had to struggle to carry our suitcases and lugggages. Fourthly, one day the maid left the bin bag with all the rubbish in our room (gone the next day mind you, BUT, still not great customer care). Finally, we made one request to guest servivces. The operator said that she would call us back. She never did. If One King West prevented all these niggling bits, then my rating would have been higher. Sadly their service delivery was below our expectations hence the scoring. By the way, the hotel gets used a lot for events so it does get busy.

Within the first day I realized the lady at the front desk placed 2 holds on my credit/debit card which kept me from my funds. She told me the machine was acting up so she had to swipe my card again. I wasn't concerned at first because surely all they had to do was call my bank first thing the next morning to release one of the holds. Wrong!!. I had to be present while they contacted my bank and that couldnt be done till the following week due to bank hours. Dont want to spend anymore time on that but just be careful to monitor your credit card or bank accounts. Check in was great in that they gave us a room some 5 hrs. early. The downside was a much smaller room than I had seen on the website. It still had all the appliances listed which was convienient but the room was very small (Room 822) but we didnt complain. Our issue came a couple of nights later when we realized the abundance of light that came from the lights in the atrium. My only thought on the previous 2 nights was we were too tired from the early flight to notice or care. I called the front desk requesting the lights be turned off as from inside the room it looked like it was daytime at 10:00 at night. They told me the lights always stay on and offered us another room (room 601). That room was larger and we had plans to move our belongings the following morning but the air conditioner was broken. The following morning they put us in another room ..out 3rd on this trip but by far the best. We had a room on the 47th floor (room 4701) with an even larger room than 601 and with a view of the city. The room was dark and the air worked. We've been in many hotels and have read many reviews where they have refused to accomodate us the paying customer. I can say that this hotel on this trip did all they could without the involvement of the management. The fitness center on the rooftop gave a nice view of the city but was smaller than I thought. They have free weights, 3 treadmills, 2 eliptical machines and 2 stationary bikes. The location is great..right in the middle of everything and with the train station being right under the hotel, you can't do any better. We didnt eat at the hotel so I can't comment. Lastly I requested a late check out as our flight didnt leave until late in the afternoon and they gave it to us. If a hotel is able then they will..if not then they wont.

Our room had a king bed, large window overlooking the lake, TV, arm chair, desk and desk seating, (Rm 3805).

The entire facility is smoke free and kept very clean. We found the front desk folks to be reasonably helpful, but Justin in Concierge and the guys running the bar were the most friendly and helpful of everyone there. Justin helped us get a rental car for a drive to Niagara Falls, suggested routes for our site seeing and gave us umbrellas to use on a rainy evening.

Not to mention the window opened to allow for fresh outside air into the room which we were both very excited about. The parking is a bit expensive because for the location. Since the hotel is in the downtown core the hotel only offers valet parking at $30 per night but they are very quick to park and bring your car up. The staff at the hotel are very helpful and pleasant and always willing to lend a hand. From checking to bumping into staff in the hall, everyone was very professional. We were very happy with our room since it was large and had a mini fridge, laundry facility, dishwasher, sink, plates and cups. The suite was only one room and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a separate sleeping area from the sitting area and only offered a chair and stool vs a couch which seems to be standard in a suite.

Generally the event was great - it's a beautiful venue with delicious food and the banquet team was very accommodating as we planned and prepared for the day. However, there were a few major snafus that should *never* have happenned... specifically not from a hotel that touts itself as a classy facility for weddings/events! In short: - Valet was so understaffed and slow that many guests almost missed the (offsite) wedding ceremony due to the slow rate at which cars were retrieved. Upwards of 45 rooms at OKW were reserved by our guests and they knew the wedding was offsite at 3:30 pm - yet there were 2 people on valet. It was very poorly run (especially at $40/night) - A/V - for A/V, podium rentals - you MUST use their preferred vendor - yet no one checked to see if the podium etc was installed in the right area (as on the floor plan) - it wasn't. - Special meals - we had an elderly guest with severe food restrictions -we had taken great care so as to not single her out but serve her appropriate special items - this was forgotten and the server instead urged her to 'try the regular meal, it's good' - not appropriate and the exact opposite effect from the subtlety we had painstakingly gone over with the banquet manager. - Tip jars on bar - we had this in the contract - there were to be NO tip jars on the bar as the grats were (steeply) included in our cost. Tip jars were present during the cocktail reception - we asked they be removed - they were put back on the bar during the dinner. - Cocktail reception - we were assured the King Gallery would be large enough for our crowd - it wasn't. We weren't offered to have the reception in the Austin Room which would have been far more suitable. - Finally - despite the tasting and the chat with the chef, and the fact that they made us review and initial each page of the banquet order the day before the wedding to ensure all details were correct - THEY SERVED THE WRONG MEAL. Pork with a mushroom cream sauce instead of a garlic ginger crust. It was actually quite delicious, but NOT what we ordered, paid for, or chose to go with the other sides. It also looked very unappealing (gray sauce over meat). Why the error? Because 'that's how we usually serve it in the restaurant'. Well - that option wasn't even on the banquet menu. Why make us review each page of the contract if clearly the kitchen staff didn't even look at it? Overall - like I said, the day was great. No one really knew things had gone wrong except for me - but after all the planning and meetings and painstaking choices we made - it was very disheartening to know that our careful plans were basically ignored. We met with the hotel afterwards - they were apologetic to a point, but really - they already had the money in the bank so it wasn't really their problem. I would still recommend it - it was lovely - but think it's important for people to hear both good and bad feedback.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottowa", "Title": "\u201cCommon hotel\u201d", "Author": "russo45", "ReviewID": "UR55138688", "Content": "This is a common one from all the same style hotel in toronto.

This was my first time spending any amount of time in Toronto. I did a lot of research before the trip as far as what I had planned and my options as far as hotels go. I like to think i am an experienced traveler, as I have visited over half the states in the Us as well as a number of provinces in Canada, all by car. I had studied the reviews for this hotel quite extensively and can usually pick out the \"nit pickers\" from the serious issues. This seemed like a reasonable place in a great location. After reading the reviews I knew what to expect and what not to. Cleanliness - I was greatly impressed by the cleanliness throughout the room and hotel in general. My only complaint was the staff seemed to take their time in cleaning tables at breakfast. They have a small amount of tables, so in my opinion I think they needed to be a bit quicker on that part. Location - This hotel is in one of the best spots in downtown. The subway stop is so close to the hotel you could almost fall down the stairs into the subway stepping out of the hotel doors haha. If it is raining or cold you can take the underground walkway to the same subway stop. The hotel is right on the corner of Younge & King st, so bus routes are also right at the doorstep. I never even tried to get a cab as I had a 7 day subway pass. Great value, as it works on both the subway and busses. Just make sure and get the correct pass, as there is more then one choice. Several restaurants and shopping is close by as the Eaton Centre is only a few subway stops down, or a nice walk on a summer day. Several other attractions are also close by such as the Hockey Hall of Fame and CN Tower. Also the location (Younge & King) may seem like it would make for a noisy environment. Being 40 floors up, we did not experience hardly any noise with the exception of a couple nights when it seemed that half of Toronto's FD was driving past the hotel. Rooms - I was able to book a one bedroom suite which features a separate bedroom area from the living area which itself as a pull out sofa bed, which is larger then most pull-outs I have seen. Also included is a full kitchen area with mini-fridge, microwave, mini-stove, automatic dishwasher, dishes, and even a mini washer and dryer for your clothes!!! We were also on the 40th floor so the view was beyond breathtaking. Heck I even hooked up my antenna to my laptop and was getting TV broadcasts all the way from Buffalo NY across the lake! Service - The service for the rooms was very fast. There were times we left the room for 30 or 45min to go eat breakfast then come back to the room to gather a few things before heading out. When we got back to the room after breakfast, the room was already made up almost everyday! Check in and check out was quick both times. Though I did give service 4 / 5 because while I was there the fire alarm sounded. I found out later that someone thought it would be funny. The reason I gave them 4 was because of the way they handled it. They came on the loudspeaker (one in every room and through the hotel), and told everyone to stay in their room while they \"investigate\" the situation. hmm?!?!?! I was always trained if a fire alarm goes off you get the heck out, especially in such a tall building. Is this a Canadian thing? Anyway the alarm kept going for about 15min, giving the SAME speech, no updates. Finally after the FD had been on scene for about 10 minutes they reset it. Again, im not complaining about the fire alarm, the hotel cant control that... but they are asking for trouble telling people to stay in the rooms during a fire alarm. Also most the time it seemed like the elevators took forever! I understand this hotel has 40+ floors but there were 4 elevators. Value - The overall value was good. A lot of people complain about the price, when they go during peak season. Wake up people! What do you expect out of a major downtown hotel that is rated as high as this one, and is mostly suites. I went in Sept so it wasn't peak season and good a decent price (cheaper then the hotel site) off of expedia. Again I did give it 4 / 5 because the internet in the room was quite expensive. They did have a business center and you could access the lobby wi-fi for free after obtaining a free code from the front desk. My complaint is if you spend all that money on a nice suite, why would you want to be confined to sitting in the lobby? That was not well thought out. The internet was also VERY slow. The breakfast (if you did not want the very few hot buffet items available) cost $40 for two! The food was average to good, but not worth half that much. There is a breakfast place a block or two south on Younge st. Amenities - The exercise room seemed to be fairly nice. They have two very large hot tubs but no pools, with men's and women's saunas and a complete changing room right there. That seemed kind of odd to me, for a hotel this nice and to have all of the aforementioned but not have a pool. Oh well, I made it up by spending some well needed time in the hot tub. There is also a bar in the lobby area. There is an outdoor deck area near the hot tubs. There is also a gift shop. Avoid it if you can, it is a rip-off as most hotel gift shops are. There is a grocery store directly across the street that will sell everything you could need. Summary: This is a well-maintained hotel with mainly suites, that is in just about the perfect place for a base location throughout Toronto. You just need to come during off-peak times to get good prices, or else you will be paying a premium.

The hotel is adapted from an old bank building and you can sense that all around the place from the entrance and lobby to our room. And what a strange room!!! Overall it was a reasonable size with one bed which was comfy. But the dimensions of the room could not be described as anything - not square, not round, not rectangle but looked as if it had been cobbled together from a couple of rooms and perhaps a storage cupboard. This made for cramped conditions in the area where the bed was and a lot of wasted space as you entered the room with a massive \"hall\". However, the worst thing about it was there was hardly any natural light which made for a very gloomy room. This was because the only window which could give any light was at the end of an \"arm\" of the room and was not big enough to let sufficient light to the rest of the room. There was another sham window at one side but this was useless for any light. It was well enough appointed - reasonable bathroom (but make sure you lock the door if you are using the loo in case someone comes in and knocks you out with the door!!), washing machine, tumble drier, hair drier, sink, microwave, hob, utensils, fridge, couple of wardrobes. However, if you wanted to make your own meal, there was not really anywhere you could sit at a table to eat it. There was a desk in front of the aforementioned window but this could accommodate only one person. The other table was a more like a coffee table with 2 arm chairs at the side. Also if you wanted to watch the TV the only place you could sit was on the bed as the 3 chairs in the room were not in front or even slightly to the side of the TV. All in all extremely quirky and did not make for a welcoming and homely feel and, for the price we paid, we thought it very poor. We were up early for breakfast so did not suffer the fate of a crowded breakfast bar as mentioned by others in their reviews. However, I could quite see the point they were making.

Our room was initially clean and well laid out. Several problems did crop up though. The daily room cleaning was not well done, and there were several delays or omissions when service was requested for our room. My main concern, however, was how the hotel responded to a problem that the hotel created. During our stay, on one of the days, there were 2 false alarms. One was in the morning, and the other was very late at night (actually early AM), totally disrupting our sleep that night. The alarm and frequent accompanying announcements via the room speaker persisted both times about 30 min to 45 min. Each time, we were to stay in our room, and the elevators were disabled. Fair enough. These things happen. But remember, this was due to a recurrent false alarm. In any case, this is a supposedly quality hotel. When I asked about an adjustment for the loss of a night's sleep, I was treated like a disposable commodity. I spoke with the Office Manager (Lazara Rouco) who's main job seemed to be to defend the fact that it was inappropriate to make any kind of adjustment in the cost for that day of highly disrupted sleep, and how this false alarm was due to the fact that the hotel had my safety in mind. I have stayed in many high quality hotels, in fact I prefer them and willingly pay the increased price to do so. I do expect quality service and consideration in exchange. I do not feel that One King West is sufficiently customer focused - as evidenced by my experience and interaction with hotel management.

There are also great amenities from Bath & Body Works. The hotel also has a very nice fitness area complete with whirpool and a very nice indoor hottub. Oh, and the location couldn't be better! You're right in the middle of downtown, across from a Starbuck's and a great restauarant called Beerbistro, which I highly recommend! All in all, an amazing stay at a great price.

One of the few negative things we can say about this hotel is arriving in a car. There is a valet service but the front of the hotel is very small and would not be able to accommodate more than 4 cars arriving at the same time. The front entrance is also located in a side street off of Yonge that looks a little like a large alleyway. We drove a pretty large vehicle and were not sure where to park it while we checked in (no valets apparent) so we parked on the street and walked in. We were told that we needed to speak with the valet desk to get the car parked. It would cost $30/night, but we were told to park ourselves somewhere else since our vehicle was too large. Whatever, it saved us $16, so I recommend parking in the building next door since it's waaaay cheaper to do that on a weekend. The cashier was very nice and genuinely hoped we had a good stay. We wanted a late checkout time but it was hotel policy that they charge us so we had to be out of there at noon (not her fault). The room was really nice with the correct size bed that we requested. Clean linens and overall very clean room. The only drawback was all the glasses (both wine and rocks glasses) had to be rinsed and wiped before using since they had a small layer of dust on them. The freezer in the refrigerator wasn't working since the ice cream we brought melted overnight. Noise from nearby Yonge street was present, but not at a level that would keep us from sleeping. Overall, nice hotel boutique hotel that just needs a couple of tweeks. I would not pay full price for a room here though.

Last month we set out for a romantic couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekend in Toronto and decided to stay at the Suites at 1 King West. THE GOOD The location of this hotel is great for walking to nice restaurants, shopping and attractions. The view of the room we had was pretty impressive as you could see Lake Ontario and the skyscrapers of the financial district and beyond. The kitchenette is a nice touch with dishwasher, washer/dryer, dishes and utensils. Room service was quick and tasty. The bell staff was very nice and accommodating. THE BAD The room was a bit on the small side although the layout made the most of the space. The bed was small but more importantly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the linens were a disgrace. There were holes in the bed skirt, the pillows and mattress was uncomfortable. The hotel could easily raise its profile by investing in this area and dressing the bed to look more luxurious and inviting with a better duvet and decorative pillows. The bathroom was pretty small, the tub could be larger but it does serve its purpose. The shower needs improvement in terms of the water pressure and two small aesthetic changes: install a rain shower head and upgrade the curtain to something better or a glass door. THE UGLY There are a lot of great deals on right now at Toronto hotels and since this hotel is downtown as well as close to the club district the Suites unfortunately drew a rowdy group of young people on the Saturday night of our stay. They started their noise early with the drinking before the club and returned after 3 am even louder and more obnoxious with yelling and door slamming while other people were trying to sleep. It took 2 hours and 2 calls to security to get them to finally shut up.

A number of issues, taken together, made it less than comfortable. Given the number of preferable options in Toronto, I am not likely to return, nor would I recommend this hotel to others. For someone needing to stay a week or more, the concept might be attractive. The rooms come with a small kitchen, dishwasher, and washer and dryer. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use any of these, but they appeared to be in working order. The room itself was reasonably well decorated, although small for a suite. A small desk was provided, with a wired internet connection for $9.99 a day. The bathroom was nothing outstanding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no bathtub, just a shower with weak water pressure. The tower I was in seemed old, even though the room had been redecorated; this was most evident in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insulation and heating / fan. A colleague told me he had stayed in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other tower before, and been impressed with the room, but that his room on the 45th floor in my tower during this stay was much shabbier. None of my three colleagues liked their rooms during this stay. Negatives to consider before booking: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The floor to ceiling windows in my room let in a lot of cold air and noise from the wind (it was December, but not particularly cold or windy). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The fan on the heater / air conditioner was extremely noisy, to the point that it woke me up several times each the night when it came on. Because the windows let in so much cold air, the heater needed to run most of the night. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The bed was very firm, which I found uncomfortable. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I was supposed to be in a non-smoking room. While my room (1602) itself had been heavily perfumed, the hallway outside my room reeked of cigarette smoke. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The water pressure in the shower was weak \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the shampoo and conditioner fully out of my hair. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The hotel does not stock the same toiletries other hotels do. A colleague had forgotten his mini toothpaste. At most business hotels, you can get a free mini toothpaste at the front desk if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve forgotten yours. At the Suites at 1 King West, they directed my colleague to the Shoppers store across the street to buy toothpaste. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The room next door had put out room service trays for pickup before I arrived in the late afternoon. The next morning, they were still there. The next afternoon, still there. Two days later when I checked out, they were still sitting out in the hallway with the food & beer drying up on them. That was pretty disgusting.

Upon arrival at the hotel at 12:40pm was told that my room was ready which was a pleasant surprise (I was prepared just to drop off my bags and head over to the Rogers Centre). The guy who checked me in suggested I take a cab if I wanted to make it to the game on time which I did. It's about a $6 cab ride otherwise it's about a 25 min walk (which I did on my way back from the game). Next, the room itself was wonderful which a nice kitchen and very comfy bed. I had an interior room so no view but that's fine since I wasn't planning on spending much time in the room. The floor I was on was very quiet so I was able to sleep like a baby.

The person at the front desk was very pleasant as she denied my request to be in the new tower on a floor that would give me a nice view of the city. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that would be an issue given what appeared to be a great number of vacant rooms available judging by the lack of people in the lobby and bar area. Instead, after she verified that I had booked my reservation through Travelocity, I was given a room in the \"Historic Section\" of the building on the tenth floor. The \"Historic\" part of the building was originally a bank that was built around 1906 and at some point in time converted to a hotel. Unfortunately, even after several upgrades, it still isn't desirable by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards, even at one quarter of the cost at $212USD a night including taxes. And buy the way, the valet parking was an additional $40. The room that I was given was a standard suite which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really much of a suite at all. It compares very closely with any normal room in a typical three star hotel even though this was supposed to be either a four or five star hotel depending on what you read. In no way should this hotel have either a four or five star rating, at least not based on my room. The windows are single pane, uninsulated, wooden windows that should have been replaced years ago. The paint is in need of a refreshining. The heater was loud but worked okay. When I went to find the vending machines for ice and a soda, I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the only ones around were located on the twelfth floor and finding them even then was not easy. As I mentioned, I was on the tenth floor, and unfortunately, due to the windows and the proximity of the room to the street below, just the noise from the traffic was enough to keep me from getting a well deserved night's sleep. I have read several other reviews and noticed a disturbing trend.... those that stay in the new tower seem to enjoy their rooms, while those that are relegated to the \"Historic\" part of the building are not at all happy with their rooms. I hope that the managers of The Suites At 1 King West will read this review perhaps change their policy on placing guests in the \"Historic\" section of the building. My guess is that \"one-nighters\" that book through a third-party will be very unhappy!

Room itself (suite3506) was large by British standards, and had magnificent views eastwards towards lake Ontario (as we requested). The kitchen was equipped with microwave, sink, fridge, dishwasher, washing machine, tumble drier, crockery and cutlery, but lacked the small essentials such as dishwashing liquid, dishcloths or teatowel - they are available from reception for a small charge, but since you'd hardly expect to stay in a hotel and not be provided with bath towels, shampoo, bath soap etc, feel that the addition of these items would improve the experience for guests at a fairly minimal expense to the hotel. Apart from that, the only other small niggles were that the door rattled in its frame which necessitated us wedging a rolled up newspaper in the gap to prevent being woken every time someone walked past, the air conditioning was a bit noisy and the paintwork could do with a bit of freshening up here and there. Everything else in the room was lovely; linens were classy, the bed was comfy, TV signal was strong with a good selection of channels (what *is* it with British hotels? they never seem to get the TVs to perform adequately), bathroom (well, shower-only-room) was small but perfectly formed - although no hooks on the back of the door as it was a pocket door. All the staff we had dealings with were polite and professional, and the business centre (3 PCs connected to the internet) near reception providing free internet access for hotel guests was really convenient. The hotel connects directly to the PATH system which means you don't even need to go outside to get around, which would be good in bad weather. Lots of nice places nearby to eat - we had brunch at Over Easy on Yonge and would highly recommend it despite its rather unpromising looking entrance. Also nearby on Yonge is the Houston Steaks and Ribs which serves what might be considered standard burger and steak fare, but which we found to be friendly, fresh and well- priced (so much so that we went back for a second meal); not haute cuisine, but it suited our tastes very well. There's a handy pharmacy/drugstore directly opposite the hotel which stays open until 10pm. Around the corner from that, there's a very small convenience store which sells a lot of basics. For quick food shopping, I'd really recommend The Market by Longo's in Brookfield Place which carries a large selection of fresh food and household essentials in a fairly small space - we bought cereal, milk, bread, ham and butter as well as juice and some treats and this kept us self-sufficient in breakfasts and a couple of picnic lunches for nearly a week. The location couldn't be better for public transport access (King subway station is accessible either just outside the back door of the hotel, or through the PATH system), streetcars stop on the corner of King and Yonge, and Union station is a short walk away. Although the airport shuttle bus doesn't stop at this hotel, we found the closest (and most convenient) stop to be at the Fairmont Royal York on Front Street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 5 minutes away above ground and a bit more like 15 minutes via PATH \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not recommended if you have suitcases as there are lots of places with stairs and no lifts or escalators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it's also very easy to get lost! The Eaton Centre is a short walk away if shopping is your thing, and if you're into chilling out away from the bustle of the city, I'd recommend taking the ferry to centre island and hiring a bike for a ride around the Toronto islands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stunning views and a peaceful location made a couple of memorable afternoon visits for us.

Upon arrival at the hotel we were initally impressed with the grandeur of the lobby area and the sense of class it seemed to exude. This nice early impression was soon quashed however by the cold and rather rude welcome given by the rather uppity guy on the front desk. Instead of advising of how much would be taken as pre authorisation he just took the card and swiped without asking our permission. When we queried the high amount taken as pre authorisation ($110 a day!) the guy kind of looked down his nose at us as if we were tourist peasants and said 'well its' gone through'. This kind of stuck up attitude kind of set the standard for the remainder of our stay. We encountered this kind of frosty service whenever we approached reception. It seems that because we did not appear to be high flying business types and instead came across as lowly tourists we were not worthy of their service. Come on guys has spending all that time in the company of snooty businessmen rubbed off on you? come on i mean you are only receptionists?! don't dismiss the tourist trade.

During our holiday we spent seven nights at 1 King West. On checking in, which was very quick and pleasant, we requested a room with a soaking tub and were given a suite on the 17th floor, opposite the gym and health suite. I think we were one of the only occupied rooms on this floor as there was never any noise at night and it was very convent for using the hotels facilities. The suite itself was large, with a small seating area and good size bed which was comfortable, however the room was a little on the dark side with only one outside window at one end. The bathroom was also a nice size with the all important soaking tub and a separate shower which was nice. We had breakfast in the hotel on the first morning, which was very tasty and not too expensive, however most days we either grabbed something in the PATH food court which is accessible via the stairs in the hotel lobby, or had cereal in the room. We did have two minor problems during our stay. A carrier bag containing a brand new top which had been bought the day before was taken from our room by the maid service however after about an hour spent calling various departments within the hotel the bag and top was returned in perfected condition by the head of hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security along with an apology. Also on our last night the fire alarm went off at about 3:15 am, however the hotel did use in the room announcement system to keep guest informed of the situation and I am pleased to say that we did not have to evacuate as it was a false alarm.

Most the time we are not disappointed until now. First of all, their website says that they would be happy to book a limo ride from the airport for you at a cost of course. Since my parents are elderly, I wanted to have a ride ready so they did not have to stand in line for a taxi. Well, when I got to the airport, there was no ride waiting, so I phoned the hotel valet services and was told that \"Daniel\" forgot to book it. Then in a not so pleasant response, I was told to just go outside, there should be lots of taxis and limos. Well on a Friday night at 5:00, there were no limos to be had and my parents and I waited in a taxi lineup for about 20 minutes. The hotel was not even sorry! We booked a one bedroom suite. I was staying on the hide a bed in the living room. I made sure the hotel knew there would be 3 people in the room. When we finally got there, there was no bedding for the hide a bed, only 2 towels, 2 cups, etc. I phoned down and they sent up another towel, cup, pillows (without pillowcases) and a blanket. The next day, the housekeeping staff again left 2 towels, 2 cups etc. I would think that if a hotel specialized in \"suites\", they would have some kind of system to let the housekeeping staff know how many people were in the room. The hide a bed was very uncomfortable, but I suppose that is the way with all hide a beds. At the end of our stay, the front desk argued with me over 18 cents for a phone call which should have been free. I paid the 18 cents as it wasn't worth arguing over, which made me wonder why \"they\" would argue about it considering all the problems we had. I did let the front desk know that I wasn't all that happy about our experience there, but they did not seem to care at all. I would probably not stay at this hotel again, more because my concerns were not dealt with rather than the place itself.

I booked the room over a month ahead of time by phoning the hotel for a one night stay. We were headed into Toronto for a concert at the Air Canada Centre. At the time of booking the hotel (1 month ahead), I made 2 simple requests - a King Size bed and a car ride through their complementary car service. I was told that most beds were Kings in the hotel and they would put a note on my reservation requesting such a bed. I was offered a Tower Superior Room for $239, which was supposed to be one of the better rooms according to the hotel. I booked the car service with the valet, who told me the date and time was open and inked me in. The Good: Well, it's hard to pin-point the good when the Bad and Ugly just cloud everything, but I'll try. Location: King and Yonge right in the downtown core. Close to shopping, restaurants, and connects to the PATH (Toronto's underground downtown walkway). Subway stop is just outside the hotel. Rooms: The room has a mini-fridge, washer, dryer, microwave, dishwasher, plates, silverware, DVD player, in-room safe. Kind of nice if staying for an extended period. Appliances were kind of awkwardly put into the kitchenette (washer and dryer are in the cabinets in your kitchenette, fridge sits atop your counter) but I guess that's the only way to fit it in the limited room space. Beds were comfortable and bathroom was average sized for a 5-star. Overall, the room was good...not 5-star comparable to most other downtown TO hotels, but better than your average 3 or 4 star hotel room. Complementary car service to downtown locations on a first-come-first-serve basis (booking with valet required). The Bad: Not to be nit-picky, but the room was somewhat run down. For a relatively \"new\" Toronto hotel, every corner had missing paint chips, scuff marks, etc. I can certainly see the need for a little maintenance and house-keeping over the regular sweep-and-vaccuum. The parking in front of the hotel is non-existent when checking-in/pulling up. The traffic is heavy and there is no room to pull into the hotel (the few spots the hotel has house the complementary car service limos). You end up pulling along the street and the valets come out to greet you across the street. Poor design for sure. Valet Parking by the way costs $30 per day, which is a little steep even by downtown Toronto standards. There is no hotel self park, although lots in the area charge approx $20/day. The Ugly: A couple of points are specific to our experience, but after reading a few other similar reviews here, I can see a pattern of apathy and nonsensical logic on the staff's part. Like I mentioned, I booked a month ahead of time and made a request for a king bed. We have one at home...we are used to the size and we are not the smallest people in the world. Well, of couse when checking in, we are told that our room has a queen bed. When I mentioned that I had requested a king, I was told that there were no Tower Superior Rooms available with a king bed. This was at 3:10pm when check in was 3:00. I then asked if they had any other room that had a king bed open. Was told that there were standard suites with kings available. The standard suites were a downgrade in room type and size, however we were willing to take if for the king bed. Remember, I paid $239 for my room and the standard suite normally goes for $169. I was willing to switch rooms and pay the $239 rate even with room downgrade. However, I was told that because rooms were so full that day in Toronto, the rate for the standard suite was now $350! So, basically they wanted me to take a downgrade and pay an extra $111 on top of it. Ridiculous! Next, when confirming my ride, I was told that there were other people also going to the concert and they wanted to cram everyone in one vehicle. Well, so much for their first-come, first serve policy. The point of riding in the classic car was to have a romantic ride to the event, not be packed like sardines in a '56 Cadillac. Finally, I mentioned the room needed a little repair and maintenance. The maid also needed to learn how to clean. There was filth on the kitchen counter under the fridge (hair, food, who knows what else). There was an unmentionable stain in the bath tub and the light switches were covered in filth (see photos). Overall, if you are staying for a holiday, vacation, or special occasion, I would HIGHLY recommend you stay elsewhere. The business traveler may find this hotel useful if you can get over the obvious deficiencies. Don't expect the staff/management to do anything if you voice your concerns...they don't even have comment cards.

Unfortunately after struggling to get our car valet parked (its quite tight round the entrance) we were told we had to wait as our room wasn't ready. Two hours, numerous drinks and lots of questions later we were \"upgraded\" to a higher suite and given a free breakfast voucher. I then told the lady behind the counter it would be a nice gesture to pay for our bar bill since we were told we would only have to wait 15 minutes. They did begrudgingly do this after much faffing about - but hey at least they agreed. At least they reacted when something went wrong, but I do feel they could have done more to keep us informed - or why not just upgrade us immediately? Anyway, back to the Hotel. The lobby is very large and nicely finished with a classical feel. There are bell-hops and staff a plenty and even a small shop to buy the essentials. While we were waiting for our room the lobby was very busy with business men and stranded travellers no doubt also waiting for something. The bar was professionally run and service was first rate. On to the room. The photos of the rooms on Expedia looked fabulous and they didn't disappoint. We were given a guided tour of the suite by the bell-hop and he even went as far as to show us how the hidden dishwasher/washer and dryer worked! The Suite had a separate bedroom with good size bed, TV and Fireplace. Off the side was the compact bathroom with bath, wet-room style shower, etc. The complimentary toiletries were very nice too.

I did not like the lobby area at all as it really feels a bit like one of those conference type hotels that usually seem to be in the middle of nowhere. Then you go up into the tower and your room and it is like you are in a different hotel altogether. The interior designer who did the hotel rooms clearly had no say on the old bank building. The meeting areas and rooms in the bank building area are very gloomy and dark with dark drapes. You eat meals if you have an event there in \"The Vault\" which is what it says with the amazingly HUGE door that used to lock the vault still there. It is worth looking at.

It was very quiet, no noise from next door, above or below what so ever. The temperature control seemed to work well. Calls to guest services were dealt with promptly and politely. The conciere desk staff were very helpful on giving directions, restuarant recommendations, etc. Checkout was smooth, bell services kept my luggage from 8 AM - 2:30 PM for no charge. The VERY BEST THING about this hotel is it's LOCATION. You can exit directly from the hotel into the underground PATH system. You can go out the door, into the PATH system, turn left, go down a short flight of stairs and get on the subway. I walked to and from my course (about two blocks away) without stepping outside, no jacket or umbrella's required. The entertainment district is within walking distance as is the Eaton Centre mall. And when you have a bunch of bags to carry back after shopping all evening at the mall, you can just hop on the subway for $2.75 and get a ride straight from the mall to the hotel in a matter of minutes - again all without stepping outside. The hotel lobby is grand and beautiful. Had room service once - it was a little pricey but the food and service were excellent. They offer a long distance/internet package for $4.99/night. Gives you high speed internet and unlimited long distance which I used extensively. Worth every penny. Had no problems connecting to the internet. High speed - although not wireless worked very well. Paid $209/night which is a steal for a hotel of this quality in this location. Would gladly stay there again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney/Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly great!\u201d", "Author": "travel_bug3379", "ReviewID": "UR7597523", "Content": "I did a lot of research when booking my Toronto accommodation as I wanted to be central in location, and in a nice place that didn't cost the world. Reading other reviews narrowed things down a lot and when I found a good price advertised for 1 King West, I decided to take it. I loved this hotel from the moment I arrived. The lobby is gorgeous, and as someone else previously reviewed, it reminded me of a private club setting - dim lighting (not too dim, just right!), a huge bar area, big lounges overlooking the lobby... Check-in was simple and fast and the lady was extremely pleasant. I was on floor 36 and had no issues with my room at all! My desk overlooked Yonge St, and the rest of the suite had city/water views which were beautiful. I was able to wash my clothes in the in-room washing machine which was handy since I was on a 3 week trip, and I also loved the fact that I would be able to cook myself if I wanted to. Everything you needed was there! It really was like a mini apartment that you could live in permanently. I ordered room-service dinner one night and it was the tastiest pasta dish I have EVER had from a hotel before - AND it was a big serving! Need I say more on how good the food was! Breakfast was also very tasty and in good portions! A little known fact about the hotel is that they have a local car service that will take you from the hotel to anywhere in the central business area for no charge. I was told about the service from someone else who had stayed there and decided to use it to get to a business meeting. I honestly felt like a celebrity! The car was an old 50's/60's car, not sure of the make/model but everyone on the street was staring in to see who I was and checking out the car. Service was great by most staff, some were much better than others but that is normal. The bar in the lobby is a great place to sit and have a drink in the evening, especially if travelling alone like I was. I met some great people at the bar and there is a huge tv screen there also which was always playing sports but that was a good thing!

The suite is spacious, we were placed at the 34th floor, so got a nice view as well. The location is excellent, walkable to/from CN tower & St. Lawrence Market. The hotel is connected through path and the King subway station right outside the door. I do however have several complaints about the hotel. The concierge does not know where Chinatown or Little India is. For Chinatown she had to google and then ask one of the bell boys where it is. For Little India, she directed us to take the subway to Yonge St, walk over a few blocks to Gerard Street, and then walk along Gerard for 15 minutes. Let me tell you, that's not even remotely close to Little India. We actually took a cab from Gerard &Yonge and it took a little over 12 minutes drive to get there! Additionally, The night before arrival, I called the hotel to see if they have any room available for early check in the next day. The person I spoke to at the time said \"Sure No problem\". So off we went arriving at 7AM. I know it's very early... At the front desk, the staff told us that there was no room available and to come back at 12 (the checkout time is 11). So we dropped the bags at the hotel and went for some sightseeing. At 12PM we came back, and was told the room isn't ready yet. We decided then to stay at the hotel lobby and asked them to let us know as soon as it's ready. At 1:30 still nothing, we then went to the front desk for status, in response we got brushed off with an attitude and was told that the check in time is 3PM. Finally at 2:20PM, a front desk staff came by to tell us she is putting a rush on a nice suite for us (mind you we did book a tower superior room). We finally checked in at 3PM. Make of it what you will, but I've stayed in many hotels (and occasionally requested early checkin), but had never experienced anything like this. If you are ordering room service breakfast, it's simply not worth it. My continental breakfast came with a cup of coffee, a glass of juice, sugar & milk in sachets, and 2 pastries. No flask to keep the coffee warm or milk in its own pot. During our stay there were plenty of college-age kids staying at the hotel, and they made quite some noise in the hallway at night.

The hotel itself is very beautifiul with many historic features. It is worth an explore to see everything. The Dominion Hall is awe-inspiring - make sure you look up to see all the provincial crests on the ceiling. The fitness area seemed to be well equiped. It is on the 17th floor with a walk-out patio. There was also a small lap pool, hot tub, saunas and change rooms. The change rooms were stocked with toiletries. We were quite impressed by our room. It was strangely shaped but had a nice layout. The desk sat in a corner overlooking the city. The bed and TV area was comfortable. The kitchenette equipped with a fridge, microwave, dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer, toaster, microwave, dishes and cutlery. There was also a small personal safe in the closet. The bathroom had a small single vanity, toilet and shower stall. We were happy that the showerhead was high enough that we didn't have to duck and the water pressure was sufficient.

One of the best things about this hotel is the location. You are close to all downtown attractions including theatre, shopping, the Air Canada Centre and Roger Centre (Skydome). We walked underground using the PATH system to pretty much anywhere we wanted. The King streetcar stops right at the hotel's front door. The food courts in the attached buildings provide a wide variety of food and shopping outlets. Although it was cold outside, we really didn't need our coats! We did not eat at the restaurants in the hotel - had a few pints but found the price very high compared to other watering-holes nearby. To get to the hotel from the airport, we used the TTC (public tranport) - $2.75 each. There is an express bus to Kipling Station on the ground level of Terminal 1. Once on the subway, we had to transfer to the Yonge-University line and the exit at King. Look for the large stairway upstairs, exit the subway to Commerce Court/Melinds Street and make an immediate right to access the lower level of the hotel.

I normally stay at the Inter-continental but with having to pay for three rooms- for teenagers, the different price ranges in this hotel was ideal. We had a one bedroom suite and two studio suites. On hindsight given the length of stay, we should have booked for one month rental - might have been cheaper to get the block price. We booked directly with the hotel which was useful as we could negotiate room prices etc.. The rooms were very comfortable- particularly the beds. I sleep with earplugs so the heating systems did not disturb but they can if you do not switch them off. One thing we felt was that it was a real hit or miss as to which rooms you got for what you paid. We paid almost $140 more for the one bedroom suites and they were nice. We paid $129 per night for my teenagers and one of them had a fantastic room on the 44th floor- and frankly we probably could have lived with that rather than pay the extra $140. The other had a basic room in the old part of the hotel. Depending on who you have at the check in desk- you either get a coordinated room allocation ( as we did on our return visit- with being allocated three rooms on the one floor) or spread all over the place. Also there appears to be no logic as to how you are allocated rooms so $129 could be a studio suite with no view or it could be a fantastic room with windows on three sides of the room- stunning view. It could be in the old part of the building or in the new at a very high floor. One very positive feature is the $5 per day access to high speed internet access. We used Skype to call home to the UK and with teenagers ringing their girlfriends back home for hours each day and wanting to go on MSN, this feature was fantastic. We stayed over the Christmas period though we went to relations for Christmas day. Rather disappointing that the hotel did not issue a seasons greeting to all its customers- the only note we had for Christmas was from the maid who placed a note on Christmas eve wishing up a Happy Christmas- presumably looking for a tip the next day- which we did give. I realise not everyone celebrates Christmas but it would have been a nice touch from the hotel management- as it was, it seemed impersonal and they took down the Christmas tree first thing on Boxing Day- did the Grinch arrive? Rooms were clean but again maid service erratic. For example, most days we were given enough toilet rolls etc but some days, they forgot to top up the coffee, milk. Some rooms had kettles and some had none but you could ask for one and always delivered. The classic cars were a nice touch- but you do need to tip but at least you arrive in style. There is a route to the underground- to PATH and malls- very convenient if the weather is cold. When we were there, it was absudly mild for Christmas/New Year- should not complain...some days we had to turn the air con on in the room- it was too warm to sleep at night! Staff varied- generally very very helpful and friendly, Conciege were helpful but we believe there is a fairly high staff turnover and we are not sure why this is, unless it is a feature of the industry. Good breakfast places nearby e.g. Overeasy(rather pricey), Richtree which is a food marketplace catering for different tastes- a good bet if you have a family with different culinary likes and dislikes and of course Tim Hortons which is not only reasonably priced but with tasty fast food. We never ate in the hotel, we found the menu range bland and standard. There is really no need to eat in the hotel given the choice around. Also very handy is a Shoppers Drug Mart across the road with Canada Post in it. No queues- go the Mart near Eaton and it is mobbed. Eaton is only 3 blocks away as is Nathan Philips Sq. Also walking distance to the CN Tower. There is a Dominion Supermarket about 7 minutes walk away where you can shop for washing powder etc.. don't bother buying these items in the hotel if you are staying for more than a few days. After spending nearly $4500 CAN in the place and having spent quite a while there over the festive period, we did get an upgrade for our second visit. What was really good was they kept our luggage for us between stays as we could not fit them all into the hired car when we headed to the snow in Algonquin. This is our 10 th visit to Toronto in as many years and we have generally stayed in a range of places from the bottom end e.g. Town Inn Suites and Comfort Inn to Sheraton and Intercontinental.

Location is perfect and as stated in previous posts the subway line and streetcars are right outside the front door. The hotel is also within walking distance to Union Station, Eaton Centre and City Hall (all of which can be walked via the PATH which is connected to the hotel) . We took the 'Rocketbus' and connecting subway ride's from the Airport to the hotel and back and found it a very cheap option if you don't have too much luggage. The subway stop is right outside the hotel so not much walking required. Check-in was fine and staff were very friendly and accommodating. The concierge service and complimentary car service are excellent and the room was cleaned everyday by the maid's who do a very fine job. The room itself is excellent and more than worth the price. The decor is great and the kitchenette is very handy, although it does miss a proper kettle (a cafetiere is supplied). The bed is very comfortable and the perfect size for a great nights sleep. We were on the 38th floor and the views of downtown at night were quite impressive. We did have lake views but not as much as we would have liked. The food was good and very reasonably priced. We spent a lot of time at the Richtree Market Restaurant around the corner (breakfast, lunch and dinner) which we would recommend as a must do just for the experience. The Beer Bistro also became a bit of a local and again this is a must for anyone who can drink a beer or two. The staff were excellent and the food and drink was awesome. The Irish Embassy Pub is across the street and well worth a visit.

I was on site for four consecutive nights end of oct and first 3 days of November. I booked and received a rate of $149.00 plus taxes. The room was a great deal. It was a king suite on the 15th floor. The problem I had was that the windows looked out onto nothing but a large vent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no daylight. It appears I was in one of a few rooms that opened into the buildings infrastructure interior\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.this problem appears to be corrected at the 17th floor above. The room was in constant heat mode with no cool air available. I asked to have the matter corrected however it never was. Staff/Service; Excellent. Any requests were handled with a smile and in an efficient manner except my non air conditioned matter. Room; Carpet was worn/stained however the room was clean every day. The facilities within the room were well maintained and efficient for everyday use. The room was well appointed and left little more required. Common facilities; These were excellent. It had a great health center for adults however any kids may notice the non-pool concept. The health/athletic center is one of the best I have seen in my travels. The elevators as previously reported were slow however did not have too much of an impact on my daily schedule. The lobby area was impeccable. It was not over powering. It had an exclusive club type of feel and was well laid out. Check in and checkout was fast. It was obvious staff knew their job and enjoyed working there. Other lobby staff was equally courteous and available to answer all questions. Location; They say location is everything, and here it is just that. Located on Younge Street in the city core you are close to everything. Having a cook facility in your room you are just two blocks from a major chain grocery store open 24 hours. If you are a non cook and on vacation I challenge you to figure out where to eat in a timely fashion. There are so many first class eateries within this area you will be dumbfounded.

My room on the 15th floor was very nice. It was clean and comfortable. Importantly, it was very large and even had a balcony. Not many rooms have a balcony, so if you want one you may want to ask when you make your reservation. I think I booked a standard room with king size bed, but I suspect I may have gotten something better, though no one mentioned an upgrade (the room struck me as too good for the price of a standard room). The bathroom was fine, though not very big, and the room also came with a kitchenette, washing machine, dryer, and fridge. Sadly the fridge was empty, but 24h room service fixed that. The food was good. The complimentary transportation service around the city in vintage luxury cars (Bentley, Rolls etc) was a nice touch and the drivers were very friendly. I only had two small problems with this hotel. First, the window above the door to the balcony could not be obscured with a curtain, so the morning sun woke me up earlier than I would have wished for. Second, I ordered room service twice (a late night meal and a breakfast) and both times they managed to mess up my order by failing to deliver part of it. This was quite annoying as I had to wait a while for them to go back and get what they forgot. The fact that 100% of the times I ordered food something didn't arrive is what really prevents me from giving this place full marks.

If you don't fancy the hotel food, try Richtree's Market Restaurant at 42 Yonge Street (5 mins away) for breakfast, lunch or dinner - great fresh food and you only pay for what you want. You can also have it as take away. Only one word of warning - we booked an airport pickup via the hotel website, asking for the $60 service. The service is run by a separate company. The guy turned up in a stretch limo which he parked in the multi storey so we had to walk all the way over there...and then he charged us $85 which is the VIP service.

The hotel is fairly new and it seems as though the staff may be still in training or not used to their jobs yet as they are a little slack. Don't get me wrong , everyone we spoke to was very nice and polite, it's just that the service could be a bit better. For instance we ordered breakfast on our first morning which never turned up, we had to call reception to find out what happened, however we did get our meal eventually - they did get the order wrong though. But these niggles are far out-weighed by the positives. Firstly, the room was great. It was spacious, and had all the mod cons you could want - fridge, washer-dryer, microwave oven and dishwasher. Secondly the location was great too. Their was a subway stop and streetcar stop right outside the hotel plus a lot of the downtown places to visit are walking distance and the entertainment district, which has theatres, bars and restaurants aplenty, is only a 10 min walk or quick streetcar ride away. Another nice feature of the hotel is that you can book one of their fabulous classic cars to take you anywhere in the vicinity ...for free! We took a rather nice Bentley to the CN tower, which was rather nice - I could've got used to that! Overall a great hotel and one where we would stay again.

I paid an additional $4.99 Canadian a day for high-speed Internet access AND unlimited calls anywhere in Canada and the US. This is really quite a deal. Only rough edges: no concierge yet and the young bell staff they have filling in are not very well informed. And the maid service still has a few rough edges: plastic bags in garbage cans installed with air inside so the anything tossed into them bounces right out, toilet paper and other amenities not always replaced--and no spares in room. But these are minor and will be worked out--my guess--as the place hits its stride. Excellent value. Thanks to those who stayed before me and pointed me in this direction!

The amenities were also good, as we enjoyed the sauna and whirlpool most days. Staff, however, are earnest yet ultimately unhelpful. Our first night, for example, we had tickets to a show at Second City, and asked the concierge to recommend and make reservations at a nice restaurant nearby.

We left the room each day around 10 am and returned between 3 and 4, and every day, found that no maid service had been provided. On Friday, I went down to the sauna around 3:30, then to the whirlpool, and found the water ice cold.

Where was this place when my kids were little? The bathroom was an odd shape, but had lots of counter space. The view was fantastic, with floor to ceiling windows. The beds were comfy, with high end linens. The windows open and the lake breeze was quite nice, but traffic noise carried up even to the 10th floor. I will warn, though, that the people in the next room were complaining to us while on the elevator about their room and view. We paid the bottom online rate, so don't know what they paid. The location... can't say enough about this. Right downtown but without the price of the King Eddy and Royal York. I was so sorry that we were only going to an event two blocks away so we couldn't take advantage of the limo service. Oh, and take a minute to go down those stairs in the middle of the lobby to check out the vault (this was originally an historic bank building) and the story of how it was installed many years ago.

Frankly, I had wanted to stay in a boutique hotel, i.e. Hotel Le Germain, but because of the many conferences in town made a last minute decision to stay at King's West. My choice to stay here was based on the price and location and the reasonable reviews that it's had on trip advisor. It was better than I had hoped. The rooms are not large but are well appointed. Also, the furnishings are clean and modern with a very nice color scheme. (nice linens, leather headboard) I especially liked the hidden washer and dryer which I used once during our stay. Other nice amenities include access to the vintage cars that give complementary rides wihin downtown, we used this service often. This hotel is non-smoking and as such does not have the musty smell that I tend to associate with hotels. It's extremely well located, we walked everywhere. I read the previous reviews, I was surprised to see that someone rated the hotel with one star. I will say that there must be construction going on somewhere in the hotel as we frequently saw construction workers coming and going on the elevators, but that was our only exposure. I never heard any noise related to construction. In general, I thought this was an excellent find.", "Date": "May 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat for travellers or business!\u201d", "Author": "Tobie", "ReviewID": "UR4955913", "Content": "Despite a few finishing touches being tended to, and training of staff still ongoing, this hotel was an absolutely great spot for an overnight stay and should appeal to a wide variety of clients. The rooms are well designed for longer stays with a microwave, dishwasher, washer and dryer, iron and board.....and a hairdryer (*if you look in the cupboard below the sink). The bathroom has a walk in shower and separate tub so the one sink vanity is somewhat small, but glass shelves add to the storage potential. As well, the bed was comfy (though not \"heavenly\") and the glass desk/work area with 2 chairs, one an swivel leather desk chair, was good for our morning Starbucks fix...located right across the street. In our suite there was an electric fireplace, with a television on top, a glass fronted armoire for clothing (thank you for \"skinny\" mirrors!) and a lounge chair and ottoman. I forgot to ask for a higher floor so we were on the 8th, but besides the odd street noise, we found the suite quiet. There was a faint smell of paint in the morning at the elevators, but besides that, you wouldn't know there was any construction going on. The lobby is spacious and tastefully decorated, with two main entrances on opposite sides of the building for easy access to public transit right outside the door. We found all staff very friendly and helpful, but they are still training people and it's obvious from the previous review, they may not have all that worked out quite yet. But our experience was above average in that regard. We did make use of the \"courtesy cars\" and had a ride in a '72 Rolls to a restaurant in the Distillery District (Boiler House .....fantastic meal, great jazz) which was wonderful. We didn't visit the cafe on site and the restaurant is still under construction, but there is a room service menu and nearby eateries so that wasn't a problem. If you are looking for a more luxurious, spacious suite for a romantic getaway, this might not be the place for you.

This was a pleasant, attractively decorated large room with a kitchen area which included not only a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker, but a dishwasher and a clothes washer and dryer. The location is excellent. We had come to attend the opera, and the hotel was only about two blocks from the Hummingbird Centre. The King Street subway station is just outside either door, or one can reach it via the extensive underground PATH. The staff were very pleasant and did their best to be helpful, although they were often busy and sometimes did not have the answers right at their fingertips. I have a few minor caveats: (1)If one takes the Toronto Airport Express from Pearson Airport, the stop nearest this hotel is at the Royal York, about four blocks away. (2) Our room had an easy chair with an ottoman which looked as though it would be comfortable. It was decorated with a double row of large \"nailheads\" along the sides and back of the chair, which bumped me in the head when I leaned back and made the chair uncomfortable for me. (I am short, and a taller person probably wouldn't be bothered. There were other places to sit.) (3) The booklet in the room describing the hotel's amenities, room service, etc. implied that if a guest needed information about airport bus schedules, where to rent a car, etc. all that guest had to do was to contact the front desk, using the speed dial on the phone. We didn't use the speed dial, but rather asked in person, and we did get the answers we needed, but we usually had to wait while the desk clerk or valet had to look things up and deal with other matters as well. We weren't in a big hurry, but our questions didn't seem very complicated. As I said, these were minor things.

The view from our 34th floor studio suite was fantastic and the suite itself was very well equipped and comfortable. The complimentary internet access was a particular bonus. The location is excellent - in the heart of the financial district and next door to King subway station. The subway system in Toronto is very clean and very safe, even at night.

The impressive lobby is richly decorated and conviently accessible. I entered through the PATH system, an 11km underground passage-way filled with stores and restaurants that connects all major buildings in downtown Toronto. Although there are only 4 elevators, you realize that the hotel is not as big as a 50 storey building seems. The very slender hotel only has about 10 suites per level. Also, upon exiting the elevators, windows let a west view shine through. The room that I had was uniquely shaped, with angled walls, which maximized light entry. There is a kitchenette which includes a washer and a seperate dryer. I don't know how valuable this is to people, but it certainly looks classy. The marble bathroom had a spacious shower instead of a bathtub (suited towards business travellers). The bed was huge, and the linens were top notch. Another perk for business personalities is the free in-room internet. It certainly left a good impression with me, and will come in handy next time around. Finally, the view (I was only on the 26 level, imagine the 40th) is spectacular. My west facing windows overlooked the lake, the CN Tower, and best of all the sunset.

When we checked in we asked if it was possible to get two double beds instead of a king and were informed that the hotel only has king beds.
