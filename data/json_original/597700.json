I chose this hotel as it was affordable and near the termini as we had to catch an early train to Naples. Cons: - The locality is not nice as at night the area is filled with drunk people roaming the area around termini in the cheap bars/night clubs. - The lady at the reception showed us in the room, there is one key to enter into a corridor from the stairs, and then one for the room. she scared us that whenever you enter from the stairs, close and lock the door behind you immediately and also keep your room locked when inside. I am sure she had all the good intentions but just and idea for you its an unsafe locality. - The ensuite bathroom was like a narrow alley with the shower head right above the toilet seat. No soap, no gel, not even a towel. No bathroom amenities at all. - The rooms are sad and depressing. Everything is old, the furniture, the paint etc. - The breakfast was the biggest joke/treachery. When we came down the morning for bf, a voucher for bf is given to us both to get bf from a cafe behind the block. We went there and found a smallest cafe and the salesperson was not happy to see us. We were told to pick one pastry and a coffee. I picked up two pastries so he said that you will not get a coffee as you have taken two pastries! where's the sense in that?!! the pastries/croissants were not so good either. Me and my wife were glad the nightmare was over in 1 night and we didn't stay more. We promised ourselves never to end up in a hotel like that and pay the extra little bit for a decent stay even for 1 night, I have backpacked solo also through europe, and even as a budget backpacker I won't stay here. If you want to stay close to termini to catch an early train, then pay a little more and stay in a decent hotel. Avoid this hotel at all cost!!!!!!!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cPick a better spot\u201d", "Author": "DovelyOrlando", "ReviewID": "UR119328077", "Content": "Sacrifice the location for something more quiet and hospitable.

Seriously, I couldn't have imagined that it would be like this. Let's start with bad points. The room was not cosy, tidy or comfortable. You could've seen dirt in it. Once I've seen the cockroach! Brrrr. There was not everyday cleaning either. The bed was unpleasant, like all the other furniture. The climax of my discontent was the bathroom. If you are not the one who want to take a shower, you should wait until the heater is ready. Also, our room was on the 1st floor close to the public bathroom, and the heater was the one, so in the morning it is simply impossible to take a warm shower. About tranquility. During the evenings I often heard shouts of foreigners in different languages, cause it is not the best quarter in Rome. I suppose, that is the reason of absence of view from the room. The window was hammered. Also, we had couple of mornings, when there was pretty noisy at the hotel. The receptionist told us that there were \"special days\", when she was shouting at some workers. The noise from the workers also was rather appreciable. The breakfast was in the room, as they didn't have space for it, but it is very poor and the same all the time. The staff was good for us. There were Russian girl Katya during some days who spoke Russian, English and Italian and was very nice, friendly Italian man during some nights and unfriendly Italian oldman during other nights. Some people wrote that he was a real nighmare, but we hadn't any problems with him. Do not speak English with him, say him \"Buona notte\", and he will be glad.

The daytime receptionist was courteous, helpful and spoke fluent English. The antique elevator was able to transport our luggage and us to the fifth floor. We did have to navigate several interesting locks to reach our room, but the security made us feel safer. The room was adequate and was ensuite. It did overlook the street and Termini, but we had no problem with noise which was a concern. Our friend's room had air conditioning, but our room could only have a window opened for cooling. We chose this room on purpose. The location was fabulous being right across the street from Termini and all the links to buses, trains and subways. Termini also had a wide variety of eateries, shops and tourist info. A Continental Breakfast was included and was served at a restaurant across the street in Termini. One note would be to not arrive in the evening because the gentleman who manned the desk then does not appear to speak English.

Given the danger, filth, and poor service at Sunshine House, we were glad to pay a little bit more and stay somewhere else. Whatever you do, do not stay at, or in the neighborhood, of Sunshine House. Try Via Nazionale, they have many hotels there and, without advertising for the one where we stayed, the area is safer even at night. Whereas, Sunshine House was scary even at daytime.", "Date": "July 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cDont stay there \u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3657047", "Content": "I am in Italy at the moment after leaving the so called \"Sunshine house\".

He described the place as a hostel & not a family run B&B as described on the website I booked it on. Having seen the gang of young men hanging around the entrance to Sunshine House and the condition of the surrounding area, we did not take much convincing to find another hotel.

The room I had was comfortable enough, with A/C, a TV, and a sink. (Note: the only bathroom is shared among 7 people!) Not spotless, but I wouldn't call it dirty. It is in the absolute worst part of town, but it is extremely close to the train and metro station, very convenient. Breakfast is a pre-packaged croissant and (good, as is all Italian) coffee. It was going as a solid 2-star rating until... On my last night there just before midnight a gruff old man started banging on my door shouting what apparently was the only non-Italian he knew, \"Pay! Pay now!\" I hadn't seen anyone like him around before, and because of the seedy neighborhood I worried that he might have been a shady character who had gotten inside the main door and was trying a ploy to get me to open my door, since this was pretty unusual behavior for a legitimate innkeeper. I tried to communicate in a couple languages (not Italian) and all I could get was \"Pay now\" interspersed with salvos of angry Italian. He pretended to call the police on the phone two different times, and after a long while he eventually gave up. The fellow tending shop in the morning said that it probably had indeed been the night attendant and apologized several times for that interchange, but the whole experience still dropped my assessment of the lodging a notch. BTW, their web site makes it look like a family operation; I never saw any of them, and where I stayed was apparently another B&B in the same building (Antonietta's House) they were either reselling or had bought. In all, you get what you pay for, and I paid for the cheapest accommodation I could find (70 Euros/night) within walking distance of historical Roma. I'd say it rates a 1.5 / 5.0, because it could have been dirtier and I wasn't actually robbed.", "Date": "September 21, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Caput Mundi Roma", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d597700-Reviews-Hotel_Caput_Mundi_Roma-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$66 - $141*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Urbano Rattazzi 65</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "597700", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f0/b5/f0b5706fc6d988a5640c49f8287e68ac4large.jpg"}}
