This is an older timeshare resort, close to Disney but away from the shopping areas and main downtown. The pool is small and becomes shaded at times, but as the resort was not busy when we were there the pool size wasn't a problem. Numbers in the pool and beds would be an issue if all the units were full. Its a small resort, not on a par with the huge multi building/multi pool resorts we have been to before in Florida, but the 2 bed units were lovely. The one beds are small, and with 2 teenage sons we would have felt crammed in, so we updgraded at a cost to the 2 bed. It was a few years since we travelled to Orlando and its grown massively. We were astonished at how long it took us to get to International Drive, the traffic was awful. Bear this in mind whn looking at this resort as its great for Disney, not for much else.

It's a VERY average place. Kinda like staying with a friend that just isn't quite as clean as you are. The units are fine, was kind of expecting a little nicer though. The pool closes early and seems to be always filled with people, it's not very big. The hot tub the same way. It offers no real ammenities that a plain old hotel wouldn't offer. The bedspreads were not clean and you don't get a real feeling of cleanliness in the place. The furniture in the unit, especially the bedrooms, were really outdated. The road you drive in on is kinda shady/creepy. It's not set in a nicest of area's. The properties out front and around them are really run down and ominous looking. Our biggest complaint that is almost unforgivable is this smell. It started out subtle when we first walked in but by then end of our stay I was begging for the people to do something about it and they gave me some lame excuse about it being a lizzard maybe crawled into the fridge......ok, well do something about it! I got handed a can of Lysol.......seriously? Which I sprayed half a freaking can in the fridge, freezer, pulled it out and sprayed behind...etc. No difference except flowery scented stink. If you are planning to be gone all day every day at Disney or other activities then maybe this place would be ok. If you want to come back to a luxury resort then you might want to pick someplace else.

I have stayed at High Point World Resort the past three years. We when vacation with the family or friends we usually stay at relatively high end all-inclusive resorts loaded with amenities. My first time at this resort, there seemed to be nothing that appealed to me. I found the units a little dated, and the resort itself is small, with only a small pool behind the check-in stattion, with a hot tub -that's it. However, when I compare the price and set-up of High Point compared to a stay at a hotel room, I see it in a different perspective. To begin with, the staff is great. I noticed that several of the desk people have been there a while, which speaks well for the place. They are always courteous and friendly. You can arrive early and get changed before check-in time, which we do when we have a mid-day tee time. Next the rooms are spacious, and have basically everything you need. We have been in both the townhomes and the one-bedroom condos. They are clean, well appointed, and comfortable. There is a flatscreen in the main room, and TVs in the bedrooms.They feature a fold out couch if needed. They are not state of the art and appointed like a $300 a night room, but compared to a hotel room cost, they exceed that value. The place is certainly convenient to everything Disney, as well as a short ride to many of the courses. We usually are out early, and go out for dinner but if we cared to we could easily have cooked in. Obviously there is no shortage of places to eat in this area. Overall, this is a great place for the price. And the people could not be nicer.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davenport, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation stay\u201d", "Author": "alvin97", "ReviewID": "UR121588670", "Content": "We stayed here on first trip to Florida 12/2011.

We had a two story unit. Upstairs there are two bedrooms; each of which has its own bath. The master bedroom has a king size bed. The other bedroom has two singles. Between the two bedrooms is a third good sized closet. Each bedroom also has its own good sized closet and a fair amaount of drawer space. The beds were comfortable, but more \"deluxe places have better mattresses. Each bedroom also had a fan. In our room, we had to keep the fan on because if we shut if off, it took ten minutes to get rid of a knocking sound. (Someone came to \"fix\" the problem, only when the person came the fan had been running and it wasn't displaying the symptom. Downstairs there is another full bath. The kitchen is reasonably sized, but I wish it had mre space for food. (For some reason, they don't provide liquid dish washing detergent and sponges, just dish washer detergent and a scrubber.) There is a combined living room, dining room. The sofa can be made into a bed. The bedding for this extra \"bedroom\" is in a good sized untility closet which also has room to hang clothes. There is a slding glass door which leads to a nicely sized screened in porch. There are a total of three televisions in the unit, the first floor has a flat screen tv. All in all, the three of us were quite comfortable in the unit. There is a swimming pool; it was pleasant - no fancy shape or anything. There were a number of bar-b-que units in close proximity to the rooms. We grilled a few nights. My biggest complaint was that there was no WiFi in the room - you had to go to their computer room. The WiFi is free, though. The staff were friendly. The place is very close to Disney and is about 20 minutes to Universal Studios and even less to Sea World.

I knew from prior reviews that it was not going to be a big glitzy resort, which was ok for us. It is an older resort with two story units and townhouses. It sits well off the main road 192, so we didn't have road noise. It was very quiet. The grounds were neatly maintained and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. There is no direct transportation from the resort to the Disney parks, but is extremely close by car. There is a pool and spa. There were two coffee and donut meet and greets at the lobby the week we were there plus a lunch BBQ one day. There are three computer terminals and a laundry onsite. The one thing that was weird in he unit was the lack of liquid dish soap. No biggy because the unit did have a dishwasher. The unit had a bedroom with king size bed and a pull out couch to sleep 4 in the living room. There was no lamp near the couch in the living room if you wanted to read; it was dark. There were ample towels in the bathroom. The one thing we didn't see and would have liked to was the armadillo which apparently runs around the property. For groceries we went to the Winn Dixie which we thought was extremely expensive. Try the Publix market instead. If you decide to eat all your meals at the Disney parks you will go broke, especially if you have kids. There are numerous coupon books in the lobby and nearby for local restaurants. We ate one night at Giordanos in the parking lot to the Winn Dixie about two blocks from the resort. Very good. We ate at a Chinese Buffet a few miles from the resort that was well past the few restaurants near the resort. It was also very good. We had a take out dinner from the Bob Evans restaurant nearby which was good. The one thing to really watch out for are the places offering to buy unused Disney day passes. Don't be tempted to buy discounted tickets from them because the tickets to the park are linked to your index finger print. Good Idea to write on your tickets whose finger they go to so you are not standing there with each person trying their finger in the scanner. Poor moms carrying the tickets for their entire families were getting a little miffed before they ever got into the park. Another thing they are trying to do is to get you to buy 5 days for the price of three days. This is a good deal if you are going to go for more than 3 days. You may find yourself exhausted after the first day with olympic sized blisters on your feet after one day and need a rest day. Be aware of getting the park hopper especially if the park closes early. Epcot closes at 9 p.m. some days and the Magic Kingdom closes at 10 p.m. If you think you want to park-hop you can upgrade at the ticket kiosks. You can upgrade any tickets for subsequent days for the lower prices, so get a couple days first and expand from there other wise you are wasting your money. For a change take the drive to Kennedy Space Center. Unless you get their very early you only have time for the basic day pass, which will get you the tour and Imax.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lucknow, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest time ever\u201d", "Author": "gazooLucknow_Canada", "ReviewID": "UR85905645", "Content": "The whole set up of this resort was outstanding.

Excellent rates, great service, and close proximity to Disney makes this place a real catch!", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kutztown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cClean, Quiet, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Pnemiller", "ReviewID": "UR11011463", "Content": "This is a very nice, clean, quiet place set back off the hustle and bustle of Route 192. We booked a one bedroom through RCI as a last minute deal and were generally pleased with High Point. We had unit 810, upstairs in the rear of the facility and it was very quiet. The unit was very clean, but the furniture was dated and there was limited lighting in the living room. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. There are few amenities--there is a swiming pool and spa and free use of one computer in the office to get on the internet. The real plus is the close proximity to Disney and the fact that you can enter Disney by using Sherberth Road, just west of High Point off Route 192. There are many dining options on 192, as well as a Publix Supermarket, 2 miles to the west.", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayne, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cIt as fine.....\u201d", "Author": "MyMuse", "ReviewID": "UR10065634", "Content": "I exchanged my week to use this resort. It was ok, there's nothing really to complain about and there was nothing glowing about it. The grounds were nice, it was easy to get to and get around. The condo was nicely decorated, though it would have been really nice to have a laundry in the unit. Does on really need 3 bathrooms?? The staff were friendly and I never got a sale spitch, which i appreciated. they even rused my check-out due to me having to leave early to get back home, cutting my vacation by 3 days. I did see bunch of staff cleaning the grounds and washing the outside of the condos.
