This facility is a series of free standing buildings located in an area that gives the appearance of a tropical island. The first building contained the office and on location restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful throughout the two days. It appears that they are renovating the buildings one at a time. The one we were assigned to appeared to have already been renovated. It was very clean new looking and the rooms were clean and comfortable.

In the evening when we came back, our neighbors in the room right of us had also arrived at the same time. I literally was hearing everything they were saying to each other. They were not even talking loud. Thanks God we did not have anyone in the room on the left side of us or anyone upstairs above us. So i was sitting there using my computer and listening to some guy talking to his children. I could hear everything he was saying just as if they were in the same room with me. Same story in the morning. They woke up and i had to wake up because they were talking and it was like they were right next to me. I have never been in a hotel with such thin walls in my life, and i have been traveling a lot. I don't think i will stay there again.

The back porch was awesome in the evening to sit out, have a beverage, and unwind. Our room was very spacious, the bed was super comfortable, and a very large flat screen was in our room. There was no charge for parking which is almost always charged from my research at the downtown hotels. The price just can't be beat in my opinion... and my wife and I were super pleased!

I thought it was a pretty fair deal for a double queen room, ocean view at Casa Marina building. Although we paid for only 1 night, we got to leave our car in their covered garage for a week without nightly charges. Plus, their free shuttle van took us to the airport in the morning to catch our flight out to Hawaii. (If you are doing the Snooze and Cruise/Fly thing, also check out Humphrey's Half Moon Bay Inn which is located virtually next door to the Island Palms Hotel, and appears to be a sister hotel to this one. Humphrey's also has a similar Snooze and Cruise deal, although the price likely will be a little higher.) The room itself was very nice with reasonably updated furnishings. And the view from the second floor window and balcony was beautiful, overlooking the marina and the hills of Point Loma. After checking in in the afternoon, I spent a good hour sitting on the balcony, enjoying the view and taking advantage of the free wi-fi. Couldn't be more pleasant. The location on Shelter Island is central to a lot of San Diego, but not really walking distance to anywhere. So, don't stay here unless you have a car to get around. For a stay at a reasonably priced, clean and well maintained hotel before a cruise or flight out, you can't really beat this place. As an added plus, the front desk clerk was very friendly and seemed eager to be of service. Seems hard to believe, but too many \"service industry\" people don't seem to like to serve. Love to patronize those who still know what service means. I can highly recommend Best Western Plus Island Palms Hotel.

I vacationed here frequently as a child in the 80s and attended college in San Diego because of my vacation experiences. I moved to Seattle four years ago and this is still my favorite place to stay when I visit. It is really is the best value out there (wait for the sales). Shelter Island really is a slice of paradise and is still nostalgic San Diego. It is centrally located but still offers the serenity and relaxation I look for on a trip. I choose this resort over Loews Coronado because of the parking, resort and internet daily fees! The Palms offers free plentiful parking, wireless internet, tennis and bike rentals. There is no daily resort fee and you have access to many waterfront activities. In addition, the food at the Blue Wave is reasonably priced. I recommend calling the resort and discussing your travel needs prior to booking online or with a 3rd party. The property has three buildings and several room options to choose from. I had booked a traditional room and was put in the Casa Del Mar. I have to say I was disappointed in the room. It would have been sufficient had I been traveling alone on business. It is very small and boutique like, my boyfriend and I were on top of each other. In addition, the fridge was located in the bathroom and we were missing our microwave. I brought my concerns to the attention of the night manager and he allowed me to upgrade to a Junior Suite (what is should have booked). I planned to work during our vacation and my spouse did not and I had family visiting one day. The Junior Suite was much more appropriate for our needs.

The breakfast offered onsite at the Blue Wave was very reasonably priced and the food was good. It is an easy drive to get to the downtown area and there is a free shuttle for the airport. The pool and pool area is very small and the pool is not heated. Capacity for the pool was stated at 60 but it would have to be SRO. Not a lot of room for loungers either. There is an old section and a new section of the hotel. The old section has been remodeled but the walls are thin. I am hard of hearing, Viet Nam, and I could hear the people in the next two rooms urinating...UGH! Each time the shower was used, the toilet was flushed, etc, we could hear it. Not what we were really looking forward to for a short get away. The room we were given was small, just about three feet longer than a standard cruise ship cabin and even though painted a light color was dark and dreary. The bathroom was nice with a nice shower, even though there was no light in the shower itself, there was one right outside the shower door. The hosekeeping staff were very good and the room was kept very clean. There was free internet, bring your own cable. The room had a large flat screen TV, a microwave and a small refrigerator. The box spring on our bed made so much noise, creaking and groaning from just sitting down, rolling over that my wife went to a CVS and bought ear plugs. We mentioned this to the front desk, thinking that maybe the frame was busted, but nothing was done. Later we talked to Chris at the front desk and he offered to move us to another room but when we tried the other room in the old section of the hotel it was just as bad so we stayed where we were. we did look at one of the rooms in the new section of the hotel and they were nicer but we forgot to check out the beds.

This was my first trip to San Diego, and what a great introduction to this beautiful city. The waterfall at the entrance is very relaxing, and the hotel staff are true examples of what customer service should be. When I opened the door to the room (at the newer Casa Marina) the first words from my son's mouth was \"Wow, how much did you pay for this?\" He's 18, we've stayed at other hotels (including the \"luxury\" Millennium Biltmore in LA) that have cost more and this is the best room I've ever had. It had a nice patio, thought there's no view because a high fence with shrubbery covers the view of the marina. Next time (and yes, I will stay there whenever I go to San Diego, there's no need to look elsewhere) I hope to get a room with a balcony to enjoy the beautiful view. Right across from the hotel is the bay, and a nice long area to walk, jog or just enjoy the weather. At checkout there was a glitch with the charge to my card (I use a debit card) and I spoke with Sean (the manager) and he immediately cleared up the problem with my bank. This hotel really is first rate, the accomodations are excellent (there is construction going on and they did have a sign posted about this, but it didn't affect us at all), there is plenty of parking, and the pool and hot tub look fantastic (and I plan to use them next time I go). The Internet connection was excellent, and they even have an Ethernet port (which I didn't use but it's nice that it's there). I was very surprised, actually, at all the connections they had built in; you can bring and hdmi or component cable and connect an external device to the TV. There are also plenty of electric sockets, very useful nowadays. The beds in Casa Marina are adjustable in their firmness/softness, though I didn't notice any difference no matter what number I set it to, they were all around quite comfortable with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was also very nice and big with pleny of storage and more towels than you can ever need. The blow dryer is a very good one with a retractable cord that is NOT attached to the wall so you can use it anywhere in the room. There is also a small safe in the room, but I didn't need to use it so I can't comment on how it works.

Ideally I prefer to book direct with hotel - but BW weren't offering anything like the discount available thro several online booking agents so I took my chances on room allocation. This hotel was as near perfection as my budget is ever going to allow in San Diego! Location 10/10 Shelter Island was an idyllic location for our purposes. With picturesque and interesting Marina on one side and far reaching Bay views on the other. So serene and peaceful. For anyone who likes to start their day with a run or a walk this place is perfect with paths pretty much right around the island, safe, pristine and precious little traffic. In addition to the water, views and boats there are plenty of other diversions - statues, fishing piers, playparks. I read somewhere their was no beach at Shelter Island - certainly compared to what else is available locally but I spotted at least two small [imported?] sandy areas. Pleasant stroll or very short drive back up to Shelter Island village for provisions or wider choice of restaurants/bars etc. - Getting there a piece of cake from the airport. Hotel offers a free shuttle but we selected to pick up our rental car first - Doh! Alamo shuttle took us right downtown - but no big deal seemed like just a five minute [evening time] drive back to Shelter Island [somewhat longer in daytime traffic]. Check In/Out 10/10 Checking in took moments. The receptionist was warm, welcoming and superbly efficient. She gave us brief clear directions re parking [free] & how to find room. I had booked a \"Traditional\" room which can come in one or two doubles. As we had our 12 yr old daughter with us I added a note to our booking requesting one with two beds if available but I know the score, so no expectations. Well she made no mention of upgrading us but I find it hard to believe the room we were allocated is their base rate room. Check out was similarly efficient. There were half a dozen folk ahead of me with two staff on reception and a third receptionist appeared. No nasty surprises on bill. And best of all - check out is not till midday. Enabling you to take your time and enjoy last morning on vacation. More hotels please take note guests really really appreciate this! Room: 10/10 Fabulous from the moment you enter. Smells fresh, Immaculate, spacious, really lovely contemporary decor, Generous Balcony. Attractive wooden shutters and full wall of windows overlooking marina just a few yards beyond. Microwave/Fridge/Coffee Machine/Iron etc. Plentiful and good coffee! Mugs & glasses. Appeared also to be a playsation or some sort of games controller supplied tho we didn't use. But it was the beds that really blew us away. We were just mocking the laminated \"boast\" sheet supplied to advise guests just how special their beds are - when we sat down on them. and almost didn't get up again to explore San Diego. Really BW no laminated sheet required. These beds scream for themselves. They even have individual bedside controls if you prefer harder or softer mattress! Bedding superb, oh so soft cotton sheets. Although all the parking spaces around our building were taken we felt as if we were only folk there - no noise from other rooms at all, save for very occasional plumbing pipe creaks that seem common to every hotel I've ever stayed in. Woken only by ducksong. If I'm nitpicking here there is only a central bedside table - so nowhere for person on outerside of beds to control their bedside light or place a glass of water etc. Nor could I find a power point near the beds. But only real issue was TV remote. They have these \"superhygienic\" new remotes - we couldn't get our TV to work at all the first night, would have reported this to reception but couldn't get our phone to work either. We were jetlagged so not a problem - we left a note for housekeeping and sure enough both phone and TV remote working on our return later next day.The remote was only partially working but enough to get us local San Diego channel. But on day 3 again couldn't get any response other than switch on/off. If it mattered to us I have no doubt at all this could have been sorted with a single call but we were just too busy enjoying the views, the spas and the beds. Bathroom 9/10 Immaculate, spacious, good water pressure and temperature control on the shower. Toilet flush virtually silent. Plentiful and plush towels and good in-room toiletries supplied. The half-depth bath was new to me. Are these common? I come from a land of more than our fair share of rainfall so I'm conscientious to generally avoid baths if I'm somewhere where water is scarce - but I confess curiosity got the better of me and I had to try it out. Perfectly fine though I had a wee bit of mopping up to do afterwards! Just a couple of comments - no glass or anywhere to place toothbrushes? Cmon! And a shaving/makeup mirror would be so helpful. Also noted no liners in the trashcan - thumbs up environmentally [tho can't be much fun for the maids?]. Pool/Spa 10/10 We visited during a particularly cold spell. But we are from Scotand escaping to California in February - nothing was going to keep us out of the pool. We spent some time in the attractively landscaped main area by bar restaurant which has a very generous and deep pool and spa But in fact we preferred the rather plainer small pool & spa closer to our building - due to the unobstructed marina views and good windscreen. Both pool and spa temperatures were absolutely spot on for the season. Nor did we have any skin reactions to cleaning chemicals - Highest commendations to whoever is maintaining these! We had a great time here. Would I return / recommend ? Absolutely! Significantly, as my review is doubtless colored by the discounted low season rate I paid, do I consider this hotel to be worth its full rack rate?

Upon arrival, I found out that we had been assigned to a ground floor unit a few steps away from the main lobby. I'm pretty bad with spatial intelligence, so it took the front desk receptionist several attempts to explain the hotel's layout to me. Apparently, all the rooms were in adjacent 2-story structures to the check-in area, separate \"condo-like\" units that are completely self-contained (i.e., there is no common hallway). I found it interesting that the units had a small, gated patio in front (see photos). Although I didn't use it myself, my neighbors spent a good deal of time outside smoking and discussing their exploits. The interior of the room itself was as expected--bed, TV, and bathroom. There was no tub (if that's what you are looking for), but the overall floor plan was sufficient for two people (maybe three). An air conditioning unit was available, but I opted to turn on the ceiling fan instead to circulate the air. There was also an in-room safe you could store stuff in by entering your own 4-digit code. I felt that the room was clean and comfortable. A microwave and mini-fridge were also available. The only issue I had was with the noise that would occasionally seep in from next door. I don't know if this was because my neighbors were unusually rowdy, their sleeping patterns diverged significantly from mine, or if the walls were flimsy, but late in the evening, and even up to 3 in the morning or thereabouts, I would hear banging sounds and laughter from time to time. When they were sitting outside in their patio area, I could hear chunks of the conversation, so perhaps they were practicing oration. Whatever the case, this was only a minor irritant. Passing traffic is barely audible, but you may hear the sounds of passersby on the way back to their rooms. The hotel itself is located on a strip of land (can't tell if it is a natural or man-made peninsula) that is accessible via the main stretch of road called Shelter Island Drive. As a result, the location is somewhat out of the way if you are looking to be in the city proper itself, but I actually enjoyed having free parking (abundant) and relative peacefulness after a full day's worth of activities. That being said, you will NOT be stranded in the middle of nowhere--everything is a reasonable drive away. Directly in front of the unit is a stretch of park where I encountered many joggers and other vacationers. You can also see the airport from that vantage point (approx. 10 min. drive). Behind the unit is a marina. There are a LOT of boats moored here (see photo). I think I've covered pretty much everything. Bottom line: if you don't mind straying a little from the city, what you have here is a nice place to recoup from your adventures and plot your next course of action. Of course, this all assumes you will be renting a car because taking a taxi from here would get ridiculously expensive really quickly. Hope this helps with your decision.

The staff are always friendly and there to help... upon check in, I found out our room wasn't ready (we checked in at 11am, check in isn't until 3).. but the girl at the counter found us a room in a different building as long as we were ok with that.

The bathrooms were recently rennovated, had a granitie stand up shower and vanity. Last time we stayed, we were in the Casa Marina building which is under going rennovations now as well. One of their pools were closed on this visit for the same reason. I don't like facing the marina, you can hear the boats at 6 am if they blow their horns, otherwise it's nice and peaceful. It's a short drive to all the attractions, including the zoo, seaworld, outlet mall, and anywhere else you might want to go. They also have boat tours in the area that take you to whale watch. All in all, another good visit and they met our needs. Housekeeping didn't come pick up our room service trays right away and some seagulls rummaged through it, leaving a big mess on the sidewalk and taking off with a napkin but when I called room service, they came right away.

We asked for a higher floor and the front desk clerk, Ajia, was very accommodating and helpful. She offered us a room on the top (3rd) floor. She also showed us a jr. suite and a full suite (extra cost for both), but we opted for the third floor room, which turned out to be a good decision. The room wasn't ready so we had dinner in the hotel's restaurant while we waited for the room to be cleaned. 90 minutes later - not ready yet. Ajia apologized and offered to buy us a drink in the bar while we waited a few more minutes. Room cleaned - checked in - great view of the marina. Definitely request a higher floor if you go. Otherwise, morning walkers and dogs doing their morning \"business\" will greet you as you awake and look out your patio windows. Some of those boat dwellers certainly need to learn how to carry plastic bags and pick up their dog's droppings. I suggest the hotel should complain to the marina management about this. We saw a few dogs being allowed to pee on the sidewalk (watch the wet trails, morning walkers) and another very lazy couple with a big black great dane and a smaller white dog just kick rocks over their dog's feces pile. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. They have adjustable mattresses so each side can be adjusted to each sleeper's desired firmness. The bright nightlight on the clock radio may be disturbing and unplugging it means you won't have an alarm clock. A folded towel laid over the light did the trick. Maybe there is a way to turn it off, but I didn't see it. The in room coffee maker is nice, but it would be nicer if there were some \"to go\" coffee cups so guests can take a cup along. Or, free coffee in the lobby would be a nice touch. Wifi was adequate and free. There is a free to use PC in the lobby also.

We had a one bedroom suite overlooking the marina at the back of the hotel. It was very comfortable and well equipped with a full kitchen and large bathroom with tub and separate shower cubicle. Our view of the marina and the thousands of boats was fabulous although the weather was not really up to sitting on the balcony! From check in to check out the staff were all first rate. Especially the bar staff who worked really hard to keep everyone happy. The happy hour menu was exceptional value and despite not really being a bar person I spent an hour or so there every night - as did many others - it was a great atmosphere and seems to be used by both locals and vacationers. The food in the restaurant is also very good and we ate there three times. We used the free bikes to cycle around the marina one morning and had great fun. Also used the laundry facilities which were cheap and fast - perfect to do your laundry whilst having a drink upstairs! The area is great and we walked to several other hotel restaurants at night and also went into the fantastic Humphreys live venue a couple of times. You do need a car as other attractions and also downtown are some distance away but it is a nice area to stroll around too and the views are to die for. The only possible thing I would mark this hotel down for is the breakfast. I booked their bed an breakfast rate which was an additional $20 dollars thinking this would be good value. However, it only includes a limited choice of hot dish and no beverage. As all the breakfast dishes are less than $10 each this does not represent value for money. I have never stayed anywhere where you have to pay extra for drinks on a bed and breakfast rate. The food was good though. Despite this I would have to give this hotel 5 stars as they really do go the extra mile to keep guests happy and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evesham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA memorable stay\u201d", "Author": "Steve R", "ReviewID": "UR120986000", "Content": "I booked the Island Palms while visiting the San Diego Convention Centre on business.

The food in the restaurant is excellent and I ate breakfast there every day, which i don't normally do in the States as it was so good and value for money. There are two pools, so for a chilling out sort of place between work sessions, with a swim inbetween the hotel was excellent. What made the trip memorable (?), regrettably for all the wrong reasons, was on my penultimate day when I had the misfortune to fall out of the shower, slipping on the bath mat. I gashed my head quite seriously and there was a lot of blood. On ringing reception, Bill the hotel manager appeared very quickly and was able to tell me that it would require some stitches. He kindly drove me to a nearby medical facility, waited for not an inconsiderable amount of time and then drove me back to the hotel, after I had been stitched up by a doctor. Much to my surprise the hotel had also picked up the medical bill!

We preferred the bay view as opposed to the marina view. The parking lot and street out front were very quiet at night. We enjoyed watching the boats and had a view of downtown San Diego.

We were able to use the computer and printer in the lobby for boarding passes. Reception was efficient, helpful and friendly. Shelter Island makes for a great location for touring San Diego and has a beautiful walking path too.

They started at 10:30 and did not stop until 6:00 a.m.!! The toilet flushed (very noisily) no less than 40 times throughout the night, bar stools screeched across the floor, doors slammed, footsteps of 10 or 12 partiers pounded up and down the outside steps right by our window and extremely loud voices carried on all night long inside and out. Where was the security in a big hotel like this?? We finally called the front desk at 2:40 a.m. and they sent someone over to check it out. However this was just a temporary solution. A few of the partiers left (with drinks in hand), but returned at 4:30 even louder. Again.. no security. Finally their lights went out at 6:00 a.m. and we slept a whole hour! Where was security all this time? And how could they not have noticed all the noise and commotion much earlier?? A quick walk around the parking lot and rooms on a regular basis is all that is required. We have been to numerous hotels and resorts in Mexico and Hawaii and situations like this would never happen.

This results in a wide range of accommodation being available, you have a choice of either a Marina view or a view of the inlet that leads to San Diego harbour. There are pros and cons of each, but we have settled for the marina side, feeling it is generally quieter (it does not overlook the car park.) The rooms are spacious, if a little warm, even with air conditioning - our room had the biggest TV ever, superb quality! The hotel is easily accessible from the airport and easy to get into the town, there are a number of places that you can eat locally, they are within walking distance. As with most BW, this hotel has free wifi, but if you don't have your own computer, there is one in reception that you can use free for 15 minutes. There are two swimming pools and hot tubs. If you just wanted to chill out, you could stay in the hotel and not explore the surrounding area, but you would miss out on a lot if you didn't visit San Diego itself with the Gas Lamp Quarter, Seaport Village, the Old Town, Balboa Park and the Midway, then within easy distance is Mission Bay, La Jolla and Coronado - there is so much to do round here, San Diego is a really great place for a vacation and you would go a long way to find a reasonably priced hotel with excellent facilities in a quiet location.

I think this year we've found the one. What makes this hotel so special and worth the not inconsiderable $$$ is its location. We opted for a marina view room and were not disappointed. We've stayed at hotels where marina views mean getting a glimpse of the ocean between two trees 100 yards away. Here you get exactly what it says on the tin. We had a perfect ground floor room with unobstructed marina view only a few feet from the water separated only by a pedestrian path screened by shrubs. Our room had outside seats and a table and it was very relaxing to unwind at the end of the evening with a few beers and a good book. The added bonus was that the fireworks from Seaworld were clearly visible each evening. The hotel is on an 'island' which means its surrounded on three sides by water. The lobby side faces a strip of parkland suitable for walkers and cyclists and offers good views of the bay and any aircraft carriers in port. The room itself was very clean and well maintained. Beds were very comfortable and the bathroom modern with a spacious shower. Reception staff were friendly. Breakfast was the only disappointment. Not so much the food but rather the poor service. There is nothing more annoying that seeing people arrive for breakfast 15 minutes after you've sat down and they are served first and finished before we even got our food. They got what I'd regard as normal service whereas our server was attrocious. The service the following day was slightly better but not fantsastic given the prices. The food was fine and the location, overlooking the marina, is excellent and refreshing. The hotel is conveniently located but will require a car to get the most out of. Parking is plentiful although given the layout of the hotel it is unlikely to be parked outside of your room. If looking for something to do check out the Midway aircraft carrier museum. If visiting the museum make sure to go early in the day as its at least 4 hours of a tour and it closes at 5.30. The tour of the bridge may close even earlier. A useful tip if travelling from Anaheim is to check out any of the attraction booklets in the hotel rooms in Anaheim. A book in our room contained cut-out coupons that allowed children to get in free which was far more valuable to us than a dollar or two off general admission. Security at the hotel was very prominent with a security guard passing our room regularly as I downed the beers!

His first time and my 4th to this wonderful city. Its been over 10 years since I was here and when I booked this hotel online I had no idea where it was relative to tourist attractions and the airport.-important factors since we were here for only 3 full days. This hotel is close to the airport, the zoo, Midway Ship Museum, Sea World and downtown. It's close, yet far away, because Shelter Island is a mariner's enclave that is at least 5 miles from shops, restaurants and night life. There were a cluster of restaurants within a 5 minute drive of the hotel. All of the retail and restaurants cater to mariners because this is the home of America's cup, ergo yacht clubs, marine shops, seafood restaurants and dive shops. The restaurant menus we looked at were above average price range and not within my budget, ($15-20 per person for dinner). Exceptions were Miguel's on Shelter Island Dr. which offers wonderful Mexican fare and is highly recommended. Great atmosphere, menu, service and prices. Our room at this hotel was very nice. It was spacious, clean, and had a large bathroom with a shower, no bath. The room included free WiFi and I appreciated the plug in bar on the desk for all of our laptops and cell phone chargers. The room had a mini fridge, microwave and coffee pot. There are two pools. The one closest to our room and the lobby had a hot tub as well. Towels and restrooms were poolside. Drinks and light meals were offered by servers that made the rounds for guests lounging on the pool deck. There is a gym but its small and the equipment is not great. Being the gym rat that looks for an easy out to exercising I took one look and decided I would rather walk along the sea wall or paddle in the pool. The room was fairly quiet. The plumbing backed up one night and we were without water-sink, shower and toilet-for an entire evening. The staff were extremely apologetic and gave me a key to use the marina bathroom and shower. At check out I was given a refund for our breakfasts that we had charged to our room for the inconvenience. The breakfast menu at the hotel was excellent, restaurant service was above average and the food was delicious. One of the best things about this location, and I did not discover this until we arrived, was its proximity to Humphrey's Bar and Grill. This hotel/restaurant has a series of live summer concerts with some really good headliners. I saw Keb 'Mo the last night of our stay. It was a 10 minute walk from our hotel.

The bonus of this location is its proximity to the airport, which is handy as we never know what the traffic situation is anywhere in southern California. We are upgraded to an Island Palms one-bedroom suite with kitchen facing the bay, from a Del Mar junior suite. Our room is double the size of the guestrooms on 1st floor, therefore I think those guestrooms are pretty small. The bay view is as good as the marina view, but as the bay facing units also face the car park, some noise cannot be avoided esp. in the morning. During night time, it is okay. For our unit, the walls are actually stucco-like, which in my opinion is not very upscale. But all in all, the other things like bed comfort, cleanliness and shower pressure, are all adequate. The pool area at the main building is not crowded and a pool will guarantee some fun for the kids, something that most downtown hotels do not have.

We had a great view of the water, BUT the sun rose over the water and woke us up bright and early! UGH!

Our room was had kind of a funky decor. We had a king bed and a couple of chairs in our room. Along the wall opposite the bed there was this long dresser-type thing that held the TV on top, the refrigerator & microwave inside, and drawers for clothes. This piece of furniture was pretty worn looking. The bathroom had a toilet, nice long countertop with a sink, and a shower stall. I\u2019m not against only having a shower, but this shower was rather dark (no lights in or near the shower) and didn\u2019t really have a place to store all of our shower goodies (shampoo, shower gels, face wash, etc. from home). The heat/ac came from an in-wall unit. Parking was close, in front of our room or very close by. We had a little gate into an area outside of our room where we entered.

Our room 670 was on the top floor at the end of Villa Marina, the building farthest from the reception area, near the tennis courts. It was easy to move suitcases from the parking spaces to the room through an extra-large elevator. Location The location is on Shelter Island only about 15 minutes from downtown and less than 10 minutes from the airport. On one side of the string of hotel buildings, there is a view of the road, parking lot, and harbor. On the other side, there is a view of the marina and the hills. We chose the marina view because we enjoy watching water birds and sailboats. We didn't eat at the restaurant because there are so many good restaurants nearby. We had a good lunch at the Brigantine Restaurant at Shelter Island Drive. Parking As you face the office, there are two loading and unloading parking places to the right side. When you check in, they provide a parking pass for the duration of your stay. At midnight it was a challenge to find an empty parking space in the complex, but eventually we found a place. Service We rarely saw the staff, but when we did, they were helpful. One of the maids offered to help bring our suitcases to the car. Check-in and check-out were fast and easy. At the office, they held our suitcases until our room was ready because we arrived earlier than the 4 p.m. check-in. Quiet enjoyment There was no neighbor noise, but there were more than usual family hall-caucuses during daylight hours. Maybe sailing families need to talk loud enough to be heard above the wind.

Though the walls/ceiling are a bit thin if you`re a light sleeper. There are 2 hot tubs which were great after many long hours walking all day, and a Spa (which I never took part). There are 2 salt water pools, the one near my room was only 3ft deep, but the one up near the Bar/Restaurant is 81/2 feet deep in parts, which is rare. *However some people may feel a little self conscious sun bathing or swimming around this pool as diners on the outside patio are constantly looking down on you. My only complaints - the menu though reasonably priced has a lot of fish dishes and I`m not a fan. I wish there were more meat selections as a $22 steak every night got a little boring. Also, I was here a week but didn`t rent a car, you`ll probably need one. I relied on the Hotel's FREE shuttle to get me to and from the airport, and as I was in town for a convention, that venue provided FREE transportation to and from the event each day. But there is not much within walking distance on Shelter Island except shops catering to The Marina/Yacht crowd. There is a nice walkway that you can use to walk/jog around most of the island however with a coastal view. My only real compliant is that on my first night here I called the front desk and set up a Wake Up Call for the next morning but it never came. I eventually woke up an hour later on my own. I phoned the front desk and complained because if this had been the day I was leaving I could have missed my flight - as a consolation they provided me with a FREE breakfast. * Other than the fact that this Hotel and every other in San Diego jacks their prices (and perhaps their food costs as well) from Jul 21-24 for The Comic Convention.

This hotel has over 500 reviews, so I will try to make my review organized and informative. We stayed here for 5 days in July on vacation. We had a total of 11 people in our family traveling, so we all ended up in 2 different buildings (2 rooms in the Island Palms & 2 rooms in the Casa Marina). One building would have been nice, but they didn't have rooms all together. (Large families/groups: book earlier than 2 months for busy times!) Rooms: The rooms in the Casa Marina were all indoors, and the rooms at the Island Palms opened straight to the outdoors. There is a 3rd building (Casa del Mar) in between, but to walk from the Casa Marina to the Palms was only like a 5 minute walk and nice if you walk by the marina! We were all right by the marina, so we had a nice view of the water and different boats. Across the street from the hotel, you can go walking by the ocean. All of our rooms were clean, but the room service fell a little short replenishing coffee and coffee cups. We did leave a little tip each day and asked for extra towels, which we got plenty of! You do have a nice selection of TV channels (at least 60). Location: Great location and no problem with noise! We were about 10 minutes away from Mission Beach, which was quite crowded. I was kind of glad we didn't choose a hotel there, because I think there was a higher chance of noise near our rooms. We were 45 minutes from Legoland, about 1.5 hours from Disneyland, and only about 15 minutes from Sea World and the San Diego Zoo, and 5-10 minutes from USS Midway and Gaslamp District. Our location made it very easy to access the interstate and main roads to these places. We were only 1-2 miles from main drugstores and larger grocery stores. Also if you like doughnuts, which all in our family do, a Winchell's was right down the street and around the corner. Good on-the-go breakfast ! Parking: free for all guests, but it seemed difficult to find a space in the evenings. Parking was also available across the street. Rate: We got a reasonable rate, an average of $140/night. We rented out a room with a kitchenette, a couple doubles with queen beds, and a double with twin beds, but that $140/night was an average of all rooms. I think this was a CostCo special. Check out the hotel's actual website: http://www.islandpalms.com/san-diego-hotels/index.cfm for prices as well.

While we waited for them to make sure our room was ready, we looked around a little. The hotel is made up of three unique buildings although we only saw two of them. The building that includes the main lobby is very tropical, lush, and green and includes a nice tropical-style swimming pool. It also includes the on-site restaurant (we didn't try) that overlooks the pool. The atmosphere seemed a bit livelier than the Casa del Mar building where we stayed. The Casa del Mar building is more of a Mediterranean theme and quite beautiful. The pool is a bit smaller than the pool in the main building and seemed much quieter except for the 5 or 6 kids enjoying it. The view of the marina was very peaceful. The rooms are clean and the d\u00e9cor is fairly typical for a Best Western. We noticed that the room we got was a bit more spacious than we had anticipated and there was ample sink counter space for our belongings as well as another counter/bar. The bed was comfortable and clean. The housekeeping staff was nice and always had a smile on their faces. I have to think hard to complain about something.

Our room was about the furthest from the pools and main lobby that they offered, but we still did not find the walk too bad. The hotel offers two pools areas and both are really beautiful with views of the marina and water. My only complaint was that the hot tubs were too hot to actually enjoy. I love heat and hot water and was still only able to enjoy it for about 2-3 minutes at a time before it got too hot and my boyfriend found it painful. Would have loved to take a swim in the pools but it was pretty cold and cloudy during out visit. One of the pools also offered a gas fireplace, but you need to call the front desk and ask for it to be turned on. A suggestion to the hotel would be to put out a little sign with instructions to call and the number - as we spent awhile trying to figure out how to turn it on ourselves. The hotel is out on a little island so you do have to take a short walk over the bridge to the mainland to get to other restaurants and it is about a 10 minute drive to get to places like Old Town and the Maritime museum.

At the restaurant, the ends of the roof beams in the outdoor section have rotted and appear ready to expose patrons to falling debris. The carpet in my room was worn and stained and the walls in the hallways need painting attention. In addition on the second day of our trip we were awoke by an obnoxiously loud child next door at 7:00 AM. The typical noise of a young child is to be expected during travel and usually its brief in nature however this child was loud and unsettling for nearly 2 hours ending any chance of our continuing to rest comfortably. This noise was obviously NOT from pain or distress, this was the increasingly common screaming and carrying on of a spoiled, unmannerly and \"out -of- control\" child. This is NOT the environment or the place to teach a child proper manners, do a practice run in Motel 6 perhaps! I mention this noise issue only because we were annoyed by the excessive noise at the Best Western resort in Friday Harbor the prior weekend (see my previous review) as well and this is rapidly appearing to be a trend ! With due consideration and thought, I have good incentive not to spend any more of my travel money with Best Western Resorts. They proved to me to be treating their RESORT properties little better than a roadside hotel.... Their reasonable if all you need is a bed to rest for a short time while on the road. Best Western has obviously purchased properties in resort locations however they need to learn that we who have money for resort travel expect reasonable control and accommodation for the additional money !

The hotel is a little out of the way for some I suppose, but we were a quick jaunt on surface streets for anything we wanted to see/do (seaworld/downtown), plus shelter island has a very laid back and detached vibe which was refreshing. The main lobby is beautiful with a waterfall and sort of tropical jungle feel (without being overdone). The front desk staff was prompt, courteous and just ... pleasant. We stayed in the Casa del Mar building on the second floor with a 'water view'. For our room this included both the marina and the bay, depending on which group of windows or balcony you ventured onto. Needless to say, the water lapping in the marina was a much needed reprieve from the day to day. The building was clean and spacious, as was the room. We had a comfortable, soft bed with clean linens, a large flat panel tv, comfortable chairs and a mini fridge. The shower, as has been mentioned, was a little dark, but not worse than many hotels and definately not like a \"cave\" as some have suggested. The pool was clean and very comfortable, and the spa has very powerful jets! There is a gas fireplace on the pooldeck and we watched the Seaworld fireworks from there. I called regarding room service and, despite a relatively late hour, they happily obliged my special requests. We visited the restaurant for breakfast and were happy to have a marina view while we enjoyed what I dare say is the best belgian waffle with fresh berries I have had in recent memory.

If you are looking to be in the heart anything \"San Diego\" other than the marina, this hotel may not be for you. I was not at all impressed with this location or the layout of the hotel. The rates at this hotel seem to swing quite a bit, but when we were here there was an average deal. I was here for a conference and did not have a choice of hotel. I feel that there are much better options in Old Town if your wanting to stay on a similar budget but still be able to get to all the sights. (See my review of Holiday Inn Express Old Town) The lobby area is tiny and includes a check in desk, tiny exercise room, small bar area, and a restaurant. One of the two pools is adjacent to the lobby. One note to concern with this hotel.....though the rooms have an interior corridor, all first floor rooms look out on the marina or across the parking lot to the water front. Also, this hotel is a series of buildings, stretched out over about a 1/4 mile. You have to go outside to get from most of the rooms to the main lobby building. It was consistently a 10 minute walk from my building to the meeting rooms. These first floor rooms are not very secure in my opinion as there is not anything blocking out access to your patio. Between the scattered buildings, dark walkways, and first floor rooms I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is security conscious. There also appears to be several people living in \"campers\" across the street from the hotel. There are not many good dining choices in walking distance. No convenience stores, and no fast dining options. You absolutely need a car to be happy at this location. Check in was efficient and friendly. They would not accommodate my request for a king bed, but they do have two queen beds in the double rooms. The rooms are of nice size, acceptable size and yet nicely equipped. Oddly, the bathroom door has an auto closer so it does not interfere with the front door...I had to cram a shampoo bottle in the door so as to let the bathroom vent when taking a shower.. Poor layout! Room decoration is warm and inviting and seemed to have been recently remodeled. The beds are sleep number, which I am not a fan of but they were good beds otherwise. The rooms have nice desk space, internet for (I don\u2019t know if there is a fee...they gave us access codes as part of our group package). They have nice HDTV's and an acceptable number of channels. Rooms have microwaves and fridges in them. The great thing about this location is that it is surrounded by water and you can get some nice but short runs in. Climate Control is acceptable and you can leave the blower on for white noise and still have the AC or Heat running. Their business center consists of one pc and printer in the lobby. They have two acceptable pools, both overlooking the marina. There is no breakfast included in the room rate, which for a Best Western is hit or miss. The food in the restaurant was acceptable given you were basically a captive audience. If you can get away, absolutely do so! The banquet food was acceptable but uninspired. The gym is way too small and unacceptable. Fortunately I went out running in the beautiful weather instead. Unless I did not have a choice, or got a killer deal, this would not be my choice at all, mainly because of the remote location (though easy driving distance to everything) and the stretched out layout of the facility.

Staff was awesome, the restaurant was very good and exercise room adequate for my needs. Shelter Island is a wonderful off the beaten track kind of place to stay and my son and I loved it. I will tell you though that you are right across the bay from North Island Naval Air Station (where my sons are stationed) and I happened to be there a week before my sons ship was deploying so there were lots of preparations being made for that. Which meant an awesome view of several Naval ships passing through the causeway there across the hotel. Great view of all the ships! There were sounds of helicopters for several days and for most of the day. I am used to it as you can here jets and helicopters around most of San Diego, but Shelter Island faces the runways and such on the base so you heard them constantly except not at night while sleeping. Just a not in case someone would be disturbed by all the activity. It was just an all around nice experience and I would definitely come back to stay!", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location -beds so lala\u201d", "Author": "Wolrdwide", "ReviewID": "UR94868937", "Content": "Highly recommend the place as it combines being close to the water with great views over San Diego downtown and the harbor, whilst being abt 10 min drive from the city center.

We also were going to Sea World and visit friends in Carlsbad with our almost 3 year old and 6 1/2 year old. We stayed at Island Palms for a week. Our room was facing the smaller pool and a marina. It was wonderful!! In some pictures they make the room look bigger than it really is. This was reverse. I couldn't believe how big the room was!! The bottom floor had a living room with tv/office work space for my husband. The couch was a pull out, but we didn't need it. A full bath too, so downstairs could be for a family or part of a family. Then there was a table near the kitchen. The kitchen had a small fridge, so we didn't get much things that needed to be cold. We got some cereal and fruit for breakfast in the room. There was a door that opened to the back view/pool area. Outside the door was a small table. So some mornings we would have the door open for air, or even sit outside. The kids would run around out in the grassy area or watch bugs on the cement. The pool was about 20 steps from our door. It was great! It was small, heated, and perfect. You could see the fireworks at Sea World every night. The upstairs to the room you have to go up a spiral staircase. There is another door to the upper floor of the hotel, but there isn't an elevator either. When upstairs you can shut the door so that no wandering kids would fall down the stairs at night. There is a full bath in the hallway. One room has a king with window, AC, dresser, tv. The other has the same, then a door to the upstairs balcony, and a full bath. The beds were very comfortable!! The AC on and the area of town, it was very quiet at night. We had room service 2 mornings for hot eggs, meat. Food was great. We never ate in their restaurant. The main pool looked fun as they have curbside service, but our kids thought the water was colder there. While this is in Point Loma, it's a little off the beaten path, but not too far. There is a Vons nearby, banks, and Starbucks. We had a routine of getting coffee, then getting to our theme park. A fun family restaurant very close by is Corvette Diner. Has an arcade, full bar, music. We went the first night and meant to get back.

Scrappy neighborhoods, near a typical big road lined with fast food joints (Rosecrans) and thats it. I kicked myself for not staying downtown at 4 star Hilton or Indigo downtown. Sure you gotta pay for parking but at least you get some LIFE around you. Endless restaurants are downtown in walking distance, promenade, museums, movie theatres, cruise ships, clubs, Aircraft carrier, Little Italy, etc. This hotel is located on the 'darks side of the moon' and nothing happening there are anywhere near! In this hotel **You have to drive just to get anything worthwhile**. price should have been half. THE ROOMS- are just like a Hampton Inn; Boring and unimaginative. The hotel site photos sell the 'belle of the ball' rooms with super photography. 90% of the rest arent like that when you are in them. I saw several in two different buildings as I walked around hoping there was better than what I got (casa del mar section). Older section was just as boring and basic. If you can score a hotel downtown 4 star with Hotwire for $90 like I saw, do it. Then you are right in the mix.

In fact, we had to walk from the parking lot, in the grass on stepping stones to get to the room on the back of the building. We did not even go in the room, as the safety issue with two small children was too great. I requested a different room, which they provided at the opposite end of the complex. Parking was good, room was small, the front door opened about an inch or two from the foot of one of the beds. It was a long evening, as my toddler loved playing w/the blinds which opened up right to the parking lot and could easily open the deadbolt on the door, which opened directly to the parking lot. Again, a safety and privacy issue for us. The room was partially renovated (bathroom only) a bug crawled out of the shower mat, carpet was worn, linens worn, but the TV was brand new. Wonderful view though, nice patio, great little walking path and beach area across the street, and the hot tub was not bad. The pool, although heated was too cool this time of year.

We had our GPS system stolen out of the car two weeks earlier and when I told them that they insisted on providing us with instructions and maps from Map Quest wherever we were going. There is a small internet desk for guests, but when this was in use it was much faster for them to provide us with the instructions. We had a king size waterview room in Casa del Mar. A very nice sized room with all amenities: fridge, coffeemaker, microwave and a balcony. Directly outside Casa del Mar is a swimming pool with hottub, and when we were there in mid-September it was not at all busy. Great for relaxation after a day sightseeing. I have seen on another posting that they offer drinks and meal service at this pool. Maybe we were too late in the season for that because we didn't see this service all 3 times we were at the pool, but it was unimportant for us anyway. One morning there were no pool towels available but once we asked for them they were brought out quickly. The only complaint we have is that our neighbors would order room service in the evening, and the used plates were still outside their room next morning at 8 am. Unfortunately they were into seafood and the plates smelt pretty awful next morning. But other than, everything was fine. We ate both breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant.

Although we were a bit skeptical to stay at a Best Western (we usually stay at Hyatt's or Hiltons), we were absolutely blown away when we arrived at this property. The hotel is located on Shelter Island, a small peninsula located in between a private marina and the beautiful San Diego bay. It's just minutes away from pretty much every landmark and point of interest in San Diego. The location is convenient enough to get anywhere in about 10-20 minutes, but is also sheltered and out of the way of all the big city noises and distractions. The hotel was very nice and clean. The overall property has a secluded Hawaii theme, which makes it all the more relaxing. There are two pools, both which were kept clean and warm. There is also a fitness center, although it is a little small, and I would probably recommend taking a jog along the bayside instead of using the fitness center. We stayed in the Casa Marina building. We were told it was brand new, and it most certainly was. We got a room with two queens and a rollaway mattress, and it was still spacious enough for the four of us. The room was clean and was always stocked with amenities. The staff, however, is this hotel's greatest asset. Everyone was very friendly and always asked us if there was anything we needed or wanted. The housekeepers always gave us everything we requested. The front desk was especially awesome. They were very helpful and seemed to be very interested in making us happy and comfortable. John pretty much acted as our personal concierge by recommending restaurants, telling us which sites and places to visit, and always arranging transportation for us.

Our room was $126 per night and since we didn't plan to spend much time in it was a good value for a place to sleep. Across from the hotel is a walking path which a play ground, fishing pier, numerous bronze sculptures and a nice (small) beach with fire pits. There are a couple of nice bars and restaurants nearby. Humphrey's Back Stage Lounge - great live music and reasonable prices. Small so get there early and stay for a few hours to enjoy the music and dancing - short walk from the Island Palms. Also a short drive from the hotel we found a restaurant called Fiddler's Green (steak and seafood). See my separate review of this restaurant. Go there - you won't be disappointed. Bottom line is nice hotel, good value, and super location.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cWe'll Definitely Return! In Fact, We Wish We Were Still There!\u201d", "Author": "BusterBee", "ReviewID": "UR61344218", "Content": "At check-in the staff was courteous, helpful, and friendly and things only got better from there... The location is fantastic. Shelter Island is convenient to downtown/Gaslamp, Point Loma, and main thoroughfares and freeways. Plus, it offers great views! We stayed in one of the hotel's new buildings and our room overlooked the beautiful Kona Marina and Point Loma homes in the distance. Standing on the terrace taking in the salt water was such a great way to start the day! Our room was brand new, so it was fabulously fresh and nice with a large flat screen TV, comfortable beds and sheets, and a spacious bathroom. I've stayed in many nice resort hotels in the Loews and W chains and this room certainly rivaled those, it felt like a 4, maybe even 4 1/2 star room. I didn't look inside any of the rooms in the older parts of the hotel, but from the outside, they looked to be nice. The hotel is laid out like a resort with a number of out-buildings, tennis courts, a lounge, a nice fitness facility, walking paths, and two pools. One of the pools is quieter and smaller and was used by mostly adults and the other pool was more lively and was frequented by families and those who wanted to order drinks poolside. We tried both pools, both were heated, sparkling clean, and the pool areas were nicely laid out. I prefered the quieter, smaller pool, since I enjoy sunning and didn't bring kids. One of the few (and I had hardly any) complaints about my stay was that a couple of times kids were running around the smaller pool, which was normally very quiet, and I had wished they'd head over to the more family friendly pool. Perhaps the Island Palms would considering making the smaller pool an 18 and over spot and the larger pool all ages? Also, the hottubs were quite crowded at night. Understandable for a busy, sought after hotel, but adding additional hottubs or larger ones might be a good investment for the future. We enjoyed the free parking and never had difficulty finding a space. Hotel staff let us know that sometimes parking is tight at night, but that even in that case, the port owned parking lots across the street are free and open for overnight parking. Perfect ,since renting a car is a must if you want to see many parts of San Diego during your stay, it's not really a public transit accessible city. We ate at some nearby fish houses and greasy spoon breakfast joints, it was great, definitely felt there is a Shelter Island sense of community combining weekend boaters and those who work in the boat trades. We also ate lunch at the hotel restaurant and had drinks and appetizers at the lounge. The service and quality were good but not outstanding. The convenience was fantastic. I believe a continental breakfast was offered to guests as well, but we didn't take advantage. As I said, our room was very comfortable, but the walls were not particularly thick. One morning we were awoken by loud people at the marina and in the hotel hallway. It was spring break at many schools the week we stayed, so maybe that accounted for some of the activity? It was, however, very quiet at night, we were able to sleep soundly. We were also very impressed by the security presence. We frequently saw friendly and courteous (but not imposing) security guards walking the grounds, so I'm confident that if there had been excessive night time noise, the problem would have been dealt with. In terms of activities, it's wonderful that Shelter Island is convenient to a number of San Diego tourist attractions (at least by car), but there were also activities right there on the island. The beach park run by the port authority had sculptures and other public works of art, historic markers, a great view of Coronado Island, and good sitting beaches and picnic areas. There was a local arts market on Saturday and Sunday as well. The hotel offered free beach cruiser rentals, which we didn't have time to take advantage of, but they would have been great for exploring the island. We did see the beach cruises however, and they were brand new, high-end bicycles. For the sake of writing a fully comprehensive review, one of the hotel vending machines did eat our money, but minus that kind of minutae and the couple other small items I mentioned above, it was darn close to a perfect stay! All that for incredibily reasonable rates! We were certainly impressed and would recommend this hotel to anyone--couples, singles, kids, old, young, you name it, this place has wide appeal.

The manager was very polite and offered us lunch to compensate for the 3 poor nights sleep, but we already had plans and the harbor view restaurant was closed for renovations (so we kept our reservation on Coronado instead).

Parking was convenient, right outside the building and doorways. The room was above average, as it was new with up scale furniture, nice light fixtures, plantation shutters, and a nice balcony, This is a two story building, but without an elevator, but does have a lovely lobby and a small swimming pool, spa, outdoor fireplace and great view of the marina. Much like one would expect at a five star hotel, only with a smaller resort feel. We felt safe. One could check out bikes, walk the boardwalk around the island. Nearby were various restaurants, such as The Brigantine. The Shelter Island and Point Loma section is very nice, older but well kept.

Frequent passage of huge cruise ships and naval vessels is very common. The Casa del Mar junior suite was superb, with a large balcony, but a word of caution - if you book through one of the sites such as Expedia or Travelocity, you might find that your \"waterview\" room actually faces the wall of another building, and you can see a tiny bit of water only if you are standing at your window or out on your balcony. Balconies in the Island Palms section of the hotel all appeared small, and seemed to face mostly sideways toward the adjoining buildings. The Casa Marina section was still under construction during our stay, but looked as though it would be quite similar to the Casa del Mar section for views, balconies, etc. The restaurant on site at the hotel was pleasant, with views out over the marina, and very nice food. All the staff with whom we had contact in any section of the hotel were exceptionally pleasant. If it fits into your plans, try breakfast or lunch at the Bali Hai Restaurant at the far end of Shelter Island, and Sunday brunch at Tom Ham's Lighthouse Restaurant on neighboring Harbor Island is out of this world, and simply not to be missed - but make reservations early, it's very popular!", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palmer, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, new, clean rooms and gorgeous views!\u201d", "Author": "akmom61", "ReviewID": "UR37965463", "Content": "First of all...let me say that we stayed at the brand new building that is called Casa Marina, it's also the furthest building from the lobby. I encourage you to stay in this one or the Casa Del Mar building, next door with the mini suites. The minute we walked in our building, it smelled new and so clean! The room was large and airy and had a huge flat screen tv, a balcony overlooking the marina, 2 cozy queen beds, a large desk that the tv sat on and housed a small microwave and refrigerator and a separate area with chairs and small table by the balcony. The bathroom was large and had all the modern amenities. The only thing the bathroom lacked (in my opinion) was a fan. We were very impressed with the overall experience.... On the other hand, my first impression of the lobby was kind of small, dark and musty smelling. The shuttle driver that picked us up from the airport, Kyle, was friendly and helpful and knowledgable about the area and had great suggestions. We got picked up from the downtown Amtrak station. When we got to the hotel, since we were there earlier than the normal ck in time of 4p, we were told that our rooms weren't ready yet, so we decided to have lunch in the onsite restaurant, the Blue Wave. It was pretty good for a hotel restaurant. We sat outdoors in the patio area under tables with umbrellas, which helped to suggest an island feel. The windows looking out at the marina could have been a little cleaner (had smudges) but the food was good (my husband and daughter had the blackened Mahi Mahi, I had the fish tacos and my son had the french dip sandwich). After we were done, one of our rooms was ready, so we proceeded to head down. Warning: if you have a lot of luggage, ask them if they could drive you with the little carts, it's quite a walk, especially if you've been hoofing it around Disneyland for 5 days like we just did! We had 2 rooms there, one for our teenagers (which was a godsend!) and ours overlooked the marina. I already described the room above. Overall: Very nice property~relaxing, tiki torches at night, little babbling \"waterfall\" in lobby, nice staff. Right next door is Humphreys on the Bay which also has outdoor concerts. While we were there, Jackson Browne played one night and then America. Good location if you have a car. A little far to walk to restaurants that are \"nearby\" but about 15-20 minutes will get you there. We were only there for 2.5 days, so it was ok for us. We didnt rent a car, but did the Old Town trolley tour one day, and they will pick you up and drop you off right outside the hotel, so it worked out nicely. I highly recommend it. We loved Coronado Island/the Hotel Del/and the beach was excellent! The other times we left we took a cab, it was about $20 one way to downtown (went shopping at Horton Plaza with the teens the first day) and then about the same to get to Seaworld the following day. Not sure if we would stay there again, not hesitating because of any bad experience, just like to try new hotels. I would have liked to use the pools, hot tub, bikes and just relax more at the property, we did the Old Town tour one day and then Seaworld the next and then we left, so If you are going to go, please use and enjoy the property more than we did! If you can, try and stay at the new building!

Shelter island is an artificial peninsula, planted with palmtrees, with views on one side to the Marina and on the other side on San Diego Bay and the skyline of Downtown San Diego. Never again would I choose a hotel on Shelter island or in Pacific Beach, since these locations suffer from the same fog problem as San Francisco. Temperature was very agreeable, so we took breakfast and dinner always on the hotel terrace, but always under a grey sky and never in the sun. Returning from excursions by 4pm, we never could spend a time by the pool, since there was no more sun. My advice: take a hotel by the water in Downtown, where there's sun in the morning and evening. But I have to admit that the location of the hotel is ideal to get by car to SeaWorld, Downtown, Balboa Park or the airport. But the location was not the biggest minus point of our 4 nights stay (if I hadn't paid in advance, I wouln't even have spent one night in this establishment!). Upon arrival we didn't get the Marina View we reserved and paid for to our travel agent in Belgium and that was also mentioned on our voucher.. Instead we got room 158 on the ground floor with a view on... the cars parked 2 meters in front of the room door (officially it is called Bay View, which may be true on the 2nd floor). On top of that, it appeared to be the smallest, darkest, ugliest room of our 3 weeks trip through the Southwest, with a minimum of amenities, yet the second highest price of all hotels we stayed in...Only the bathroom and the shower look fine, but are scarcely lit. Walls and ceiling are probably wood or cardboard (earplugs are absolutely necessary) and the flush of the toilets in other rooms makes a terrible noise. We leave the luggage in our car and return immediately to the Front Desk. Receptionist Kris listens carefully to our arguments and promises to have immediately a word with the manager. He promises to call me in my room within 15 minutes, but I never get a call. I therefore return frequently to the Front Desk, but it is very busy from lots of arriving guests. Finally I am told that no better room is available for that night, but that the next morning a Marina View could probably be found.(although he pretended that my travel agent had booked a Bay View). Meanwhile I contacted my travel agent by phone, mail and message. I got his absolute confirmation that a Marina View had been reserved. Even before breakfast the next morning, I return to the Front Desk, where receptionist Danny knows about our problem. He advices to pack all our luggage and to go peacefully on excursion. By our return we would probably find our luggage already in a Marina View. While visiting SeaWorld, I get a phone call from Belgium that my travel agent had also been in contact with Danny. Upon our return in the afternoon, nothing has changed and our luggage stands still in room 158. Receptionist Kris pretends that the manager is still working on it (does this hotel really have a manager???) and advices me to wait \"a few minutes\" in the lobby. After 90 minutes of patience and still no news, we decide to return to our room, to unpack luggage, take a shower and give up all hope for a better room. The next two days I didn't take the trouble to return to the Front Desk, but neither did they ever recontact me on our problem. I can easily understand that mistakes are made by a travel agent (which was definitely not the case), that a hotel is sold out or can not offer alternatives, but I prefer that they tell immediately that no solution is possible, rather than letting one believe and keeping one for two days on a string with false promises. After my return to Belgium, my travel agent could prove that she absolutely had reserved through Galileo a Marina View. Complaints with the hotel management resulted in nothing, but Best Western-management accepted to reimburse 50% of the room price as compensation for this bad room and the miserable hotel service. Other bad experiences with our room: earplugs are absolutely necessary when staying on the groundfloor. Impossible to retain water in the lavabo (it runs continuously away). A white fibre of a towel that fell in the shower lies still on the same place after 3 days. The glass shower door opens towards the bathroom, which results - after showering - in water pools on the floor. When i tried to avoid this by cleaning the underside of the shower door with a little washcloth, it turns black from moisture (picture available). Only plus points of the hotel: the nice swimming pool with a little bar that serves succulent cocktails and the restaurant where we had 4 wonderful dinners (friendly female service - perfect quality of food and wines - very reasonable prices). \uf02dOur conclusion: our worst hotel experience in 9 weeks of travel (in 3 successive summers) through the Southwest.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely a Keeper, Incredible Views, Incredible Location, Nice Amenities, Fantistic Family Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SanDieg0Trip", "ReviewID": "UR37317883", "Content": "Let me preface my comments by first saying I am very picky when it comes to hotels. This property is actually the combination of two hotels. Casa del Mar is seemingly the newer hotel of the two. I believe Casa del Mar is mostly the suites. We did not stay in Casa del Mar, we stayed in the Island Palms, adjacent property. I believe both hotels operate under the name of Island Palms Best Western. I would stay here again but in Casa del Mar. The Island Palms facility itself is older, beautiful with its mature trees and shade however our room smelled moldy, there were ants in the room, the beds are quite small and very low. The rooms were tight, a little dark. I believe these comments were comments others have written as well so no real surprises. Having said that it is just a room to sleep in and overall it was clean, I found it acceptable, but just above my cutoff line of what is 'clean' for a hotel. I walked through Casa del Mar just to check it out, it is definitely much cleaner, brighter, larger rooms, seemingly much newer, etc. Oddly enough I believe the prices are comparable which I don't understand since Casa del Mar seemed at least 2 steps above the standard Island Palms rooms. I would recommned you stay in Cas del Mar. The LOCATION of this property is AMAZING. It is incredible with just steps to a small beach on the marina, access to both pools at either hotel, steps to rent a kayak or go fishing, free bike riding. We traveled to San Diego for a wedding, our friends who booked at other hotels more out of town to save money were quite jealous. They paid as much as us or more and didn't get half the hotel and sacrificed location. I would go so far to say that if you are there with your family you could almost never have to get in the car and go anywhere else, something for everyone right there. The rates were incredibly low for such a tremendous location, what a steal! Parking is completely FREE, did I mention FREE? Internet is completely FREE (now that is definitely not found often). There is an on-site washer/dryer you can use for a nominal cost of like $1.00 per load, fabulous if you there with family like we were. Bikes are complimentary at the hotel. Kayking just across the street is something like $20 per 2 hours, another great steal. The two pools are great, the Island Palms with more ambience and an outdoor bar, Casa del mar more modern with a nice fireplace outdoors. Next time I would definitely rent a junior suite in Casa Del Mar, I think definitely worth the additional costs and there really simply is no better location. I peaked in on a suite in the Casa Del Mar and it looked fabulous. Most anything on the Marina side has an incredible view, make sure you book a room on the Marina side no matter which hotel you are at. Every room on the marina side of Casa Del Mar had a private little patio. The Island Palms rooms only the large rooms had patios, ours just a chair with a little lawn, still very nice to just step right outside and view the beautiful marina and the boats, the water, etc. The hotel is secluded making you feel like you are on an island yet it is just minutes and I mean minutes to just about everything you want to see in San Diego. I checked out the other hotels while I was there that I had looked at online before my travels, they just don't compare, much more commercialized areas with tons of people and traffic. Island Palms is difficult to explain and the photos don't do it justice, but the VIEWS are just INCREDIBLE. Humphrey's, adjacent to the Best Western, looks nice to stay at also. I believe all are owned by the same developer who appears to be snatching up all the properties on Shelter Island. Humphreys has outdoor concerns which you could hear lightly down the street, if you're younger you might enjoy staying there and listening to the concerts. Insider Tip: A local told us about SUNSET CLIFFS ... DEFINITELY worth the trip. Sunset Cliffs is an incredible view of the ocean, the views watching the sunset are breathtaking, again, words don't do it justice. Sunset Cliffs is also great just to look at the beautiful homes, have a picnic, walks some trails (its a public park). We watched locals propel themselves down the cliffs to the small private beach and surf in, while the sun sets, really incredible. We definitely hope to go back and will definitely stay on Shelter Island.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGood family hotel\u201d", "Author": "BigTTTTT", "ReviewID": "UR37023141", "Content": "Stayed in a queen suite- like a small apartment, very convenient and pretty good value for this area.

We reserved a junior suite and stayed in the Casa Del Mar Building in room 506 with 2 queen beds. The room was clean and exactly as described on the website. It was extremely spacious with a pretty big (long) balcony. Our balcony directly faced a new Island Palms building being remodeled but off to the left was a great view of the bay and to the right a small view of the boats. I wish it was more clear on their website that the wet bar includes plates, bowls, forks, spoons, cups, etc so that I could have brought oatmeal, cereal, etc for our 2 year old daughter but I'm mentioning it now so that it might help someone else. This room also has a small refrigerator and a complimentary in-room safe. The Casa Del Mar building is situated right across the street from a pier where many people fish (so don't forget your fishing poles if you want to take a stab at catching a mackerel or two!) and right across from a children's playground which we spent quite a few hours at. The hotel is about a 7 minute drive to Sea World up Nimitz Street. Because of the close proximity, we were able to bring our daughter back to the hotel for a nap during our all-day visit to Sea World. Super convenient and great location! The Casa Del Mar pool is currently closed for renovations. The main pool and jacuzzi off the lobby was open and was super busy with allot of children. It was fine for us since our 2 year old loved all of the other children but if you are looking for a quiet, romantic pool - this is probably not the place for you or at least it was not the place on Memorial Day weekend. Overall our stay was great. There was one thing that bothered me - the walls were thin thus the 4 star overall and room rating (=very good, not excellent). One of our neighbors was so loud - they had the TV blasting at night, I could hear their conversations, etc. Luckily my daughter and husband slept right thru it! I think this was an isolated incident because I never heard a peep from the neighbor on the other side of us or anyone else in this building. But beware that the walls in the Casa Del Mar building are thin and if you get unlucky enough to have inconsiderate people next to you, you will hear them. Also, FYI the parking is not great. They have limited spaces available on the property and if you get back late you might not find a space and have to park across the street at the park, which the hotel said is okay - a little inconvenient but not a big deal.

Our view out the back was green plastic netting instead of the marina, and even the small amount of grounds between our room and the netting was not maintained. One pool and spa were closed. Construction was the reason for all of this and none of this is mentioned on their web site. I have been to several hotels that had always stated online that they had construction projects pending and where and to be prepared. Then, we were not allowed to check-in until 4P on the dot....as were some other folks that we met up with strolling the park across the street. We were there at 3 and had hoped to allow the little one some time for rest before the evening, but alas, that was not to be. The next day our room did not get cleaned as they didn't come around until late in the afternoon and our little one was taking her afternoon nap and could not be disturbed. In a family villa I would think this would be a consideration in the cleaning schedule. The next day I personally requested the cleaning staff to clean \"in the morning\" while we were gone. We did appreciate the 2 bedrooms and 3 full bathrooms. The couch downstairs made into a bed also so the full bathroom on the first floor would accommodate more guests if you needed to.

Our room was cozy and clean and we had a great water view right out our door. It was mid afternoon so we walked around to investigate the place and stopped in the bar for a drink and an appetizer. Great food and the bartender was very nice. He was a local and was able to answer any questions we had. He highly recommended the hotel restaurant so later that evening we had a delicious meal right there at the hotel. The next morning we went for a nice long walk around the \"island\" and then headed back to check-out and head for the ship. Again, the shuttle was there to take us to the cruise port. Thanks so much to the wonderful staff at the Best Western Island Palms for making our first taste of San Diego and southern California so pleasant!

It's often said that San Diego hasn't realized it's a small town that grew into a big city. Staying at this hotel evokes a feeling of San Diego as it used to be. Located on Shelter Island, the hotel is isolated from the rampant development, freeways and mall jams that characterize the more high-profile neighborhoods. Yet it is convenient to all that. But on Shelter Island you're surrounded by shops, restaurants and homes that don't seem to have changed much in the past 20 or 30 years. You're in the middle of the \"yachtie\" subculture, a different little world. The pace is slower and the view is superb. It's worth the extra price to get a \"Bayview Suite\" on the 2nd floor facing the harbor (not the marina). Bring binoculars and amuse yourself from your deck, living room or bed with an unobstructed view of the fascinating boat traffic in the channel. You'll see everything from massive U.S. Navy vessels and cruise ships to tourist \"duck\" boats and fishing boats plus pleasure boats arriving in the U.S. from Mexico. A lovely green park runs alongside the channel -- perfect place for a picnic or a brisk morning walk. Or go to the other side of the hotel, with rows and rows of yachts in the marina, to watch boat crews busily taking care of the rich people's playthings. The suite is comfortable, with ceiling fans, vaulted bedroom ceiling and a kitchen that makes it feel more like home. The rooms were redecorated enough years ago t be a bit dated now. But that wall of windows overlooking the channel can't be beat. We travel a lot and know there are fancier, more exotic places to land.

We spent the entire week at the Island Palms - great choice (thanks to TripAdvisor reviews!). We booked a bay view room (I know everyone recommends the marina view, but it was just a boring view of moored boats & a hill covered with homes - probably a little quieter). Our room was in the Casa del Mar building on the second floor. We had a private balcony with views of the harbor - cruise ships, fishing boats, navy ships (say a destroyer pass by just about every day), a fishing pier. You heard regular noise from Navy helicopters and jets taking off, but it was not overwhelming at all. If you are on the lower level of the Casa del Mar, you will get a lovely view of the parking lot, but the water is just across the street. The room was very clean and comfortable - couldn't ask for more. A functioning air conditioner and ceiling fan, plus plenty of toiletries and towels. The sink was separate from the toilet & tub/shower which was nice. There was a coffee maker and refrigerator, a desk with internet hookup, and a very comfortable chair along with our king sized bed. We always found the room clean and refreshed upon returning every evening. The windows also cranked open (after shifting the chairs around that were on the patio). I found this to be a very quiet, secluded hotel. You seemed to be away from it all on Shelter Island, but were within a 10-15 minute drive to everything (Zoo, Sea World, Balboa Park, Embarcadero, Mission Beach, La Jolla, Gaslamp area) - even supermarkets, drug stores, gas stations and Target were within 15 minutes driving. Staff was all super friendly. Pool & hot tub were wonderful and quiet (we used the second smaller pool and hot tub behind the Casa del Mar building). Later in the day, there weren't any towels at the pool, so bring your own from your room. There was a computer near the hotel's restaurant for internet use, so we were able to print our boarding passes before leaving. Exercise room was small but adequate (we didn't use it - just stuck our heads in). Hotel restaurat was decent, but we found much better food within walking distance. Across from the hotel is a waterfront park with a boat launch, public fishing pier, playground, and walkway. It was very nice to stroll along the water each night, and I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. We had a small incident late in the week where the boiler in our building went down. We were lucky that we had gotten up early enough to get a lukewarm shower. We immediately contacted the front desk, and before we had left for the morning, a gentleman stopped by our room to let us know about the boiler and that they were working on it (we actually saw the workers arrive as we left the room - quick service!). I can't wait to get back to San Diego to stay here again. Our only complaint for the entire week - the parking is tight near the Casa Del Mar building on the weekends (Friday & Saturday night). A few larger pick-ups and SUVs had a difficult time maneuvering around.

The restaurant was lovely and the food was really good, we ate there twice, the breakfast we had delivered to the room once was mediocre surprisingly. We really liked the hotel itself, it was attractive, staff were nice and friendly and the pool and hot tub were nice and deserted BUT for us we thought it was too secluded from everywhere, you couldn't go anywhere for a stroll in the evening to say another restaurant or bar unless it was another hotel as it was within the marina. It was easy to get to places in the car 15 mins away though. On reflection I wish I had booked us somewhere more central although this is a choice not a reflection on the hotel itself, it was very good and I think best western are pretty good anyway, you don't get any personal touches in a big hotel chain though.

We intended it to be our chillout part of the holiday and the hotel was just perfect for this in every respect. We had found the hotel online, but decided to call them direct to book. They were very helpful and even gave us good advice over a room - ie the bay view rooms do indeed look towards the bay, but between the room and the water is the hotel car park and a road and then a public car park before you see water! As a result, we took their recommendation (at a slightly higher rate admittedly) of a marina view room. This was perfect. We were in the two-storey (no lift) building at the far end of the hotel - I think it had recently been acquired and was originally another small hotel; the room was excellent and had clearly been renovated recently. The decor, carpets, bedding etc were high quality and immaculate. We had a huge king bed in a large room with a balcony (with chairs) that looked directly over the pool and the marina. There are two pools here - the main pool is very prettily landscaped with a hot -tub, toilets etc and right next to the bar/restaurant, but as a result was busier. We had the luxury, by opting for the smaller pool and hot tub outside our room, of having it to ourselves nearly every time we went there! The staff were amazing, from greeting us by name the minute we arrived to doing all they could for us. THe standard of housekeeping was top class. ALL staff were friendly and spoke when they passed you. We ate in both the restaurant and had bar meals and all were very good. Breakfast was particularly nice and also the meals were very reasonably priced for the location. Free bikes are available, which were made use of; there is a self service laundry too. We ate at the Red Sails Inn on Shelter Island and highly recommend it. Food and service excellent. We also ate at Humphreys next door - larger hotel with an excelelnt bar with live music and again a very good restaurant overlooking the marina. The Old Town trolley buses pick up twice in the morning and drop off twice at night outside the hotel. The shuttle bus (free) was also a plus. The airport is so close (but not intrusive noise wise) that the transfer was a doddle. We spent some time in San Diego - loved both Old Town and the Gaslamp quarter, and also Coronado Island.

We had a terrific stay. We had a junior suite, with two queen beds, in the newer Casa del Mar building on the second floor that provided a wonderful view of the marina. (My wife and I spent many early morning and late evening hours sitting on the balcony, enjoying the view.) The junior suite provided lots of space. The Island Palms has two swimming pools, with the larger and nicer pool connected to the main building; that pool also had a tiki bar with reasonably-priced drinks and good service. We ate a good and reasonably-priced breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. We also enjoyed the Shelter Island location; it provided a quiet respite from busier San Diego, but was easy driving distance to the Zoo and other attractions. A few notes: (1) the Casa del Mar building (a former hotel that was acquired by the Island Palms some years ago) looked newer and nicer than the other Island Palms building. I suspect that TA reviews that complained about small or older looking accommodations were not staying in the Casa del Mar. The junior suite in the Casa del Mar was pleasantly large; (2) inquire with the hotel if you care whether your room has a view of the bay or the marina. Island Palms' description of the rooms' views can be confusing (if not misleading). A busy public parking lot and a public street separate the hotel from the bay itself. If you want to view the bay, you must have a second floor room, which would enable you to see over the parking lot and road. These second floor rooms are called \"water view\" rooms. The first floor rooms facing the bay are called \"bay view\" rooms -- despite the fact that they will provide nothing more than view of the car parked in front of your room. Adding to the confusion is that \"water view\" rooms (in addition to describing second floor rooms facing the bay) also describe rooms facing the marina. I did not learn this terminology until shortly before we were scheduled to leave on our trip. We originally had a \"bay view\" room. After several conversations with the hotel, we managed to change our reservation to a marina view room -- which required a reservation for a \"water view\" room \"facing the marina\" (and not the bay). ( Hope that wasn't too confusing.) I don't think we would have enjoyed our stay nearly as much if we had a first floor view of the \"bay.\" The marina view was tremendous.

To me, this hotel is just a tad above a Howard Johnson or Days Inn, where we could have received a continental breakfast each day and saved $150 per night. We were lucky in that we got the Entertainment Book rate of $109 per night, but normally the rooms are well over $200. Our room was very small for a family of four, but did the job. I think they must have different sized rooms because some of the reviews talk about how spacious the rooms are, with beautiful views. I was told we had a view over the phone, but in reality our view was partial. The reason we chose this hotel over the Howard Johnson or Days Inn was because the reviews on trip advisor of those hotels were that they were in a terrible, unsafe neighborhood, only to find out they were within a mile of this hotel. The Best Western is in a more secluded, beautiful area but we are from Los Angeles, so to us, those other hotels were not in as sketchy of a neighborhood as was described. Yes, there are some strip clubs, but right next store are clean, brand-new shopping centers with a Walgreens or Jack in the Box in them. It's not like you are in some dark, unlit, off-the-beaten path street. Those hotels are on a major boulevard, are well-lit and would have been sufficient for us. So it depends on what you are looking for. We basically just needed a place to sleep since we were out sight-seeing all day. The nice things about the Best Western Island Palms was that it was tranquil and quiet, not on a major street, room service (especially having coffee delivered in the morning!) and the refrigerator in our room. I was able to bring along cereal and keep the milk cold in the fridge so that we didn't have to spend money on breakfast. Overall, a nice place to stay, but overpriced for what you get.

Free wi-fi internet in the sleeping and meeting rooms. The restaurant in the main building is lovely, and the food is quite good. The exercise room is a little small, but if only one or two people are using it, it's not that claustrophobic. More than two people at a time would be a nightmare.

For all we went through (not getting enough sleep, packing and un-packing again, untidy room) I don't think it was near enough, but what bothered me the most was the lack of apology and the staff attitude: they dealt with our problems like it was no big deal. My advice: spend your money somewhere else!!!", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cFilthy!\u201d", "Author": "Rren", "ReviewID": "UR5732137", "Content": "This hotel had to be the worst of anywhere we stayed in our month in California and the most expensive. It was the equivalent price to 2 rooms at San Francisco's sparkling Argonaut Hotel but hardly in the the same class. We paid \u00a3600 per night so expected something special. That's pounds not dollars! Multiply roughly by 2 and you'll get an idea of how much we were ripped off! We stayed in the Island Palms section in a villa and I agree with previous reviews which say that website pictures are very misleading. That's if you can get it to stop crashing and have to restart your computer every time. The \"villa's\" are only the equivalent of 4 small motel rooms joined top to bottom by a grotty and slippy spiral staircase. The villa's are right next to the hotel's ballroom which hosts their many weddings and the noise would be a problem if you had small kids or needed to sleep. I rang and asked Reception at what point the disco was finishing and was told that it was virtually over - it went on for another two hours!! The block is basically a sixties motel given a superficial tart up. The windows are still the same grotty metal frames and are impossible to open. The a/c is old fashioned individual units and noisy. The rooms are dark and furnished in a dirty dreary green colour presumably to hide the stains which are over everything, carpets and furnishings included. The main problem however is that EVERYTHING is dirty or broken. The door into our room was filthy and it went on from there. Stained, scuffed, broken or uncared for was the order of the day. The \"full kitchen\" promised was underequipped, scruffy and smelt permanently of sour milk. NOTHING worked properly from the lights to the tv's and the room was not cleaned well every day we were there, even the bedcushions had unsavoury looking stains. Yuck. Dog poop in the corridor was also a nice touch one day! (upstairs!) Well I think it was dog's.... People let their dogs mess on the grass outside your rooms as well. It is not very private when sitting outside due to the constant foot traffic and the odd strange kid on noisy, petrol driven scooters. There seems to be no restriction on who can walk through the hotel's pathways and gawp at you in the pool. We did not swim as we felt the rooms were so filthy we were likely to catch something in the pool. Security is also a huge problem, we were woken at 3.30 am by someone banging on every door. This was a worry as my teenage daughter was sleeping on her own downstairs. the doors are left permanently propped open and there is no staff in this building overnight nor any security that I saw. Shelter Island sounds nice but is, in reality ,one big car park with weirdo's hanging around all weekend. We also found it hard to park anywhere near the hotel. This was a nasty surprise after 6 hours spent crawling along the 5 at 15 mph all the way from Santa Barbara (no exaggeration) This was in no way worth the money and we all felt that we needed a good wash after leaving! We only did not check out because we could not find anywhere else!", "Date": "September 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oro valley, AZ", "Title": "\u201cBest Western Shelter Island, San Diego\u201d", "Author": "mazuka", "ReviewID": "UR5725425", "Content": "We spent 5 nights at this hotel.

The area of the hotel is far from the cool sections of san diego but a short drive to SeaWorld.

Just overall a great size for a family of five. The suite opened up to a balcony that overlooked the marina. It was great seeing that every morning and every night. That's what I mean by relaxing. Even with traveling with three children, having a view like that will make just about anyone relaxed. The staff were great. Very personable and informative. They have two pools and two hot tubs. We liked the bigger of both. In the afternoon, there was complimentary cookies which the kids loved. They also have at the front desk a coupon good for a free appetizer at one of the restaurants right on the island. Very good food and kid friendly. They are famous for their seafood.

We're a married couple in our late 20's both professionals and not into the party scene. We usually stay at nice Best Western caliber hotels and above. We decided to stay here because 1) We have a Best Western Gold Crown Club membership (ie. racks up airline miles and free stays), 2) we wanted to stay somewhere that was a bit more quiet and not too close to downtown and 3) the trip advisor reviews were pretty good. In a nutshell, here's the good and bad: Good: *The place has room service! Prices, very decent, were the same as in the restaurant with a 15% service charge added. Didn't get to order in, but lots of people were. *Very nice pool area. There's actually two pools / spa areas. The one on the Casa del Mar side is much smaller but very nice at nightime if you're looking to take a quick dip or hang out in the hot tub. The island palms pool is really nice but seemed to be crowded up until 11pm. Both have a nice view of the Marina (they're right on the water). *The Shelter Island location of the hotel is very nice. Not too far from normal things like food and gas but just far enough so that it's quiet at night. *Very scenic and you can take a little stroll along the marina on a little path at the hotel. *Enormous bathroom. Lots of counter space, ladies! Not so good: *Kinda expensive for a Best Western. We payed $170.10 / night for a King Bay view room with AAA. The marina view rooms are about $20 more. You may consider paying the extra $20 if you want a view. Our Bay view room was actually a \"semi-Bay view\", as some of the rooms are turned sideways and the view isn't so great. Also, the Balcony faces a street (with Bay in background) instead of the Marina. *The rooms are kinda small. Not a whole lot of room between bed and TV, no table to eat at (does have desk instead). *There are NO ELEVATORS on the Case del Mar side. Not sure about the Island Palms side. We did see accessible rooms on the ground floor. Difficult to carry luggage up a flight of stairs and impossible for someone in a wheelchair, walker or with difficulty scaling stairs to have a bay view or Marina view room :( Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would consider going back again but only if we could get the room for less than $150.
