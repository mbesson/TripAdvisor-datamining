I arrived at nighttime and was surprised to find that it is, in fact, a 2-story motel rather than an hotel; with each door opening onto the car park rather than inside a building. I either missed this information or they don't make it clear in their adverts. If the motel had been situated in a less solubrious area I would have been extremely worried, however, Woodland Hills is a safe residential area and at no time was I anxious even when returning on my own late at night. Despite the motel being full almost every night the guests were extremely quiet when parking their cars and the walls must have good soundproofing as I never heard any noise coming from next door or from the rooms above mine.The room and bed were comfortable although a little drab in colour - there was a drip coffee machine, ironing board and iron, microwave, fridge and TV (with a good selection of channels). Although there was no electric kettle if you wanted to make tea you could go to the reception office (at the entrance of the motel) where there was 24 hour hot water machine, cups and milk etc. Opposite the motel - set well off the main road - is Ralphs ( a large super-market), Rite-Aid, a very good deli-restaurant and a 'Coffee Bean' cafe. Topanga shopping canyon is about a 10 minute drive away. The Best Western staff were extremely helpful, friendly and efficient. I used Prime Time shuttle service to get to and from LAX airport and the ride took between 45 minutes and 1 hour.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Feoivane", "ReviewID": "UR129122675", "Content": "The hotel has big rooms (2 beds + living room with small kitchen).

Ended up staying for a little less than a week, I have been able to accumulate the following review: 1-Location The hotel is located 30 min away from Los Angeles in a nice suburb called Woodland Hills. It is not an exciting place to be in as it does not offer good entertainment as you would expect from being closer to the city. You definitely need a car to commute back and forth to the exciting location around town. On the other hand, it is situated in the middles of a commercial area where a lot of bars, fast food outlets, and a Westfield shopping mall are just in close proximity. The only close entertainment attraction is Universal Studios which is approximately 20 min away by car. 2- The hotel It looks a lot like a motel complex rather than a hotel. It is composed of a circle shaped like building with rooms distributed on two stories. The ground level is too close to the parking area and you wills ably get awaken by the car noises or shouts of gets getting in Late. The upper level is not much better off as oh will keep on getting hit by the noise of cars and guests. The hotel does not scre high on its appearance, you will definitely not find sofitel's glamour or Westin's magic. If you are looking for luxury, that pace is definitely not where you want to stay. 3-Rooms This is probably the best scoring part of the complex. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, a very large bed is situated in the middle with a big TV screen just centered around your sleeping area. Rooms come with a sofa at the entrance next to the door and Re equipped with the accessories you would find in most hotels, from a coffee machine to a fridge... While the equipment might be a little old with signs of usage, the TV is not even plasma and there are no DVD decks attached or iPod docking station. The AC and heating system is situated just under the window, it is very effective at cooling the room or heating it up, but it is very noisy and you might want to turn it off before you sleep to avoid getting awaken by a loud flow of air getting on every 10 min 4- Services There are not much services offered in the hotel. But at least the net is free. Distributed over wi-fi, it remains at very high speed and accessible all day long. I find this as a big plus as still lots of 5 star hote S still charge you for the net. Breakfast is also available for free with the room, but served I. The breakfast area next to the rectilinear. That area only has one table and will definitely fit 4 or 5 guests, so don't expect to be sitting on a table enjoying coffee. It is intended to just grab what you want and be on your way. It is also worth noting that you need to step out in the open and walk to the reception, not much of a thing during winter. 5- Personel They are surely worthy of a 5 star hotel. I love smily helpful hosts. I was greeted with a big smie by really lovely front dek officers who were more than kind in explaining everything about the hotel and the area. They did not hesitate in offering me all the assistance I needed, they even called after my check in to see if everything is fine. Room service Personel are also very kind and really friendly. All in all I rate this place a s a 3, it is very average and definitely a place you will stay in if you are on a budget or because you have an occasion in the surrounding area. If you intend to see more of Los Angeles without commuting and enduring the endless freeway traffic of LA, you definitely need to stay close to Hollywood", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menifee, California", "Title": "\u201cWe stay here when flying from LAX\u201d", "Author": "cmdevenney", "ReviewID": "UR122799733", "Content": "We like to stay here when we are flying from LAX, this hotel is about 30-40 min from the airport depending on traffic. it is conveniently located near the 101 freeway.

The style of the hotel is definitely motel style with your car parked right up close by the room and a walk way/balcony running the length of the rooms.The rooms are clean and there's a coin op laundry down below for guests use, which we found pretty handy.The front desk staff are chirpy and helpful and there is a free breakfast next to the lobby.Beware though that the breakfast room is ultra small and you'll find yourself competing for space at the rush hour.They serve cereals,supermarket style pastries,boiled eggs,toast,coffee/tea and DIY waffles-nothing gastronomically spectacular.However compensating for the lack of space, there's no problem taking food back to your room so you can utilize the extra space there.If you'd prefer a different food scene there's some healthier options with Jamba Juice and a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf outlet across the road.

Be sure to bring a GPS so that you can avoid traffic jams by putting in alternative routes which seem to be just as quick.

The variety of options from homemade waffles to cereal and bagels, were a great boost to start the day.

P.S. While I express my apologies to the reviewer before me for what she experienced, I'd also be remiss as a veteran traveler if I didn't point out that some of it was preventable. The first line of defense is to look over paperwork CAREFULLY before signing/initialing it at check-in. I've caught wrong in and out dates, wrong rates, or both on a few occasions over the years\u2014and have rectified it on the spot. Then check it again first thing in the morning and resolve if needed.
