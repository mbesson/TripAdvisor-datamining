I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant to go in the hotel seeing that it looked a bit shady from the outside but we didn't have much choice since it was a busy week with 2 conventions going on and most of the surrounding hotels were completely booked. I appreciated that they did give us a room even though they said they were sold out. We stayed on the 6th floor in a room that was facing Figueroa street. First night, one can hear people yelling, cars, sirens, street bumps from the street outside. It didn't quiet down until about 12:30 am. There was a huge billboard with extremely bright lights pointing up from the Luxe Hotel across the street so alot of the light was going in our room. Needless to say, I could not get any sleep! To top that off one can hear doors slamming and people walking/talking around in the hallway. I was also a bit concerned about security since anyone can go in/out of the hotel and up the elevators although there was a chain at the door and the lock on the door knob but that was it. I called front desk and asked if they can provide ear plugs or eye mask, but this isn't a 3 or 4 start hotel. They tried to be accomodating and said that they can move me to another room on the 2nd or 4th floor but they were both facing Figueroa St so it may be worse. They sent a maintenance guy to come see what he can do and I asked for a blanket to be rolled and placed on top of the curtain to prevent the lights from coming in. He was nice enough to do that. Next morning, I asked to be placed in another room which helped a bit. I asked if the blanket can be placed on top of the curtains but the front desk stated that it was not something they can do even though I told them that it was already done the day before. This new room still faced Figuroa but a part of the building blocked the room from the lights and also the street noise and there was blinds although some lights still went through at the top. I finally got some sleep on the second night. The television was small perhaps 15in wide and the remote sometimes did not turn on the TV, i.e. you have to turn it on manually, then the rest of the remote worked. There was a small refrigerator but I don't think it was cold enough. For some reason, it was hot in the rooms. Both the fan and heater were both off as I didn't want to blow dust around as the curtains were a bit dusty at the top. The bed is reasonably comfortable and the bathroom seemed clean but old. It did feel like we were staying in a developing country. Parking was in the back of the hotel and very cramped. I rented a brand new car and didn't get the insurance which covers for scratches so I was always concerned that it might get scratched, but thank God it didn't. The guys at the parking lot were helpful and accomodating. Yes, we were staying at the heart of downtown so I can't really complain much about all the noise and staff did try to accomodate and helped with the room change which is why I rated this hotel an average instead of poor.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cCharming atmosphere, good downtown location, and affordable in comparison...\u201d", "Author": "Sone-a-rone", "ReviewID": "UR125294865", "Content": "I recently stayed here to participate in a conference.

I felt as if I were in a movie set. Breakfast with good coffee offers limited selections but is quick and very reasonably priced. One evening a friend and I ate a hamburger in the cafe with really good fries and nice $6 glasses of wine. I love the wild paintings on the 13 story towers that can be seen when walking back from the Convention Center and apparently change at times. These now are of Sasha Baron Cohen as Barack in 3 different and amusing guises. It was fun watching painters on rather skimpy scaffolding hand painting at times and other times using spray paint. Talented commercial artists. Music plays - often in the background - but one morning at breakfast a glorious aria swelled into the large space. Awesome! The hotel is clean - cleaning staff are friendly and helpful. The owner/manager is most generous with a sense of humor. There's no concierge or bell-person - it's not that kind of place. Wi-Fi is really reasonable.. $5 for 24 hours! Parking is $12 a day.. This hotel isn't for everyone. If you need slick, high-tech surroundings, this is not for you.

With fees, parking and taxes the suite cost about $300 per night though the property offers less substantial rooms as well. Parking behind the hotel is a little tricky as it accessed by a narrow alley but is very near the lush pool bar area. Food selections are limited in the cafe but are promptly served and executed very well. Cocktails in the Pool Bar at the rear of the premises were potent ($8.50).

I go on vacation every year to new cities and watch hockey games. Hotel Fig was originally picked for being close to the venue, but it turns out it was a nice relaxing place to stay. Check in went smoothly and having an Old School key was kind of cool. The lobby is so cool, some nice decorations and a piano too. Of course, you need to know how to play or Uno will get \"mad\". PS. I can't play that well. We got to our room (#930) and it was just as the picture looked. Very roomy and nicely decorated. The beds were super soft (I think they are new) the room had 2 closets (we missed the 2nd one for a couple hours) and a little fridge too. Again the room was way bigger than the normal hotels. The room had a non-working old piano and that is where the TV was located. I think they should get some new TV's. it's a good distance away from the beds, so a new one would help (even though we were not in room alot). The windows even opened, so it was nice to have fresh air, well LA air. The bathroom, as others have mentioned, was not super big, but it worked out perfect for us. The shower head needs to be a little higher as quick fix. Maid service was done and on one sleep in day they even called to ask if we wanted maid service. We had plans for most of our stay, but we did stop at the hotel bar and it was nice, not many bottled beers. Having onsite parking was nice, it was $12 a day, so not bad for the area.

This hotel has captured my imagination, and even in recollection, it takes my breath away. With so much attention to detail, the owners have missed nothing in building a magical setting, rife with warmth and splendour. The lobby, pool and bar are magnificent. Poolside is spacious, yet cosy and comfortable. The landscaping with the plants and fountain transported us elsewhere and made us forget we were in downtown LA, a mere half minute from the bustle and big box of LA Live. At night especially, the ambient lighting out here was lush and colorful, the perfect accent to a beautiful November night. We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t considered spending an evening at the poolside bar, but it turned out to be one of our best decisions. The lobby is high-ceilinged and dim which created a very warm twilight affect, accompanied by gigantic trees in massive vases with sprawling chandeliers and lamps overhead, all of which contributing to the bazaar (and enchantingly bizarre) qualities. No better room could welcome you to this hotel, and there is no better place (other than poolside) to start the day. The straight-forward and very fairly priced breakfast is served here in an environment conducive to strategizing the day ahead. The owners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 love of their hotel manifests itself everywhere. I stayed in a different room than my last visit and pleasantly surprised how the rooms were unique and so different from each other in their layouts, colors, and furnishing. It was so refreshing being somewhere that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cookie cutter. Something as small and seemingly insignificant as a hotel room door has been afforded painstaking detail here where many doors are profoundly different and home to its individual and intricate one of a kind design. Similarly, some of the hallway lamps are housed in hanging lead fixtures which flicker hospitably, yet give a medieval and timeless aura. And the silver house phones in the lobby complement the space, despite being weirdly modern. I regret not snapping photos of all these elements, but can take solace in the fact I know we will come back here at some point. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s become a destination in itself for us. It would be unfair to close without complimenting the staff on their professionalism and attentiveness.

And possibly florid. Get some coffee and settle in. The Figueroa Hotel has been an incredibly important fixture in my life for many years. An oasis in the middle of downtown Los Angeles, the Fig is the most beautiful and magical hotel I have ever visited, and this includes stays at the Ritz in Paris and various overpriced monstrosities in London and on the coast of Monaco. I had my wedding reception at the Fig, I celebrated two anniversaries there, and I've spent far too many hours hanging out and drinking with buddies at Rick's Place, the covered bar outside by the pools and walled cactus garden. If I had my way, I'd live there. Good to know up-front: If you resonated with the traveling style of George Clooney's character in \"Up In The Air,\" and are a fan of those Best Western ExecuSuite type accoutrements -- TV-Bigger-Than-Bed, cookie-cutter execudesk and \"confab area\"; poly-fiber bedspread that picks up inoffensive pale peach color scheme of room; hairdryer, mini coffeemaker and high-speed WiFi in the molded plastic bathroom; Nutty SnakMix in the minibar; continental breakfast of stale muffins and canned orange juice; free shuttle to the local Aqua Park; Absolutely No Surprises -- you're going to hate this place. Try the Ramada or whatever it's called across the street. But if you're interested in combining form with function -- uncommon loveliness and a sense of the exotic with comfort and affordability -- then you need to check out the Fig. That sounds strange, no? Would never put those two scenarios together, right? That's a big part of what makes the Fig so unusual. It's difficult to list the things I love about the Fig in any kind of order because my experience of it has always been more about the whole vs the sum of its parts, sort of thing. If I close my eyes and think back, multiple images flash by: - the flickering light from the tin and colored glass Moroccan lamps; - the deep blues, burnt oranges and rich reds of the unique and intimate guest rooms decorated with antique furniture, original artworks and tapestries; - evenings spent lounging with friends and a bottle of bubbly by a fountain in the walled cactus garden, bathed in reflections of light rippling up from the tiled mosaic floor of the heated wading pool; - mornings in the same garden, this time breakfasting al fresco by the tiled swimming pool, aware of the omnipresent L.A. helicopters, but still feeling like I'm in the desert somewhere, maybe on my way to a secret rendezvous, oversized sunglasses and floppy hat de rigeur. - the magnificent lobby, a fabulous melange of various influences. Is it Moroccan? Is it Spanish Colonial? Do I care? - Oh! The entrance from the back alley, this long passageway of wrought iron and flowering hibiscus vines into the walled garden, past the pool and bar and into the main lobby. It's like following a path into some magical world. Well, it's not \"like\" that; it actually is. One last thing: Since a place is only ever as good as its people, a word needs to be said about the management, i.e. Uno Thimansson, the owner, the operator, the manager -- it's hard to know his title is because he's a cagey fellow and rarely admits to anything. I've never experienced such warm and magnanimous treatment from anyone in the so-called hospitality industry -- he's nicer than my parents, actually. When I called at the last minute to find out about having our reception at the Fig -- um, because we actually eloped, like with a week's notice -- Uno helped me figure out how to do it on the cheap (without making me feel like a loser) and found us a room, even though they were already sold out. During the whole process, I kept saying, \"It's fine, I'll find another place,\" but he'd say, \"No, hold on. I think I can figure something out. Let me call you back.\" It's been like that every time I've been back, whether to beg for a room at (always always always) the last minute because I just came into some unexpected cash or to prevail on them to keep the bar open for One Last Drink. And it's not like the hotel makes much money of me or any of my broke (yet charming!) bohemian arteeste buddies. Still, Uno and his staff are unfailingly gracious, treating me and my raggedy gang like royalty. Hell, I'm only writing this review now, and it's been six years already, so that can't explain the continued kindness and generosity over the years.

The best way I can describe this hotel is that is an oasis in downtown LA. You walk in and you're transported to a different world. The architecture is kind of latin, kind of Moroccan. Lots of arches, lots of colors. Great, friendly staff. Our room was a regular room with a king bed (I believe). It was a bit oddly laid out, but comfortable and quiet, other than noise from the street (which can be substantial if there is a lot going on at the neighboring arenas). The window air conditioner helped mask some of the street noise, but sirens cut right through it. There was a ceiling fan above the bed which is probably all you really need on everything but really hot days. The bed was comfortable but nothing to write home about. The room had a desk, a couple of comfortable (not cushy) chairs, an ottoman, a dresser, a table. Colors tended toward rich red tones. Two closets, one didn't seem to be used often and had a musty smell, but the other was just fine. Things that seemed to be missing were an ice bucket, lots of blurbs about the hotel itself, and a mini-bar stocked with too-expensive treats. The hotel has a parking lot our back which seems really small for a hotel this size (12 stories) but we always had a space. One note about the lot is that you must turn into it off of Olympic and cannot get to it from Figueroa. You'll need to wave off all of the parking attendants if there is an event going on and tell them you're staying at the hotel. If you need web access or want to print your boarding pass, you can use a small netbook at the reception desk. The first five or so printed pages are free. The lobby and kitchen area are very comfortable and there were always people in them, unlike some hotels that feel too cold for humans to feel at home in. The two days we were there, the kitchen had a buffet breakfast that was good and inexpensive (priced by the item so you could choose what your meal cost, not just what you wanted). They'll even make you a latte or espresso if you prefer. Wander out back and you discover the bar/pool area, which looks and feels a lot like you're in a tropical paradise and not in downtown LA. Stay here for the vibe, the atmosphere, and the location. Don't stay here if you're expecting the Four Seasons treatment.

The details of it's Moroccan theme are apparent throughout the venue, from the lobby and the lounge, all the way down the beautifully tiled covered walkway that leads past the pool, to the hotel's gated back entrance. Each floor has a unique collection of furniture, plants, earthenware, draperies and carpeting, that invokes a warm feeling. Every inch of the hotel, from ceiling to floor, invokes an exotic, rustic charm, that challenges won't let you to believe you're in a hotel in North America. Our double room at the Figueroa had an odd floor plan featuring, an entry way with large, walk in closet, followed by a long, narrow room, that extended left, into the corner of the building. Our bathroom was also quite narrow, which despite it's square footage being decent, made it quite cramped, and impossible to be used by more than one person at a time. There were no additional mirrors in the room, so this made getting ready a little bit slower than in a larger room. Be sure to think of your usage and requirements before booking just any room here, as they each deliver a slightly different, foreign flavoured experience. If you've ever traveled abroad, you will immediately understand this hotel's unique charm, and appreciate it for all of it's lovely details.

Now (the day of the wedding) I'm being presented an invoice with fees I questioned. This after spending over $15,000.00 in rooms and services. At the event it self, we had a sit down dinner and the staff brought out the dinner plates and food to each table. This was accomplished with guest assistance, \"please pass this down\" as you were handed a dinner plate, as apparently the staff could not be bothered to place the dinnerware at each guest's location. If the server could not find a location to place a food platter, it was simply handed to a guest and the server walked off, leaving the guests at the table to figure it out for themselves. Lastly, because no beverage was offered at the meal, if you wanted a simple glass of water you had to get up yourself and walk to a near by public bar and request it yourself as this was not made available either.

Not safe. 2) No safe in our room. 3) Electrical outlets jerry-rigged and looking extremely unsafe - two prong only! The one behind the bed was impossible to reach, but that was probably good, because it might have set me on fire. 4) Air conditioner, which needed some firm whacks to get it going and seemed circa 1984, had enough dust accumulated in it that we seriously debated turning it on. That kind of stuff is gross. And easy to keep clean; no excuse. 5) Security of your personal information: this place is run on a typewriter-and-carbon-paper system. At the front desk, not only can they not do anything quickly, they also risk the security of guest (and credit card!) information. Upgrade this stuff; no excuse. In the not-security/health risk but still bad: 1) The towels. C'mon. As small as could be, awkward if you're sharing a room with a colleague, but also thin and worn. 2) Toiletry amenities were kind of vintage-y cute, but insufficient. Thus, not ironically cute. More like you were still in the early 1980s and sort of regretting it. 3) \"Breakfast.\" It belongs in quotation marks, trust me. On the plus-ish sides: 1) It was clean enough. The beds were old and dorm-like, mattresses bad, and sheets were not nice, but it seemed clean. 2) Someone has clearly tried hard to decorate with care. It is sort of endearing, because they obviously tried, but you can't make an old YMCA into a Moroccan boutique hotel. It still smells like my college dorm - maybe the grout from the tiles or something? Industrial cleaners? It makes me think \"no way will I ever go for 'Moroccan,' because it means 'this stuff is old so we'll make it dark and maybe no one will notice.'\" 3) The pool area is nice for a drink - the kitsch works there. The building is old - own it. Don't try to make it into some weird Moroccan theme. Go with the vintage-YMCA/college dorm feeling. That could bring up a lot of interesting memories for people.

The \"Fig\" is part casbah, part Casablanca, part Silk Road caravan, not your normal hotel, and I mean that in the best way possible.

The front desk and dining staff are superb, friendly and professional, and the owner of the hotel takes a personal interest in making sure operations are top-notch. Housekeeping always seems excellent as well, the rooms are clean and well supplied. This year, there was a dinner menu in place, which, while limited, was a very good value (especially for downtown), and dining poolside at the Fig is relaxing and delightful (while lines form for overpriced restaurants all around LA Live, you can chill by the pool with a nice New York steak and a great drink from the bar, enjoying your meticulously landscaped surroundings). Breakfast is basic, but reasonably priced, while the legendary \"Pantry\" is just a block away if you want something more substantial. Downtown can be noisy at times with all that goes on down there, and the nightlife lasts well into the evening, so if you're sensitive to noise, just be advised this is not in the quietest neighborhood in the western hemisphere.

The Housekeeping was ultra attentive. We were even called by name once we'd been introduced by the manager. The purpose of this trip was all leisure, and it didn't disappoint. While there are no real fancy restaurants in the hotel, the steak and salad and potatoes at night were most tasty, and there was a nice breakfast buffet. Uno, the mgr., also directed us to 4 great places to eat directly across the street at the Staples Center! Also movie theaters nearby there....we never had to drive anywhere. Every restaurant we went to around the area had only high praise for Uno and his staff. The Figueroa was a mix of Moroccan/Mexican/Spanish and Indian styles! Very pleasant! Nice music was piped into the lobby from hidden speakers, and the pool terraces and back bar hosted amazing clients to meet and mingle with...The bartenders were most friendly and made good drinks! They got iced teas and cappuccinos for my wife. The pool was immaculately clean, as was the hotel lobby. I learned that this hotel was a former YWCA and was from the 1920's. The building itself is amazingly in great shape. The walls are concrete and very quiet to sleep in. There was an in-window A/C unit, as central air would've lowered the nicely and artistically painted beamed ceilings. The hallways and rooms were just as advertised, only much more fun due to the service! I will be going back with my wife and newborn son as soon as we have the baby! Bravo Uno on a wonderful hotel experience! Thanks too, to your kind and hospitable staff (some which said they had worked there since 1977!)....Cheers!", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cA great stay-cation\u201d", "Author": "Michael_777_11", "ReviewID": "UR95215232", "Content": "My wife and I like to take \"stay-cations\" in and around Los Angeles.

It houses some interesting memorabilia and fun interactive displays. Since it's on the outskirts of downtown, walking to the Historic Core is a bit of a hike, but well worth it once you get there. Be sure to check out Grand Central Market for some incredibly cheap produce and good Chinese food. Also, DO NOT MISS The Original Pantry on the corner of 9th and Figueroa. They have no locks on the doors because the diner has never closed since 1924. That in itself was enough to make us go in. This year is their 85th birthday, having never turned the lights off and never locked the door. The home fries that they serve with breakfast are cooked in a cast iron skillet that has been in use AT LEAST since the 1960s. Needless to say, it's a seasoned pan!

So we knew one day we'd do a \"staycation\" here. The event was our anniversary. The owner (I presume - he was French and I remembered some reviews here describing him as such) took my booking. Our main thing was we had only one night to spend and we wanted full advantage of the pool but with a usual 3pm check in & 11-noon check out it didn't really leave us much daytime as official guests. Well the owner offered unsolicited to give us an early check in (noon), late check out (2pm) AND let us use the pool the whole next day. Sold! Very very nice of him. He asked if we'd like a \"dark\" room. I said to book us in whatever would be romantic. He gave us the \"Prince\" room (#125). It was the base rate, around $150 + tax and + parking. I cannot even describe how much I loved it. Purple, BIG, 2 closets, gorgeous furniture, canopy bed, beautiful bathroom. Some people have talked about dingy rooms. Well I can tell you the bathroom was entirely spotless - it looked like everything was just caulked and grouted that day. There was a cool farm sink too - separate hot and cold taps but I'm down with old funky things like that. There were 2 downsides to my long-awaited pool experience. 1. no lounge chairs. Just metal cafe ones. I get that they have a big bar scene at night and need space for people but it was a downer not to stretch out. 2. the pool & spa close at 8pm. Again this is probably for bar biz. But we wanted to use the hot tub at night! wah wah wah Oh and one more, the water was pretty frigid. Not heated. But it was still gorgeous and the spa made up for it. It was also a little hard to get ice. I assume this is b/c they try the whole \"no outside food\" thing. But I smuggled stuff in. We also spent $70 or so at the bar & restaurant so I feel no guilt over this. The mojitos at the bar are stellar. We tried both the burger & the tomato pasta from the restaurant and both were satisfying, especially the pasta. Not grade A but the Original Pantry next door (supposedly a city favorite) turned us way off and this was a much better alternative. Plus we got to eat by the pool with a cold beer. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat, and I'd want that room. If you are into exotic, and a little funky come here.

It cetainly has a laid back charm,and is also part of the LA sky line as well. It has the added feature of a pool surrounded by lush cacti and ornate features which make this a Garden of Paradise in this sprawling Downtown area of LA.

It was nice to stay in a builing with character and not the usual plastic fasade with plastic people in them.

Avoid the Figueroa Hotel at all costs at all future events. I did not always believe the horror stories about this hotel until we checked in. I had thought that this would be a one star-Motel 6 type of motel. Unfortunately, it was far, far worse than a Motel 6. Normally I don't even mind sleeping in a Motel 6, as long as it's sanitary and clean. ( I've been to hotels in other countries, as well as the Midwest and East Coast in the U.S. ) This was one of the worst hotels that I ever been in my life. Due to the proximity of the location to the LA Convention Center, I had booked this hotel for an Anime Expo Convention at the LA Convention Center. When my roomates and I checked in at the Figueroa Hotel at Day 1 of the convention, we were appalled when we entered room #318. This what we found in the room: (There were other things as well, but these were the most appalling parts.) 1. The hotel room floor-It was not carpeted and a plain floor. There were various cracks everywhere in the floor. (Some were large enough for you to stub your toe or trip over.) Also the floor was filthy. When you walk barefoot on the floor, the soles of your feet became black with dirt & hair. The room was quite dirty and there was dust everywhere. Even in the tables. The wooden chair facing the table was broken and left unfixed. 2. Rest room: There were cockroaches running across the bathtub and toilet seat. The toilet seat's was chipped and it was hard to flush. The Bathtube/shower-The worst part. The bathtub was not a flat surface and strangely curved in a steep angle. Once the shower is turned on, it becomes very slippery and I fell down 3 times. (When I tried to get back up I would slip and fall again.) The fall had bruised and strained my back. I had to see a masseur, (Spent $99) in another hotel to help ease the back pain. ( I had to see my doctor after the con was over and he prescribed me diclofenac sodium for the pain.) My 2 roomates also said that they almost slipped and fell inside the bathtub. The shower would also turn suddenly hot and then suddenly cold. When I complained to the manager, Uno about the situation, he was very rude and tried to argue with me. He refused to apologize and tried to shift the blame on me for falling down. One of his responses was \" The bathtub is 85 years old. What do want me to do about it?\" The hotel manager never once apologized, never bothered to call or come to see if we were O.K., and just didn't care whether we stayed or not. The room situation had gotten so bad that we all checked out in the morning after the 2nd day of the convention and checked in the Wilshire Grand. (An excellent classy hotel with great service. Plus the price difference as compared to what the Figueroa Hotel was quite minimal.) I just want to caution anyone who are thinking about booking at the Figueroa Hotel in AX 2009. In some cities, this hotel would have been condemmed by the city due to lack of health standards. Since this hotel is privately owned and not part of a hotel chain, it makes me wonder what the fire marshal or health inspector would find if they pay this hotel a surprise visit. (Having cockroaches running around the restroom and hotel room are a good indication that it is not up to the current heath standards.) This is a health and safety issue, and this should be a hotel that you would only book at your own risk.", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cA unique experience\u201d", "Author": "jazbearz", "ReviewID": "UR18655993", "Content": "When I found out that I was staying at the Hotel Figueroa to attend a conference, I started looking at these reviews.

Living in Los Angeles ourselves (my wife and I), we don't get too many opportunities to stay in hotels in the city. But we do stay in a lot of hotels across the world and I do a ton of research, so take our word for it, THIS PLACE IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST. While we splurged on the Casablance suite (room #100), I made a point of checking out a friend's room since I had read some pretty God-awful reviews in here. In fact, some of the reviews were so bad that I hesitated booking a room for my wif'es 35th birthday. I even considered canceling my booking like another reviewer here. Up until entering the room after checking in, despite how cool the lobby was, I was very concerned but decided to realize that this place wouldn't be in both 'Travel & Leisure' and 'Conde Naste Traveler' magazines if it wasn't special. It's also in a handful of other publications with decent reviews. And special it certainly is. If we booked a suite (not to mention the hotel's biggest & best) anywhere else downtown, we'd be paying $700 and up. Easy. In February for my birthday, we got the penthouse at the Standard Downtown for 1/2 price (booking the night of) for $500 (normal price was $1,000). We paid $245 for the Figueroa and it was a great deal. Out on the street, you walk up to the door wondering where the valet is and what kind of dump this place could be. It certainly doesn't look like much from the front. Parking is directly behind the hotel, piece of cake. To save you some time, pull up in the back instead of the front when you check in. Once you enter, you're swept away to Morocco. The lobby, restaurant and various bars on two levels were absolutely breathtaking. I felt like a little kid at Disneyland, running around to check out all that there is to see. The pool is beautiful with its own bar out back. We had a great time hanging out here with friends after we grabbed dinner up the street at Nick & Stef's (spectacular steak). The room...where do I begin?? You enter the Casablanca suite and you expect to see princes and princesses recling on the sofa or bed or sitting on the bench/trunk near the window. The decor is sultry, sexy and so much fun. The room is huge and the bathroom....the tub is a concrete swimming pool with a rain shower head above you. It's wonderful. The second we stepped into this room, I knew I was going to be sorry it was only for one night and we had an early morning the next morning. If you're looking for a room with a view, forget it. The view IS your room. There's a small window to let in light (and air I imagine), but of course, any added light would take away from the warm, cozy Arabian theme. There's good air conditioning and it was a warm L.A. day and night. We had a bar area with a fridge and coffemaker. There's a T.V. if you need one and the bed is amazingly comfy. The quilt is so big and fluffy it looked as if someone was sleeping in our bed. While the pool bar is hopping and definitely worth grabbing a drink at, I thought having our room right next to the upstairs bar might cause some commotion that would make sleeping difficult. Nope. I don't believe they even opened the bar outside our door and the lobby was surprisingly quiet. Now for the standard room....I have no clue how many bad reviews I read before deciding to stay here. The room I saw, up on the 7th floor (we had 2 sets of friends staying in 2 rooms on the same night), was a perfectly good standard room. Okay, the floor is concrete (painted) but the room was cozy, clean and cool. The theme from downstairs is even continued up into these smaller rooms with interesting colors, furniture and furnishings. There's a fridge, A/C and T.V. and the bed looked very comfortable and clean. I just don't understand how you could give this place a bad review. The bathroom was clean...i even checked out the tub, which was clean and in perfectly good, working order. I believe our friends paid $140 for their room. Average for downtown I believe. For the same price, my wife and I stayed at the Bonaventure in June for a wedding and while it was nice, if you wanted to be picky about some things, it certainly wasn't perfect. I was pleased with it, and certainly more pleased with the Fig. You don't stay at the Fig if you're looking for the Ritz. And if you're looking for the Ritz, you're going to pay a lot more. If you're looking for a very cool, funky, clean and inexpensive place to stay downtown, this place is AWESOME. We never had any trouble with management and checking in and out was a breeze. Sure, they have a policy as do any of the other hotels against having parties in your room. And they assume, rightly so, that if you're inviting people up to your room, you're inviting them to have a party. Let's be realistic here. What else would you be doing? The Figueroa makes it very clear that they don't approve of parties when they give you a paper to sign upon checking in. Any other hotel makes you do the same thing, you just don't know you're agreeing to not having parties in your room. Check the back of your checkin contract (or the small print). Or ask. As for throwing parties in your room, I actually have quite a bit of experience with this. Like anywhere else, I imagine you CAN have people up to your room as long as you're mature and respectful about it. If you're boozin' it up and causing a lot of rucous (and being obvious about it), you're going to get booted. If you're quiet and have a nice group of people over (not a mob) and having a beer or a glass of wine up in your room, I'm sure you'd be fine. But then again, on a nice night like it was this weekend, why would you stay in your room? And just remember, you're staying in a hotel. You're expected to be mindful of other guests. If you have more people in your room, you're bound to disturb your neighbors. I'm a fun loving guy but a light sleeper. I've been woken up a number of times by noisy neighbors. Anyway, I plan on staying at the Figueroa Hotel again. Absolutely, no question. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. If you want a fun and unique night out on the town, this is a great place at which to finish.

Hotel Figueroa came up and I read Frommer's review, which was good. I booked a room with the owner, Uno. Very pleasant and helpful. I then read some very disturbing reviews of the hotel. I ended up cancelling the reservation, but thought twice, and rebooked it because it sounded so unique. I could have booked the Holiday Inn across the street - but when you are tired of sameness, sometimes unique is the right choice. It turned out to be charming. I have done a great deal of global travel and wanted that feel. The other guests were a combination of other nationalities, as they seem more willing to allow for quirky simplicity. The room had terracotta painted walls, matching stained cement floor and lots of other color in sari-covered windows, Indian rug wallhangings and a lovely wrought-iron covered bed. Simple and comforting. The staff was friendly. I was up at 6am and went downstairs to find a satisfying breakfast buffet - alacart. 50 cent pancakes, $1.50 for bacon or sausage -- etc. Including coffee, my $5.00 breakfast was just right. I walked by at 10am on a Sunday morning and found the restaurant full with lots of people enjoying overflowing plates. The pool and restaurant are also inviting. If you are a seasoned traveler, you will enjoy the charm, color and atmosphere. It's convenient to downtown and the DASH 25 cent buses. Take a chance - make your own decision.

When I got up to my room, I found that there was no refrigerator and that the television had very few channels. The airconditioning unit in the window also made it impossible for the drapes to fully cover the windows, so every morning as soon as the sun rose, I was awakened by bright sunlight. To say the least, that was frustrating. The cable TV was also annoying, and if I'd been told the truth about the refrigerator, I probably would have stayed elsewhere. Since I was attending a sporting event and getting out very late, not having a refrigerator meant I couldn't stash a sandwich in there for a post-event meal, but instead had to traipse down a deserted city street in search of a restaurant open late, which was neither fun nor safe. And when I made the reservation I was assured I was getting a special rate due to the event I was attending; I later found out it was the standard rate.

It is a shame that a chic hotel like the Figueroa can be ruined by a flippant, standoffish, rude manager. And if you have kids definately stay clear of this hotel as it is dangerous even for adults. Dear Management, I and my fiance stayed two nights at the Figueroa hotel on the 27th and 28th. The building was clean and fanciful. The front desk`s and cafe`s clerks were friendly, and the rooms were clean and colorful. But I must say that I have never met a ruder manager in any hotel ever before. His complete lack of care for his customers and disregard for common courtesy and respect were made obvious after my fiance slipped and fell while she was taking a shower. Apparently, the bathtub floor was extremely slippery and posed a health hazard. Not only was it slippery but the shape of the bathtub, a U at the bottom, was not conducive to taking a shower safely. When I called the front desk to inform the management that one of their bathtubs was slippery and dangerous I was met with a very curt response, \"Did you use the bathmat?\" My fiance did not use the bathmat and there was no sign, notice, or warning that one should use the bathmat, nor that the bathtub was dangerously slippery. Her response to the management`s most offensive reaction was that she had never used a bathmat in any other hotel, and it is not custom to use bathmats in her home country, Japan. I also have never had a problem bathing at another hotel with or without using a bathmat. When I physically went to the the front desk to discuss the manner the manager (owner?) again replied in a snappy voice that it is our fault we were not smart enough to use the bath mat, even though it does not cover the entire inside of the tub. No attempt was made on management`s behalf to listen to what happened nor to accept any responsibility or even to apologize for the unsafe, irresponsibly hazardous conditions in the hotel room. And at the end the manager got right in my face to tell me that in his 30 years of hotel managerial experience he had never had a complaint about the bathtub. Again, I have NEVER been treated so rudely at any hotel nor have I EVER stayed in a hotel with such unsafe conditions. This shows a hazardous disregard by the hotel for it`s customer`s safety, sensitivity to customers from foreign countries, and a professional way to handle customer complaints.

My room was fairly basic, and no frills; but it was clean and everything worked and the bed was fine. It is a really good hotel for its price (it's recommended by the Time Out guide). There is a restuarant in the lobby that serves a great, cheap breakfast buffet; eggs and pancakes and juice and sausages etc. I also had dinner (again good basic, decently priced food). I needed to be close to the Staples Center, and it is a 3 minute walk to there (and a three minute walk to the 7th Street/Metro subway stop). And also I got to see how great downtown LA is, and could eat at swanky places like the Standard, without having fork out big money for their rooms. I would definitely stay in the Figueroa again!", "Date": "November 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angles", "Title": "\u201cRudest Staff ever\u201d", "Author": "KristenB", "ReviewID": "UR4025881", "Content": "I have never encountered more rude staff in all my travels.

No such luck. After a lovely stay at the Biltmore we decided to stop by the Figueroa to see the rooms, and check out the bar since we'd heard so much about it and we stay downtown a lot. We were both dressed up (again we'd just come from the much nicer and more upscale Biltmore) and in great moods. I asked if the rest. was open- no not until 4pm- then I asked if we could see a guest room, but the rude lady at the desk said they were sold out (I find it a little difficult to believe that every room had a guest literally checked in to it, it was 1:30pm Sat the 8th of Oct.- I buy that all the rooms were reserved but surely we could've seen one that wasn't checked into yet). Then my husband asked where the restroom is, and to our HORROR, the rude lady at the desk told him there were \"no public restrooms\". I said, \"perhaps you don't understand, we're here specifically to look at your hotel because we want to stay here in the future\" and the rude lady at the desk STILL SAID NO!!! I had JUST asked her if the rest. was open and to tour one of the rooms!!! Obviously I was interested in more than a free flush of what must be some pretty spectacular toilets if she has to protect them like that. Literally, I wanted to say \"well I never!\" Especially coming from the Biltmore where the customer service level is so high. Just say no to this place, those jerks can be jerks to travelers who don't know any better but I'm telling EVERYONE I know not to patronize the Figueroa.", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cBest of all worlds: exotic, cosmopolitan, priced right!\u201d", "Author": "Leslie1121", "ReviewID": "UR3998732", "Content": "This is a great property, very European exotic.... distant feeling in a big city. The atmosphere in the lobby and pool area at night has a sensuality to it and our room was great, too. The hotel is old, yet current, because of the styling in the rooms, very artsy Moroccan. Our room was very reasonably priced, very clean, had a comfy queen bed, with the criss cross type canopy like in the pictures on the hotel's website. It's apparent that the room was made up of 2 small rooms, so it was almost like we had a separate sitting/TV room that was in front of the bed. Painted concreted floors/great colors and atmosphere in the room... the windows open, and there's also A/C if needed. Looking out the windows, Staples Center and the LA Convention Center are just 2 blocks away. We were attending an event at the LACC, so we enjoyed the walk and saved $ by not having to pay the parking fees at LACC. We parked at the hotel. There was a lot of activity in the area, as Neil Diamond was at Staples the same night we were there, and the hotel had a wedding banquet in one of their really neat, candle lit banquet rooms, but we still were able to easily park. The front desk keeps your keys overnight, if you are blocking other cars when they fit your car in the lot, thus parking was no problem. Even with all the activity, there was no noise that impacted our visit, other than a siren here and there, as any city has. We'll definitely stay here again and definitely prefer this environment over the cookie-cutter branded hotel chains. Also, in the morning, they have an a-la-carte breakfast buffet set up with various eggs, bacon, sausage, cereals, etc. You pay a nominal amount for each item,l like a scoop of eggs, etc. We didn't eat there because we had other plans, but the food looked OK...nothing special. Lastly, the hotel staff was nice and efficient. The owner, mentioned in earlier reviews wasn't around, but he handled my reservation, and was a gentleman.

Fine detail is paid attention to the walls and the murials to give th soft comfortable feeling of escape to another land all the while knowing Los Angeles is only 20 feet away. The courtyard is like a world within a world . A cozy bar with all the popular libation choices. I had a Grey Goose martini streight up,$10.00 with tip. The rear has a pool where you can stroll,sit,relax and enjoy the comforts.The inside lounge has a Persian style bed that you can relax on and sip your drink on. Also some lounge chairs and tables and complementry chips and dip. The room was beautifull. Decorated with African motifs and Moroccon wall decorations and a spotless bathroom.

The unusually decorated lobby is very nice, the bar & pool area surrounded by vegetation create a very nice atmosphere for an evening drink. We spent an entire week at this hotel and never had cause to complain. When we were given our room we found it had 2 doubles, not the king we requested, within seconds the staff fixed that and we were in a gorgeously decorated old world style room that was actually as big as a suite. Now its not the most modern place in town, still has window ac units, no fancy tubs or bathrooms, but the theme decoration of the room was very nice, the bed comfortable, and the housekeeping service was excellent. Hard to define this hotel...eclectic, moraccon styled, old fashioned? but hey we enjoyed it! In fact everyday we came back to the room the windows were open with a cool breeze coming thru, havent stayed in a hotel in a long time where you could even open a window. Staples Center was just a block away, the convention center another block, very convenient for conference attendees. If you would like to try something different, stay here, if you want to do the \"same ol thing\" and stay at your typical 4/5 star hotel, go elsewhere. Sometimes different is good, less amenities, but we could appreciate the atmosphere. Likely not all would.
