After going down at the reception and explaining what the problem is, the guy just put the card through the reader on his desk and sent me away. I finally managed to get into the room after multiple retries. Next day it didn't work at all - I was lucky I was noticed by the cleaning team. Thanks to those ladies I got a new room. Otherwise, there was a girl at the reception looking always busy and upset, lots of noise coming from the bar across the street and not so nice area around the hotel. Won't go there again. The reason I went there this time is they had a good offer of 55E for 2 nights over the weekend.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cNot the same good experience that I had with other Accor hotels.\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR105764997", "Content": "I was in berlin and was looking at budget hotel and I checked in to this hotel. Well the location was not quite in the town center which explains the low prices of the hotel, but they had also saved in one more part which came as an unpleasant surprise, There were no customary tea-coffee offered in the rooms free of cost(which probably all the accor hotels have). The location was a bit noisy as there`s a pool place bang opposite the hotel. The other things were quite standard so no complains about these.

From Schoefeld Airport you have direct bus that stops few meters from hotel. Room is good and clean, nice bathroom. If you are scared of ghosts than ask for a room on street side :). Yes, the cemetery is on one side of hotel but at least is quite. I wouldnt recommend any meal in hotel becuse just few meters from hotel is restaurant with unbelievable prices called LA SERRA http://www.laserra-berlin.de/. Check the prices on web site and food is very good.

It is located near the metro station \"Grenzalee\", but it is a little bit dark there at night, and the trains doesn\u00b4t work until late. We had two problems while in this Hotel: it was hot and there was no air conditioning (at least it was not working at that time) and also the elevator doesn\u00b4t achieve the same level of the rooms, so we had to carry our luggage one level up. That was not a very good situation, and we got really mad about it.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton", "Title": "\u201cCheap and Cheerful\u201d", "Author": "HisFussiness", "ReviewID": "UR20598844", "Content": "I booked this solely on price and I am happy with it for the 60 or so Euros I paid. If you arrive late into Schonefeld it is on the right side of town and is only a 15 minute taxi ride on the newish motorway. My room was a good size but basic and in a kind of extension out back. 100 yards from the U-bahn, which connects into the S-bahn one stop away at Neukoelln, so an easy trip to the airport. There is a large supermarket adjacent to the Neukoelln S-bahn to stock up cheaply. Definitely not a touristy area, just a plain suburb, but as you're going to use the U-bahn to get anywhere in Berlin the location is just fine. I had no problems getting back to the hotel at 2am as the bahns run all night.
