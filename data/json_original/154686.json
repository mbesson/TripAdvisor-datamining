It's definitely not a Ritz-Carlton but the bathroom & room were clean. I never saw anything crawling on the floor or carpet (thank goodness!). The room felt slightly muggy but we turned on the A/C & it was fine. The water pressure in the shower (no bathtub) wasn't to my liking. But I did like that the shower head was pretty high (I'm 5'8\"). Also, the beds are kinda small (my feet dangled off the edge). And they have a piano bar (which is nice) but not when you're trying to sleep. The hotel also supplied clean towels, shampoo & conditioner (small sizes). They also had an ironing board & blow dryer, which happened to stop working on our last day but luckily one of my friend's brought her own. They also have complimentary coffee & one bottled water in the room. What I didn't like was that they didn't have a gift shop inside the hotel. So, whenever we needed to buy bottled water we had to go across the street to buy it from a vendor (looked like a newspaper stand). And whenever we needed anything other than water we had to walk to a nearby convenience store. It was less than half a mile from the hotel & we went during the day so we felt safe. And actually, I felt pretty safe throughout the whole trip. We got ALL our taxis through the hotel. And the hotel staff was AWESOME!! They were VERY attentive. So, overall I would recommend this place if you're in town for business and since it's in an Industrial area there isn't much to do. However, the staff will gladly find you a taxi to take you to the more \"happening\" spots.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel with accomodating staff\u201d", "Author": "miggus", "ReviewID": "UR112233277", "Content": "This is a moderately nice hotel in the Tlalnepantla area. As others have mentioned, it's a little dated, although the suite I was in was large and comfortable. It was clean although I did find a couple of long black hairs in the sink and on the bed. The bed is on the firm side, which worked for me. The staff was particularly friendly and went out of their way to welcome us. The buffet breakfast is reasonably priced (MXN 132) and offered a fairly nice selection including a made-to-order station. There are a handful of restaurants within walking distance, but the area doesn't have a lot of options for nightlife or dining. My biggest complaint came at checkout. There was only one employee at the desk, and it literally took him 10 minutes per checkout, all the while answering constant phone calls. Finally the bellman went behind the desk to help him manage the paperwork, which helped but still set us back 25-30 minutes. Note to all hotels: If you don't offer express checkout, staff the front desk to handle the check-out process!

The lobby is definitely impressive. I did find check-in (and check-out for that matter) quite slow as they seemed to struggle to add my Priority club number to the bill. Entering the room is where I was disappointed. Although it was a fair size it wasn't as big as I expected. It looked old with older furniture and fixtures. The AC did not seem to work fully. The TV was old and the channels snowy. I found the beds very soft. Although there was traffic noise from the window it was quiet. The room service and food was great though. My lower rating is basically due to the expectations I had. I will be back if in area next time due to the special our company has and may have a change of heart but at full rate I can't recommend.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cCool Place\u201d", "Author": "shubz81", "ReviewID": "UR28682006", "Content": "Good location if someone going for exibition in mexico City awsome breakfast :)", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lovettsville, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA Good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MTCSS", "ReviewID": "UR21458049", "Content": "The Crowne Plaza is a nice modern hotel in the Tlalnepantla area north of Mexico City.

The room was large, 2 full size beds, a couch/sitting area, workstation and lots of closet area to hang your clothes. The Bathroom was clean but had a slight musty, mildew smell. The room had a safe, refrigator and you were supplied with 2 free bottles of water a day. A coffee maker and free coffee are also included which is a nice thing to have in the mornings. The hotel had free WiFi in the rooms and lounge. The lounge was nice but did not like the 30 peso cover charge to sit there and have a drink. I did have a problem with the toilet constantly dripping at night. I informed the front desk and it was fixed that day.

Check-in was efficient and the lobby and public areas were clean. The lobby is in a hige atrium which adds spaciousness to the experience. The room was very large, even by American standards. The beds were comfortable and the staff excellent. If I were forced to be critical, I'd say that TV channel choices were limited for non-Spanish speakers. CNN and Fox News was about it. There was a movie channel and I was thrilled to watch Kumar and Harold go to White Castle. You too can get lucky. The area around the hotel is run down. I couldn't get a straight answer from anyone on the safety of the surrounding area. I rollerbladed early one morning and found it perfectly OK. I'd also say that the buffet breakfast is just average. Service is great and the coffee was good. I tried, eggs and bacon but didn't finish them. The yogurt worked though. The biggest surprise was the weather.
