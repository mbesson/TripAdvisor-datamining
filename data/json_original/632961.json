{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hostel Berstein DON'T DO IT. You will be disappointed the moment you see the place. This is not a hotel; it is nothing more than a pension type guesthouse for backpackers. What should cost 30 USD per night at most, cost me 60 Euro one night and 90 Euro the next. I had room # 5. It was featureless, had brightly painted yellow walls, and your basic prefabricated wooden furniture. Don't expect a phone, or heat on a cool October night. Berstein is on the second floor of a 5 story apartment house. After you drag your luggage up the first flight of steps, your heart will sink even further. This hostel has 5 rooms (in what must have been an apartment) on the left, and another 5 on the right. The owner is not the most personable fellow either.. Seems like all he is interested in is getting your cash. Oh yes, bring a flashlight. Peer out of your room at night and the guesthouse is pitch black. If you jump around a bit, the motion sensors might detect you and turn on the light. The entrance to the hostel is just as dark. No light sensors here. You have to feel around in the dark to find the light switch. There's no staff at night so if your room gets too cold, I recommend turning on the hot water in the shower. Don't expect a fridge, coffee, tea, or any other item in your room. Curiously, there was a blow dryer for your hair. This too can warm up your room if it gets too cold.If you are considering staying here DON't. If you do decide to stay here, well remember I WARNED YOU LB", "Date": "Oct 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR324141954", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TLBS"}, {"Content": "Good hotel Very nice hotel. good value for the price. close to a lot of attractions.
