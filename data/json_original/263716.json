This couldn't be more true. It always surprises me that people expect 5* hotels when they are clearly - and honestly - advertised as less! I don't go to Mc Donalds for rump steak and champagne. This is a 2* hotel and for your money, you get a 2* hotel. We were expecting something clean and basic and were actually overwhelmed by the quality of room we got. We had a lovely corner room with balconies overlooking the plaza and the street. The bed linen was clean, crisp and changed daily. The bathroom was big, clean and modern. The staff went out of their way to help us settle in Barcelona and were quick to help us find nice restaurants and bars. The breakfast was colossal, bearing in mind the price we paid. I was thrilled with the quality. We weren't blessed with good weather during our stay so we didn't need to open the windows at night, however, if we had, we would have expected traffic noise bearing in mind that the hotel sits on a road which leads to the Placa de Catalunya - one of the busiest intersections in the city. Staying in the centre of European cities usually is quite noisy - that's the nature of city living. You can't have your cake and eat it, if you want to be near the big attractions in Barcelona! So, in a nutshell, it's the the same story as in most in busy European cities: if you don't want to spend a fortune, you are happy to stay amongst the hustle and bustle near all the major attractions, in somewhere basic and clean - this hotel is perfect. If you want a silent night's sleep and full cooked breakfast every morning, then it's perhaps best to pay a bit more and stay outside the city centre.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUnclean, smelly and expensive\u201d", "Author": "ignacio_valdecasas", "ReviewID": "UR128096063", "Content": "I've recently had to stay in Hotel Condestable for three nights, so had time to experience their service enough.

Beds are made and new towels every day. I did not have their breakfast, there's too many lovely local places to eat. Done with the good, over to the bad. The noise from the street isn't too bad, but it's a fair bit of traffic there all day and night and if you're sensitive to sound or need fresh air while sleeping, you may want to look elsewhere.

The person behind the desk told us we had to go to another hotel near Plaza Espana, which was no where near where we wanted to stay. We had picked Condestable based on its location and price. We explained to the man that the streets were closed and that we had just walked in the rain, but got nowhere with him.

The Raid made it smell sooo much better. I wish I was exaggerating. This smell didn't become apparent until the second day, though... we think they may have put air freshener in the room the first day and it wore off. The worst hotel we stayed in on our 3 week trip to Europe. To be fair, we did have a great location by the Placa Catalunya and La Rambla. They did have a complaint form which we never filled out... what is the point? It didn't feel like one of those places that it mattered a whole lot... we just threw in the towel.
