The property is beautifully lanscaped and in an ideal location. The Indigo Beach club was one block away, Fifth Avenue was around the corner and the grocery store was in walking distance.

Everything from the room to the service at the gym, beach club and hotel were top notch. The rooms: Our room was a 2 bed/2 bath condo with fully equipped kitchen, living and dining area. It was immaculately clean and I am a clean freak. We had a huge cooler of purified water for drinking and cooking which came in so handy because we were constantly refilling our water bottles. Indigo beach club: From what I could tell this was the best beach club on the strip. The service was impeccable and the beach was gorgeous. We had a complimentary breakfast on the beach every morning which included anything from eggs to french toast, fresh fruit, coffee, fresh fruit juice, pastries etc. The food was ok, but this is what we found at most places on Playa. Not bad by any means. Just your typical caribbean island food. Gym: We used the gym 5 out of our 6 days there. They had an extensive class list anything from cycling to boxing and yoga. It was clean, convenient (1/2 a block away) and perfect for a quick workout. It was one of the more extensive gyms I've had access to at a resort/hotel. Beach: The beach was lovely, though, here is where you will see my only complaint. The boats really detract from its beauty and track debris into the water. It's funny because you really don't notice this the first few days. It wasn't until day 5 that I looked around and thought, hmm, these boats are making the water a little dirty. And by dirty I mean bits and pieces of plastic, water bottle labels floating etc. I mean it wasn't bad, but just something to be aware of. Service: The service was great. Everyone was super accommodating and always had a smile on their face. Location: AMAZING! Probably the best feature here. I wanted to get away but also have access to restaurants and clubs so this was great. We didn't have to take taxis anywhere. Everything we wanted was just steps away from the hotel. We tried a lot of different restaurants and bars and had a great time just walking up and down 5th ave. However, we weren't on 5th so our street was quiet and quaint. Overall amazing stay at this hotel and beach club. Couldn't have asked for more on this trip. We would definitely go back and recommend them to anyone.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luton", "Title": "\u201caverage\u201d", "Author": "englishguy25", "ReviewID": "UR126532175", "Content": "Found this place to be below average and had nothing on some of the other places i've stayed in throughout Mexico.

Check in was smooth but as we were in villa 417 the hike up and down stairs multiple times of day was a turn-off. Glad we weren't with small kids and strollers - would have been a nightmare. We felt the villa seemed smaller than the photos and ours felt very dark due to the colours of the walls, also you either sit on a patio which is overlooked by all or on a smaller one staring at a blank cement wall a few feet away. The room was otherwise ok - water cooler, fridge, comfy bed and nice bathroom but no bath. The penthouse terrace is also accessed from outside the villa whereas some others have an internal access. This means you either have to lock up while you sit on the terrace or trust that no one has snuck into the complex. Also the rooftop in quite exposed to other penthouse villas and having a skinny dip in the hot tub is a tricky undertaking. Access to the beach club was nice but not being able to use the Taj pool was a disappointment. The part of the beach has boats moored in front of it so have to walk about 5 minutes to a swimmable but shallow area. It would have been nice to have quick dip in a pool after swimming in the sea but this is not possible. They did allow you to use the pool shower but I think they could allow access to any pool irrespective of which part you stay in, the numbers would not be large. The pool at the Maya Villa is very small and never gets any sun, also the last 24+ hours of our stay was closed off for chemical treatment. This meant we had no access to any pool. The villas are also for sale and we were phoned one day to ask if the sales rep could show someone around - luckily we are very tidy but would have been cheesed off if we suddenly had to tidy up for a viewing. Staff were lovely, concierge was helpful, access to out of town beach club - Al Cielo was beautiful. Would I go back? - probably not.

Their beach club was not a very good place to hang out for the day, but since it was free we tried it out. The beach itself is on such a slant away from the beach, you are laying uphill and you can't even see the ocean as there is a big drop off to the beach. The water was dirty with trash and kelp, and the small beach is not groomed by staff at all as is some other places we have stayed. The restaurant food at the beach club is at most average and way overpriced, but just across the side road are two small family owned cafes that were better, and much, much cheaper, although not that good either. If you have to eat average food, better to pay less just 30 feet away. As far as the condos and property go, it was the cleanest, well maintain complex or villa we have ever rented, and that is quite a few as we go the the Roo at least 3 times a year for the past 27 or so years. Very impressive. We stayed in 413 penthouse thinking that we would have a great view of the ocean and a big terrace. Pictures can be deceiving! It was very small with barely a view of the ocean...you had to lean over the kitchen counter to see it. Unimpressive...the gas grill igniter is broken so you must light it from underneath which proved to be very dangerous. As soon as my husband went to light it, a hugh fireball blew up in his face and burned his eyebrows and lashes almost off, burning one eyelid. My brother-in-law standing next to him almost burned his shirt. Think twice about cooking out. If you have small children, this is not the place for you.

Overall - our experience was okay. We stayed in Room 417, which is often reviewed as one of their better condos. Let me start off by saying that the condo was very nice and the rooftop patio had an INCREDIBLE view of the ocean. It was perfect for sunbathing if you didn't want to walk to the beach (which isn't that far at all, by the way). The beds were super comfortable and the rooms were always cleaned very well. There is always a guard/doorman at the gated entrance to the condos, and all of them were always super friendly. The condos themselves are about a 3-5 minute walk from the beach and all the shopping on 5th avenue - which is one of the main reasons we chose to stay at this property. I can't give this hotel more than an average rating for several reasons. First, there are 12 conditioners stored on the rooftop (hidden by foliage) that make it difficult to sleep in the master bedroom of the condo. The noise from them all running is very annoying and bothered us on many occasions. The grill on the rooftop has something wrong with the right burner. When we turned it on to use it flames shot out of the side. The pool at the condos isn't much to rave about - and the way that the condos are set up, there is absolutely no sun that actually makes it into the pool. The only contact that we had with the staff (besides saying hi to the doormen and occasionally bumping into the maid on our way out/in) was on the second day of our stay. My husband needed to send an email back to the states to let someone know that we had made it safely and we didn't want to pay the $10 per day to use the internet for one email transaction. He explained that we had already made attempts to use a calling card in our room that had failed, and that we didn't want to pay the international charges to make a call. We were told to just use the phone and pay the charges. We were very surprised that the front staff had absolutely no desire to help us with something so simple.

I don't even know where to start. Maya Villa is such a beautiful Hotel. Playa del Carmen is such a beautiful location. We arrived in Play del Carmen with the hotel arranged driver and walked into an oasis. Coming through the gates you could forget you're in a city. The attention to detail in this condo hotel is mind-boggling. Everywhere you turn there are what appear to be hand-carved mayan artifacts. It took me a while to figure it out, but the pool and its surrounding tile are in the shape of a gecko! The rooms themselves are gorgeously appointed. For a family, there's nothing better when on vacation than a functioning kitchen. Don't get me wrong, the restaurants of Playa del Carmen are worth a visit, but after a long day on the beach nothing beats a laid-back dinner at home (really, it feels like home - I'd move in if I could). Speaking of the beach, the beach club is an amazing perk. We were able to go down and camp out all day. And the best part is that the Indigo restaurant offers great food and a wonderful shady break from the heat. The staff at the beach club was just incredible. One of the attendants, Miguel I think, actually brought out a bucket of sand toys for our littlest one to play on the beach. Oh, and Teresa, the concierge was super too. She had tons of great recommendations and even arranged the perfect tour of Tulum with a side-trip to a beach-side restaurant for killer fish tacos.

We asked to be moved the day before the hurricane was suppose to arrive since our room was directly in front of the ocean. Luckily the hurricane lost it's strength and turned out to be a major tropical storm. We did spend the first two days at El Taj which is an amazing place but we prefer Maya Villa! The Maya Villa is located on a picturesque street (half a block from El Taj) and it is a very quiet, more like a quaint boutique style hotel. We love this place since you receive all the amenities including the beach club which is only a short block from the beach. Their fitness club is right next door a few feet away. The units are breathtaking and everything has curved walls like all their other properties. Maya Villa has it's own Spa located in the building and it was real handy having it so close since it rained for 3 days. Oh, the concierge her name is Teresa is also located in the building and she is awesome! She knows all the best restaurants and she has a great library of complimentary videos and games. When you enter through the Mayan arch of Maya Villa you feel like you entered a private exclusive villa. Even though the place was fully occupied we felt like the whole place belonged to us. The swimming pool is the most amazing pool we have ever seen. It is shaped like a Gecko Lizard with beautiful jade colored glass mosaic tiles. It is more like a river pool with a big waterfall. They upgraded us to a three bedroom duplex which has an amazing private roof top deck and jacuzzi and outdoor kitchen with the most incredible view of the Caribbean. The appointments are luxurious and all the appliances are brand new. Having a duplex is really nice because for a family like us everyone has their own space and lots of space. The bathrooms are spotless as is the rest of the unit and the entire place. The staff is very helpful and everyone speaks English which was very helpful since we don't speak Spanish. We felt very safe at all times and the security guards are always eager to help us with anything we needed. About the beach club, The beach attendants are really awesome and as soon as they saw us coming they organized our chairs and umbrellas and set us up like we were royalty. When the sun shifted they automatically came and repositioned our umbrellas without even asking. These guys don't miss a thing and they even have this professional sun glass cleaning machine which they ask if you want your glasses cleaned complimentary. The waiters and the food at the beach restaurant are fantastic even though we thought the price on some drinks are a bit steep. Also check the promotions on their web site because we understand they offer complimentary buffet breakfast most of the time. The buffet breakfast is very popular and we ate there everyday.

But WOW, this place more than exceeded our expectations! We were in the first floor one bedroom condo 412. At first I wasn't sure about the being on the ground floor thing for noise and safety reasons but you quickly forget all that when you see how nice the place is. It was impeccable - all new, modern appliances, fully stocked, flat screen TVs in the living room and bedroom, iPod alarm clock, the bed was enormous and AMAZING, tons of drawers and closet space, even a closet for your suitcases. On top of that, being on the ground floor, the pool and jacuzzi are literally steps from your front door (and a waterfall!). There were only a few other guests at the place so we basically had both the pool and jacuzzi to ourselves every night. It was looooovely :-) :-) And more on top of that, Maya Villa is in the perfect location for everything. Its tucked away on a quiet block and its only a short block and a half away from 5th ave (the main street thru playa), the beach and to street where all the nightclubs are. Also when you stay at Maya Villa they give you cards for access to the Indigo Beach Club at the El Taj beachfront condos. The Beach Club was pretty sweet as well - the chairs were comfortable, the drinks and food were delicious. (Only downside is, as some others have said, the actual area of the water in front of Indigo has a bunch of fishing/snorkeling boats docked so you cant really swin there with the smell of gasoline. However we just left our stuff at our chairs and walked maybe 50-100 meters down the beach and the water was fine and no one bothered our stuff.) I highly recommend and would definitely stay here again next time in Playa. Its the best of both worlds - you get the privacy and quiet of being somewhere secluded yet all the best (IMO) things in playa are only a short walk away. *There is only one slight negative comment I had and this has nothing to do with the hotel itself. The last two nights were were there, there was a different night security guard. First, he told us we couldn't smoke by the pool because (guessing) he thought we might drop the ashes or butts in the water. Even though others guards saw us smoking there previously and said nothing plus it was evening and there was no one else even in the pool (and hardly any other guests staying at the place for that matter. Also, to clarify, we weren't actually smoking IN the pool, we had our ashtray on the ground next to the pool). Fine, not a big deal, I get it, so we put the cigs/ashtray on our little porch and got back in the water. This guy literally kept lurking the whole evening, passing by over and over again like he thought we were going to try to sneak and do it again. We finally just went inside because he was being such a stalker.The second night, our last night, same thing. It was raining so we couldnt go in the pool, we were just sitting on our little porch chatting and having a couple glasses of wine, this guy kept passing by over and over. Anyways, it was very invasive and annoying. I'm sure it had nothing to do with the hotel because all the other guards were very friendly and helpful, this guy was just clearly a jerk.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jardin\u00f3polis/SP - Brasil", "Title": "\u201cDon't miss this wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Gustavo B", "ReviewID": "UR118405791", "Content": "Excellent in all itens, no matter you looking for fun, beach or peace.

I didn't realize my oversight until I sat down to start planning our 2012 trip! Our family of three (mom, dad and 12 yo son) spent a week at Maya Villa in February of 2011. We were in unit 417 which is one of the top floor 2-bedroom \"penthouse\" units. Our unit consisted of a large 2 br condo plus a huge private roof deck with hot tub, outdoor kitchen, shower and eating/lounge area above the unit. We had a fantastic view of the ocean from our deck. We were so comfortable during our week there -- I don't think we'll ever go back to \"just\" a hotel room ever again! First, location. This was the first time that we \"settled\" on a hotel that wasn't right \"on the beach\" but the fact is that our walk to the beach was no longer than most mega-resort rooms. It's a pleasant half-block down a quiet side street and only a couple of feet further than the El Taj \"Beachside\" units. We thought the nicest swimming beach to walk to was on the other side (east) of Constituyentes, maybe a 5-10 minute walk. The beach in front of El Taj is a 2-3 minute walk. The only thing to be aware of is that there is no elevator which might be unexpected for someone booking the \"penthouse.\" The unit was furnished and outfitted impeccably. Nice linens, comfortable beds, well-outfitted kitchen. The kitchen was \"pre-stocked\" with basics like cold drinks, coffee, etc. at reasonable prices. We had a rental car and opted to do a full grocery run and had a lot of fun at Mega browsing through the Mexican products. We had been to Playa before and new that we would be picking up local seafood to cook and the grilled chicken (our absolute favorite). We loved having a fully equipped kitchen. We whipped up frozen cocktails with the blender and had our own happy hour in our hot tub on the roof deck.... really, it just doesn't get much better! There is no restaurant in the property but we didn't miss it. We had breakfast every morning at El Taj, right on the beach, which was included as a booking bonus. Set up as a continental buffet (breads, pastries, fruit, cold meats and cheeses, juice, etc.) plus your choice of a hot dish from a small but tasty menu. We also loved Era Ora, almost next door, for a casual pizza and Italian dishes. Maya Villa is a short walk from all the restaurants and nightlife on 5th ave. Actually, it's amazingly quiet considering how close it is! We booked our stay with the propery's management company and daily housekeeping was included. I don't know how this is handled for privately arranged reservations, such as through VRBO.com. Housekeeping was very good and surprisingly inobtrusive considering that the unit is so large. As much as we loved our stay at Maya Villa, we did experience some issues and they were all to do with maintenance. First, Playa seems to be one huge construction zone and we were aware before our visit that there was construction going on next door. We were told, however, that the exterior was complete and that it would just be \"quiet\" interior finishing work. Well, it wasn't quiet. We were OK with it during the day but the jackhammering right on the other side of the living room well into the evening got annoying, especially by day 3 or so, and we finally complained. It got marginally better and ended earlier in the day and we were also given a price adjustment. Customer service by the management was responsive. We also had some strange issues with the lighting/electricity. Some of the overhead lights began to flicker like strobe lights... and then the bedroom lights wouldn't turn off, at all... we solved it by systematically removing the light bulbs. Construction issues, I assume. Then our hot tub started to really, really smell and it took them an entire 24 hours to have it cleaned. The gas grill never really worked the whole week which put a damper on the grilled seafood dinner we'd planned on the deck. So, small annoying things that didn't bother us all that much except that we were paying high enough rates to expect that they wouldn't happen... All in all, a great stay, even with the small inconveniences. I think the \"condo-hotel\" is a FANTASTIC solution for families who want to really experience Playa without the \"all-inclusive\" trappings (which, frankly, I don't like) but still want all the comforts of home and the pampering of being on vacation. We had plenty of space to spread out, have some privacy for the adults and we could enjoy having drinks and a hot tub under the stars...

We only used it once, it was always quiet, and either empty or with one or 2 people in it. There was also a guard or security at the front entrance to Maya Villa at all times, so it felt very safe. The location is FANTASTIC. on a very cute and QUIET street, we had no idea and were SO glad to have been lucky on a quiet street. one block either way is packed with restaurants and lively shops. The whole area was so charming and unexpectedly fun for us, really amazing food so close by. At check-in you are provided with a very good list of places to eat, concierge was also very helpful. The Monkey Cave was our fave restaurant. We also spent a day at the Al Cielo beach club at Xpu-ha beach which the concierge booked for us, it was gorgeous out there, and an incredibly beautiful beach, definitely a must and only a quick 20-min cab ride away! just be sure to bring your own beach towels if you go there... otherwise Guests at Maya Villa have free access to the beach and deck chairs nearby in front of El Taj which we enjoyed, though the ocean there was not as nice as Xpu-ha beach. We booked transportation through the hotel website for a car to and from the airport, and it was very nice to have someone waiting for us at the airport, but when we go back next time we'll just take a taxi as that seemed just as convenient and much cheaper. Once you're at Maya Villa you really dont need a car as everything is walking distance or there are taxis waiting around the corner... We thought the service was very good, we had a great time and would definitely recommend/go back again.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kristiansand, Norway", "Title": "\u201cVery nice condos!\u201d", "Author": "Hildent", "ReviewID": "UR115334983", "Content": "The hotel consist of spaceous condos, and ours was really nice.

The photos from their website is very accurate. The pool is not too nice, its very small. The grill was covered with aluminium foile, and they told us not to take it off when griling. This was actualy very dangerous, because when liting it, the gas almost blew up in our face! Be aware off this and do not use it if all covered in aluminium foile, especially if children are around. It did rain a lot while we were there, and we had a leek from the roof in one of the bathrooms. We reported it and they tried to fix it by putting towels somewhere up there. Of course it didnt help, we reported it again, and they said they couldent fix it. We was promised another condo, and hours later the same night I went to the reseption too see what was going on. Seemed like they were not doing so much to sort it out, but after a while I was offered a condo in the Porto Playa complex. i asked to see the condo before moving, and it turned out, like I thought, it did not at all have the same view as the one we already had. The receptionist tried to chitchat and cut me off with that condo, but I said it was not acceptable. I found him to be quite arrogant, but After some discussion he apologized and said he could not do anything because the managers were on vacation and that he could get fired for giving us a new condo. I find it hard to believe all this, but I decided to wait until next morning (this was a sunday) and talk to the other receptionist. I asked for free WIFI as a compensation for the trouble and he agreed and gave me free acsess for the rest of our stay. Next morning I called the reception and talked to the woman this time, she was very helpful, instantley got us settled in a new Condo in El Taj, wich was an upgrade.

We used to spend on average 50 US Dollars in taxis from the hotel to Playa every day (the alternative was to stay lacked up at the resort) By staying that El Taj or Maya Villa you are literally in the heart of the city, with walking distance to the action (if you are here to party) or secluded enough to read a book and watch the sunset. We enjoy walking to the beach or to our favorite restaurant. My favorite thing is to buy a real French Baguette at Chez Celine, a bottle of Mexican Wine at La Cava, some great cheese and enjoy it in my balcony before my siesta. (try doing that in a hotel) Housekeeping is amazing, the ladies are incredible they watch every detail and make you feel right at home. All the furniture and appliances are first class and are kept in great shape. We will never stay in a hotel when visiting Playa del Carmen, this alternative is just a great value. We love it!!

We were there for 4 nights and the property completely exceeded our expectations. We stayed in room 408 (a 3br/3ba with a rooftop deck overlooking the ocean). Despite the fact that Maya Villa is a block away from the beach, we had great views of the beach and the ocean. A small sampling of what we liked best about Maya Villa: Cleanliness- the place was new and modern, great design, and spic and span. The cleaning service comes every day and does a great job. Location- we were worried we were going to be too far from the beach, but it turned out our location was perfect. It is an extremely short (90 second) walk down to the beach, and you are right around the corner from 5th avenue. It really was the best of both worlds. By the way, I had read one review mentioning construction and/or 5th avenue noise, we didn't hear any noise at all. Staff- they were quick, friendly, efficient, and responsive. The front desk is always manned, and there was a security officer out front every night all night. Pool and hot tub- we all loved the pool at the Maya Villa, very unique. Rooftop- probably our favorite part of the actual place. Had a wonderful view, an awesome lounge area, and a grill that we fired up a few times. Beach and Indigo Landing- the beach is right in front of El Taj (which also looks like an awesome place), and we had a great time there. Very nice attendants, comfy chairs, good services, 90 seconds away from the Maya Villa. Couldn't be beat. Yes there are some boats on the beach or in the water, but they are small fishing boats and frankly added to the vibe. We had no problem swimming in the ocean just by walking a hundred yards down the beach. Finally, I know this is long, but we went during a unlucky timeframe and had two straight days of torrential rain. Yeah, our trip surely would have been better if we had more sun, but it was the Maya Villa that saved our vacation. We had space to relax, the pool and hot tub to sit in during rain, and it was so close to 5th avenue we were able to stroll during periods of light rain up and down doing some shopping and bar hopping.

Pros: - Beautiful, first class accomodations - stainless steel appliances, marble floors, bathrooms, vessel sinks, nice sheets, nice crib for the baby, excellent cleaning service - Rooftop deck - My husband and I could put the baby down for a nap and then grab the baby monitor and head upstairs to grill and hang out. I could tan while my husband napped. It was great. - Location, location, location - 1 block from 5th avenue where all the hustle and bustle is and 1 block from the beach. It was so quiet but still in the middle of everything. - Great service - the concierge offers DVDs you can borrow (including Elmo!), was always very attentive to any of our requests - Private Beach Club about 20 - 30 minutes away - as a perk of staying there you have access to Al Cielo Beach Club which is located down a dirt road in Xphu-Ha. This is absolutely one of the most amazing beaches I have ever seen. You have to make a reservation through the concierge because there are only about 8 palapas. It is a $20USD cab ride each way but completely worth it. It is really breathtaking. We ate at the restaurant there and had our most amazing meal of the trip - the seafood paella. It only costs $100 Pesos to rent a palapa (about $8USD). Highly recommend you do this while you are there. Cons: - The El Taj beach is not that nice. While we never had a problem finding chairs, the beach directly in front of El Taj has fishing boats in it and is dirty with gasoline. You have to walk down the beach to be in clean water. - Our remote didn't work and they couldn't fix it, but did offer us 3 free days of wifi in our condo so we were happy. The wifi is $10USD/ day but with it you also have unlimited free international calls. - Stairs - We were in the penthouse units which was the 3rd floor but keep in mind there is not an elevator. There r only 17 units in the whole property which is awesome. The bellboys take your luggage up and we were fine with it - but if you have trouble walking up the stairs, this could be an issue.

At first we were skeptical but were pleasantly surprised. We had been to Cancun before and, although the beach was great, we didn't really like the general atmosphere of crazed youth in ultimate party mode. Playa del Carmen is much more subdued than Cancun. There are clubs to be sure but they are all in one small area and you can avoid them quite easily if you want. Access to the sites of the jungle is very easy from Playa. There are many places suitable for good family fun within 10 minutes of downtown. We went to a place called Xplor that had caverns, Zip lines, swimming, rafting, 4 wheeling and a fantastic buffet, all for one reasonable price. Now for the condo. It is a nearly new facility and is maintained very well. The architecture is reminiscent of Gaudi's work in Barcelona; very striking but functional at the same time. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is just perfect. It's on a quiet street but within just a few blocks of the main shopping and restaurant district i.e. Fifth Avenue. The restaurant selection is amazing and we didn't have a single bad dining experience even when we left the main area looking for authentic Mexican fare. Going in the other direction just one block is the beach, with it's clean, white powdery sand and dazzling azure water. Like I said, a perfect location.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Maya Villa Condo Hotel & Beach Club", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1488864-Reviews-Maya_Villa_Condo_Hotel_Beach_Club-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$184 - $417*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avenida 1a Norte, entre Calle 14 y 16</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1488864", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/85/57/bf/beach-club.jpg"}}
