The location is well placed being walking distance from Sharaf DG Metro station yet placed off the main motorway so to avoid some of the traffic noise. \u00a0A\u00a0short taxi or metro trip is all that is required to reach to the main beaches in Dubai. While The Mall of the Emirates is only a few hundred metres walk. The rooms were well appointed, modern and spacious for the price. 2 free water bottles are supplied each day. A separate toilet from the bathroom which housed both an individual shower and a bath. Space in the shower was a little tight though and the spray head was oddly directed towards the wall. The TV was a large Samsung LCD supplied with a standard collection of English and international channels. The bed would be considered hard by some but this seems to be the standard experience with many Middle Eastern rooms. Free internet was included in my price but it was served via a wired Ethernet cable. Free Wifi can be found in the lobby, reading room and business centre. The centre also houses 3 free to use desktops. During my stay breakfast was offered for 55DH which was a choice of a la carte in the hotel restaurant\u00a0or buffet in the interconnected IBIS next door. I preferred al a carte which had a greater variety than the buffet and was cooked to order. If catching the metro to the hotel, get off a Sharaf DG station on the red line and get a taxi outside. The taxi will cost 10DH but it makes finding the hotel for the first time much easier.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cshop and ski\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR125754891", "Content": "Great location next to Mall of Emirates shopping mall with indoor ski resort.Italian restaurant at hotel was good value although reception tried to charge me twice for breakfast but was easily corrected.Staff very polite and helpful.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait City, Kuwait", "Title": "\u201crough start\u201d", "Author": "Yagen5", "ReviewID": "UR125329834", "Content": "When we got to the hotel, we had a minor rough start since we had made a mistake in our bookings and booked a suite for 3 adults, but had put it was only 2 adults.

The service here is easily on par with the best I have seen across the globe - especially given it is a mid-priced hotel in the area. The rooms (well, our room) was a good size, but the toilet and bathroom were both tiny. I mean, you were brushing your stomach against the door when closing it in the toilet and the shower was a funny trapezoid shape which was bordering on small for the large side and battling to lift your arms on the other side. In downtown Italy, Paris or London you would expect this and it would be totally ok... but in Dubai where everything is massive and spacious, it is very much out of place. The beds were as hard as planks of wood but the staff were really helpful and placed 4-5 doonas (fluffy quilts) under the bottom sheet to make it more comfortable. Maybe this is a Dubai thing but I have slept on the shores of the Colorado River and in the sandy deserts of Moab, Utah and didn't come close to how firm these beds were. We very nearly changed hotels over it but were only staying for a week. The breakfast is great and you have a choice of both the a-la-carte menu from Novotel or the Buffet breakfast in the adjoining Ibis (big door connecting the two) as it looks like the two are the same ownership or management. The major draw card of Suite Novotel is it's closeness to Mall of the Emirates. This mall doesn't compare in either size or selection to Dubai Mall down town, but it has the largest indoor ski run in the world (and only black diamond run) within 5 mins walking distance. Admittedly you have to cross a couple of roads and negotiate some traffic but it is easy enough to get to and easily the cheapest way to learn to ski. Everything but gloves and beanie included in the price and the training staff at Dubai Ski are excellent. If I had my time again (and I will be back) I would probably stay at the Kempinski Hotel located in the mall and 50 metres from Dubai Ski entrance. The pricing is a little bit more but gives you ready access to a range of restaurants and activities with some funky bars. Don't forget to try Salmontini Restaurant whichever hotel you stay at where you can overlook the ski run while eating some pretty good Sashimi! Oh - and finally, Internet charges were AED100 (about US$25 for 12hrs or $50/day) which for an advanced country is really steep!!! We ended up getting a couple of Ahlan SIM packages with Etisalat which gave us high speed internet and phone calls for about the price of a day's internet at the hotel.

I am not a 'shoebox' fan and like room to swing the proverbial cat. So I thought that a \"suite\" would be a good sized room or more like a hotel / apartment. I was therefore disappointed to find that the dividing line between a room and a suite - I kid you not - is a curtain! Yes - this room has a curtain that separates a sofa and table from the bed! That is what Novotel mean by a suite! I fully accept that I misunderstood the description of the room - which is a normal to big sized hotel room - however, I was disappointed. I also find the layout of the room strange - a tiny loo - by the door, separate and tight-ish bathroom with no loo and then a massive minibar / kettle area and then the rest of the room dominated by big cupboards. I don't know, but I would have thought that a massive group such as Novotel would have room layout down pat. The common areas are all very smart - buzzy lobby - nice pool and gym. I also found the bathroom quite grubby. I know its hard but finding one of housekeepings hairs in the sink isn't great either. I ordered room service and while the food tasted good, the plastic take away boxes and plastic knife and fork were a bit of a put off and made me question the Dhs 55 ($15) price tag. The bed is comfortable, nice and quiet room but I am not sure I would come back or recommend this hotel. The Kenyan guy at the front desk was friendly and there is a great Ghanaian bell hop. Free parking in the basement is good. No wifi in the rooms but free wifi in the lobby. I find the whole internet thing a bit annoying - either it should be free or not but this free here / pay there thing, especially when the pay internet is cable only is really annoying.

This hotel is very near to the Emirates Mall, which was great for food as there is a large food mall serving various styles of food. This meant we could eat really cheapily in what can be an expensive city. The other great thing about this hotel is that it around 400 yards from the new metro line at Sharaf station, although there is another station in the Emirates Mall. A day's pass on the metro is 16AED, about \u00a33.00, and you can see all the major sites for this amount, except for the Palm. The hotel itself has a pleasant lobby, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. We were quickly into a suite which was very elegant and well worth the money. We had just come off an 18 day cruise, so having a bath and a shower was a wonderful sight, and the walk-in shower was excellent. The room is large, well furnished and had a safe which is always an advantage. Plenty of hanging space and drawers meant there is no problems with storing your clothes. I am a light sleeper but there was little noise to wake me up. We bed and breakfast and were stunned by the breakfast as it was three courses, including a variety of cooked dishes. We were most impressed, and the evening menu was not that expensive - around \u00a311 for fish and chips. All in all, we could not fault this hotel, and it even had a gymn and swimming pool on the roof terrace.

Our travel agent has told me that the hotel is right inside the Mall of the Emirates, but it is actually a city block away and not that straight forward to walk to as there are busy roads in between and we had to look for the entrance. If you want a hotel actually in the mall, we passed the entrance to Kempinkski Hotel inside the mall and it received great reviews. However, that aside, our hotel was very nice, the staff were extremely helpful. Benson, who both worked on reception and brought our bags to the room was charming - I asked him about tipping (always a sticky problem for Aussies as he don't tip as a rule) and he explained that in Dubai, \"tipping is from the heart\" and was quite happy that I only had a very small tip to give as it was accompanied by a smile and thank you. (Benson told me when asked that the word for thank you in Arabic is 'shakran'). We didn't have much time and left it a bit late to organise anything for the morning we had free before our flight. Benson suggests talking to them as soon as you check in if you only have one night and they will organise their driver to take you on a tour - slightly more expensive than a planned tour, but he recommended this if you have limited time as you can please yourself how long you spend at each place. Another tip is book ahead if you want to have morning tea at the Burj al Arab as it is booked a fairly long way in advance. My daughter didn't really want to go sightseeing so instead we spent the morning by the roof top pool, which was delightful and not to busy. The lifesaver on duty was very polite and helpful.

It was a wise decision as no matter where you stay in Dubai you will inevitably have to take a taxi or transit to get to your destination. It's a 6 -8 minute walk to the Mall of Emirates ( walk diagonally across the empty lot towards the mall entrance located at the Kempinski hotel) . There are 2 minimarts and a few cafes and restaurants located across the street , we found the Turkiye restaurant to be very good. We found the bed to be very firm so my wife actually slept on the little day bed/ sofa and I slept on the bed . The free internet computers where very handy . I thought the restaurant was very expensive considering the class of hotel and always went across the street for breakfast /lunch.

It easily fit three adults. It also had two bathrooms and a separate toilet- which is very welcome when sharing a room with two women. The room had all the essential amenities: mini bar, a safe, and water heater. The room also had a separate thermostat. We found the service also spotless. We asked for a converter, an extra blanket, and new towels, and these were brought it in very quickly. The staff were welcoming and nice. Oh by the way, they let us check in at 11 am. The negatives. Essentially only one. The location. The hotel is not exactly easy to find so best to get accurate directions before you go here. It says Suitehotel Mall of the Emirates but it is really about a couple of blocks away from the exit. We had to cross a couple of streets to get to the hotel (which can be difficult if you had luggage/children in tow). Overall, the location is convenient.

First of all, the location is great. It is right next to Mall of the Emirates and it is not too far from The Palm or Jumeirah beach. Down Town and Burj Khalifa was some 15 -20 minutes away by taxi - but don't forget that traffic in Dubai can be a bit crazy. In the area, within walking distance from Novotel, there are caf\u00e9s, Pizza, miniamarts, spas and pharmacies. Metro is close and there where always taxis to get. We stayed in a Master Suite which was brilliantly furnished. With two curtains we got two bedrooms and a living area. Or simply just one very big room. The kids shared the sofa bed and there is one more divan by the TV. The double bed was a bit hard and uncomfortable for my taste and the AC system was a bit loud. But after an activity filled day I was so tired so I fell a sleep anyhow. The only part I really did not like was breakfast. First morning me and one of the sons went for the buffet, which is located in Ibis Hotels facilities right next door, accessible from the inside. Food was ok and kids under 12 (I think) ate for free. The second morning I decided to try one of Novotel's set menus. After three waiters and 40 minutes I still had not gotten my food. That is when I left, angry and hungry. It also irritated me that nobody helped us at 1 AM when we arrived with luggage and sleeping kids from the airport. There was one from the staff out side, but he cared more to continue chatting with a friend. Since no bellboys work during the night, a man from housekeeping helped us after check in with the bags. He on the other hand was very tentative and asked if we needed an extra pillow for one of the boys.

We arrived very tired after an overnight flight. I had booked an extra night so that we could be gauranteed a room when we arrived at 5:30am but the message hadn't been passed on and there was a little confusion because the hotel thought we had been a 'no show' from the previous night. All was resolved quite quickly and we were taken to a clean, cool, ultra-modern room. When we woke up we found the room overlooked the building site next door but there was no building happening, so luckily it was quiet. A room facing the street would probably have provided a better view. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful and the buffet breakfasts exceptionally good. The Italian style restaurant food available in the evening was ordinary. My only real complaint was that the hotel was located so far from both the interesting cultural centre of old Dubai around Dubai Creek and the glamorous beach resorts along the coast. The only nearby site of interest was the Mall of the Emirates which was interesting for a visit and to see an indoor ski slope in action, but shopping malls have a certain sameness the world over - even the glamorous ones. The hotel itself was very good though and we all made use of the free internet access in the foyer.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ABERDEEN", "Title": "\u201cExcellent 6 night stay\u201d", "Author": "philsadon", "ReviewID": "UR61121649", "Content": "Hotel was great for a 6 night stay, room is more than adequate for 2 adults and one 8 year old child. Location great, 2 mins to mall of emirates and cheap taxi's from right in front of hotel. Small pool on roof top with a seperate toddler pool and life guard who would bring fresh towels and sort out a bed, albeit beds are limited but lets face it, you dont choose this hotel for the pool. Deli is 24hour and within the hotel, restaurant and bar in Ibis next door which is accessed throught the deli. Kids are not allowed in the bar but you can take your drink out of the bar at the chairs around. A pint of lager is about \u00a38, which is roughly what you will pay in most hotels in Dubai.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aalesund", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "mabrun", "ReviewID": "UR60331752", "Content": "We couldn't picked a better hotell for our stay in Dubai.

The food in the Hotell restaurant was cheap and very tasteful. Don't hesitate.. just go there.
