{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Go to the Shaba in Jimbaran Bay! The Shaba-bali (www.shaba-bali.com) and the Villa balquisse are fantastic properties, directly opposite the Intercontinental, but a gem hidden away. The owner is French Morocaan and an Interior designer and that shows in The Shaba desihn and fitting which was opened in Nov 2007. Our room (one of only 3) was huge, full of antigues and and massive bed, a modern bathroom with stand alone bath and walk in showers. The towels were changed twice a day if you used them and the sheets were chnaged each day.We had the place to ourselves for 6 days, including our anniversary where they presented a wonderful meal outside on the pool decking. The food was some of the best we've had anywhere in the world. The staff were amazingly friendly yet discreet and unobtrusive.We had a dream holiday. thank you so much to the Shaba", "Date": "Jul 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR508239982", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RTL91"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297696-d1069761-r17486525-The_Shaba-Jimbaran_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1069761", "Price": "$864"}}
