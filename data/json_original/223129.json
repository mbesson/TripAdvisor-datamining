BUT I will tell you I switched to the Marriot on Canal Street for the same price and why i did in a bit. Front desk clerk as very fast upon check in.... BEWARE even if the room is prepaid, they will charge you a \"resort Fee\". Not expected but not that much either. The door man helped me find everything and had wonderful suggestions. There is a coffee shop in the lobby, but it was never open while i was there. This hotel is close to everything from Bourbon Street (if you like that) to the Street Cars. We walked most of the city. THe French Quarter is wonderful and Mothers is a must for lunch. The lobby decor was nice. BUT it had a horible smell that made me ill everytime I walked throgh. Apparently it is supposed to be a pleasent floral scent....... but It was way to strong and I couldnt breath. The room. Small. Nice view of the river and city from the 7th floor. The room was clean and adequate for the one night i stayed there. The bathroom was clean. There is no pool. So these are the reasons I left and walked to the Marriot (WHICH I LOVED). 1. The female desk clerk hit on my 17 year old daughter and made her very uncomfortable. 2. I coulike the smell. 3. I was able to get the Marriot at the exact same price with no resort fee. $70 4. I didnt like the atmosphere for my young children. I personally would not stay here again for the reasons mentioned above.

It was super pricey for this particular reason. $750 for two nights. Plus all the added fees. This hotel was my last resort so I went for it. Our room was very shabby and small. No window. Kind of looked as if it was falling apart. I could go on and on complaining, but I must say when I walked OUTSIDE the hotel, I was happy with where I was.

That is pretty cheap compared to other hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at before that are $20+. The bad: Upon arrival I had my boyfriend wait outside so I could get us valet parking and check in. I informed the lady at the front desk that my hotel itinerary indicated I would receive 50% off valet parking for BOTH nights. They did not want to honor it even though it clearly stated on my hotel reservation itinerary. She then called a general manager supposedly and said they could ONLY honor it for one night (July 4th) not both. And it just gets worse she told me that the valet parking for the second night (July 5th) would be $40.00 instead of the normal $29.99. I honestly think since they gave me the 50% off for the first night they tried to get their full amount one way or the other and charged me $40.00 for the second night. I don't understand why they would advertise such a false advertisement if they are not going to honor it!

The room we were in was 7th floor and a Deluxe Queen. Since the marathon was on Sunday, we came down on Friday and stayed until Monday. Lobby was nice and clean as was the elevators (4 of them). What we didn't know was that Queen rooms are interior to the hotel and there was a regular size faux window with nice curtains. The glass blocks used to make the window allowed in some light (must have been from a skylight or nigh light) during the day. At first I was a little claustrophobic since the room was small and I wasn't used to not at least having a window in a hotel room. Front desk was understanding, however the hotel was booked solid for the weekend, but they would try to work us into an exterior room. Room was small (but there was only 2 of us)..smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in. Queen size bed was against the wall on one side so who ever slept there either had to crawl over of shimmy off the end of the bed. Just don't run into the desk when you do it in the middle of the night. After the first night we decided the room was sufficient since we wouldn't be staying in the room much except to sleep. Firm bed, nice sheets, heavy down comforter, and nice pillows...we slept like babies! (I have back pain if the beds are too soft..no back pain for the whole weekend!) Friends stayed on the second floor where they had a balcony. Room was same size as ours but with a king size bed. After the first night they were dreading it since street noise was a big problem even with ear plugs. We used the valet parking since the parking area was a couple blocks away at another hotel. From past experience I've learned that if a hotel offers valet parking it a good bet you want to use theirs instead of risking parking on the street. Car didn't move much and no dings or scratches. Bathroom had a tub/shower, toilet and small vanity. Plenty of ventilation when you turn on the light as I thought it was going to suck up the towels too! No risk of fogging up the mirror in this room. There was a hair dryer, soaps, lotion and shampoo. Plenty of towels and when we called down for more they were there in less than 5 minutes. The coffee shop wasn't open the morning of the Marathon, but it did open later that morning. It would have been nice to have had a muffin and coffee, but hopefully they will get the hint and open next time.

There is even a sign posted at the front desk about the fee. Yes, the room WAS small, but this is common in the NOLA Downtown area. In the past, I have paid about $240 per night for a room at the Inn on Bourbon Street that was only about 2 feet larger. MANY hotel rooms in NOLA are small and charge $30 per night to valet park.....I paid only $15 per night parking.

I arrived on Friday at 4:30pm, my car was parked and I was checked into my room within 15 minutes (I reserved over the phone on Wednesday).

The frontdesk offered to refund the $8.95 resort fee for each day for our party of six since complimentary breakfat was one of the big reasons we chose this hotel. They told us bookit.com was updated before to remove this from their booking. We were given a small queen size room upon checkin. I asked for a move to a corner, King bed room and they were able to accomodate the request the next morning. When we needed to leave, the front desk arranged for a cab to be waiting on us. Overall, staff were fantastic. The carpeting throughout the hotel could probably be replaced as it is worn and dated. One of our rooms had torn sheets placed on the beds. Bathrooms are small, two cannot share at the same time. We did not have any noise problems at all, even with a batchelor party and batcherlotte party in the hotel all the weekend, no issues and they even invtied us along to party. The hotel could just work the 'resort fee' into the overall price and I would bet it would receive less negative feedback as that seems to be the rott of the comments on this site.

You have to consider how extremely busy they are during this time of year but they all smiled and were at least cordial. We had free wifi access that was very fast. The complimentary soap smells awesome and the room was pretty clean. The hotel is located right in front of where the parades run through so you can step right out of the hotel and onto the sidewalk and be right there watching the parade. Sadly that is about all I can say that is good. Now for the bad. We had a double room and 4 adults and we were absolutely tripping over each other. There are 2 double beds, a nightstand, and a tv armoire crammed into a tiny room. This room isn't even the size of a normal one bed hotel room. The bathroom is equally small, our toilet broke 4 times, the water never really gets hot and there is no water pressure at all. Now to be fair the maintenence people were very friendly and finally fixed the toilet issue. I'm also willing to bet that the hot water/water pressure issue was due to the hotel being packed, but if things were done right we should have all had plenty of hot water. The other problem we had was that it took over an hour to get our car when we checked out but that was also during a parade. Our main reason for not staying here again is the size of the room. You do not get what you pay for in this case. They are basically packing people into tiny rooms and making more than the Motel 6 does for larger rooms. Another reason we will not stay is not the fault of the hotel but it's location. You are right there for the parades but if a parade is going on you cannot get across the street. You can go a block the other direction and get to Bourbon St but we enjoyed the French Market area and Decatur St much more and it was impossible to get there during parades. So I guess this hotel would be great for a group of teenagers or very young adults but it's not for anyone else. Also whoever said something about the noise, I don't know what they were hearing because we never heard a thing.

We stayed in Covington the night before and did a check of the hotel on Friday, asking the front desk when and how to check in on Saturday the 5th, as we knew the parades and such would be a problem. Was told that the check in time was 3pm between scheduled parades. O.K. We planned our return for that time.

I booked it because the property was running a special that included free breakfast and free parking. I was familiar with the location because I have stood in front of it many times waiting for the trolley on other visits to New Orleans. I had also patronized the lobby bar but I had never actually been in the hotel but from what I saw, it seemed like a decent property. The property is ideally located- one block from Canal Street and the French Quarter. The staff was very friendly. Based on the room that my party was assigned, this property is a dump and there is nothing luxurious about it, as stated on the website. Deceptively, the lobby area looks pretty nice as does the hallways. I could not believe the condition of the room when we entered, however. Where there was carpet, it was filthy. In some areas, the carpet was worn down to the flooring. There is not a room on their site that looked like this room. The walls and armories were marred with colored crayons. There was not any sort of desk in the room as shown in the pictures on their site. There was nothing contemporary about the furnishing. I would categorize it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Early Garage Sale.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The beds were supposed to be Queen-sized but they were not, they were Full-sized. The sheets were so dingy and wrinkled that they must have been packed up since Katrina. The sheets were so thin and worn you literally could see through them. The coverlet was supposed to be a duvet. The inner comforter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filling had separated into many balls making it very lumpy. The pillows were the same way. The filling had separated into lumpy balls. The site advertised modern bath amenities. We had nothing but a few dingy, worn towels. We arrived rather late that evening so we decided just to sleep in our clothes & socks and check out as soon as possible the next morning. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be deceived with their specials and free amenities either. The free parking and free breakfast was recovered by a per person \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and with exorbitant Service Fees. While waiting for our car, I checked out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Free Breakfast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The breakfast area is located behind the double doors behind the reception desk. This area must double for a janitors/housekeeping closet because there was trash piled up in the corner as well as housekeeping carts, brooms and mop buckets. There was no seating available but stacked against the wall were tables and chairs. The actual breakfast consisted of sweetened & unsweetened breads, regular coffee, powered cappuccino & hot water. There was nothing to dip the cappuccino out of the container with and nothing to stir condiments into your coffee. There were not even any disposable plates or saucers. But what was worse, was that the table cloth was black and absolutely filthy. The dirt and stains were not from that mornings serving either. They had been there through many presentations. This property has mostly been rated as a three-star property so I was not expecting six-star accommodations but I would not even give it any stars. Any property, no matter what the rating, should, at the least, be clean. I read some very positive reviews about this property. I can only write about my personal experience.

We had a reservation somewhere that we had to cancel because of this. The entire lobby was packed full of people all in the same situation. There was no waiting space for anyone, so the lobby floors were full of people waiting for hours for their cars. They wouldn't let us go get our own cars. None of the staff looked organized and their system for retrieving cars was a disaster. Once we finally got our vehicle and were driving off, we even saw a few of the valet guys hanging out on the sidewalk talking to people down the street when they were supposed to be getting cars for the tons of people that had been waiting for way too long. This specific thing was so poorly handled and aggravating that is wasn't worth it to stay at this hotel for any price.

Since the hotel is a block away from Canal/Bourbon, you can isolate yourself from most of the rowdy crowd noise yet walk with confidence / safety to all of the festivities. We stayed at this hotel last year and opted for a standard room. Although the standard room was small, it had new furniture and was very clean. This time around we stayed in a suite room (room 209) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. WoW! This room was bigger than my first apartment. We had a full-size living room w/ a leather sectional couch, small kitchenette (microwave, small refrigerator, sink), two-vanity bathroom with a full-size shower and separate tub, and a great balcony. The hotel staff was fantastic. Specifically, the Valet team! Just a quick note for any of the hotels around Bourbon/Canal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c daily parking for any hotel in the area is around $30.00 per day. So if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to travel a long distance during your stay in New Orleans, it may be better to hire a taxi/shuttle to/from the airport instead of a rental car. The valet staff usually has to park your car several blocks away from the hotel. So, it is wise to pre-plan and call ahead by 30 minutes prior to needing your car. In our case, the valet ticket clearly said 45 minute wait time, but our car was at the front door within 10 minutes.

So the cons you ask? Oh, where to start... The hotel web site and Expedia both stated that valet parking was available. However, they failed to mention that it cost $30-$40 and in order to get your car, you had to call 45 minutes in advance. This ruled out the opportunity to make last minute plans to go somewhere out of walking distance and almost made us late for our dinner reservations at Emeril's Restaurant. Also, upon checking in, we were told there was a mandatory hotel fee which covered wireless internet, long distance calling, and a bunch of other things that we absolutely did not need, want, or use. Once the fee and parking were added to the bill, the hotel was way too expensive for what we got. As for the room, the walls were apparently made of paper. We could hear every bit of what the people next door were talking about, and they were not being loud. Also, we were on the third floor, and the street noise was terrible. New Orleans is a 24-hour city, and between the people screaming/cheering, the street car, police sirens, and traffic we couldn't sleep at all. (I would definitely suggest that no matter what hotel you choose in New Orleans, ask for a room high above street level.) To make the sleeping issue worse, the bed was incredibly uncomfortable, and it seemed as though we could feel every spring. Additionally, the bathroom was so tiny, you couldn't even get in the shower with the door open. The toilet was practically under the counter, and two people could definitely stand in the space, much less share the sink or mirror. We've had more room in baths on cruise ships! Also, there was no complimentary bar of soap, shampoo, or anything. There was a coffee maker, but only decaffinated coffee was provided. Who going to a 24-hour city like New Orleans wants decaf??? Finally, we were told by the hotel web site and Expedia that there would be a complimentary breakfast. This amounted to coffee and biscuits/croissants, absolutely nothing else. I'm not a coffee drinker, and there wasn't even orange juice or water to quench my morning thirst! In closing, I am actually from the New Orleans area, and believe me, there are much better places to stay for the same price.

The cleanliness of the room was more than satisfactory although a little more attention couldve been given to the shower (little bit of mold in the grout). As a hotel professional myself, I would only recommend that the management pay a little more attention to the small things like peeling wallpaper (small places in the rooms and hallways), lightbulbs that are burned out, handprints on the large windows, and again the bathroom.

If you're a light sleeper, request a non balcony room. -our room was also on the second floor over the bar in the lobby, so we could hear music from the bar.

(once again no sorry sir) When checking out the next morning I experienced the young lady at the front desk was letting her friends come in and help themselves to coffee and croissants. The I proceeded to check out and was to be charged for parking and two days instead of one. After that I started to look for the valet, that was no where to be found. I informed the inattentive young lady at the front desk and she phoned him. When he showed up I told him what I drove and ticket number after 10-15 minuets he called the front desk and asked for the number again, then what car I drove again. After a total of 40 minuets my car showed up. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure happy that my airline could find where they parked the plane that day.

Continental apparently books third party through Travelocity, which we didn't find out until we arrived... then the \"fees\" started to add up. Continental pre-charged my cc for the $69, plus tax. What they don't tell you is that any \"service fees\" that \"may\" be extra are in fact mandatory fees. Upon arrival we ran into a \"resort fee\" of $9.95 and then an internet \"booking fee\" of $2.95 and then if you bring a car, be prepared to pay! The only reason we got a rental car was that the hotel was very reasonable. The car was $40 per day. If you want to park your car at the hotel, there is a mandatory \"valet\" parking fee of $29.12 per night!! Yes, per night!! That's almost as much as the car! They don't have their own parking lot and use a parking garage. We were told by the manager that we were not responsible to pay the resort fee since we booked online, but when we got home, it was on our cc! We never even signed anything! Also, when I called, they told me they would credit the $9.95, but it's been a week and no credit yet! Be careful where you go there, everything is extra. The online booking tools do not disclose these specific fees, so make sure you call the hotel before booking anything and ask for all the details. It will be a cold day when I deal with an internet booking tool again without investigating with the hotel first!! This particular hotel is normally about $119 per night. I think if you add the fees to the $69 \"special\", it's just about there. Also, the people are near impossible at the desk to squeeze a nickle back out of!

I made a reservation at the latter site. The disparity in the glowing descriptions versus the reality of the property would be funny if the price were not so expensive. Since a friend and I stayed at this hotel during Jazz Fest 2006 we paid a dear price, which had to be paid up front at the time of reservation, and our sense of humor was at a low point. If this hotel touted itself as a one- or two- star property, and charged accordingly, I would not have blinked. As it is, this hotel fancies itself as a luxurious boutique hotel. They claim to have \"spacious rooms\" but, as other reviewers have pointed out, the rooms are very compact. Our room had two double beds (and a window, which I hear is not always available). The beds were each against a wall, and the space between the beds was only wide enough for a bedside table. In other words, perhaps a meter between the beds. The desk was located at the end of the beds, with an armoire on each side. The space from the foot of the beds to the desk was probably three feet. Wide enough to maneuver as long as the armoire's doors or drawers were closed. The room was clean. Although it was labeled non-smoking there was a smoke aroma, probably from a shared venting system. We bought a scented candle and burned it while in the room, and that helped alot. The AC was powerful but came at a price. While the AC was running there was a loud high-pitched sound. At first we thought it was an alarm in the outside corridor, but when we investigated we discovered it was coming from our ceiling AC vent. We checked another room and found the same problem. Every time the cooling unit cycles off (every five minutes or less) it did so with a tremendous bang, like someone had just angrily slammed our room door. We resorted to ear plugs for sleeping. The hotel says it has bathrobes but like other reviewers have noted, we found none. The furniture is supposedly handmade but we found it cheap and flimsy. The bedside radio clock flashed endlessly as it kept coming unplugged. The reason? The socket was at the head of my bed and the mattress pushed against it. Every time I sat on the bed the clock came unplugged. We could not move the plug as it was inserted through the bedside table. To move it we would have had to dismantle the table. The wireless internet costs $8 a day and was not worth a cent. It was a weak signal and dropped my connection every 3 - 5 minutes. The TV worked great, and had a good selection of channels. You will be charged $2 a day for the room safe. It was just a bit too small for my laptop to fit inside, but smaller laptop would likely fit. Our room had no book listing hotel services, no phone book, and no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. Small things, but annoying. Our phone was dead after the first day, too. Not sure why, but since we had cell phones we didn't investigate. The bathroom was clean and well-appointed with a bathtub, shower, good water pressure and plenty of hot water. There was a hairdryer and makeup mirror. The towels were of good quality and the amenities are from 'Bed and Bath.' The beds were comfortable, had duvets and 5 pillows each. The coffee maker has no carafe but brews coffee into a coffee cup, using a prepackaged coffee filter the size of a tea bag. It was impossible for me to use my own coffee in this machine. I tried, and only made a mess. There is a bar at the first floor lobby but no evidence of breakfast -- continental or otherwise. There are, of course, many places to get great food nearby. The streetcars that travel St. Charles at the front of this hotel were ruined during Katrina, so were not running. They are going to return, eventually. In any case, Canal Street with it's many bus connections and streetcar is only 1 block away. The biggest problem we faced here, besides the Jazz Fest inflated prices, was lack of customer service. We had reserved a non-smoking room with two beds. When I called the hotel prior to our arrival I was informed they would not and could not guarantee two beds or non-smoking. I was persistant, contacting the Clarion customer service folks who assured me that we were guaranteed the room we had reserved or that the hotel would make other arrangements. The hotel did, eventually, guarantee us a room but I would certainly check before arrival if room type or number of beds was important. The hotel has key cards, and doors have dead bolts with additional fold-over security latches. There were three efficient elevators. We did not see any bell staff during our stay, and no noticable security presence. Non-guests seemed to be wandering the hotel at leisure, and even smoking in the elevators, with no one to challenge them. The so-called mini-bar in our room was actually a dorm sized refrigerator. It was not stocked but the front desk gave us a key so we could use it. The website says fridges are available for rental, but we were told not. In any case, we had what we needed. In short, if this was the only hotel available in the area AND had a good rate I'd recommend it.

No doubt because of the special web price, we were assigned an inside room, which would normally face the interior well of the building. But the view must have been so inferior that the window panes were thick opaque glass, so we were saved from what must have been a very unsavory view!

Unfortunately, basic elements of hospitality, helpfulness and cleanliness were clearly not priorities of this establishment. (I stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and found it to be very pleasant.

I would say that most of them were not an accurate reflection of our stay. We had a wonderful room, extemely quiet, on the 7th floor. We did upgrade to a Jr suite for a reasonable premium. The room was lovely, with a large king bed and nice linens. The bathroom was ok, nice, clean but a little on the small side. I know it's a boutique hotel and expected it would be small. The staff was friendly and helpful. The bar was ok but was open only limited hours. They did have nice live music Friday and Saturday nights. The room was very clean and had wonderful windows. The carpets in the hallway were ok - a little worn looking. The location was pretty good. Just one block from Canal street and the French Quarter. I would definately recommend a stay here if you don't need to be right in the Quarter. The downside was that there was not a lot of restaurants/bars open in the evening in the direct vicinity. The only real complaint was that there was not hot water in the shower. Appears that availability of hot water varies. Not really appectable at a supposedly renovated hotel. Other than that we had a great stay.", "Date": "October 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Alky1229", "ReviewID": "UR2334101", "Content": "This is a great hotel, with a great location which can't be beat for the price. To address the people who said the room was small, hence the reason it is called a boutique hotel, that means the rooms are smaller, if you come from a city with some of these hotels you will understand. In regards to the complaints about the staff, the front desk was fine, I don't know why u would have anymore interaction with them other than to check in/out and a question or 2. The bar staff was great the one bartender even reopened the bar at 5:00am when he was closing, for my friends and I and a couple of other people, just because we asked him to. He stayed open till 8:30am, if thats not hospitality then I don't know what is.
