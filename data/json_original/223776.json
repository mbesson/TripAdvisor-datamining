In my opinion, that hotel has gone down hill over the last 2 years so I wanted to try another property that was still reasonably close by. Only 5 minutes farther up I-5 North is the Del Mar Marriott. It is so much nicer than the one in the La Jolla. It has been completely updated, and the rooms are very clean & spacious. The concierge lounge is outstanding with a very wide variety of hot & cold foods for both breakfast & dinner. I did not use the pool area, but it looked really nice. I don't like that the parking garage isn't attached to the hotel because you have to walk completely around the building so I deducted a star. It is also shared by an office building so there are many reserved spaces that hotel guests can't use. The parking is cheaper than many hotels at only $10/night. There was discount applied to my bill so that may only apply to higher Marriott status levels. The hotel is in a very quiet business park area so I had no problem with noise either outside of the hotel (traffic/people) or inside either. This also means that there are few services within walking distance, but there are lots of sidewalks if you want to walk or run. It is a straight shot down Carmel Valley Road (about 5-10 minutes depending on traffic and the lights) to get to the beach and the cute little Del Mar restaurant area. I highly recommend eating at Jakes Del Mar but you have to make a reservation. They have the best seafood but it's definitely pricey. In short, if you want a Marriott property near La Jolla/Del Mar, this is by far the nicest one. It's great for business but would also be a good base for a San Diego vacation. If you need to be closer to downtown, the Marriott Gaslamp District is the best of any Marriott property in all of San Diego, however it is also usually the most expensive. If you're looking to use points for vacation, definitely choose the Gaslamp. It is ultra modern, hip and in a spectacular location.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNice property.\u201d", "Author": "Greg M", "ReviewID": "UR125297762", "Content": "The property is very clean and the rooms appear new. Although I did not visit the pool area, it looked very nice from my window and appeared to have a good social scene. The hotel is about a twenty minute walk (5 minute drive) from the Del Mar Town Center, which has some good dining and shopping options. The property isn't really far from things to do, but you pretty much have to drive if you want a good selection. Downtown Del Mar and the ocean is about a 12-15 minute drive. I had a few relatively minor service failures, but although annoying at the time they didn't really taint my view of the overall stay. The Hampton Inn next door is a bit better value and seemed clean (no parking fee, free breakfast and slightly lower rate) but the Marriott definitely has a nicer property.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Hotel but Very Noisy Pool Area\u201d", "Author": "Enjoy2travel", "ReviewID": "UR125187715", "Content": "My husband had a business meeting in the area so I had a couple of days to relax.

The address says San Diego, but is still about 10-15 minutes north of what a tourist would consider \"San Diego\". So if you're looking for a place NOT in the hustle & bustle of downtown but close by, this is a good place to stay. Despite the fact we were there for a soccer tournament and there were other teams staying there, it did not seem overly loud or busy, even for a holiday weekend. One drawback is everything costs extra. Self-parking $15 or valet parking $20. Internet $12. Plus all the taxes etc really increased the price of the room. Parking garage was decent but does have a height limit. Pool looked very nice but we didn't have time to use it. My room was the farthest from the elevator on an upper floor, so maybe that is why it was so quiet...no one wandering back & forth past my room!

What else would a business traveler need? Couple of side quirks: 1) No safe in the room. Somewhat strange for a hotel catering to business travelers. Safes do not take up too much space, folks. 2) But they did have a minibar in the room - and it was turned off and completely empty. Either my persona did not effuse Marriott with confidence in my solvency, or minibars are \"out\" at Marriott as permanent room features. Here is a suggestion: take out the non-functioning minibar and replace it with....wait.... you guessed it! A safe! 2) The hallways are a bit claustrophobia-inducing - and I mean really, really narrow. But, I suppose, this cannot be helped. 3) As I mentioned before, bar and restaurant are decent. Can get really busy and crowded real fast, as your fellow hapless corporate warriors converge after day's meetings and presentations, so get there early.

When I made the reservation, they told me they only had \"Concierge Rooms\" left to book, which are more expensive, but I had to be in San Diego so I booked the room. The room is actually the same room everyone else has, but you have access to the 11th floor \"Concierge Room\" for breakfast and afternoon appetizers. That is the only difference between booking a regular room and a concierge room. The breakfast was very good, and the afternoon appetizers were nice too. Not sure if it is worth the upgraded price. The hotel room was very clean, bed was comfortable, bathroom very large, parking in the garage was $18.00 per day and valet parking was $24.00 per day. The Doubletree across the street had free parking so I was a bit irked by the parking fees. Also, the Doubletree had a shuttle that would take you around. That was nice as the Marriott didn't have one. My colleagues were staying at the Doubletree so I was able to take advantage of the shuttle. These hotels are really in a business section, so you need a car to take you anywhere you may want to go. We did get to go to the beach near the 15th Street area - lots of restaurants and shops in that area and it is about 15 minutes from the hotel.

I like the Del Mar area that this hotel is in because it's not the \"rest\" of Del Mar near the fairgrounds. What I wasn't necessarily fond of is getting in & out of the hotel due to the orientation of the hotel on the street. But everything in this business park area has the same issue. We ended up at this hotel because we bid on a 3 1/2 star level on Priceline rather than our usual 3 star in this area. The 3 star is the Double Tree that, while not as \"pretty\" and not featuring what seems to be an outstanding restaurant, doesn't charge for parking.

However, we are delighted to meet your needs by changing bed linens upon request. Simply place this card on your pillow each day you would like your bed linens changed.\" Nowhere on this card does it state that the bed will not be made and that the room will not be picked up, but that is what happens at this hotel.

Here is where the nightmare started (no exaggeration, in fact it is a bit toned-down). On the night of the 24th, we decided to rent a humidifier from the hotel, since the first night in the room was dry (a typical California night). At 12-midnight, the fire-alarm goes off. With the 11 months old baby crying in that terrible noise, we do our best to try to put off the alarm for about 5 min. A lady calls in (who cannot speak much English, and has no clue about the humidifier), and tells us that she is going to send someone over. A young man walks in the room, climbs on top of the bed with his SHOES ON, and struggles with the alarm for couple of minutes, then rips the alarm out the wall saying, \"This is broken. I hope there's no fire from your room tonight, hehe.\" I, then realized that the fans in the room was not working, and the humidifier has fogged the room, and caused the alarm to \"break.\" We were very unsatisfied and decided to tell the front desk about what had happened. The next morning, I walk up to the desk, and ask a young lady to pass on the message to the manager about the humidifier incident, and I was stunned by her response & attack. Young lady: Well, OBVIOUSLY, we cannot foresee the alarm to break. Why didn't you report the fan problem in the first place? Me: (Trying to figure out why she hasn't apologized ONCE, and why she is blaming the GUEST for not catching what is broken in the room) Uhh... could you please just pass on the message to your manager? We are very upset, and this is the first time in our lives that we made a complaint to a hotel (we have stayed at numerous hotels around the world, and this is by FAR the worst service). This is not what we've payed for. Young lady: I am glad to replace you to another room, if that's what you want. IF YOU HADN'T RENTED A HUMIDIFIER, THIS WOULD NEVER HAD HAPPENED. Me: (Trying to manage my anger from the rude tone, and how she tried to justify them not being responsible for the broken alarm REPEATEDLY) We will come back and discuss this, since my family needs some sleep. PLEASE pass on this message. Since we could not go back to the hotel until around 9PM that night, I called the hotel, and they told me that we were getting an upgrade to room #1022, and access to the Concierge Room. We were not please with the young lady, but we thought that the hotel was doing there best at that point. Early next morning, I tried to check the internet on the first floor, and the guy at the front was using one of the computers (out of two, and the other one was broken). It was not very pleasant having to wait for the WORKER to just sit there, browse through the internet. I did not complain about this, since we did not want to \"rat\" on this guy, but there was more to come. We go into the Concierge Room to get some breakfast on the last morning. The lady there, told us that our name was not on the list. I had to explain everything to the lady, and she understood. We were again, not very satisfied by this simple miscommunication within the hotel. When checking out of the hotel, the young guy at the front, had his hands in the pocket throughout our conversation. We have (again) never received this kind of service in our lives. The young workers at this hotel SERIOUSLY need a training. I would NEVER want to stay there, with that kind of service.

I really disagree with the two-star rating that Trip Advisor is giving this hotel - it is at least a three-star hotel. It is much nicer than a Holiday Inn or similar hotel. This is the second time we have stayed here. This time, it was much busier than the last time. There were a lot of group events going on so the bar and restaurant were constantly crowded. That is a sign of the success of the hotel, of course. The restaurant, Arterra, seems to be extremely popular with more than just hotel guests. As far as the rooms are concerned, everything was fine - comfortable bed, rooms cleaned on time, nice amenities in the bathroom. One thing I really like about this hotel is the location. Although it seems unexciting - it is basically in the middle of a business park so is not a good choice if you don't have a car - it is only about a 15-20 minute drive to downtown San Diego and 10-15 minutes' drive to Del Mar, La Jolla and Solana Beach so you have the option to go in either direction for dinner, beach or entertainment. It is also a lot less crowded and much mellower than staying downtown.

It is, after all, mainly for business travelers. Our reservation was wrong upon check-in. They only had us there for 1 night instead of 3. We had a room on the 11th floor, concierge level, ($244 a night) which included a full breakfast daily, and appetizers and dessert at night. Our room was located by the elevator(shared wall), and across from the concierge lounge. Knowing how noisy that can be we tried to get our room changed, to no avail. The room was small, the bed average, and the view from the room was either the highway or the building next door. We tried a few appetizers that evening before looking for someplace to eat. Pretty average. The breakfast the next morning was just eggs, toast, mangled bagels, and sausage, fresh fruit. Not awful, just very average and not worth the exta money we spent that the business didn't cover. The appetizers and dessert in the evening were the same. No big deal.

At first, I thought it unremarkable, from the outside to the pool. But after the first night, and with all the travelling we did, I ended up really appreciating how close it was to everything, how helpful and friendly the staff was, and how comfortable the beds were. The hotel is in a safe and pretty business and residential area. I felt very safe here. This building district was clean, nicely landscaped, and well lit. The residential neighborhoods were above average to high end. Beautiful flowers and landscaping abounded. We saw vegetation we wished we could grow in our backyard. I saw arbors, pergolas, climbing vines, it was a gardener's dream, and really added to the feel of the place. Casually elegant, lushly landscaped, a true coastal town. We were very close to a Plaza that had lots of stores and lots of casual dining options. We drove towards the Del Mar beach (maybe 5 mins at most) and took 13th street to Bullys for our first night. We had read from a guidebook that it was family friendly. It was . . . in a way. It was definitely a bar, and despite anti-smoke laws, it smelled of smoke and there were plenty of drinkers there. I wasn't comfortable here. It cost us $80 and without a doubt, the sirloin steak I had was delicious, but the atmosphere wasn't family friendly, the server was distant, and the sides were average to below average. My husband and I had opted for the steak and shrimp plate, and were each given 3 shrimp. The salad was a classic iceberg and the rice pilaf wasn't very good. There was a child menu the guidebook had promised, but for $5.95 the choices were chicken nuggets, hamburgers, and mac and cheese. We expected to pay high but we also expected to have good to excellent food. My daughter, who adores mac and cheese, couldn't eat more than one bite here. She's not a picky eater either. We ate brunch at IHOP at the Plaza after that, the only IHOP I had ever seen with mercedes, bentleys, and bmws parked in front. I am sure there were other family friendly restaurants nearby, but we were hard put to find them. There was a Red Robin in the plaza, and when we checked out the nearby La Jolla Marriott (it was very close to a shopping mall and restaurants there), we ate at Sammy's Fire Grilled Pizza. That was great. They had yummy salads, pizzas, and a good children'ts menu. Prices were $10 and up. Most restaurants we found were higher end electic sea food, fine dining establishments. Which is great, but not for a family vacation. We ended up eating also at the attractions we went to: SeaWorld, Legoland, and the Zoo. SeaWorld actually had a decent selection. The apple fries at Legoland were also pretty good. The Zoo was more expensive than SeaWorld, which surprised me. This Marriott has the new Marriott bedding, feather pillows, and feather comforter. It was extremely comfortable. We had two double beds, and they were the equivalent of a full size bed. I think it would be comfortable for two adults and two children, though just barely. There was a pool that from outside my window looked unremarkable, but we tried it out after a long day, and found the heated outdoor pool to have a comfortable temperature and to be very relaxing. It had two lap lanes roped off to one side. There was also a jacuzzi that was a nice respite as well. You can also rent a mini fridge, though there are no microwaves. We couldn't have driven more than 15-30 minutes to any of the attractions we wanted to see. We were going to stay downtown at the Marriott Marina towards the end of our stay for 2 nights for a local vibe, but just came back here. We were familiar with our way around, and found it to be more reasonable (parking elsewhere is $18 to $22, but here it was $11). It wasn't as crowded as downtown and I ended up being very pleased with it. There are fees for virtually everything (local calls, internet, etc.) but even with all of that, for a full service Marriott, this hotel or the La Jolla, would have been hands down much cheaper than downtown overall. I had wanted to tour Balboa Park, and peruse downtime, but there simply wasn't time for it. The people here are very friendly.

We let our friends choose the hotel and they said the Del Mar was a nice place. The Marriott turned out to be an excellent hotel. Its proximity to downtown however is somewhat far. Figure 20-25 minutes drive to downtown SD. The room for the most part was excellent. The beds were extra comfortable, and my girlfriend loved the pillows and the down comforter. The bathroom was very spacious and the entire room was spotless. The rest of the hotel we didn't get to see much of as we spent most of our time partying in downtown, but from what I did see walking in and out, it seemed very classy.

We were able to find street parking behind the hotel on Valley Centre Drive for free. It's hard to find during the day, but after 5-6pm, you can find parking there.
