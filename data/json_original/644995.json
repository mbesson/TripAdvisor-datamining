It is right in the heart of Kings Cross, but the rest of the advertising is misleading. I booked a suite for AUD$104, but am very sceptical whether I was given the room advertised. The windows could not lock, the cleaning was not done, used towels were not replaced, but just refolded, the tap in the bathroom wobbled all over the place, the room was much smaller than advertised. On the positive side - it did have a fridge, coffee making, double bed, and shower that worked. It may be worth booking a Studio room at less cost, but forget the so-called suites. Formule 1 is far better value and at a cheaper price (AUD$89).

It was Queens Birthday in New Zealand and I went over on the Thursday. I had mentioned to the woman on the phone that I don't appreciate loud noise and she suggested that they would put me in a room in the centre of the hotel. From the tone used I asked if the reality was that I would be better off NOT staying at their hotel but was assured this was not the case.When I got into my room about 2.30 pm I found that it was tiny and had no shelves for clothes, never mind a wardrobe. Planning to go to the Opera House on the Friday night I needed somewhere to hang my good clothes and was respectfully re-assigned to a room at the front above the street. As with the previous review, I was asked to pay as I registered, not as normal, when checking out; the strategy surrounding this became apparent later.The noise from the street was uproarious and ear-plugs did little to lessen the effect, there was also a booming (less so in this room) from the dance-music night club immediately through the wall from the main part of the building. The club is open until 5am Th/Fri/Sat/Sun. That was the end of any sleep for me until the Monday night. There is obviously no extra baffling in the walls and no double glazing - it truly was a nightmare. I noted that the manager disappeared for the weekend, sensible her. The rooms are well appointed (other than that small one I wrote of before which could easily be solved with a standing hanging and shelf rack between the end of the bed and the sink bench).I hear they opened in January and while there are phones in the rooms they are not connected. TVs, beds, and facilities are great, if you are not suffering from sleep deprivation. When the night porter (Ali- helpful chap) helped me to move again during the middle of the night on Sunday, I found to my dismay that although the street noise was significantly lessened in the small central room, the impact of the nightclub was multiplied. It was like trying to sleep in the middle of a giant tympani, while the percussionist was still drumming.While the manager seemed intent on dismissing the reality of the noise, at least one staff member (Kaijsa) had the honesty to be embarrassed about the situation.Now you'll have guessed why they take the money upfront. Once you've spent the $500, you are much less likely to leave and go to somewhere that understands that renting a bedroom, at whatever price, is so you can SLEEP in it.With the nice rooms and beds, plus the other great facilities in the rooms, I was tempted to mark this 2 stars 'okay but with problems' but the very basic enjoyment of any of these facilities was undermined by the overwhelming noise problem, one they either can't or won't fix. Don't know how much money's left in their coffers to do it, as one whole floor is still to be opened and one would think double-glazing at least would easily repay itself.Summary: Nice rooms, beds, facilities. Location and noise management a NIGHTMARE. You may go once and even stay for the term you'll be asked to pay for at the beginning; but unless you are deaf or a masochist, I doubt whether you'll return... Maybe with a member of the NSW Tourist Bureau???
