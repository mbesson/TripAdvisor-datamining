The vacation was great, and the staff is suberb. Fernie and Vincent, miss you guys!! The rooms are chic and new, unfortunatly we had to switch rooms from 1407 to 2002 because of a weard smell. We switched to 2002 in the middle of the night, and the hotel switched your loggage and we kept the new room the rest of the vacation. Thank you for your quick and good service:)! The food is amazing, they have 3 restaurants and the hacianda (buffet). You need to try all of them, they have amazing food on all of them. Book a table at the oriental restaurand, and sit in front of the chef while he makes the food and throw knives in the air!! Super fun! They have great shows in the theatre every night at 9. Be there! And the entertainment staff is always there to make your holiday more and more fun. Join the Ocean Idol, you will remember it!!! ;) If you want to have a quite day, lay down at the beach area. There you can only hear the breeze and the ocean... Lovely. And if you want some other day to be more fun, lay down at the pool and the entertainment staff will keep you busy with water aerobics, yoga and more fun.. There is also music and drinks by the pool. Great drinks:) If you want a great beach area, you need to look someplace else. The beach at playa del carmen was washed away in some hurricanes, too bad. But they have great pools, and you can take the local bus to some local beaches. About 30 min away you can fin a little beach called la playa xpu-ha. There thea have great food, drinks, live music, very chill. Just a handful of people.. Go there... Book an appointment at the spa, and come early. Sit in the relaxation room for 30 mins and you will be a new person. !! Oh so good. And book a photo session at the photo shop. The girls there take AMAZING photos.. Thank you everyone at ocean by H10 for an amazing vacation, thank you doctor for making me well again, entertainment staff, spa personell, waiters, bartenders.

You get shown to you table which is a nice touch. Rooms - Nice, clean and compfy. With dressing gowns and slippers a nice touch. Plently of clean towles every day.

This was our 5th time to Mexico and while we have stayed in much nicer resorts, overall the OMR was pretty good. It's a small resort, and with that are pros and cons. The upside is easy access to everything and you can even get to know the staff. It has an intimiate feel to it, but still offers everything you would expect. The pools are great, it's clean, there's a spa and fitness room, security, and a la carte retaurants. Because of its smaller size however, there are only 3 a la carte restaurants - Japanese, Italian and Mexican. The main buffet dining room offers a different theme each evening for dinner, but they all seemed to blend into the same thing night after night. Food is ok. If you like seafood, there was fresh shrimp being cooked up on the grill nightly and they were fantastic. The Japanese restaurant was quite good - we went twice. We upgraded our room upon check in to what they call \"priviliege\". I wouldn't recommend the upgrade...I thought it was a waste of money and not worth it. The \"privilege\" building is located as far away as possible from the beach area, so if you're looking for a room close to the water, you won't find one in this building. It's located next to the main lobby buidling. The OMR has a very, very tiny beach. Most people hung around the pool or in a sandy area near the water. The beach is basically non-existent. It's not recommended for swimming and it would be impossible to snorkel. No one was in the water - it's just not conducive to any kind of water activity. We ended up going to another beach for our water activity. Weather, as always, was fantastic in Mexico. We hung out around the pool and service was excellent. Overall the OMR is a resort that offers a quiet, relaxing and low-key vacation.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little Falls, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cLoved OMR!!\u201d", "Author": "Jodi64", "ReviewID": "UR126208988", "Content": "My husband, myself and two other couples stayed at OMR the first week in March.

What a wonderful vacation we had! It was fantastic from the moment we arrived at the resort, until the moment we sadly left. I cannot say enough good things about the resort and it's staff. The resort is gorgeous! It is not a huge spread out resort like some that you have to walk miles to get to things. It, instead, is more intimate with fewer guests and reminded me of a small gated neighborhood, where, when you walked around; you recognized your neighbors as you passed them by. It consists of several smaller two story buildings that hold 8 units each with beautifully kept grounds and lots of lovely landscaping and walkways....not to mention the wildlife....cute coati and racoons, lounging iguanas, and mischievous black birds that were always fun to watch. The restaurants were all great. My favorite were the Italian and the Mexican, but the tempura at the Japanese restaurant was mouthwatering, too, and the chef's show was very entertaining, so make sure to reserve a seat at the grill area. There was always a great selection at the buffet, too. Make sure to have them make you some garlic butter shrimp....wonderful!! Our room was great . I like a softer bed and they provided us with a foam mattress pad right away when we inquired about one. We always had lots of hot water for showers. Our room was always immaculately clean and the frig well stocked. The swimming pools are terrific. One has a deep section that is 8 1/2 feet deep and also neat shallow ledges to lay out and tan on. The other has a swim up/walk up bar and was used as the activity area for water-excercise classes, volleyball, etc . The water in both was crystal clear, and usually a perfect temperature to swim in. There were always lots of lounging chairs available either around the pools or on the sandy area with lots of shady areas available when wanted. The best thing about the resort, though, is it's staff!!! Everyone there, and I mean every staff person that I came in contact with....was wonderfully friendly and helpful and always had smiles on their faces. Many started addressing us by name after only a day or so and knew or preferences for drinks or even how we liked our coffee or eggs cooked.....unbelievable! I have a hard time remembering some acquaintances names that I've known for years! Everyone made us feel so very welcome! I actually kidded the general manager that they must be putting something in the water to have such a happy staff! You could never find a nicer, happier group of people to be around....anywhere! They definately kept the smiles on our faces, too! I had a full massage and facial at the Spa with Hector.....great experience.....well worth the money......my muscles are still relaxed! The only possible negative I could mention about the resort.....would be the actual swimming beach areas. The sandy beach lounging area is very nice, but the beach adjoining the water isn't the best for swimming due to seaweed and other natural sediments carried in by the surf.....which the resort can do nothing about....other than keep cleaning it up and removing it.....which they do a great job of. It was the same with any of the resorts along that general area of ocean front. The beach was nice to walk on for excercise, though, and there is a lagoon about a 10 minutes walk that has a nifty river that you can get into and float out to a shallow sandy area with clear, clean water where it meets the ocean. We did that several times and had a great time. It fulfilled our wanting to get into the ocean. We did take the free shuttle for a trip into Playa del Carmen and swam at a beach there one day, but we thoroughly enjoyed the pools at OMR the rest of the time. If having a perfectly pristine beach to swim in is a huge priority.....you may want to consider a resort in a different area.....but this one has it all otherwise and I totally recommend it!! My husband and I were celebrating our 46th anniversary while at the resort, so I booked us into one of the Romance suites....a little larger two room suite with a jacuzzi tub, which included the priveleged status for preferential reservations in the restaurants, top shelf liquor, and a reserved area on the beach area with padded tanning beds, etc......but we became friends with many other guests that weren't \"privileged\", and they were just as happy campers as we were. They had gotten into all of the restaurants that they had wanted to and were happy with their drinks, service, etc. and had always found a tanning lounge in the beach/pool area without having to get up at 6 AM to get one, like at so many other resorts. Would I do the \"privileged\" again.....sure. I enjoy a glass of Grand Marnier in the evening and like Bacardi or Havana Club 7 Rum in my drinks. Plus, at my age, I can use all the extra padding I can get on my chaise lounge! :) But, do I feel you need to be \"privileged\" to have a wonderful time at OMR....no. As I said before.....I HIGHLY recommend OMR. I want to personally thank their ENTIRE staff for making our vacation and 46th anniversary such a wonderful experience. A special extra thankyou to Claudia, Maria, and Suzanne who really went the extra mile to make sure we felt we were a special part of your OMR \"family\".", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "dundee, MI", "Title": "\u201cWould go back in an instant.\u201d", "Author": "mwaggon", "ReviewID": "UR126049459", "Content": "My wife and I traveled during spring break.

The good points are: Rooms..Clean,comfortable, well equipped and spacious. Food & Drink..Good selection, Plenty of choice in the main buffet. Italian..excellent food, service & setting. Mexican..Very good. Japenese.. Did'nt think the food was that authentic and it lacked atmosphere. Big thanks to Rosalyn & Sarai for looking after us making sure we got the correct drinks and plenty of them. We found all the staff really attentive & friendly. Thanks also to Concepcion for keeping our room very clean & well stocked with towels & toiletries. The grounds are beautiful and immaculate. The pools were very clean and lovely to swim in. The evening entertainment was ok and there was a good atmosphere in the foyer bar and outside terrace during the evenings. The bad points..The sea at the hotel was terrible, full of seaweed, rubbish etc. It was rough & smelly. The beach area where the sunloungers were was fine but the seaweed washed up onto the beach everyday and although they tried to clear it, it was an impossible task. We did walk to the lagoon on several occasions just to be able to swim, but you can see all along this part of the coastline how the sea has eroded the beach and sand bags have been placed to protect the beach areas in front of the hotels. We also felt it was not good that unless you were on the Premium package you could not book the theme restaurants and as there was 6 of us there was limited space anyway (ok for 2-4 persons). Even in the main buffet there was only 2 tables that could sit 6-8 people so we did ask if they could be more flexible and one night they did push 2 tables together. Apart from this it was a great relaxing holiday that I would be happy to recommend as long as you are made aware of the seaweed problem. We used the free shuttle bus once but book early the day before you want to go. We also got a taxi into Playa del Carmen one evening and that was good. We also hired a taxi to Akumal (great beach & snorkelling) and Puerto Morelos (more traditional Mexican local beach good for snorkelling trips & diving). We did'nt do Tulum as we went there before on a previous holiday but it is well worth a visit (Ruins & gorgeous beach) If you want a first class hotel and you don't worry about swimming in the sea go and have a great time like we did!!", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201c\"Can't wait to go back again\"\u201d", "Author": "Philip F", "ReviewID": "UR125985814", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Ocean Maya Royale for 2 weeks from the 21/02/12,it was our first visit to Mexico and to be honest we could not fault it.

This was our first all-adult resort but trust me, if we are not travelling with our teenage children, it will NOT be the last! :) My husband and I arrived at the resort with no other guests on our shuttle so we had a very quick check-in followed by a private meeting with Helen, the VIP Concierge, who provided us with details about the resort, then a quick cocktail and a ride to our room by Alex, who smiled constantly and pointed out items of interest on our ride to the room. We were in 2806 which had a beautiful view of the pathways and other rooms. The sound of the palmtrees outside our door was an awesome welcome. Our room was spotless and looked exactly as the photos online do. We noticed right away that our bed lacked a foam topper, and, having read about them on Tripadvisor prior to leaving, we asked Helen for one as soon as we went up for dinner and when we got back to our room, it had been put on the bed. Yes, the shower leaked onto the floor, but this is strictly due to the design of the shower. We always kept our towels each day (and did not put them on the floor to be replaced) so that we had an extra towel to put at the base of the shower for safety - this worked well for us. As well, we also read about not getting faceclothes which we have also experienced at other all inclusives so we had packed our own to have on hand. On our second day our shower/toilet light switch went on the fritz...again, we talked to Helen and within 10 minutes we had this repaired. As we arrived at the resort after 5pm, we had time only to walk around the grounds, stop by the pool bar for a quick drink and a friendly smile from Javier and walk through the sand prior to darkness setting in. Our first impression was an overall gorgeous! The grounds are impeccably clean, lush and always have someone working on them. The Coati and Iguanas are always fun to watch. It is true, there is no beach to swim in, but for those of us who enjoy sitting on a beach and swimming in the pool, this was just fine with us. And when we wanted more lively fun, we sat at the entertainment pool and joined in whenever we wanted. The entertainment crew kept us laughing the whole week and we had a ton of fun with them! Suzanne, Amanda, Omar, Alejandro, Jess and Amy Jean appeared to never sleep but were always smiling, fun and great to chat with both at the pool and in the evening at the shows and the after parties. They always called us by name and a friendly hello whenever we saw them. These kids helped make our vacation what it was for sure! The evening shows were entertaining and full of so much energy by these kids. Alejandro started at the OMR the day we arrived and was in every show we saw - he spent each day practicing and learned the shows that quickly. The Grease show was very entertaining and my personal favourite...and our hubbies enjoyed being part of the show that night - lots of fun! The pools were always immaculate and constantly being skimmed and vacuumed each morning, the decks were swept and garbage picked up by the hard working \"beach boys.\" The only day the cleaniness of the one pool was an issue was the day that the winds were so strong that the beach was encroaching into the pool area...if you were near the beach, you were being sandblasted so it was VERY understandable that they could not keep the pool and deck clean this morning. but as soon as the wind died, there were out there getting it back in order. Always a gorgeous welcome every morning to see the pools with the ocean behind them and to see the pools lit up at night. We did walk down to the Lagoon one afternoon but ended up getting rained on so we did not really experience it to the fullest. We tried all of the restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Japanese restaurant (twice!) - Israel put on an amazing show and the food was delicious! The Mexican restaurant was also good, but not nearly as much fun and the Italian was delicious but WAY too much food! If we had any complaints about the restaurants, it was that the dishes were often too much to eat and we hated to leave the wasted food. It was always delicious. And yes, as Pat said, the white wine was actually very nice....just not in a plastic cup at the pool! We found the Bloody Caesars to be a great way to start the day as well. The buffet restaurant had excellent breakfasts and my husband enjoyed omelettes made by Aurora every day - always so many choices, I do not understand how someone cannot find something to fill them up to their liking. After being in Germany last year, it was easy to see the European touches at this resort including their selection of cheeses, cold meats and breads. It was a nice option to eat a sandwich at any time you chose to not have a big meal. As this was our 3rd time to the Mayan Riviera, we did not take any tours at all and spent all our time on the resort - which was perfect for us! A group of friends who had joined us on the 3rd did do a dolphin swim and absolutely loved it and could not say enough about the experience with the dolphins. The group of friends who joined us did not know we were at the resort and we surprised them by waiting in the lobby (for 3 hours as they were late arriving!) and Hector and another porter (sorry, cannot remember his name!) were so very helpful in watching for them and keeping an eye out for us so that it could be a perfect surprise - and it was! After their arrival, every time Hector saw us, he asked if we and our friends were having a good time. He was the sweetest man! You meet so many people from different areas during a stay at the OMR - the US, UK, Canada...and most have a smile and a friendly hello as you walk by. We met and chatted with many people from near and far and always enjoy talking to others - this helps to make the memories. Overall, our trip to the OMR was spectacular and we truly had no complaints at all. We were on vacation, there were palmtrees and warm breezes and we were with friends and making new ones...what more can you want? Every vacation is what you make it!

We had a wonderful holiday. We understand some people had room or hotel problrms, but for us we rave about the service of the staff. The hotel grounds are beautifuly maintained. Kudos to the gardeners and cleaning staff. We did upgrade to 'Privilege'. The 'Privilege Suites' are in a 3-story building close to lobby and buffet restaurant. When we got to our room, there was robe & slippers, bottle of wine & chocolate covered strawberries. Room 214 was quite and everything worked. We even enjoyed the firm beds. The mini-bar had the usual, bottle water, pop, juice and 3 mini liquor bottles that was restocked every day. Yes, it was a 3 minute walk to pools and beach but everything can't be in the same area. Walking is good for you. The 'Privilege' section at the beach had canopy beds and lots of padded beach chairs with shade huts. An ice bucket at every table with bottled water & ice. Our own 'Yvonne' was always there if you wanted a drink. The little self-serve area had champagne, beer, fruit, peanuts, cold face towels, lotions and books. The whole hotel pools and beach area had lots of beach chairs. There was a very good selection of liquor. The 'Privilege' had another shelf with extra selections. Just don't let them pour from the bottles under the bar (I think it might be local alcohol). You can taste the difference. Maybe not by the 3rd one. HaHa. We had no problems asking bartender the brand we wanted and saw it poured from that bottle. The white and red wines were even good, I have been to some 5-star resorts where you could not drink the white wine it was so bad. The food at the buffet was good. You are in Mexico and cannot expect what you get at home.. It's nice to try different dishes. The 'Privilege' could make reservations at the special restaurants. The Japanese was fun sitting at the Tepanyaki table but the Italian was our favorite, good service, good food, beautifuly presented and served hot. Don't be cheap, give your server or bartender a dollar or two once in a while, they do appreciate it and they work hard with long hours and always a smile & greeting. All-inclusive does not mean you don't have to but your hand in your pocket. Other travellers report a lot of mosquitoes, but honestly I only got 2 bites and they usually love me at home. I did take bug spray but only used it once. We saw our room sprayed once and every night around 5 pm they sprayed the foliage and tree area around the grounds.

She was also very informative if she did not know the answer she was quick to get one. We were never mislead in anything she had said and was always helpful and sweet. We truly grew quite fond of Cassandra during our stay and hope that the OCM truly appreciates how hard she works with the guests. The Food: This was hit and miss. We found the restaurants quite good - some of the best we have had on our travels. The Italian was amazing, and they did not limit how much you ordered. We accidently ordered two entres at the Mexican and they served us which typically you are limited. The service was quick and the food was tasty - absolutely no complaints about the A La Carte restaurants. The Buffet: This is where the OCM falls a bit. The variety was quite redundant and not too tasty. We are not picky people but truly there were times that I struggled to find something that looked appetizing. The Pool: Great pool, clean no issues at all. There was limited service around the pool which is not a big deal just be prepared to serve yourself. Liquor: When you are in the Privilege section you are able to get top shelf liquor - Crown Royale etc. They do check bands. Great selection when you are in the Privilege - can't really speak to the regular alcohol as we were able to get what we wanted. Beach: This is where they fall in ratings for me. i know it is clearly noted on previous Trip Advisor reviews that they have no swimable beach but I really thought people were just being picky - no, there really is no where to swim. The beach actually stunk on a couple of days - it depends on the winds. You cannot swim in the ocean so prepare yourself and you will be fine. You are able to walk down the beach about 15 minutes and there is a lovely area that you can swim in and it is a nice walk and truly not too far. Privilege Section: Great service, Yvonne was just amazing - we spent time here and by the pool and she would even see us by the pool and serve us there - unbelievable. The sun beds were comfortable and you always had a bed, we never saw that they were full throughout out week. This is also true for the pool loungers. We never saved any spots and always had somewhere to sit or lay down. The Rooms: Nice rooms, clean with all the basics - well almost. There is no tub in your room - which was disappointing for myself. They offered us an upgrade at 50 dollars a day we didn't think we could justify spending 350 dollars for a tub for the week so we stayed in our original room. Our room was cleaned at various times throughout the week. At times it was just being cleaned when we arrived at our rooms to prepare for dinner and other times early in the afternoon. Could never figure out their system. There was always a variety of pop and alcohol in the fridge and we never had to make any requests. At times they did not give us facecloths but truly that was only 2 days other than that they kept everying replenished. They don't give you towel art on the bed but the rooms are clean and well appointed. Room Service: We used room service once and found it to be disappointing. Food was cold and not what we had ordered so we decided not to use this service again. We were given our romatic dinner for two as promised by our service provider - this was interesting. There were four couples in the Gazebo so not so romantic and dinner took over 2 hours to serve. It became comical and we did have a good time with the other couples but not a romantic dinner that is for certain - that being said we met another couple who said there service was quite effecient and there were only two couples that evening so I think it may be hit and miss. Grounds - they were very beautiful and well kept. Someone was always cleaning somewhere. There is an odour in some areas that you cannot miss and depending on the direction of the wind depended on how strong the smell was. Overall, you will have a good time if you have already booked this resort. We truly had a nice time. We decided to not let the little things ruin our vacation and they absolutely did not. We loved the staff, made reservations for dinner most nights, loved the pool, loved Cassandra, loved the staff at the Privilege desk - very helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean. We will not be returning as they just missed the mark on a few things but honestly if you have booked this resort don't be nervous you will have a good time just prepare yourself for the beach. I should also add that I am a beach person that is why I have rated this resort at a 3 but would give it a 3.5 if I could.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trinidad", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Rianne S", "ReviewID": "UR125762338", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from one of the most relaxing vacations we've ever had. Usually when we vacation we do lots of tours and sightseeing, but this time, we just laid back and relaxed. Check-in was a breeze. I should warn you about the \"welcome breakfast\" though, as the resort is also time-share based, and they do try to sell you this for future trips. Avoid it if you're not interested, as time may be better spent soaking up some rays poolside. they do offer some resort credit though if you attend (if you seem doubtful, they do up the ante). We were in Villa 37 and this was perfect as it was right opposite the pool and close to two of the on site restaurants. The room had a partial ocean view and was gorgeous and well laid out, and our welcome wine and treats were awesome. One downfall was the number of towels stocked in the bathroom. Even when they restocked, it wasn't sufficient. The housekeeper dressed the bed with little paper flowers daily, a welcome touch! We were able to benefit from WIFI from the neighbouring hotel as our villa/room was close to the edge of the property, so we didn't have to make the trek back to the lobby to get WIFI (it was a good walk back) We were not impressed with the Mexican restaurant- El Charro. I expected highly seasoned and tasty food and was sorely disappointed. We ate here on our first night and did not venture back. The Italian restaurant was great and so was the Hacienda. We didn't get an opportunity to try the Japanese restaurant though as we didn't plan our meals well. Point to note: fancy/formal dress is not required at any of the restaurants, once you are not in swimwear they will serve you just fine. The resort has a nice booklet about their facility and it is a good read. They do state that you should not reserve lounge chairs at the pool or beach, but everyone does it, so don't expect to go and get a lounge chair after 10a as folks reserve chairs with towels, books and personal items before they go to breakfast. Join the crowd and reserve your chair if you want to spend some time in the sun. The pools were great! My husband and I spent a lot of time on the sun shelf just liaising around. We left with great tans! My only complaint is that there isnot enough staff around the pool to refresh towels or get drinks. You will end up doing this for yourself. If you are going into town, Playa del Carmen, for some souvenir shopping, it will be easier to take a taxi as the shuttle is usually full. It costs about USD25 one way. Arrange with the driver who takes you to pick you back up. This was you won't get scammed in taxi fare on the way back. CHECK THE HOTEL SOUVENIR SHOP AND POOL KIOSK FIRST. IT IS A BIT CHEAPER THAN IN TOWN!!! The sundries shop in the lobby has just about everything (except toothbrushes) so if you need anything you can get it there. Really and truly, the hotel is very self contained an there is no reason to leave except for sightseeing. Tip based on the service you receive. We received excellent smiling service. Walk with bug spray for mosquitoes as they are relentless. We will definitely visit again!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Vacation at the Ocean Maya\u201d", "Author": "composthappens", "ReviewID": "UR125727470", "Content": "My husband, 20 year old daughter and I just returned from a week at this resort. The Cancun Airport is a disorganized mess, so just be prepared. It took an ungodly amount of time to get out of the airport to find our transportation. It is about a 45 minute drive to the resort from the airport. Check-in went very smoothly, and we were soon in our rooms. We were in villa 27 which was a perfect location in our opinion. It was close to the pools, beach and two of the restaurants, but set back one building from the main path so it was quiet. We were on the second floor which was nice. The rooms are quite spacious and nicely equipped as you can see from my photos. The towels were of good quality and my only complaint is that each day we would only get three bath towels for the two of us. Being in a beach setting, sometimes you need more than one shower a day. It was hit or miss as to whether we would get a hand towel or a wash cloth. The resort is very nicely laid out and is a smaller property, which we liked. The lobby area is pretty, and we very much appreciated the free wifi in the lobby. Normally I do not complain about the food at all-inclusive resorts but I have to say that the food at the La Hacienda and El Charro was just average, and boring after a few meals there. However the food and service at both the Japanese and Italian restaurants were excellent. As others have said, there is not much beach at this resort, and the area where you can swim is definitely not too attractive. However thanks to the reviews on TripAdvisor, we knew this when we booked our trip. We did walk down to the lagoon, which is more like a 20 minute walk not the 10 minutes that others have said, and it is definitely worth the trip. If you have snorkeling equipment, be sure to take it along with you. We used the on site dive shop several times. My husband and daughter both took the lessons and went scuba diving, and the snorkeling expedition we went on ended up to be the best snorkeling we have ever experienced. Truly like swimming in an aquarium - highly recommend! On the recommendation of the concierge, we hired a taxi to take us to Chichen Itza instead of one of the tour buses. Best decision ever! Not only was it less expensive, but we were on our own timetable and were able to see the ruins at Tulum as well as the ones at Chichen Itza. Additionally our driver took us to a small restaurant for lunch where we had excellent traditional Mayan food. For those who are interested, there was a nice mix of age groups at the resort during our visit and it was not all couples. Friends traveling together would not feel out of place at this resort. My last comment is that the mosquitoes are terrible. Pack your bug spray and some anti-itch medicine. I did not expect to get bitten inside the lobby, restaurants and area where the evening shows are held but I did. Getting out of the Cancun airport was worse than arrival. We stood in line for an hour and fifteen minutes just to check our bags and get our boarding passes.

If you researched and read the thousands of reviews like I did, you will find out that it was a waste of time. This hotel by Mexican standards is great. The grounds are beautiful, the staff is without a doubt the friendliest and most accommodating we have encountered in 25 years of traveling and the food (even the buffet if your not set in your ways and like a good butter hunt) was excellent. A lot of people on this site will complain about the seaweed on the beach. Well we traveled far down the coast by rental car and it was everywhere do to severe storms this winter. To there credit, the Ocean Maya had men out cleaning it every day. As far as privilege vs non-privilege. If your a snob and like to be isolated from the general public, Get it. Otherwise, it's a waste of money. We can afford it but choose not to because from experience we knew that people are not that friendly and we received premium liquor when requested anyway (sorry, can't reveal method). Maid service didn't mop some days, forgot to leave coffee or the odd face cloth or towel, but hey, it's Mexico and that's all part of the experience. You won't see a Vegas quality show here, but if you understand how hard these kids work to keep you entertained, you will appreciate them way more. If you have never been to Mexico, one thing you need to know. The people, especially the Mayans, are some of the warmest and friendliest people in the world. If you treat them with compassion and respect, they will do everything they can to insure you have a great holiday. If your there for awhile, rent a car and travel to the cenotes (under ground rivers) Playa del Carmen and archeological sites.

We did not do the \"privlege\" but got the wine, chocolate covered strawberries in the room AND the \"Romantic\" dinner. From what I saw the \"privelege\" isn't worth it. The staff is SOOOO friendly everywhere. Standard cocktail at easy checkin (easy checkout too). Stanard wait for room (got in @ noon), \"time share\" dude offered pearl necklace to have breakfast and 2 hour talk (not really time share, a complicated plan where you can travel anywhere), said standard \"NO!\", at bar he inticed with $100 USD, \"NO!\", then $150 plus necklace...\"OK, but I'm not buying anything\", we were to eat breakfast anyway, were going to checkout the lay of the land anyway and after the 45 min spiel I wanted my money and the beach. Got it in a couple of days, don't do it, I never did before or again...easy money though. ROOM-pretty standard, couch,hardish bed but a nice LARGE balcony.Yes shower leaks, ask for extra towel.Thought it was smoking room, even called to be sure, but NO indoor smoking, balcony is just fine though. FOOD- Buffet is standard with cooking stations. Restaurants are first rate. Can make reservations 1 to 2 days in advance up until 2pm, easy, no lines. Mexican and Italian great food and too much of it. Japanese, do the \"show table\", fun! food OK. I wish they enforced the dress code in the Buffet (long pants is not too much to ask).

SHUTTLE-free to Playa del Carmen, need to reserve day before (doesn't run on Sun). Taxi is $19 each way, mile walk to front gate gets you a $3 bus or a $6 taxi (still $19 coming back). INTERNET-lobby only. ENTERTAINMENT-not the standard silly stuff, Aztec show etc. HOUSEKEEPING- this is the bad part, never the same number of towels, some days coffee, swept floors but not mopped, rinsed glassware, these guys don't speak anything but Spanish so another call to front desk. BARS- pool bar closes @ 6. long walk to lobby bar after your 2 beer room allotment is gone (if you drink one, they bring you one, $ 3 to have them bring more) Ask @ pool bar for additional cans.

Overall, it was great. There are a few things that could have been better \u2013 and I explain below. Upon arrival, we checked in at the Privilege desk. We had wooden/fabric bracelets, which were way nicer than the plastic ones. Someone brought us a drink right away while we checked in. Since we had upgraded to privilege, expectations were high. Our bags were brought to our room and we opened the door to a very nice room with wine and chocolate covered strawberries \u2013 with a personalized note welcoming us to the property. At this point, I was pretty happy with the upgrade to privilege. The Room: Location, it was just off the main lobby/buffet. Nice location. It was a little walk to the beach, but not a big deal. The beds have a mattress pad on them which gives them a little more padding. D\u00e9cor is nice, balcony is nice. Nothing outstanding but certainly nothing to complain about. The pictures posted by the hotel are exactly what the rooms look like. The mini fridge was stocked. Air conditioning worked nicely. There was a musty smell \u2013 but nothing that I couldn\u2019t live with. Housekeeping was good, room was nicely cleaned. I didn\u2019t ever get more washcloths after the first day, I just used hand towels. We had mints on our pillows a few nights when we returned to our room, slippers bedside. That was a nice touch. No flower or towel animals. I kind of liked that from our previous resort stay. The Restaurants: Buffet: Overall good food. The best time to eat here is breakfast where you can get a nice omelet made fresh. There is a mix-your-own Mimosa and bloody Mary station. Japanese: We made a reservation for the grill which was fun. The food was very good. The show was ok \u2013 I have seen more excited chef\u2019s. I think he had a long day already and was getting tired. We ate there a second time because the food was so good. This time not at the show table. It was still very good food, each course! Mexican: It was good. Tortillas are good. Guacamole and salsa are great. We made an evening reservation and all the courses were good. We were brought a banana margarita upon our arrival. It was yummy! This is also a good place to eat during the day because it is right by the pool. Decent food during the day \u2013 AWESOME mint chocolate ice cream. Itialian: Food was good. I liked what I ordered. Nothing really blew me away about this place. Staff was pleasant. Mikes Coffee: Good coffee, weird that they don\u2019t open until 4pm. The lobby bar has an espresso machine and can make most of the specialty coffees if you need a morning pick-me-up. Also, you can order coffee from room service. After 11 PM, in the lobby bar, you can order food. I ordered a chicken fajita, it was unbelievable. Probably one of the best things I ate at this resort! My husband got a club sandwich and he said that was good. Our friends had a pizza (which was very cheesy and huge!) and beef fajita \u2013 which was really tender and good. As part of the privilege package, we got a romantic beach dinner. Shrimp came standard, had to pay more for steak. The steak was not good. Tough and full of gristle. The waiter had too many people to wait on and had to go around the pool for each trip. They need to build a bridge for that guy and maybe have more than one staff on those tables! The food was good, nothing spectacular\u2026 except the 4 cheese soup. I cannot get over how good that soup was. I need to find the recipe, so anyone from the hotel who can get me a recipe, I would be overjoyed! (Maria Lopez, can you pull some strings?) The Entertainment: Pretty standard resort entertainers. Good looking dancers trying to get everyone involved. We played bingo one night; our friend won a small bobble head turtle. \uf04a We saw a nice performance of some traditional Mexico dancers. That was fun. There are venders most nights around the fountains selling things. They don\u2019t harass you nearly as much as the vendors on 5th Ave in Playa. The pool/beach: Pool drink service was spotty. Sometimes there was someone available. The bars closest to the pool were sometimes wonderful (Jairo rocks) and sometimes you can stand there for 20 minutes to get a beer. The pools themselves (2 of them) were very nice and seemed clean. Remember this is an adult\u2019s only resort, so there is some topless exposure. The privilege beach section was good for my husband and I as far as service. The waitress there was very attentive. I really liked the beds, being able to put the curtain down and cool off or stay out of the sun for a bit was nice. Our friends said that they waited a long time for her to come by and were more satisfied by the pool. Privilege: Overall, not worth the cost. I liked the chocolate strawberries, I liked the bracelet, the romantic dinner was nice and being able to make reservations was nice but\u2026.. eh\u2026 Plus, we were told tales of a VIP area that had TV\u2019s and air conditioning. We found what we thought was this area, but the doors were always locked. I asked around (H10 guy in lobby, privilege desk, front desk) and no one was really sure when it opened. We were told \u201cafternoon\u201d. Tour desk: The guy at the desk owes my friend and I each 2$. He kept telling us he would bring it \u201ctomorrow\u201d which never came because he never had the money. How hard is it to have 4$ in US money? We booked our Xel-ha excursion through him. It worked out fine, we however paid 2$ each couple more than we needed to. I think he took that as a little tip. Anyway, the free shuttle to Playa is a nice service \u2013 but it is super inconvenient to book. You have to be at the tour desk at 8am the day before you want to go and the shuttle fills up within an hour. Might be an easier option to just take a cab into town. Upon check out, our friends had a charge for a steak on their room tab. My husband and I paid for the steaks in cash for all three of us (one was happy with shrimp). There was no charge for our 2 steaks on our bill, but still the charge for our friends. I assume the person who took the cash just entered it for our room and should be an easy fix, but the worker was not available when our friends checked out and it might still be something we need to work out. We were getting the stink eye from the privilege staff member as we waited for our shuttle. Overall, this is a beautiful resort with clean well-manicured grounds. The food is good enough, with a couple stand out dishes. The staff was pleasant and for the most part very helpful.

From \"crazy games\" pool volleyball, dance lessons, texas hold em, and the Amazing Shows that this great group of hard working young men and women put on it, was a trip to remember. Thank You to our Favorite Fernie, also Suzanne, Amy Jean, Sergio, and Ricardo. ROOMS are very clean and spacious. Housekeeping did an amazing job and our fridge was always restocked. It was very warm/humid when we were there. The AC worked great. FOOD was great. There is always something to choose from at the buffet and you will get the friendliest greeting at the omelette station from Aurora. The A La Cartes are great. We especially liked the Japanese (at the grill) and the Mexican (best chicken fajitas). The Italian was OK but the food lacked flavor. By far, out favorite waiter at the buffet and the Mexican Rest was Vincente. He greeted us every day (remembering our names) and was always smiling and singing. GROUNDS were beautiful. There was always someone working/grooming on the grounds and it shows. I was in awe of the landscaping and beautiful flowers. BARS..excellent service. Always a smile and a great drink. Our favorite bartender was Javier and he was always up to making us a \"Javier Special\" of the day/night. Even at the pool bar at very busy times, they had your drink for you right away. BEACH was nice to walk along but water not so nice, but take a 15 min walk to the left of the property and you will reach a beautiful lagoon with crystal clear water to swim in. Take your camera...its beautiful. POOL is where it was at for us. We never swam in the quiet pool but it is huge and very nice. We enjoyed the activities, music and company of all of our new friends that we made from all over the world at the pool with the swim up bar. We loved the fact that the property was adults only. We would definitely return to OMR if travel brings us back to this area.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fredericton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cfirst time in mexico\u201d", "Author": "colin1234_12", "ReviewID": "UR125372342", "Content": "was an excellent vacation the food was to die for the late night fajitas alone made the trip i would recommend taking the tour to the coco bongo with the staff but wander on your own as soon as you get in dont go where they try to put you. the only blackmark on my trip and why i did not rate excellent was a number of people in our party had moneyy missing from there room safe and luggage included", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFirst time to the Mayan\u201d", "Author": "Tammy S", "ReviewID": "UR125303985", "Content": "This was our first trip to the Mayan. We were there from Jan 20 - Feb 3 2012. We have stayed at Ocean Properties before and so thought this would be a good choice. FIrst off the front desk staff and all the staff working in the restaurants and the grounds are vey friendly and helpful. The buffets and a la cartes - The Breakfast buffet was amazing. THe omelettes and eggs were great. I am not sure her name but she was always smiling and greeted each guest with a smile and a greeting. She was the reason breakfast was good. The lunch buffet at the poolside was great as well. Burgers made fresh while you waited and the food was hot. The chili on the nachos and fries was great. The evening buffet was ok. Food was not always hot ..usually warm if that. The selection was ok..lots of seafood (for those who like it) The Italian A la carte was my least favorite of them all. I did not find much selection or taste to the meal. The best part was the spinach/cheese soup. The Mexican was good. Again not alot of selection but food was good. The servers there were awesome as well. They remembered you from day to day and even knew what you drink.The Japanese was by far the best there. The servers were awesome and the show is great too. Had some of us sitting watching get up and try there tricks. Was a lot of fun.Highly recommend going to this restaurant while there. The one dissappointment i did have with the 3 a la cartes was the dress code.There really wasnt one and so you had people in shorts and tank tops. To me I dont think this should be allowed. The ground - Immaculate and amazing. The grounds people take very good care of the grounds and it really showed. The rooms - the rooms are nice. had what was supposed to be two double but was more like a super singles. I was looking forward to a king bed but none were available. We had our kids with us (18 and 20) and they shared a room which they accomadated us and had our rooms facing each other. The room was kept clean. The shower does leak and the door to the bathrrom is a 3/4 frosted glass door so not sound proof. The fridge was stocked somewhat and had to ask for coffee a couple times and there was a musty smell in the room. As long as the ac was on you couldnt smell it as bad. The beach - well there was a beach but it was covered in seaweed and the staff worked endlessly on removing it but it was a never ending battle. The ocean was rocky and not nice to swim in. IF you walked down the beach to the left for about 10 minutes there was a beautifl spot for swimming at Tres Rios. If you walked the other way as well you came to nicer beaches and water that you could swim in. THe Pool - was great place to be. The swim up bar was busy most of the time and you got better service from the walk up bar. The entertainment staff - Suzanne, Fernie, Amy Jean, Amanda.Omar, Jes and (the sexiest man in the Mayan) Ricardo were the hardest working people there. From keeping us all busy during the day with activities and games. beach volley ball water volleyball,texas holdem and aquasize to the endless hours they put in rehersing for the nite shows and then the evening entertainment with Bingo and Karoake. I know that these 7 peopls were the best thing about this vacation. They really put themselves out there for all the guests. And after all the fun is done in the resort its off to Coco Bongo which we did one nite with Fernie..she is a great hostess outside the resort as well. They truly made this trip for me. I am not sure i would go back for the food or beach but aside from that its a great place to relax.

Pool - very good. Entertainment - very good. Talum (Mayan Ruins excursion) - excellent, one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. Playa Del Carmen - fun for shopping, walking and a chance to get outside of the resort. Snorkeling - hired the outfit located on OMR's beach; it wasn't incredible but good, fair priced, and fun.

My husbad and I stayed here from Feb 5-15, 2012. This was our first time to Mexico and we chose a great resort. We also extended our stay to 10 nights which was as well the first time.So we were happy the resort was so good.There were only a couple of disappointments to us and one of which could actually be corrected quickly and easily. (the reservation process for shuttle to Playa Del Carman). The weather could have been a little better at times, nothing you can change about mother nature. I will speak about each area seperatley. Pools- Beautifu and refreshing! The pool with the swim up bar was our daily hangout and is as well where all the entertainment staff do daily activities.You can join in or just watch, they don't pressure. They were all so much fun and easy to get to know. They love to entertain and give the guests a laugh. You can also get some daily exercise with them. They hold Pool aerobic, yoga,beach vollyball and pool vollyball. They have different games daily that they call crazy, and believe me some are pretty crazy, and hilarious! They all work very,very hard and we need to realize just how hard and long hours they keep. Take one of them to lunch, they'd love it. So please say Hi from us ( the crazy canadians) Look for Suzanne,Amy,Sergio(the baby) Fernie and Ricardo. They are ALL great I don't know all there names. One more thing you should know about the entertainment staff. They have talent and you'll see that when you go to the night shows. A lot of practise and again long hours goes into it all. The drinks are made really good at the swim up bar. They are not over owered by alcohol unless you state otherwise.Say Hi to the best bartenders there, Javier( beautiful curley hair) and Ebar.They make the best mojitos. Beach_ Not Good!! The beach with the white sandy area to lay on the loungers is georgous! There just isn't the sandy, turquoise water to walk into. Murkey and rocky, hard to even walk into the water if you wanted. Best advise, bring water shoes. There is a beautiful lagoon 10 mins up the beach going left from the privilage section. Bring bread from breakfast and feed the fish. You can do some snorking there or take some great photos. Enjoy, its beautiful! Rooms- Clean and a great size room. The bed wasn't very comfortable so we asked for a pillowtop mattress pad and after asking 3 different people at guest services we finally got it on the 4th day and it made a world of difference. The toilet and shower area, GREAT!! We are Canadian and can't follow the direction of no paper down the toilet. We just don't do it that way like Im sure most of you don't. Just flush beginning, during and end. It has proven to work, we never had a problem with leaking or backing up toilets as I have read in previous comments. Grounds- AWESOME!!! They work very hard at keeping the landscape beautiful and it shows. You see the people working and maintaining each and everyday. The animals are part of the landscape, its pretty cool and they don't bother you at all. They even let you take a picture with them. lol. Restaurants- They are all very good! They feed you a lot of food, so go hungry. Not needing a reservation to get into the restaurants and can repeat as often as you want is a really, really good idea and it works as far as we could see. They do this really well!! It was always an inconvenience at other resorts to stand in line to try and make reservations to only be turned away when it was finally your turn. They have a mexican, Italian and Japanese. Take note. They all take a turn closing one night. The Mexican restaraunt is located beside the pool area and serves lunch as well.Good food! The buffet as well is good. Its smaller than what we were use to with other resorts. I would imagine the amount of verity is probably determined with the size of resort. The verity was just fine for the size of resort. Theres lots to eat! Say Hi to Aurora! She is the friendliest omlette maker we have ever seen. Every morning she has the biggest smile on her face and manages to say hello to each and every guest in her line and on top of that always makes eye contact. I work in a customer service envirorment, I look for that stuff. She speaks pretty good english and understand well. Overall we think this resort is an excellent choice. We just couldn't honestly give it a 5 due to the beach water and some inconvenience we experienced with trying to book the shuttle to go to Playa. You could only book day before and you had to make sure you were at the desk by 8:00am.There were a couple of days we went over to book after breakfast, 9ish and it was full. The day we finally made it at 7:50am there were only 2 spots left on the sheet.Something was not right about that! We were told he starts at 8 and we weren't allowed to book until the day before you want to go. So you can't book it a couple of days in advance and that is what I think should change. Adults only resort is nice. Not as rowdy but a little. Depends on the group at the swim up bar. You can always go to Coco Bongo with the entertainment staff from 11:00pm-3:30am into Playa. We could never make it that late.I think if we were to go back to Mexico it would be further up by Tulum. We love the sandy turquoise water and there is plenty of it in Tulum. One last thing. This was our first H0 hotel and we will stay at another. Your treated quite well and looked after. HAVE A MASSAGE!!!!! We had a couple's 50 min, it was amazing! you can go into the hot tub first, its included.

The beach is covered in sea weed that never ends. It's thick brown, stinky and disgusting. The poor guys working down there with pitch forks shovel it all day in to wheel barrows and drive it away in dump trucks. All day, every day, and they never make a dent in it. We've walked miles in either direction and you can not swim in the ocean anywhere near here. The buffet food is awful, even when they cook meat to order it's tough and tasteless. We paid for the Privelige jr suite and they stuck us in building 21 which must be built on a septic tank because the stench was horrendous. The whole place has bad plumbing. You can't flush the toilet paper, you must put it in a trash can or your toilet backs up. The amenities seem to be here but they are just unavailable when ever you need something. We tipped our room maid $20 the first day and got dry towels. This morning we ran out and didn't leave her cash, so our wet towels were left in the room. The only evidence that she was in was that the bed is made. We've asked for a clock that works (our fancy iPod docking station does nothing) and we just want to know what time it is without having to wear a watch. They say 'you don't need to know the time\" and laugh, like it's funny. I'm sure it's hysterical to them as they screw you out of your vacation dollar. Like everyone else has said YOU GET NOTHING FOR THE UPGRADE, and it's true. Premium booze is stacked behind the bar, and they won't use it unless you specifically ask and remind them to put bacardi in your drink. Even then it's all watered down. We've been to many Mexican resorts, and this place would be lucky to receive a 3 star rating. It could be great but the staff and services are just poor. Even when you tip the bar staff it's inconvenient for them to serve you. One pool bar services the whole resort, pool and beach with 2 bar tenders. Needless to say, you pour your own water or coke, or just go without. Go to the Iberostar Grand Paraiso if you want a great beach vacation. Go to the Barcello if you want a good beach vacation.

This is an adult\u2019s only resort, the majority of the guests are 30 and over. The resort is on the smaller size but beautiful! The grounds are kept very nice and they do a wonderful job with the gardens! The food was good both at the a la carte and the buffet. We didn\u2019t find the buffet at dinner very good they had a good selection but we preferred the a la carte. They also do not have any 24 hr snack bar, so you can\u2019t get food whenever you would like it. There is a restaurant at the pool which is a buffet at lunch so a cover up and dry bathing suit is what the dress code is for lunch. You can request a plastic plate that can be taken outside the restaurant if you would like to eat at the pool or beach. The rooms in the villas are nice they are 2 storey\u2019s and have 8 rooms in them. We had a king bed and the mattress was fine (it did have a mattress pad on it). I believe the hotel section which is the 3 storey long building is the preferred section. I\u2019m not sure what these rooms are like but they are located close to the lobby and main buffet. The entertainment staff was great they do activities at the pool during the day had lots of fun with this and we don\u2019t normally go for that sort of thing but they were great at encouraging everyone to get involved. They took no for answer though if you didn\u2019t want to. The evening shows were actually really good we normally don\u2019t even bother going because they are normally kind of bad with them bring guests up and playing silly games, but they did a Grease show, a Madonna show, Fiesta show which was dances of the Caribbean. They had acts come in 2 of the nights and they were very good! After the shows it was normally a little live music and then into the karaoke till 11 pm. The lobby bar closes at midnight and that\u2019s the end of your night NO DISCO at this resort so if you\u2019re looking for night live you will have to leave the resort. They do go to Coco Bongo some evenings you can book it at the hotel and someone from the entertainment staff goes with you. We didn\u2019t go but I\u2019ve heard it is very good. This is the big one for me the beach\u2026. I would not return to this resort as the beach is not good. It is not the resorts fault nature cannot be controlled but it is very murky. Looks like mulch that you would put in your flower beds. It keeps the beach guys busy cleaning it up which they do a great job at. You will want to take water shoes as you can\u2019t see the bottom and it\u2019s rocky in spots. You can walk for distance to the right of the resort. If you go to the left you can walk for about 15 min and you come to a lagoon area which is really nice. When we did go in the water this is where we went!

Also the service in the beach was really good. Food was average and the service in the restaurant differed a lot depending on your luck. Sometimes it was really good, sometimes not that good...

We discussed with other guests and they all said the same. One couple had had 3 room changes in 3 days and still they couldn't sleep. The hotel was also located in the middle of nowhere and it was quite small, so there wasn't that much to do or see in the hotel area.

The rooms are great, spacious, updated, free safe, well stocked mini bar, great shower , the only negative comment would be there is no door on the actual sink/vanity area, and the noise from the hair dryer is extremely loud. The food at the morning and lunch buffet was good, supper buffet not that great, but the ala cartes were great. Huge portions, no reservations and never waited for a table. Japanese was our favourite. Drinks were excellent, alot to chose from as far as brands of liquor. My husband grew tired of the Corona, and wished he had the upgrade as they get Budwieser.Still not sure if thats worth the upgrade, as we did here from a few privilidge people, that they ran out of Bud quite often. The pool area was alot of fun with the entertainment staff, lots of games etc.. I could have done without Omar copping a feel during the water areobics, which we heard happens quite often from a few other female water areobic participants. It was reported during our stay, so we didnt feel the need to say anything. Havier and Ebner at the pool bar were great.We had lots of fun with them. The beach is not in the greatest condition, but the sand is beautiful and if you walk 10min down the beach you will find the most fabulous lagoon area....its definately a must see. My only real complaint is that there is no night life....it does state that there is a disco...there is not...They have nightly shows which are good, then they have karaoke in the outside lobby area and cuban band...And everything is shut down by midnight.They are nice enough to leave the beer tap open for selve serve .

We stayed at OMR from Feb 11th through Feb 16th. Our stay was amazing. As with any review, there are 'goods' and 'bads', but we can say that the goods definitely out weigh the 'bads', if you can call it that. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and well maintained. The staff is always friendly, and work very hard to make you feel welcome. The Room: We stayed in a Privilege Suite. Yes, they are located at the back of the resort, but we found this only to be a positive. It was very quiet and serene. You do not have a view of the ocean, but the grounds are breathtaking. It is closer to the main lobby, which is convenient. We scoped out other rooms while we were there and found the oceanfront rooms to be right by the pool, which can get a bit loud during the day. It is a popular place during the day so it will not be quiet until at least 6pm if you every feel the need for a nap. The room was very large, and very nice. The robes and slippers were a very nice touch. One reviewer complained about bathroom size, but we did not find this to be true. The shower and toilet is separated from the vanity area, like most hotels, and is quite spacious. Our room was very well maintained, with a fully stocked fridge daily, and turn down service at night. We found the pillow menu to be a great thing, as I suffer from neck issues and was able to order a neck pillow. Sweet! Room service was always friendly and pretty punctual for the most part. The exception being, the last morning we were there, we ordered and it never arrived so we went to the buffet. We preferred to wake and immediately order a pot of coffee (which was very good) and pastries to enjoy while we were getting ready for the day. We would then take our walk on the beach and come back up to the buffet for breakfast. The Food: We found the food in the buffet to be very, very good. It was always different, and always hot. We are confused by the reviewer that stated the food was always cold. We never found this to be the case and were very pleased. The Mexican, Japanese, and Italian restaurants were also very good. The Japanese was amazing. The one thing with Privilege, you always get a reservation, no questions asked. We found this to be nice and helpful. As long as you make the reservation before 4pm that day, you are guaranteed a seat. The food in the Italian restaurant was very good as well. The Mexican was wonderful. We had grilled shrimp kebobs that were amazing. We have nothing bad to say about the food at this resort. Even the room service was good. (Room service is part of the Privilege package). The bars offered very good drinks. We have no complaints. Our glasses were always full. The liquor selection is superb, even without the Privilege bracelet. The good liquor is on the shelves behind the bar, you just have to specify that you would like Bacardi instead of rail rum etc. As others have stated the staff work very hard for very little so please tip. We took a lot of one dollar bills just for this purpose. Beach/Pool: The pools are very nice. One pool has activities and loud music and the other is more relaxing. There are two bars by the pool, the pool bar and the bar for the buffet by the pool. Privilege has its own section on the beach, if you prefer. The cabana beds are so wonderful, and the staff is always offering to refill your drink. We were at the beach by 10:30 or 11am and never had a problem getting a bed. The ONLY downfall of this entire vacation was the water in this area. The beach sand is so nice, but the water is a bit dark and murky. We were hoping for the crystal blue water, so this was a bit disappointing. Regardless, we were able to walk north by about 10 mins and find a beautiful lagoon. The entertainment at OMR was very good. In the courtyard in the evening, there was a live saxophone player which was very relaxing. The hotel offers shows every night as well. We only watched one or two. The first one was the entertainment staff at the hotel that did a Caribbean show. It was not really to our liking, as it was very amateur. But in their defense, they do work very hard and it was still enjoyable. Heck, we are in Mexico....on a beach....how bad can it be? The following night they brought in other staff that did a Madonna show. This was really good. It is hit or miss with the shows. All in all, if it wasn't for the beach/water, we would for sure visit this resort again. It is just gorgeous and we were very pleased with our stay.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExceeded Expectations!!!\u201d", "Author": "BobcatTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR124826744", "Content": "When I go on vacation and return we ask ourselves these questions: did the AI make us feel special, was the food good, and did we come back much more relaxed than before we went? To these questions then answer is a High Five Yes! From the moment we arrived we fell in love with the grounds. The villas where we stayed (Villa 8) felt like an oasis. The room was modern with plenty of closet and drawer space for our clothes. Everything in the room was spotless. Every day the maid came in and had flowers in an arrangement on the bedspread, and the refrigerator was well-stocked with bottled water, soda , and beer. As others have said, the bed is very firm almost like a rock. It did bother us the first couple of days but we slept well. Be careful to close your sliding glass door at all times to keep the mosquitoes out. We forgot one evening and paid the price. Remember to bring mosquito repellent. Ocean Maya felt like our own community. I liked it because it is compact. We met people from all over -- Canadians, British, and our own Americans.There are two pools that are situated so that you can walk to either one and relax. The smaller of the two was the activity pool where Amy and her crew worked gathering us to participate in activities like volleyball, exercise, dancing, even a race over a surf board. There is a swim up bar and service at both pools. I never found the drinks watered downed and if you want top shelf liquor if not on Privilege just ask. What made this area so great was not only the pools but lunch was next to the quiet pool in the Mexican Restaurant only a few steps to walk. If you wanted to sit and eat by your chaise lounge there was a grilling station with Kabobs, hamburgers, chicken and even steaks. I agree that the beach was not in top condition but to walk to the Lagoon, turn left and take a small hike along the beach and see a beautiful cenote with azure water so pure looking with fish and soft sand. It was a field trip so picturesque. When finished sun bathing and returning to the room all made up we looked forward to activities in the evening. I have to say since I have been to other all-inclusives, Ocean Maya's entertainment had great shows overall. The Madonna, Mayan show, ballroom dancing and Mexican dancing with a full live band and a soloist really stood out. There were also two fantastic Cuban magicians that performed before the Mexican show. Before the show one could sit in the lobby where there was drink service in their comfortable couches and chairs and do people gazing or play cards. I never felt there was a dull moment. Before the main show there was a saxophone player who did a variety of favorites outside by the fountain. Imagine star gazing and having music and recognizing people you have met or striking up a conversation with someone new. We did that. Everyone we talked to couldn't believe the level of fun at this resort. The employees from Maria the sub directorate, the front desk people, and Yuritzi at guest services made our stay wonderful. How can I put the food. It is not 5 star but it is way above what we thought when we arrived. In the Morning the breakfast buffet had stations with a huge variety. We have to give kudos to Aurora at the Grill station for omelets and eggs. She had always a smile and asked how are we? She really whipped up a big omelet that my wife and I could split in two. There was always champagne, wonderful bread, traditional cold cuts, hot cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt and breakfast sandwiches. I have to admit I liked being seated and not having to look for a table when arriving. One nice added touch was the sax player who also played the flute. It was so relaxing. Dinner as other reviews have stated there are 3 ala cartes. Of the three, we went twice to the Japanese ate at the Hibachi Table and I was amazed at the amount of food and how great the cook was with his flying act of knives and utensils. The Italian restaurant faced the ocean and with music piped over speakers it felt so laid back. The quality of both was super great. The Mexican Restaurant was not anything special and I was a little disappointed. If you read this far you must want to know were there any cons? I guess if I was knit picky I could mention one or two. There was never any butter to be found for the bread. Not important to some but I like it in the morning with toast. And the only other complaint is the beds felt too firm. Also, we had to call and request that the maid leave us hand towels and wash cloths. These are minimal drawbacks. In summary WOW the grounds, the people who work so hard to make your stay special, and the ambiance of the Resort makes the review of the Ocean Maya a thumbs up.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cOverall experience of property o.k. - people wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "Baxtero", "ReviewID": "UR124760060", "Content": "We decided to try an H10 property in Mexico this year.

As we had delayed our honeymoon for 5 months, i wasn't expecting any of the honeymoon extras as normally it has to be with 30 days of the wedding, however we were surprised to find a bottle of wine, chocolate covered strawberries and a voucher for a romantic dinner on the beach and a room service breakfast in our room. We stayed on the upper floor in villa 7, which was perfect. It was to the quieter side of the hotel ground, but still close to the beach, pool and lobby. We tried all the a la carte restaurants and the food was excellent (the Mexican was my personal favourite, if only for the Lime pie dessert), even in the buffet restaurant, the food was excellent with lots of choice. We were never disappointed. The staff are very hard-working and their attention to detail is fantastic. The room was always clean, the mini bar always restocked and the grounds and gardens looked amazing. I simply cannot rate this hotel high enough, it has to be experienced. The romantic dinner on the beach was certainly a highlight, it can be booked and paid for in resort and i would highly recommend it if you are staying for a speacial reason or simply want to indulge in the perfect romantic moment. Aurora was our waitress that night, which added a special private touch for my husband and i, which the hotel couldn't possibly have known about. The entertainment team our fantastic, whilst they are out and about trying to get you involved in things, a polite No is all it takes and they will leave you alone. Take lots of change or small bill notes as the Mexicans rely on tips to make their money and it is certainly deserved. I, personally, rarely tip but even i did here.

I contacted Maria Lopez at the hotel prior to our arrival to inquire if we were eligible for the honeymoon upgrade (at booking it said it was only valid for 30 days after the marriage and we were about 6 weeks after). I also requested in advance an upper floor room in a quiet area of the hotel, with a mattress topper on the bed. We arrived at the hotel in the early morning and had to wait until the afternoon for our room to be ready. No problem, our luggage was stored for us and we were shown to hospitality rooms with showers where we could change and get ready for the day. Once we were shown to our room...well thanks Maria! We did in fact receive the honeymoon upgrade (and didn't have to show proof of marriage even though I brought our marriage certificate). The room was exactly as requested (upper level in block 18, very close to the lobby/restaurant but far enough away that noise wasn't much of an issue). A flower heart on the bed and rose petals on the floor, champagne and goodies, as well as certificates for a romantic dinner on the beach and room service breakfast. We really appreciated this after our long travel day and the wait to check in! As others have said, the beach isn't great but what there is is well maintained. We never had trouble getting a lounger, and we never made it to the beach or pool much before 9 or 10am. You might have an issue finding something around the \"party\" pool but otherwise there is always something somewhere. I don't think people really reserve the beds, it's more that they come down and sit for a while then go for breakfast or lunch or to play volleyball or something, then come back later. Another thing we noticed was how well the grounds are maintained...and the beaches are always being raked of seaweed. There was always a security guard on duty all day and night as well. The food was great, we tried all the a la cartes and were not disappointed. Even the buffet was good, there was always a good selection, the food was hot, and they have stations where food is prepared on the spot for each meal (omelettes in the morning, stir frys, etc at lunch and dinner) The romantic dinner on the beach was awesome as well...I believe privelige upgrade people may get this option as well, you should definitely take advantage. If not you can pay extra for the experience as well...I think $50-$100 depending on menu...would also be worth it. The drinks were great and DEFINITELY not watered down here! The staff was amazing. Always a \"hola\" in passing, and great service at the bars and restaurants, we especially like Imelda in the lobby bar and Victor for our romantic dinner/Italian a la carte. The entertainment staff were great also, Fernanda, Amy, Amanda and Omar always had things rocking at the party pool and tried to get people involved. Also they handed out surveys to see how your trip was and one of the managers went around with a book to ask about your stay, concerns etc, and made notes. So they really seem to care about how they are portrayed and how they come across, they really want to do a good job. Bring lots of small bills for tips as change is hard to come by at the reception desk and you will want to tip the staff for their great work. The room was always cleaned well, as others have mentioned the shower leaked (but we just mopped it up with a towel, no problem). Also facecloths were an issue for us as well, if we didn't leave a note we didn't get any. The TV remote didn't work but we weren't concerned enough about it to complain. We weren't there to watch TV anyway! As for the toilet paper issue, this seems to be the way things are in the entire area, the first thing I noticed in the bathroom at the Cancun airport was a sign asking not to flush the paper. So it's not just this resort. Yes it's a bit gross but you get used to it, and they are very good about changing the waste baskets. One thing I didn't like was that the resort has street type vendors that come Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday and set up in the courtyard. I didn't care for this, as they were quite aggressive and I felt like I had to run the gauntlet with them if I wanted to get to the lobby, the theatre, or the restaurants. If I wanted to shop I'd go to Playa or Cancun. But I can see how some people would like this. We were delayed on the trip home due to weather at home and flights not arriving to pick us up. Transat put the whole plane full of us up at the Moon Palace for the day. I have to say it was a nice hotel but didn't really compare to Ocean Maya. The staff were not friendly, it was HUGE (we got lost finding our room) and the noise in the restaurants and pool was CRAZY because of all the kids. We really realized how much we appreciated the quiet ambiance of Ocean Maya after the day at Moon Palace! On the whole, a very good trip and I would return here for sure. Bring extra sunscreen (it costs $30 in the gift shop!!) and bug spray (mosquitos in the rooms at night will eat you alive).

Check in was a breeze accompanied by a nice cold drink and the room in one of the garden villas was spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean. The gardens around the resort were immaculate and there were always gardeners around trimming, tidying and planting. All of the communal areas were also clean and tidy. The facilities were good with free wi-fi in the lobby area. There were 4 restaurants The Hacienda was the main buffet restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner. The Mexican restaurant was located by the pool and was available for lunch and dinner. The Japanese and Italian restaurants were available for dinner only. These two were the best and the Japanese just edged the Italian for quality and service. Both the Japanese and Italian restaurants were great and even when they were busy Hector at the Italian or Ulisses (apologies for the spelling) at the Japanese could always find you a table within 30 minutes and waiting at the bar with a cold drink while they found a table was really no problem. The buffet restaurant was also excellent and even the fussiest of diners would be able to find something to eat. They regularly cooked fresh seafood (particularly fresh prawns) to order and frequently the meat station would have chicken and beef or pork available to be cooked to order. The cold meats and cheese selection always had a massive choice and in the morning eggs and omelettes just as you like them were prepared to order. I am sorry to say that we found the Mexican restaurant to be the worst for food quality and unfortunately for service while we were there (and I love spicy food) but the other three restaurants more than made up for this mild disappointment. An added little bonus was Mike\u2019s coffee shop; this was part of the all inclusive and a great place for a speciality coffee after dinner or for a coffee and a pastry in the afternoon. The Italian restaurant had an excellent bar attached to it. The pool bar and the lobby bar both operated all day and there was also a small bar attached to the Mexican restaurant. The guys at the lobby bar work non-stop in the evenings and cope no matter how many guests are around. We never found ourselves waiting for a drink for longer than a few minutes. Thanks to Rafael for always making sure my gin and tonic did not run too low and for all the cocktails that my wife enjoyed. The odd tequila shot was also welcome (when in Mexico\u2026.!!). Imelda was often our waitress in the evening and she looked after us superbly too. We met some great people while we were there and enjoyed many a day by the pool or evening by the bar having a chat with new friends Bob and Diane from Canada and Dave and Yvonne from Nottingham. Special thanks go to Maria Lopez who arranged a special occasion dinner for us with the executive chef and also organised a romantic dinner for us out by the beach one evening. Maria, as I said when we met at the hotel the staff are a great credit to the hotel and we felt very spoiled while we were your guests. We would happily return to this hotel.

We also had a leaky shower and the dates are right for Berlin Dublin to have followed us into the room (2704?). That said everything else was wonderful.

The pool scene was pretty lively and the evening entertainment quite good - what we saw of it as our days were so active we were shattered. The beach wasn't so bad that we couldn't swim in the sea and we did so almost every day. A couple of times we walked along the beach to where the underground river emerges and runs into the sea. This was great fun. You just lie back and the current carries you out towards the sea (there is a barrier to stop you floating away) or you can 'ride' it and pretend to be an olympic swimmer. This being our first trip to Mexico we did several excursions, Si'an Kaan, Chichen itza where we were able to swim in a cenote and, finally, the Dolphin Push. We took the bus to the beautiful Akumel. Sadly, Playa del Carmen was not the chic boutiques and restaurants we were expecting, in truth it was a bit scruffy. (Nice beach though).

Face clothes are hard to come by, but we had loads of larger towels. Grounds: Very well maintained and clean. Lots of walking and that's a good thing with all the good food. Food: Excellent! Main buffet & pool buffet both had a variety of items each day. There are the standby's... fresh bread that is out of this world, fresh guacamole, chips, and salsa, fruit etc.... Mornings offered great omelettes and many interesting Mexican dishes. Lunch always a choice of a few meats - fish, chicken & pork...sometimes even buffalo chicken wings. Dinner buffet was good, and the a la cartes were all excellent. The most disappointing was the Mexican restaurant. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The Italian had a few excellent pasta dishes - cooked perfectly to a la dente. I do not like mushy pasta! We did try a seafood casserole that was a little odd... pretty much shrimp in tomato sauce and too salty. Everything else was great. We went to the Japanese restaurant twice - one with regular seating, the other at the tapenaki table and both were very good. Suffice to say we all came home in tighter clothes.

I think the longest I ever had to wait was maybe 5 minutes and that was the exception. The entertainment staff was a lot of fun. The evening shows were a bit of a joke. It's dancing and lipsinking and not very good at that. The dancing outside after the show was fun though. So nice to dance outside in fresh air instead of a dark stinky disco. Ricardo, aka 'Sexy Boy' was their ringleader ... very sociable and interacted with all the guests constantly... not in a pushy way either. Suzanne was also very social and friendly. We did participate in a few aquatics classes, and afternoon games, and everything was done in a fun way. The activity hut also housed a lending library... always good to know you can find another paperback on a lazy holiday. I think Ocean Maya is very close to their 5 star rating...

All personnel is very helpful. They do their job with joy and pride. The site is perfect. The hotel is situated near the coast, between Canc\u00fan and Playa del Carmen. In the lobby is a nice bar and some shops - with acceptable prices for fashinable jewelry. The cocktails are ok, the coffee is superb. There's even a special coffeebar, called \"Mike's\", with exquise mocha frapp\u00e9 and delightful vanilla latte, thanks to the lovely and skillful Karolina. The toilets are very clean - turn your back and a lady pops up cleaning the smallest spot. It's necessery though with those drunken tourists ... Just outside the lobby is the theatre, where shows are given (there's also a pool table). Don't expect broadway, but you will have about an hour of good entertainment each day at 9:30 p.m. You will meet the performers (especially Amy and Daniela) at other occasions too: it's the entertainment team that keeps you busy near the pool! Two pools are available, not heated though. Since no children are allowed at the premises, there's no splashing, no running, no shouting ... Unless some noisy Americans checked in - but, hey, if it aren't Americans, some other group of noisy people will spoil a fraction of the splendid atmosphere. The facilities are plenty, so you can always look for a quiet place. The beach itself is not lengthy - about 30 metres - but that suffices to get in and out the caribean. There are enough seats for everyone to find a place to sunbath, read, sleep ... under palmtrees or parasols, on the sand, near the pool. If you happen to get bored, you can jetski, have a massage, learn Spanish, ... Or take a tor to a cenote, Chitzen Itza, Ek Balam, Playa del Mar, Villadolid, ... what we all did. Take a day per visit, booked inside the hotel. At the hotel you can go to the spa into the hot tub (reservations needed). The restaurants serve good food. There's El Hacienda, with a grand buffet, sometimes thematic. At Yokooso you can eat 'teppaniaki': you sit around a grill with 8 while a chef cooks on the spot. The Mexican-Japanese cook does his best to give a entertaining performance with his knife abd fork, but the food he prepares is better. We also choose \u00e0 la carte', and that was very nice: artfully served and honest flavours. The new Italian restaurant 'La Dolce Vita' is situated at the end of the premises, near the beach. The dishes aren't big, but they're very, very good. El Charro is located next to the pools. It's genuines Mexican food. During the afternoon you can have a snack there. Try the splendid beef hamburger with cheese and fries with cheddar on the side. The rooms are located in two level villa's. If you have the chance to book with ocean view, make sure you are on the second level. The rooms are in perfect condition, the cleaning ladies are the best. Leave the airco on at a perfect 22\u00b0C. The boxspring beds are exactly what you need. Don't forget a walk on the beach at sunset. And experience moonrise out of the sea. For honeymooners like us, it IS paradise. We for sure will go back to Ocean Maya Royale (5 years from now...).", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manasquan, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cFelt like a \"Rock Star\"\u201d", "Author": "TAGJR_11", "ReviewID": "UR124402764", "Content": "Traveled with two other couples.

My husband and I whent Privalege if you are thinking of this option save your money. I had read reviews of previouse guests bad and good and thought we would take our chances. We had simalar problems like the other guests. 1. They didn't have our room we booked we had to downgrade we had seen this in a few reviews. 2. The bed was hard as a rock 3. The beach WHAT BEACH!!! It is not like they advertise 4. Water was an isue they are very cheap with the bottle water remember to use it when you brush your teeth. 5. Food is o.k not great no 4 or 5 star 6. The spa is a joke save your money and tip. I don't think they have any training my 13 year old can give a better massage. No pampering at this place. Not worth it. 7. We would of liked a nice fancy drink you know with the fruit and stuff , no such luck 8.I think we had a drink down on the beach 5 times waitresses are scarce. You have to get them yourself. oh ya and no food on the beach. You can't leave the Buffet with a plate and take it to your room. or any of the other restaurants. You can get room service but it has a very small salection and it was always cold when it came (NOT GOOD) if you get the pancakes make sure to ask for syrop if you don't you won't get any same with cream for your coffee. Also they do not give it in your room with the coffee maker just coffee. 9. the front desk staff are no help what so ever don't try to get change because they never seem to have any or if you have a problem they will push you of to the next guy and the guy after that or the guy that will be in the next day. They play dumb. 10. We asked for bug spray and was told they don't keep it incase people are alergic to it. But she offerd to get my room sprayed. Does that make sence????? There are some bugs that live in the sand kinda like a nociam very tiny my husband got bit like crazzzy they didn't seem to like my blood. I was fine. 11. The gift shop/candy shop I left my camera in the gift shop when and sat down for breakfast and noticed I didn't have it. I ran back and asked if she saw it, the girl held out her hands slapped them together and shook her head no then proceeded to read her book. She didn't even offer to look with me. As I left I yeld at her, THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP!!!!!! I have to say this as a big big let down. Not as it appears we don't travel much and have never been to Mexico this was our first time. I guess I was expecting what all our friends have expierianced good and great things and they go twice a year not to this resort. After what we told them they will not be trying the Ocean Maya Royal. Just because they put Royal in the name doesn't make it Royal service NOT A 5 * maybe a 3 or 4 . When you book a trip that looks like they offer high expectations they should live up to them and deliver no less. We didn't expect caviar dreams, but we didn't think we would get sardine dreams. The good things I can say is they have hard working general staff I feel bad for them they have to work at a place like this. I think we ended up tipping about $300 in 7 days bring a lot of $1 bills remember the front desk won't give you any. And if you have a drink you like at home that isn't on the menue the bartenders will try to make it for you. We gave $1 every drink. I asked one guy how many hour he worked he said 8 yet I saw him there from morning to night. They work hard. Can't say the same for the privilege staff.. Walk down the beach for about 15min and you will find a nice lagoon. Don't stay in the privilege building it is the farthest from the beach.

She was so excited as we made our way to the beach the first morning...only to find that the water was a nasty brown. While this isn't the resorts fault, it is a definite turn off. There were many things we liked about the resort, but also many things we didn't like. As this is not my first stay at an all-inclusive, I can say that I wouldn't return here, or refer my friends here. First, the good things. The staff are exceptionally friendly, and are always there to lend a helping hand. The resort, and its grounds are beautiful, and all of the wildlife is so exciting to see. Almost every drink we ordered was wonderful, and if we were in the lobby, or out in the plaza area, or by the pool, we were waited on hand and foot. The shows the entertainment staff put on were great and it was nice to have something to do in the evening. I told the resort it was my mom's birthday and they had a cake and wine waiting in the room for us! That was super exciting for her! The bad: We never got sick from the food or water, but I would say the food is average at best. Nothing really wowed us. There was no service at the beach, unless you were a privilege customer. If you aren't a privilege customer, don't count on eating at the hibatchi table in the Japanese restaurant unless you wait until 9:00 pm. Unless of course, you get lucky and there is a cancellation while you're there, which we did on our last night after we were seated at a regular table. The restocking of towels, especially washcloths in our room was subpar. We went three days with only one wash cloth and when I asked the staff for more, she told me to press zero and ask the front desk. I called the front desk, and by the next day, still no wash cloths. And no coffee. We stopped by on our way to breakfast, and finally more wash cloths were delivered after noon, and we had already requested more by the cleaning staff that came in that day. My biggest complaint about the resort is the lack of water. We were given three bottles of water in the room. One for coffee, and two in the mini fridge. When we requested more, we were told we would have to pay for it. You can't get bottled water anywhere, only glasses from the dispenser. On our last day, we decided to skip breakfast to get in some beach time before check-out at noon. I couldn't get water from anywhere until the bar opened at 10:00 am. I was told they were closed, and they wouldn't even give me water. You should not have to go without water, at any time at an all inclusive resort. I have stayed at much better places, particulary the Valentin Imperial Maya. While it may cost a bit more, I would return there before returning to this resort.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Amboy, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGood but not great!\u201d", "Author": "dwirick", "ReviewID": "UR124224848", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed here from Jan 24-Jan 31. I am going to write this review in two sections. The first section will cover the \"not so good qualities of the resort,\" whereas, the second section will highlight the \"good qualities of the resort.\" I am reviewing in this way, because I want to demonstrate that the good does outweigh the not so good. NOT SO GOOD QUALITIES OF THE RESORT: The beach, or lack thereof, was disappointing to say the least. However, with that being said, it is not to be blamed upon the resort itself. Mother nature was in definite control. Food: The food quality was average. Of the four restaurants, the Japanese, was our favorite. TIP: please make a reservation, as you will have to wait, depending upon how full the resort is The opaque glass on the boardwalk prevented us from actually enjoying the view of the ocean. The boardwalk was a nice touch, just seemed odd that those in the privilege section couldn't even see the ocean. And, the most obvious downfall of the privilege upgrade was that our room was the farthest away from the beach/ocean. That made no sense whatsoever to us! .GOOD QUALITIES OF THE RESORT: Staff: The staff is definitely the number one asset this resort has to offer. They were friendly, hard working, attentive, and went above and beyond. I would like to know in an email reply from someone on the management team, how these staff members are recognized when those on Trip Advisor write specific positive comments about particular staff (please advise). Ivonne in the privilege beach section definitely needs to be recognized for her hard work. She made us feel right at home. Grounds: The grounds were plush, green, and highly aesthetic. Once again, the staff members were always working to maintain superior quality! Keep up the good work. Bathroom around the \"quiet\" pool: The women's bathroom was spotless. The female staff (sorry, I did not get her name) was constantly cleaning and replenshing paper towels, etc. She worked nonstop! Spa: I had a deep tissue massage and reflexology--OUTSTANDING. The spa was immaculate, and the 90 minute massage was less expensive than a comparable one in the U.S. The spa staff was outstanding. I would definitely visit the spa again if I were going to return to this resort. Housekeeping (Anna)--room 106, was outstanding. She did a wonderful job with our room. The linens were clean and the bed was comfortable. In summary, we would not recommend this resort to those who desire a large beach as a requirement for the ideal vacation. If, however, you are looking for excellent service, you will definitely find it at this resort.

For example, they had workers on the beach shoveling seaweed from the beach from sun up till sun down, i actually felt really bad for those poor guys cause some days it was just a losing battle. Also from the reviews, we knew to ask for the mattress topper too, which i dont think i could have taken without...literally felt like you were sleeping on a box spring alone without. There were animals everywhere which i didn't mind but some poeple were complaining about, but this is through no fault of the hotels, guests insist on feeding them constantly i observed, one lady practicly had a racoon in her lap one morning..idiot! I observed many guest with their own thermal mugs which i wish i would have thought of...would have been great for the beach. The bar was occasionally a wait in the day, my husband and i were happy with the selection of corona on tap, mojitos, and captain and cokes. My husband arranged a 2 day trip for us during our stay in which we rented a car and stayed over one night in a charming little city. i would highly recomend this we were able to visit Coba which was amazing, chitzen itza, 6 different cenotes, and akmel, which we never would have been able to do so much had we gone by tours only and it was a third of the price from what they were charging for the tours. ***BRING BUG SPRAY*** you will need it. and over pack on sunscreen, it costs a fortune there. Also it downpoured about 30 minutes at least every night, so pack a travel umbrella, it will be nice to have if you get caught in. We loved that it was adults only and will never do anything other than, there was a huge hotel next door that was packed with screaming kids and every last square inch of their beach was covered with people, we would not have enjoyed. Only complaint about hotel was that the food was not consistent, it was good one meal, horrible another. And i know this is terrible to say but my husband had a sneaking suspicion that the steak served one night at the buffett was re-served a different way the following day... but this is only speculation.

We stayed there from Jan 26-Feb 2. We loved everything about the resort. Nothing to say negative. We really loved the size of the resort. It was on the smaller size, very compact has everthing you need, but we Iiked how the pools were right beside the ocean and beach. It was the best of both worlds. You could take a dip in the pool or ocean it was all right there. Our room was right in the middle of everything which was great, not too much walking. The entertainment staff were awesome. Ricardo, the best!! Friendly, approachable, made everyone feel at home and having fun. All staff were great. Others include: Fernie, Amy, Amanda with the enteraintment and Vincente and Mary at the buffet. Food: Great food and selection at the buffet. We also went to the Italian restaurant twice and loved it. Room: Very nice and clean Staff: Everywhere was very nice and helpful Loved the adults only. We will definitly do that again Grounds: Lovely and well maintained This resort does not have a disco but I actually like what they did instead. Most resorts have a disco and you are either in the mood to continue partying and dancing or not. Well at Ocean Maya after the evening's entertainment show everyone spills out onto the courtyard and lobby bar the entertainment staff have music themes every night where the dancing continues in the courtyard. You can either sit and enjoy with a drink or take part in the dancing. I really liked how it was outside in the lovely caribean evening air rather than a dark stuffy disco. As many have mentioned the beach is not the greatest. I found that that there were red flags up several days and people in general were not going in the water the other days. The water was murky. We are not beach walkers so that is not a problem for us. I like to take a dip in the ocean and the pool so the layout with both right together was perfect. We went to Playa del Carmen 5th Avenue twice. We did not take the hotel shuttle as it was at 10am and we did not want to miss out on sun shine time at the beach. Instead we went around 5pm so we had a bit of daylight and then the evening energy. It is a MUST do. It was a 20 USD cab ride about 10 minutes. I could not believe how much fun it was. So many people, shopping, restaurants. Lots of tours to choose from in the area but one that is not so common is the half day trip to Akumal to snorkel with the giant sea turtles. Ask about this one.

What made it particularly enjoyable was the totally hospitable and friendly, warm feeling we got from all of the staff.

The staff were very professional and everyone we encountered made us feel like they cared very much about making our stay a terrific one, and it was! The food was excellent and an extensive variety to choose from. The rooms were fresh, clean, spacious and beautiful. Our balcony was near the pool and ocean, we were in villa #36 and it was great. Room 3605. A fantastic saxaphone player played each night in the main courtyard and it was so enjoyable on a warm night to sit outside with a drink and listen to the music. I had a massage by the beach and it was one of the best I have had. There were two pools which was nice, a smaller one with a swim up bar and music and one just down from it which was larger and quieter in case you didn't want to have all the action around you. The best coconut ice cream EVER. We liked that it was adult only as everything was geared towards us, a nice change. There were games around the pool with the bar each afternoon if you wanted to partake. You could put your beach chair by the pool, on the sand, and even off by yourselves for a quieter day. The beach was small but the bottom was sandy and the swimming good. We walked a few hundred yards and swam at the neighbours beach a couple of times but the bottom was much nice at our own. Drinks were excellent and the food abundant. In the morning you can get cappuccino or lattes at the bar in the lobby, each morning we were warmly greeted with a big smile by Ignacio, we loved him.

We chose this property based on the size, proximity to Playa Del Carmen and it offered something for everyone on our group wishlist. The property is smaller than many we have stayed at in this area. No trams required and I think we actually walked more due to this. This was not a bad thing as the grounds are nicely kept and as you are walking to the beach you can admire the exotic plants and interesting wildlife. We saw many iguana's, tropical birds, coati, capabara and monarch butterflies. I love photography and this region of the world has so much to photograph. I was dissapointed upon arrival because we all paid for the priveledge upgrade and I would have liked to see a bottle of champagne at the check in desk.I have enjoyed this at many resorts and think there is something special about finally arriving at your destination and being greeted in this way. The rooms are nice and it was nice also to have a decent bracelet for a change instead of the usual florescent plastic one. Our rooms were nice and upgraded. All priveledge rooms are in a 3 story building tucked close to the main lobby area. We all thought that the upgraded package would include beachfront rooms and it does not. We met people who downgraded their package to be closer to the beach. The room has a nice shower, comfortable bed and nice linens. The garden view from the patio was interesting as far as wildlife and pretty. I loved the sounds of the tropical birds.We had to call maintenance to adjust our water temp and they were right on it. Our door lock was broken and our room smelled musty upon arrival. Again they were there within an hour and had fixed the door and fumigated our room. Service- bar service was great. Ignacio at the lobby bar is great as well as Javier at the pool bar. These guys keep you laughing and are always quick to serve you. Waiter server Alberto in the priveledge buffet room was always excellent as was Aurora the omelette lady. When these servers were not present there was a difference in the level of service. Not terrible but not as good as with the regulars. food- not a huge buffet like larger resorts but a nice selection anyhow. There was a lot more food prepared fresh just for you than I have experienced at any other resort. In the main buffet there are 2 cooking stations daily. At dinner there is a seafood station which includes raw muscles, shrimp, tuna, grouper, sometimes squid and salmon. You choose what you like and they cook it for you and add whatever you like into the pan which can be simple with wine and garlic or sauces if you prefer, the meat station directly across has chicken, beef, pork, lamb, sausages etc. and the same thing. You choose and they cook it to order. There are prepared dishes also and everything was tasty and very nicely presented. There are no reservations for meals unless you have the priveledge package. You can walk in and depending on how busy get a table immediately or wait a bit. We never waited once with our package. All the restaurants were enjoyed by all. Decent wines are served and champagne with breakfast etc. A sax player plays softly at breakfast and then every night pre-dinner with a different theme of songs nightly. He is very personable and very good. Activities- Amy and her group were fantastic. There is a fellow from Venezuela and a girl that works with Amy all day and I am sorry I cannot remember their names but these people were fantastic. Loved the pool games, their sense of humor,and all of the shows at night. We would have rather not had the talent night which was comprised of guests of the hotel but rather would have liked to see another showed put on by the animation team. A free shuttle from the hotel goes to Playa del carmen daily but sign up a day ahead. Leaves at 10 the next day and comes back at 2. A nice perk. Priveledge package upgrade- we paid $300. each for the upgrade. I would definitly go that route again. Even though I was not met with a glass of champagne it flowed freely all day and everywhere. Loved the free wifi in my room, and the separate beach area with fabulous service. Those beds were fantastic and something so decadent about laying there with a lovely view. Towels were as many as you wanted daily. They provided free books, magazines, sunscreens in this area. The package includes any drink you may want so we enjoyed grand marnier, nice tequila's etc. They gave us a free beach dinner with our package also. we went as a group and they set up a special table for us in a beachside gazebo. It was lit up with candles and pretty lanterns and the meal was a set menu that you choose in advance. We had a great time. Many people have said that they did not feel priveledge was worth the price but if you can afford to spend the extra dollars it will make your holiday more special in my opinion. I forgot to mention room service- 24hours. One thing we only received once was turn down service. would have liked to see that regularly. Beach- o.k. there has been much discussion on the beach at this property. Our initial look at the beach was dissapointing. The point of land where this hotel is situated stuck out somewhat and was therefore hit hard by the last hurricane. There is approximatly a 20 meter piece of beach missing. They built a boardwalk and have placed the priveledge beds in this area. It is gorgeous but that section has no beach. To the right there is a small section of beach. You can walk to the right but as you walk you will come across some sandbags and some palms that are now in the water due to erosion. It is not like a traditional beach walk if you are dreaming of long walk.To the left you can walk for about 20 minutes. Yes you will come across some sandbags in certain areas but the beach is wide and at the end there is a beautiful Lagoon where you can snorkel. Once you hit the lagoon you cannot walk further. The first day we arrived I was expecting to see nice clear carribean blue water but instead the water was muddy and full of seaweed which made it look worse. I asked about this and there is no control and it just depends on the weather and currents. A few days in there was no seaweed, no mud due to calmer seas and the water was a nice blue. a few people were out swimming this day as well but it is not huge. My husband craved the rolling waves to body surf on and he was not able to do this here. the pools are nice though and fairly warm. one quiet and one with activities. We all had great time on our holiday. I will mention that we travel a lot and wanted to take advantage of the H1 resort loyalty program so we could try some of their other properties worldwide. We inquired at the H1 desk and although Helen was very nice it was a timeshare scam. We declined the offer of a rep joining us for breakfast and never did end up with the card.

We arrived at approx. 4pm and were checked in very quickly by the staff at the Privilege desk. (Note ** if you pay for the Privilege upgrade and require anything, you always go to this desk. They may not always be there. Ask at the main desk and they will page a Privilege rep for you) The Privilege rooms are situared in a three floor complex very close to the main resort buildings. If you have mobility issues, this could be a good option for you, although it does make for a longer walk (5 mins) to the pool, beach, Mexican and Italian restaurants. The first floor rooms are not as private as the balconies back onto a main green and walkway. If possible, request a second or third floor room. We also noticed that the air conditioning units in the Privilege complex had possible moisture issues (read: mold/mildew) and my allergies were acting up so we left the a/c off for most of the week and chose to keep the door to our balcony open instead. Here's another good tip: My spouse and I brought quite a bit of $1 bills with us for the week (tipping begins from the minute you get on the shuttle to your resort). It should go without saying that Please and Thank You or a smile go a long way. We say this because we noticed that not all guests at this resort had this attitude. Yes, you pay money to stay somewhere and you want to be served ... but you should still treat people with respect. This is probably why we feel like we got such great service from the staff at Ocean Maya, because we were very polite and respectful of them and the work they did for us. The resort staff are very accomodating. I asked for fluffier pillows and a privacy sign for the door ... no problem. We wanted extra water in our room fridge ... no problem. The Privilege option allows for free room service from a (somewhat limited) menu which was also nice when you are hungover. The premium alcohol selection is also nice if you are a big drinker, which I am not. Our room was always very tidy. They do ask you not to flush your toilet paper, but that is common (I believe) for places with low water pressure. No biggie. If you are young, or into the nightlife ... the resort may not offer what you are looking for BUT the entertainment staff will help you find a great deal on Coco Bongo tickets or a Pub Crawl in Cancun. We spent $65 each for a Coco Bongo ticket which included pick-up/drop-off to our resort and table service/unlimited drinks/Coco Bongo ticket. It was by-far ... the best night out I have ever had. The resort also has a free shuttle into Playa twice daily. I may stand corrected on that. You can also cab into Playa for $20 one way. You can also walk out to the main highway and flag down the bus for cheap. (Like less than 20pesos) both to Cancun and Playa. It's 15 min walk to the highway though. The resort also has nightly shows starting around 8:30pm. The entertainment staff work very hard and some of them were very good. Around 10pm they try to get the guests into games, or dancing. I think we were there ono a quiet week as most people were not into it. The lobby has free wi-fi. Privilege rooms have free wi-fi in the room. Good if you have business to do while on vacation. Food: I loved the breakfast buffet. Privilege has their own area in the back which is quieter and the waiters are excellent back there. You can also ask for a menu and order a la carte as well. Lunch was always served at the snack bar. We didn't realize until half-way through the week that we can ask for fresh grilled burgers or freshly grilled tortillas for fajitas. Due to the nature of the building - breezes flow through - which is why people will complain that the food is cold. Once I figured out that the burgers could be hot, or my fajitas could be hot ... solution solved. Also, even though you are Privilege, it's still a good idea to make reservations at the a la cartes. Especially at the japanese tepanyaki tables (which are a MUST!) Large parties are harder for them to accomodate on short notice. Just call the Privilege desk and they will handle everything. I love Japanese/Asian cuisine so that was my favorite restaurant. My spouse loves pasta, so hers was the Italian. Beach/Pool: Ocean Maya is smart. They are reinforcing their beach walls so along most of their property line is a boardwalk to prevent shoreline erosion. If you take a walk along the beach, you will see sad stories and palm trees being held up by ropes at other resorts. They do have smaller sections of natural beach still which you can lounge on as well. We spent a few hours in the Privilege beach area but dealing with the \"self-rightious\" attitudes of those who haul all their crap down to the beach and reserve the white balinese beach beds for four hours while they are off doing other things was a turn-off. TIP: If you want a beach bed and it's reserved ... go talk to a staff member. Everyone reserves beds, pool chairs, etc. We didn't. However if we found two empties ... we moved them where we wanted. There are two pools. One has the beach bar with music and is a little rowdy .. the other is quiet. (It was cold and cloudy when we were there I wasn't in my bathing suit much at the pool) We would have loved to have met more outgoing people at this resort, but it is not a party resort and there were not many Canadians there. The resort staff are very gay positive and did not even bat an eye when I explained that my spouse was not my sister, but my wife. If you want to party ... this is not the resort for you. The company that owns Ocean Maya is H10 and is European which would explain why there were so many people from Europe visiting. I know not every European is this way, but the ones at our resort didn't seem too friendly ... to us, or the staff. Some were just down-right rude. I suppose if you feel you paid a lot of money to go somewhere you have the right to also be an jerk sometimes too. I would definately stay with H10 while in Europe. I would not upgrade to Privilege however. Whever you choose to stay, may be it sunny and HOT. That was one thing that we missed while in Mexico and no one could fix that for us :(", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBEST TRIP EVER\u201d", "Author": "Taaryn", "ReviewID": "UR123991924", "Content": "This past December my bestfriend and I stayed at this resort for a week, we had an amazing stay and have NO complaints at all.

I loved the nightly shows, they all are really good dancers and we could tell how much effort was put into the shows. Fernanda, Amy and Amanda were always so nice and fun to chat with, they tought us the basics of how to salsa and took us on walks down to the lagoon many times. Omar was such a sweetheart and was so much fun to talk too. Thanks to polo, for taking us to coco bongo, best club ever we had a BLAST! My two favorite entertainers were Jess and Ricardo. Thanks to Jess, for keeping us in shape and burning off all the calories from the amazing food and drinks we had by doing aqua gym, he really knows how to get people into it and have fun, he always came to visit us by the pool to make sure we were enjoying ourselves! Ricardo was always getting us involved in all the activities.. Day and night! He was constantly making us laugh and he even came up to sing Britney spears with us during kareoke.

It is instead a boardwalk without access to the water. Below the boardwalk is a black murky water filled with dead organic material that washes up on the 30 feet of beach to the left of the boardwalk (facing the ocean) and it smelled very bad. It is a natural area where dead organic matter washes into the boardwalk and beach area. They have workers with pitchforks working on it all day, but I did not enjoy having them toil nearby. Working while I'm relaxing... To the right of the boardwalk is a beach portion where they have the kayaks and hobies but very limited seating... you'd have to camp all night there to get a spot the next morning. if you're inclined to go to Mexico to lay by the pool, this is your resort. The service was fair. There were a couple of waitresses who I felt I was being a bother. Once they fill your coffee and water, they don't come back. It's not a bad drive to Playa Del Carment shopping area... It's about 20 minutes away. The landscaping was immaculate, the courtyard was nice, there is a charming little waterfall that is a nice photo backdrop, and the natural mangroves all around.

This is our honest review about the First Choice flight / staff, and also the actual Hotel. We have travelled to lots of 5 star hotels in Dominican Republic and Cuba, and will base this review on comparisons to those destinations. Flights The flight left Manchester on time, and we found the leg room on the aircraft to be fine. It has the same amount of leg room as the BA flight to Cape Town we did last year. The food and entertainment was fine, we upgraded the entertainment for \u00a35 per person each way, this gives you additional films, games and a vast selection of CDs. You can create your own playlist from the huge selection and then just sit back and chill out to the music you want to listen to! I personally think the entertainment upgrade is well worth it. Drinks and snacks on board are pretty expensive, as they are with most airlines. The flight home was fine too, much quicker with the tail wind, we made it back in 8hrs 45mins. The food on the way home wasn\u2019t great, but then I\u2019m pretty fussy! First Choice Rep We thought Carlos the FC rep who is based at OMR, very approachable and helpful. He did not give the hard sell at the welcome meeting, in fact almost the opposite. He is more than willing to help you book attractions in the way that offers best value. i.e. We bought Tickets for Xplor from him, but made our own way there on the Collectivo bus, saving around $40. If we had any issues, he sorted them out straight away when reception staff proved difficult. The Hotel We arrived late afternoon, and check in was reasonably quick. We were greeted with a drink and left our luggage for the bellboy. I had e mailed in advance to request an ocean/pool view room but we did not get this. We were given a 2nd floor room in block 35. This block is to the far left of the resort as you look to the sea, and is overlooked by the hotel next door which is about 5 stories high. The patio door on this room was faulty, so we immediately went back to reception to request a room change. Within about 15 mins we were allocated a new 2nd floor room in Block 5. We enquired about upgrading to a sea view but these were all fully booked, so if you absolutely want a sea view pay when you book in the UK. Block 5 is right next to the Lobby / outdoor lounge area, we checked the room which was spacious and modern but had 2 queen beds rather than a king. The view wasn\u2019t great but it was more private than block 35. We decided to stay in this room. That night we went to bed at around 10pm absolutely shattered after the flight and time difference. It was then we realised our mistake! If you are a light sleeper and not a party animal DO NOT STAY IN BLOCK 5!!! The music from the Lobby echos right into this block, and the music does not stop until 2am. So, we asked Carlos about moving and he explained that the disco is not on every night, and see how we go on tonight. Next night\u2026same again\u2026 Now I\u2019m not boring, and I love dance music, but hardcore dance at 2am after only 3 hours sleep in 2 days is not good! My husband went to reception at 7am to request another room, but was told they had nothing available and they couldn\u2019t move us! The reception staff were very unpleasant and unhelpful. We ended up going to see Carlos the Rep, who spoke to the manager and surprise surprise they had a room available at 3pm that day. So we packed up from block 5 at 12 noon and moved into Block 23 at 3pm. This room was right in the middle of the complex, and like all the other rooms it was spacious, clean, and modern. All 3 rooms we saw looked exactly like they look in the website. We could not hear any noise in this room at all, except from above. Try to get a 2nd floor room if you can. I have a map of the complex, if you want a copy send me a personal message and I can e mail it to you. That evening we received a bottle of wine and some Chocolates with a personal message from the Manager to apologise for the room issues. Which we thought was a nice touch. There are very few true Sea View rooms at this hotel, if you want one book it in advance, and the Privilege Building is right next door to the Main Buffet Restaurant at the side of the Lobby. Not the best location in my opinion. With regards to the Privilege Upgrade, I wouldn\u2019t waste my money. Yes you have a designated area of the beach with a waitress, but they bring drinks to everyone every so often anyway., and the pool bar is less than a 1 minute walk from anywhere around the beach or pool, and is self service for soft drinks. Yes you have an extra spirits available\u2026i.e. Jack Daniels, but they use Bacardi and Absolute Vodka if you specifically ask for it. They had a separate area in the Buffet, but we never waited than 1 minute to be seated anyway. So really, I guess it just depends whether the extra alcohol and a larger room is so important to you? Rooms The room was lovely and clean, and had all the expected amenities. Walk in shower, which was fairly powerful and always hot. Flat screen TV with a few American channels showing movies at night, and BBC News. There is a hairdryer, but I didn\u2019t use it. Iron and Ironing board in the wardrobe along with the safe which is Free of charge. They provide shampoo, shower gel, mouthwash, but we always take our own. There is an alarm clock with MP3 connection, and a coffee machine. The fridge was restocked every day with 2 beers, 2 Coke, Water, Sprite and Tango. The beds are firm, but it didn\u2019t affect my sleep, and there are loads of pillows. Overall we were more than happy with our room. The Hotel gardens are absolutely spotless, there is not a single blade of grass out of place. Yes, you will definitely see wildlife in the gardens. Coatis, Racoons, Lizards and Iguana wander freely around the resort. They do not bother you if you leave them alone. The two pools are very close together, the activity pool is the smaller shallow one, and the quiet pool is larger and deeper. They play music around the pool from about 11am, yes it can get a bit repetitive, Adele, Michael Jackson, Bob Marley\u2026 you can hear the music around both pools, but If you go to far left hand side of the resort on the beach it is pretty quiet there. The Entertainment staff are great, they work so hard from early morning to gone midnight. They are there to help you have a good time, so join in or just spectate, they do fun games in the pool at 11:30, aqua aerobics at 12:00, Volleyball on the beach and in the pool, Salsa Dancing lessons, Poker games. There are also Kayaks and catamarans to use at the water sports centre to the right of the activities pool. They also do snorkelling trips, Scuba, and Parasailing for an additional fee. Food The choice and quality of food was very good. We tried all of the A la Carte restaurants, and the Italian was our favourite. I like the fact that you do not have to book, and can just turn up. The longest wait we had was half an hour, but you just get a drink and chill out. The main buffet had a large choice of food, some of the hot dishes were not always hot enough, but the salads and fruit were exceptionally fresh and always chilled. The cooking stations will cook your beef/chicken/pork/fish exactly how you want it so I would advice going for that option if you want really hot food. The A La Carte\u2019s close one day per week each. The Italian is located right next to the beach, and the food there is lovely. I can recommend the steak, chicken and salmon dishes. The ambience is nice, but can be a bit breezy down there at night. Its hard to get a spot at the Teppanyaki grill in the Oriental restaurant, I think Priviledge guests book this up. However, the food we had at a normal table was good, and the service was very good as it is in all the restaurants. The Mexican is based in the snack bar by the pool. If like me you expect Crispy Corn type Tacos like in the UK, you\u2019d be wrong. In Mexico Tacos are Flour Tortilla wraps. They do a starter which is the crispy ones, and if you ask for these as a main dish, they will make an extra large portion for you. All the staff at this hotel, with the exception Reception in our case, are really friendly, helpful and courteous. They get on with their job very efficiently, yet you don\u2019t really know they are there. In the restaurants everything is very calm and organised, which ensures a relaxed atmosphere. Some hotel buffets can have a canteen feel to them, but I didn\u2019t feel like this at OMR. The food does get repetitive after 2 weeks, but every single All Inclusive resort I\u2019ve ever been to is like that. If you don\u2019t eat everything that is on offer, every single day, you won\u2019t run out of choices. On the whole I\u2019d say the food is a good 4 star standard. We found that the buffet restaurant was often better at lunch time than in the evening. So make the effort to go back up there from the beach at lunchtime. The snack bar by the pool is good, but its nice to be in the air-con, and we had some delicious food in there at lunch. Beach \u2013 The beach in this area of Mexico has suffered extensive erosion in recent months due to Hurricanes and storms. If you want the picture perfect Caribbean beach you will not find it here. The beach has a boardwalk to protect the beach area directly in front of the hotel. The sand itself is spotlessly clean, fine white sand, and there is plenty of room on the beach to feel like you have your own space. You can access the sea at each end of the boardwalk, but when we were there, the sea was quite choppy most days, and a bit murky. We would not have been able to snorkel directly in front of the hotel. If you want to walk on the beach, you can do, but you will see that in both directions the neighbouring hotels have a really poor beach due to the erosion. There are lots of sandbags trying to keep the waves at bay. This is when you realise that erecting the boardwalk is the best thing that OMR could have to done to protect their stretch of beach. If you walk to the right the beach does improve, and you can walk a fair distance. We also went to Playa Del Carmen and the beach there has been badly eroded too. There was actually a 5ft sandbank at the beach there. Evening entertainment \u2013 We did not see many of the shows in the evening, but I know they do not get great reviews. All I will say is that I watched the Hollywood show, and I really enjoyed it. Yes, they mime, but remember these are the same people who do your volleyball, aerobics and dancing in the morning. They work really hard, and do their best. If you want Vegas shows\u2026. Then got to Vegas!!!! The entertainment here, was comparative to that in DR & Cuba. There is a saxophone player around in the evening, which can get a bit repetitive. There was always music of some sort after the show, whether it was Disco, Band or Karaoke. The waitresses in the Lobby will bring your drinks regularly, so you don\u2019t have to move from your seat if you\u2019re too tired after sunbathing all day! Other facilities \u2013 There is free wifi in the lobby, which is reasonably fast, providing its not overloaded with people trying to access it. The Gym is well equipped, and the Spa looked nice. The prices in the spa were very expensive though\u2026 There are Tennis Courts which have just had a facelift located 5 min walk down the main drive. There are a couple of shops selling souvenirs in the Lobby area, and I thought the prices were reasonable for gifts. However, if you want imported snacks like Pringles, Lays, Haribo then expect to pay for them! Pringles were about \u00a36 per tube and Lays \u00a38 per large bag! They also sell Ice creams like Cornetto, but why anyone would pay for ice cream when you can get it in the restaurants is beyond me! Mike\u2019s Coffee shop opens at 4pm until 11pm, and the drinks are really good. They also have cakes, biscuits and small sandwiches in there too. It is a shame its not open for coffee in a morning, but the staff at the Lobby Bar will make you an Espresso or Cappuccino. Out and About \u2013 We went into Playa Del Carmen using the Collectivo Buses on the main road. The hotel drive way is very long, about \u00be mile, so it takes about 10 mins to walk to the road. We felt very safe using the Collectivo and it costs about \u00a31.00 each to go to PDC. We used this transport to go to Xplor Adventure Park too, and the Mexican People were very helpful in directing us to the correct buses. On the way back we just stood at the exit of Xplor and within 5 mins a minibus pulled over for us. The Hotel also offers a Shuttle bus to PDC daily, but you have to book the day before and spaces are limited. Summary \u2013 Overall we had a great time at OMR, despite the room issue, which they put right. The hotel is spotless, rooms are clean and modern, food is of a good standard and staff really are this hotels best asset. Everyone, with the exception of Reception went over and above their duty to ensure we had a great holiday. We did not feel the need to tip anyone to get good service, the Waiters, bar staff, gardeners, maids, entertainment team, every single one of them was so helpful, friendly and efficient. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and I would definitely return to this resort in future. To compare with resorts in Cuba & DR, I thought this hotel was more contemporary, with communal areas such as toilets near the pool and in the lobby being much cleaner and smarter. I think the fact it is Adults only helps with the cleanliness are there are obviously no children to make a mess, and most of the people staying respected the environment, and didn\u2019t leave litter on the beach etc. I hope you have found my review useful in helping you to decide if this resort is for you.

We have travelled extensively and have never seen staff work so hard from the pool staff (special mention for Xavier who was great) and the main bar staff (Rafael deserves a special mention here too) the cleaners (think ours was Jobita who did a fantastic job), waiters, chefs, entertainment staff and gardeners all kept everything tip top and the place was spotless. Special thanks to Maria Lopez for arranging decorations wine and cake for my husbands birthday and being so helpful before arrival with information I needed, she even replied to an email on her day off. Our room was oceanview and was beautiful with lots of room , had no problem with the shower we thought it was great, and the bathroom was kept fully supplied with toiletries and towels, face cloths etc, everything you could possible need. The beach is not huge but is kept very clean and all this area has suffered over the last few years with the hurricanes and storms, reducing the beaches and they have done the best job possible to protect the beach here. There was a problem with sunbeds (not enough) the first week but we did see new ones arriving the second week and I would suggest that you should always have more sunbeds than visitors as it should not be necessary to get up at the crack of dawn in order to get one, but this is only a minor complaint and is one of the few things I would like to see improved. I have to say from our own experience that we could not see the point of the upgrade and would prefer it if this distinction did not exist. All in all I would say that the hotel was great value for money and the service from all the staff could not be better.

You will only confused youself and wonder if you have made a mistake. I will break my review into sections that i was most interested in and hopefully it will help some people in their decision. But myself and my partner had an amazing holiday and thought the resort was fantastic. Food I must say that some of the food is not amazing. The buffet is mediocre, unless you use the fresh preperation stations in the middle, they always have a selection of meats and seafoods.( i would recommend telling them when you would like to have your food as they can over cook things). The mexican restaurant was our favourite as the food had the most flavour and the staff were always bright and cheery. The japanese restaurant was also really good but getting a show table is virtually impossible before 9pm unless you are privilege. The italian is lovely, if you have to wait i would choose to have a drink on one of the tables on the beach as it is so beautiful. Rooms/ grounds Our room was always clean and towels were replaced daily, thanks to Patricia who was incharge of our rooms. There was not one day in two weeks that our minbar was not replaced, even when it was torrential rain. Don't bother taking a hair dryer as the one in the room is amazing! We had a few little lizards outside our room, they never got in but if you dont like things like that i would be cautious. The groundsmen work insanely hard and keep the gardens and areas in meticulous condition. Beach/ pool Im not going to lie the beach was a dissappointment. it is a much smaller area than we expected, though this is no fault of the hotel (they cant prevent mother nature). The water was often murky but you are free to stroll up the beach and find a nicer patch to swim in. in addition there is a lovely lagoon about a 10mins walk left, take your snorkel as there are hundreds of fish and even a few crabs that you can look at if you can with stand the current. The loud pool is hardly loud, well unless you have a huge inconsiderate group of americans or canadians causing unnecessary noise that is. The music can become repetitive after the first 5 times you've heard the CD though. The smaller pool is better to be around for sun bathing and having fun but the larger pool is deeper and much better for swimming. Also get up at the crack of dawn if you want a good spot as sunloungers are ALWAYS reserved past like 930am. Upgrades We considered upgrading after reading that is was well worth the money. I would have to disagree. the privilege beach area has no direct access to the beach and is away from the pool area. There is a bar in the area but there is always a member of staff walking around taking drinks orders at the pool/ beach anyway. Unless you are planning to drink your spirits neat i dont think it is worth it for the drinks either, the vodka they use is smirnoff and the rum bacardi so unless your particular. The best perks for privilge that i saw were being able to reserve at a la carte restaurants and room service. i may be mistaken but it is what i thought. Just to add the Entertainment staff work really hard and are amazing at what they do. I would recommend going to see at least a few of the shows, especially the cultural ones as they are fantastic. If you dont like bad kareoke i would skip that night, but if you want to have a laugh its not too bad ( Ricardo is really bad though haha). Carlos for first choice and thomson is really helpful and answered alot of questions that we had in regards to which excursions to go for.

Stayed at two different resorts. One being the Ocean Mayan. The food there. Is actually quite good. If you go hungry in Mexico, you are going to lose the Darwin battle. This resort has really good food. I like the fact that they seat you at a table and not have a free for all for the buffet. Ive been to other places where your tables gets taken on you while you are up getting food. They prevent that. The service is a little slow at times. But again, you are at a buffet. How much service do you really need. The ala cartes are un-real. Great service. Better food. The bartenders and servers around the complex are pretty good. they do get busy. Mainly because they actually use alcohol in their drinks, and they taste good. I have been to a few different resorts, thus place has the best food and drink of the ones I have been too. You may get something better at a 5 start, but really it is pretty good. The villas are well spread out, and it isnt a major walk to the beach, pool, or the lobby. If you cant make the walk at this place, you shouldnt really be going anywhere. The pools are clean, and a decent size. The spa is really nice, and you do have access to the hot tub for free, just have to book it. And it too is clean, and not hot, just perfectly warm for Mexico. Where the resort lacks is what you make of it. The beach isnt very big, but it is seperated. One side hosts the marina and is not all that pretty. The other side is cleaner, but much smaller. The water is murky, but its from the sand being displaced. Keep in mind, in Mexico the beaches are owned by the government, so you can go to the beaches to either side and you have access to miles of white sand. and you can get access to it with a 30 second walk. Being recently renovated facility with old infrastructure. This means... yes you have to put your toilet paper in the waste basket and not flush it. This is very typical in a certain areas of the world. Not a huge concern as long as the baskets are cleaned out everyday. Which in this case they are. Only issue about it, is some people.... not the resorts problem.... ignore this rule and flush it anyway. This causes the plumbing to back up. Can't blame the resort for this part, but how they treat you when it does happen is where they can improve. I read one review. They said 4 calls and 1 hour to come to fix it. 1 hour is not a long time to wait in any hotel for anything. To call every 15 minutes is rude and won't make the staff rush to you. We had the same issue. Within the hour they had come out and fixed the problem. Only thing being it still smelled in the room. They originally didnt want us to switch rooms, but eventually we were able to stay in another room for the night. In the end I wont return to this place, but I also wont return to any other resort. I dont like seeing the same thing over again. In fact I probably wont even do all inclusive again. So I have no preconceived notion to put this place in a positive or negative light. From what I noticed the Priledged upgrade isnt worth it, we didnt have it, but it didnt look like it was any better. Other than you get some top shelf booze, which only matters if you drink it straight. Its a nice place, a different atmosphere than a family resort, so depending on what you want you may or may not like it. In the end you are on a holiday, if you are a complainer stay home.

The staff was amazing! All the servers, bartenders and entertainment staff really added to our experience and without them it would of only been a so-so trip. The rooms and resort are nice however the air conditioners smelled like mold and we had to air out our room often. We had the priveledge package however it's only worth it if you like room service or drink alot of premium alcohol otherwise we wouldn't upgrade again. The breakfast buffet was by far the best of the day for buffets. The grill staff is really good at making fresh food for you at any time so don't be scared to try it, however make sure your wait your turn or keep your elbows out to hit those line jumping europeans. The italian and japanese a la carte were great and the staff were awesome. They are unlimited so make sure you take advantage. The beach is small on both sides of the resort as the erosion from the storms was easy to see up and down the beach for all hotels. The blue lounge chairs are pretty comfortable however same as all resorts people leave towels on chairs and don't come back. Just address the staff and if people are doing this they will help you find a spot. All the bad reviews we read from mostly europeans did not do the place justice. This resort is linked to a european hotel chain hence the very european feel and customers. Most of the europeans we encountered on the resort were very arrogant and rude to the staff. They acted as if they owned the place and should be waited on like a paid butler. This resort is also pretty mature and tame at night so if your ages 18-35 look for another resort as you won't find the fun you want unless your not into that scene. The pools are nice but they are not heated and it gets chilly by 4pm. If you like to keep to yourself and don't really drink or socialize this is the resort for you.

We booked our trip through Marlin Travel in Delta BC. We decided to get the Privilege upgrade, mostly so we would have a better selection of room, en carte dining privileges, and early check in and late check out. Of the things we were hoping for we got only late check out. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30 at night and the only food available was a limited room service. Our room was a junior suite that was too close to the main loby. There was kareoke going on and it was carrying to our suite. The suite was nice with a king size bed and a spacious suite. Problem was that the room wasn't close to the beach and you couldn't see anything but the solid wall when sitting on the deck. I had a shower and the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor. I mopped it up and my partner had her shower and we mopped it up again. The toilet leaked around the base onto the bathroom floor also. Next morning, we asked for a different room, only to be told that there were no more rooms in the Privilege section available. We would have to move to a regular room and there would be no rebate for our Privilege status. Later in the afternoon our new room was available for us. It was a nice room with a king size bed and a railing that we could see the garden area and other buildings. We no long had premium service with juices and hard liquor in our fridge, beach towels etc. The cable connection was torn out of the TV so there was no TV reception. It took three days to get a new TV and the new one didn't turn on. I didn't try to get another one as we only had a couple of days left and who watches TV in Mexico? For all our trouble the concierge gave us a romantic dinner on the beach. An hour before we were to have dinner they phoned to cancel because it looked like rain. After we had our regular dinner we went for a walk and there were couples having their romantic dinners on the beach. This was very disappointing for us. Next day we asked the concierge about this and she arranged for us to have our romantic dinner in the restaurants wine cellar as it was raining cats and dogs. The food in the three a la carte was adequate but selection was minimal. The pictures on the hotel on their web site show a beautiful beach in front of the hotel. There is very little beach left as it was destroyed by a hurricane 4 years ago and they have replaced it with a wall and a board walk. This hotel claims to be a 4 1/2 star hotel. In our opinion it was 3 1/2 to 4 at best. The girl that worked in the Privilege area of the beach (?) was the best thing we ran into during our stay. Her name is Yvonne and she was so sweet and helpful we couldn't have asked for more. Weather was warm approx.76 degrees during the day, and we only had one day of rain.

I arrived at 10am, checked in and spent some time at the pool, and my room was ready promptly at 3pm.

The rooms here are beautiful, just what you see in the photos on the website. I did not pay for the \"privileged\" upgrade, because for me it wasn't worth the extra money for the balinese beds on the beach, the upgraded rooms or the better alcohol.

The food suited me just fine, the quality and variety at the buffet is great, although I remember from my last trip that the food in the specialty restaurants was not great (other than the Mexican).

Grounds - are beautiful, well kept, staff are always working hard. A la carte's - Mexican 4 stars, Italian 3.5 stars (never got what we ordered but stilled enjoyed it) Japanese 3 stars (if your not seated at the entertainment table the food is average). Buffet - 3.5 stars. the first week the food was good sometimes hot / worm but week 2 they seam to be short staffed not all the food stations were full or replenished once depleted. Guest services - will help you in every way they can. Bars - fantastic likely best I've had, Friendly fast service, engaged in conversation with everyone who wanted to talk I learned a ton of Spanish from all the bar tenders. Entertainment - fabulous, If you want to get involved or not they will keep you laughing, If you can stay awake until the late show take it in you wont be sorry. Check in - was fast friendly, we were first placed on the main level, we requested a second level room and got it day 3. Spa - we took advantage of the beach massage hut for a 90 minute massage, I felt like soft butter for two days afterwords. Security - My wife and myself usually take taxis to get around. Security records where you are going, your room number, the taxi's plate number and drivers licence number both at the hotel lobby and at the resort's entrance gate every time. Cons Resort - lobby looks dated, late 70's could use an upgrade soon Beach - maybe a bit small, but very clean. A la Carte's(3) - adequate for a 1 week stay but for longer stays would like to have another choice or two. Specialty coffee shop - opened at 4:00 PM ??? I like my latte when I wake up. I spoke to guest services they said they had several complaints about this and may open in the morning next week.

Even if it is very nicely built, the beach is just for the pool, if you would like to go into the sea you will have to walk until the near lagoon or other resort to have a nice sea.

We immediately went back and asked for a different room. They obliged and got another room for us although it took a couple hours to get ready. No worries, we went to the bar. We ended up getting a room in one of the smaller buildings and the room was much bigger with a queen size bed. The staff was all very friendly, although they do ask you to attend a time share meeting for a 100 dollar voucher. We declined, and they never bothered us about it. I liked that it was adults only. The pools here were great, although the ocean front is not great for swimming. However you can walk down the beach to other beaches that you can swim in. If you walk down the beach about a mile, you get to a place where there are some little freshwater streams that flow into the ocean. It was really awesome and we did some snorkeling there and there were lots of cool fish. The only complaint we had was about the food. The Japanese restaurant was quite good, the Italian restaurant was pretty good, but the buffet was sub-par at best, and the Mexican restaurant was awful. However the bars were good, but they could use more of them, another one down by the pools and another in the lobby/restaurant area.

We have stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe and the Grand Palladium, both in the Mayan Riviera. The Ocean Maya is significantly smaller but everything they have is on par with other 4-5 star resorts of this nature in the area. Of course there are fewer restaurants and bars, but we found in the larger resorts we frequented the same ones over and over anyway. Everything is close by - a walk from the beach to the reception is 10 mins at the very most - therefore pretty much any room location leaves you convenient to everything, and no golf carts or trains to wait for. The pool areas run along the beach, similar to the Bahia, which is lovely and convenient. You can walk for miles in either direction along the shore, keep in mind that past hurricanes have wreaked havoc on beaches in this area and some resorts are definately having difficulty maintaining their beach - therefore some areas for swimming are better than others. The Ocean Maya is further along in their restoration than others and have done a commendable job in building the boardwalk and protecting two separate swimming areas. Food quality is excellent at both the a la cartes and the buffets - buffets definately better than the Palladium. Although there are only 3 a la cartes, the menu on each are quite extensive, so going back 2 or 3 times still leaves lots of choices.

WE had a lovely room that was super close to the beach in building 37. There was a jacuzzi on the patio, nice patio furniture, a white leather furniture set in the room as well as a king size bed. I believe we got these upgrades due to the Orbitz package we booked. Nice perk! There was also sparkling wine and treats in our room upon arrival. We booked a dinner under the full moon out on the beach complete w/ our own waiter! Highly recommend this ..very romantic and fun! We had a super waiter. Wish I could remember his first name. He works also at the Mexican Restarant at night. Steak, Shrimp, great service, yummy desserts, appetizers etc...well worth it for a special night. Inquire at Guest services each menu level has a price. The beach as we all know is \"different\" and is not the fault of the OMR just mother nature taking back via Hurricane a few years ago. They lost 30' of beach front and I can imagine at one time it was an outstanding stretch of beach. They did a super job with what they had to work with take a quick walk to your left down to Tres Rio's...gorgeous river system on the mangroves that meets the ocean. Refreshing, beautiful and a wonderful spot for photo opportunites. We walked to the right one day down the beach for about 45 minutes and yes you have to walk up over a golf course etc for a few steps and then back down...but no worries...nice to get a good walk in. Even tho we are huge beach people and this in not anyway as nice as say the beach at the Catalonia Royal Tulum or say Punta cana we did still enjoy our time on the beach reading and people watching and napping each day. Ahhh vacation can't beat it. We did feel the saggy , old fashioned beach loungers in the area where we laid each day just off the activities pool really really really need to be upgraded. It was like you were laying right on the plastic. Ouch. And I think they should have a few more of the little tables so your stuff, kindles, books, sunglasses are not sitting right in the sand. Did a nice side trip for a day to Isla Mujeres via the hotel and it was a full long day but well worth it. Nice sail on a catamaran, snorkeling, lunch, shopping in isla etc... catch a collectivo out on the highway for $2.00 a person to PDC but you have to walk out to the road from the lobby. There is a shuttle that runs from 10 till 2 that you book at the guest services one day in advance. It's free but the time was not worth it to me to give up my beach and sun time. A taxi will run you about $15.00 to PDC the bellman can summon one for you as they are waiting out at the security gate. the staff was lovely. Our maid was spot on each day. All toiletries refilled and towels etc...the water soda fridge guy did a great job each day and we would leave a little tip and request more beer instead of say tonic water and we always got it. There was in our fridge orange soda, coke, sprite, diet coke, tonic water, and 2 different juices, beer and water. SCORE!!! xaiver at the pool bar is hands down this properties best waiter. He could run the bar taking care of 6 people at a time seriously all the time with a smile and he had a way of keeping guests under control when they had too much to drink or bringing a smile out of newbies etc..he is great. Drinks were good...yes, the are going to offer the bottom of the line stuff but polietly request the other level you are entiteled you and you will get it. You will only get the stuff on the cube shelf that says privelege if you have paid for privelige. And we didn't see anything on that shelf that was really, really worth paying for. We found lots on our level that we liked. The bartenders that filled in for Xaxier while he was on break or off for the day just didn't have his level of bartending and it wasn't the same vibe. The lobby bar is where it's at in the evening as well as the little courtyard outside the lobby. Lots of people playing cards, on their computers and smart phones etc...just winding down and socializing. They staff does put on a show and they do have a coco bongo's trip for a fee etc...but we were always too tired to partake. We really enjoyed the talented sax player that played there most nights. you can order off the menu while sitting at the lobby bar after 11 p.m. if you got in late and the restaraunts were closed etc...simple menu, burgers, sandwiches etc.. most of the food was really good. Not exceptional but good. We wished the mexican night at the buffet on the thursday nigth were more \"mexican\" we wished there were more choices. Mashed Potatoes to me are not mexican. lol loved the italian. The japense was fun at our show table. mexican by the beach was good. Loved the ordering off the menu. during the day we never managed to venture to the main buffet to see what they had we just made our way to the Mexican restarunt by the beach that was a buffet at lunchtime. There was a gal that was chef while we were there and she was always busy keeping the variety going fresh fish, burgers, beef, chicken etc...loved the guac and pico. They had ice cream that everyone seemed to enjoy. Self serve cones. Loved the Sparkling wine. It was free flowing at all bars and also at breakfast with mimosa's. the grounds are lovely, lovely, lovely. Colorful, and well taken care of. We liked that our room was way down by the beach because during the day that is where we like to be and at night it was a pretty lit walk to the lobby. We felt the young gal that served at hostess at breakfast and in the lunch buffet could probably use a lesson in smiling. The one with the long hair pulled back in a pony tail I don't think we saw her smile at Anyone in the 7 days we were there. She would just point to where we were to be seated and never friendly, never a HOla or welcome or how is your vacation. I don't know if she was shy or snobby but either way..she needs more training. One day she pointed to a section where she wanted us to go and we asked nicely if we could sit in a section where our favorite waiter was...she seemed almost huffy that we messed with her routine. Sorry but he was good to us and we were good to him with the tips. After all we are the customer we should be able to have the waither we wanted. The lobby bartenders meh! they also need a lesson in friendlness. not once in one week stay of us being up there each and every night did they say hello, how is your stay, how are you ...nothing...nothing nothing. They wouldn't even say \"how may I help you\" they would just stand there and wait for you to say what you wanted\"...for me the \"little details\" of customer service are what makes a resort whether it's big or small and it's these little details that get the repeat customers. They need to work on this area imo. And yes for the record we did tip them. There were two gals at the front guest services desk that we really enjoyed. Sussana and Judith both are in training and will do well for this resort. There was also a friendly gal from Germany that was in training that did a good job for us when we had questions etc.. We find that this resort after recently being converted to to adults only has soooo much potential and to me it falls in the little details. We had a great stay we totally felt we got our money's worth but had we spent top dollar on this resort we might have felt like we got gypped. We originally were going to the Catalonia Royal tulum but got a better price on this so we thought we would give it a try. As I said we did have a great time and there was lots about it that we did like but it's not \"quite' where it needs to be if they are going to cater to adults only. There is a nice book exchange at the towel hut. The bathrooms everywhere on the property were clean and well maintaned. Bathrooms close to the beach which we like. The E team did a great job of getting people that were interested in the games and contests involved at the big pool. We didn't participate but we did enjoy watching them from the beach. They had a fun variety of games each day and they also had a texas hold 'em tourney every few days that was popular as well as showing you how to make drinks etc...at the tables set up. they get an \"a\" for effort.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lesleyOntario", "ReviewID": "UR122920868", "Content": "we stayed here for 2 weeks from 26th dec, 2011, rooms are small but adequate with shower only.

We did not dot he \"premium\" deal. The resort is clean, landscaping is gorgeous, and the staff is very friendly. We've stayed at a few \"budget\" all-inclusives, and this was by far the best of the bunch in terms of drinks. The rooms are clean, new and comfortable. We were initially booked in a double-double by mistake and those beds seemed more comfortable than the King bed, where we eventually transferred to. There really aren't that many activities to do here at night, so if you are a \"night owl\" type, you might find this place boring. The only bar that's open late night is the one in the lobby. It's not a huge resort, but during a high season, it might take a while to get your drinks. They work really fast, tho! They do have good tequilas, vodkas and gins, and will pour them if you ask. Otherwise you get the generic bottom shelf kind. We didn't try any of the specialty restaurants. The Buffet dinner/lunch is OK. Nothing special. Surprisingly bad Mexican food on \"Mexican Night\"... The cooked-to-order seafood section is your best bet. A lot of the dishes were over-seasoned in my opinion, but then it could just be me...Also, there is no food option after midnight, so if you plan to drink up with your friends at night, don't count on late night Pizza or anything! The beach is pretty sad. It's really small part of the resort. So if you are expecting miles and miles of white sand beach, you will be disappointed. The sand is really smooth, but as people have said, the currents make the water look really muddy - it's not dirty, just muddy. It seems to clear up every now and then, and for us, it cleared up on our last day. The beach is a tiny section of the oceanfront. Most of it is that boardwalk like structure. There are lots of sands and shady areas - just not wave crushing, shell collecting, swim-able type. The gym has two rickety treadmills, couple of elpticals and a stair master. Also so free weights and weight training machines. Nothing to write home about. If you are a runner, and not a fan of beach running, just run from the Dive house up to the resort gates...that's about 0.9 miles (I had Garmin). Do a little loop inside the resort and you'll get a mile out and a mile back. I recommend this place for a short R&R, but won't recommend for anything over a week, unless you are a type that's happy to sit on a lounger and read all day. We rented a car (Erica's fantasitc) and went out to Akumal to swim with the Turtles and Tulum. It seemed like while there were many tours to the Eco Parks, there were none that did Tulum and Akumal in one day. Renting a car for a day turned out to be the best thing we did. Cheap Turtle swim tour in Akumal, delicious dinner at a taqueira in Playa del Carmen for pennies, and we did this without speaking any Spanish, other than \"Margarita Por Favor\".", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cA Standard All-Inclusive\u201d", "Author": "BubblesNYC", "ReviewID": "UR122822980", "Content": "The hotel and property was immaculate - well taken care of and the staff was very friendly. We were there over the New Year holiday and on January 1 there wasn't a chair to be found on the beach or at the pool so we upgraded to the \"privilege\" area which had plenty of chairs and a waiter who brought drinks, etc - this was worth the extra $40/person (which also entitled us to a room upgrade to the privilege rooms). Our waitress, Azucena, was fantastic - she didn't miss a beat for the 3 days we were under her care! The rest of the trip there were ample chairs outside of the privilege area. Also, the hotel property has only two small beaches - most of the waterfront area is actually on a sea wall and the water churns a lot so it makes it brown versus the clear blue that you want in Mexico. And, the privilege area is bound by the sea wall and not on the beach (although there is sand) and goes right up to the sea wall. The pools were great - they started activities @ 11am. One thing I didn't figure out from any of the reviews on this site is that the hotel lobby and main dining areas and most of the rooms were actually about a 2-3 minute walk from the beach/pool. The rooms are all (with the exception of maybe 10) set back on the property and there are no ocean views. The views are all of lush greenery, etc. So, if you want a hotel where you get an ocean view when you wake up in the morning, then this isn't it. The privilege rooms back up to the parking lot where all of the service trucks and various buses pull in early in the morning so we heard the reverse beeps of every delivery truck each morning starting at 7am. Probably would not stay in privilege rooms again for this reason. The spa was fantastic - they have a really nice relaxation room as well as showers, sauna and jacuzzis. The ambience in the service rooms is great - book Diana for a deep tissue if that's your thing. Incredible. The food was good and there was plenty of variety for everyone. The hotel is only @ 5-10 minutes from the city of Playa Del Carmen. We went in for dinner one night and spent some time wandering through shops before dinner - really festive and fun even on a Tuesday. All in all, this hotel is fine but I think I prefer their sister property Ocean Coral & Turquesa even though my review of that hotel isn't completely positive either.

It is a Blue Couples hotel (meaning no kids, adult only), which we saw as an advantage. When we arrived after 12hr flight and few hours of transfers we were greeted with swift check-in, and our baggage was taken care of accordingly, as is to be expected from a five star resort. Our initial room was 1307, and it was very nice and spacious, with a nice view over a walkway leading to the pool area, and it was quite close to the reception and the main restaurant \"Hacienda\" where all the evening events are held. Rooms: The room was very nice, but since it was close to the main area, and we were a bit jetlagged so we went to sleep first days quite early, and had some problems falling asleep due to the evening program that would last until cca 23:30. We requested a different room, and were moved the next day to 2407. This other room was very quiet but was close to several ponds, and had a bit of mosquitos. It was not really a deal-breaker so we kept it. Beach & Pool: The staff is very nice and will politely greet you every time you pass by with a smile. We did not spend too much time in the hotel's beach and pool area, but the time we spent was nice. The entertainment staff approached us and took us to play beach volleyball which was nice. The pool area is nice, and so is the beach. Note that there is a special area of the beach which is reserved for \"privilege\" program, which we thought was not worth it, so we stayed on the regular beach. The main benefit of privilege (at least in the beach area) is nicer sunbeds, and regular waiters coming to attend to your needs in terms of drinks. My only comment is about the sea quality in front of the beach, that was so so, since there was quite an amount of seaweed in the water, so do not expect beautiful turquoise swimming area in the sea in front of the hotel or any adjacent hotels (we walked on the beach to check). It would be nice if they could clean it somehow. But since we only spent 3 days (out of 14) at the resort, it was not a big issue. Restaurants: There are 3 main restaurants, and although both the Italian and Oriental was superb, we chose to stick with the main one \"Hacienda\" as it had buffet with the best selection of food. There is also a snack bar \"Charro\" by the pool, which is decent for a snack, but the food was much better in other restaurants. The restaurant staff is quick, friendly and unobtrusive and in our opinion deserve every credit. Even if the restaurant was closing at 22h and we stayed until 22:15 and requested a waiter if he could bring us an espresso from the cafe bar, we were greeted with a quick service and a smile. Regarding the New Year's Eve the hotel staff have really outdone themselves: Ice sculptures in the main area, food buffet that beats Maldivian buffet hands down (meat, seafood, lobsters, salads, gourmet, you name it), and the entertainment program that created a great atmosphere. We did not feel we missed out anything by choosing to stay at the hotel for the New Year. The spa is nice and we have booked 3 massages, and did not experience any problems i have noticed in the previous reviews for this hotel. Also the water-sports center allows you to take out catamarans (as a part of all-inclusive offer) as long as you know how to sail them. If not, the course will cost approx 30 USD and lasts 30 min, and after that you can take it any time you like. Events / Tours: The tour desk offers a variety of tours to explore the surrounding area, and some we have already pre-booked, and some we took, but overall we were very happy with the tours (Isla Mujeres, Cozumel, Chichen Itza). We especially recommend to check out Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve with Jeeps. It was truly an unforgettable experience. Our last night we went to Coco Bongo club (arranged from the pool area guys for 65 USD / person), which was a good deal, since we had no waiting in queues, all drinks included, and we had Omar from the entertainment staff joining us to ensure we get good service. Coco Bongo is a night club, but they also have a show that would resemble a cabaret which we thought was spectacular, and money well spent. To sum it up, we had an amazing vacation in Ocean Maya Royale, and would gladly return, our only comment would be if they could clean the sea in front of the beach a little. The Good: * Beautiful Hotel Premises * Friendly Staff * Clean Rooms * Excellent Food * Great Tours * Coco Bongo was great The Not So Good: * Few rooms close to reception prone to noise * Sea at the beach is not the nicest", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "mississauga", "Title": "\u201croyal?\u201d", "Author": "trysoccer63", "ReviewID": "UR122684578", "Content": "Just got back from the Ocean Maya,it is an adult only ,nice hotel .

The mini-bar was kept well stocked for us and the maid did a good job of tidying the room, although some days this would happen quite late on in the afternoon. The restaurants (buffet, japanese, italian, mexican) were all excellent considering that it is mass catering. The pool has a quiet area and a more active area where they play tequila volleyball etc. Unfortunately the quiet area is where the pool bar is and they play loud club music throughout the day and people stand there for hours drinking cocktails getting progessively more raucous which doesn't make for a peaceful swim/sunbathe!! It also makes it hard to get served if you want to take drinks back to your place on the beach although they have serve yourself soft drinks dispensers which helps. The beach area was beautiful. The only issue was getting a sunlounger. This hotel has a rule for not reserving loungers but it is in no way enforced. People were leaving their sunbeds for hours at a time leaving their towels and books behind so that others didn't use them. If you don't get up at the crack of sparrows to reserve a lounger you won't get one (certainly not at the time of year we went anyway). There are hammocks but no shelter/shade in that area and a limited number of padded beds for Privilege guests only. In my opinion, Privilege is not worth the extra money. These beds are the only tangible bonus you really get and there are so few beds I imagine you could well end up without anyway! We found the staff to be friendly on the whole - especially in the little on-site shops. Some in the Mexican restaurant were quite abrupt as were some of the bar staff in the main lobby, at the pool bar, and the towel shack. Most however offer you an \"ola\" whenever they see you and a lovely smile. Take PLENTY of money for tips - a lot of all-inclusive resorts have a strict no tipping policy but not this one. They play up the tips here big time. We boarded the free transfer from the airport to the hotel and were actually asked as a group for a tip for the driver and host before we had even set off! Our rep also told us to make sure to leave plenty of money for the housekeeping staff at the beginning of the holiday and to tip the barmen well each time we ordered a drink in order to get good service.I have to say - I have travelled a fair bit but this was the first time I had been recommended to tip BEFORE getting any level of service in order to make sure it was good, but there we go. Things work differently in different places. The evening entertainment and themed nights were great - particularly the mexican night! The other guests very sociable and supportive...thinking back to karaoke :-). Only one guest in the room above ours created any trouble during our stay by having a punch up with a couple of other guys in his room and crashing and banging about. They ended up outside our front door and we called security but by the time they arrived the guys had scarpered. We didn't hear anything else from them after that - put me a little on edge though! We booked this last minute for a good price and considered the holiday to have been a success. We were there for a week and both decided that had it been two weeks we may have started to have gotten a bit bored with the food options and activities etc. despite the excursions we did every other day to local sights such as Chichen Itza etc. Other couples we met felt the same. You are really tied to the resort in the evenings which wasn't a problem for our stay but might be something for others to consider when booking. The one thing our agent didn't tell us about until we got there was that you have to pay 700peso each departure tax in cash at the airport before boarding your return flight. This works out at about \u00a335 each so if you are keen on budgeting before you go - don't forget this. We only took what we intended to spend on tips and souvenirs so when we were told about this it was a bit of a shock and used up a fair bit of the spending money we had put aside. Also it was tricky to get hold of peso in cash once we were out there because we were so tied to the resort or were on planned group outings. Oh and don't book with Thomson like we did - the rep was a guy who was absolutely shocking. His welcome meeting lasted TWO HOURS! People were falling asleep. He was suppsed to clear up a problem with some excursion tickets for us and never did leading to embarassment on our part when we arrived for the excursion. He also asked that we give him a high score on the customer survey as he really needed it...hmm...Ten minutes before our coach was due to return us to the airport he sloped off somewhere which meant that the group of us with Thomson kept trying to get on to the wrong bus etc. as ours was late and didn't really know what was happening! We sorted it out between us in the end and it's quite funny when we look back on it really, I suppose, but my advice would be to steer clear of Thomson and book through someone else if you can. If you must book through Thomson though, whatever you do, DON'T GO TO THE WELCOME MEETING!! Read the binder at the Thomson desk instead - all the info is there for you :-).", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "stanwood", "Title": "\u201cLoved this vacation!\u201d", "Author": "StanwoodBlick", "ReviewID": "UR122620769", "Content": "We stayed at the Ocean Maya December 26 thru January 1.

I will not bother with describing the hotel and grounds because this has been covered extensively. I will say the negative reviews have left all four of us baffled. This is a beautiful adults only resort. It may not be perfect, but they are really trying and we all think this is a place to return to. A very good value for the cost. Ocean Maya Royale put on the best New Year's Eve party I have ever experienced! Everything from terrific food, great entertainment, lovely decorations and fireworks on the beach. A special mention goes out to John Talin, their sax player in the evenings and weekends. A talented and gracious man.

We knew that we wanted an adult only resort that was not too big. This resort was awesome. We went from dec 28-jan 4- it was quite busy until new years and then it was really quiet Food- there are three a la carte restaurants to choose from, you can go to the restaurants as often as you want. The italian was ok, we only went there once. The Mexican was delicious, I wish we would have gone more often. The Japanese blew our minds- best Japanese food I have ever had. The buffet had a lot of options also. There was a pool side restaurant for lunch that I thought was very good- hamburgers and fries as well as classic Mexican cuisine. The one negative my husband found was that they said there was a midnight snack bar, but every time we tried to go it was not open, so after 11pm there was no food. Rooms- the rooms were good, quiet. We paid extra for an ocean view and although we couldn't really see the ocean it was worth the money as we were very close to the pool and the beach. The rooms were spacious and clean- the cleaning staff did a great job every day Entertainment- the entertainment staff were great, and quite funny. There are tons of options for activities during the day. The activities start at 6:30 at night- normally with some music, then a theater production at 9:30 (these productions were good, there were the typical cultural ones mixed with some productions I have not seen anywhere else). After the theater there was always something that went on from 10:30-12:00. If you wanted, a shuttle went to the bar every night. also, they have a free shuttle to playa del Carmen which was awesome. Bars- were great. They had a drink menu which was always helpful, and had many options for drinks. Spa- worth the money. I got a great deal on a massage and pedicure. Be warned, the staff must get paid on commission as they are often coming around the pool asking if you want a massage or a free 5 minute massage which is always followed by a proposal for their services- they are not pushy, if you say you are not interested they leave you alone. Previledge- on the website we has the option to book as a priviledge package as you got perks at the resort. We did not get this package and once we were there we did not think it was worth it. You get the chance to reserve at the restaurants- this would be beneficial if you went with a large group. There is a special section at the buffet as well, but the restaurant was huge and there was no lack of seating. There were some alcohols that were privilege, but we found they had everything that we would drink in the normal section. There was also a roped section of the beach with a waiter- the beds looked comfortable, but we didn't see it as a anything special Overall this resort was awesome. I would recommend it to anyone. I have been to 7 all inclusive resorts and this one would rate as one of the best.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal Canada", "Title": "\u201cNOT A FIVE STAR, YET NOT REALLY A THREE STAR, SOMETHING IS MISSING WITH THIS RESORT\u201d", "Author": "Blue62", "ReviewID": "UR122577342", "Content": "We always book two wks in 5 star resorts, and usually return if it is wonderful. We booked this resort as a 5 star only for the xmas week, left 25th returned 01 january. We already had booked our winter vacation at el Valentin Imperial, in riviera maya for two wk stay jan.18 2012. Second time we are returning at Valentin. The resort is super clean, spacious, and extremely quiet, I m canadian, and don t fancy the westerners rumbuctious and loud behaviour. This resort was very quiet with baby boomers of same mature age. A lot of nice folks from U.K and some Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario. I enjoyed the atmosphere on the pool side and beach area. You never have problems looking for beach chairs. One thing that particularly ticked me off the very first day is that they have signs prohibiting chair reservation, but the resort has a section on the beach side roped up reserved for PRIVELEGE guests. In there you have lawn chairs, and beautiful beach beds, with a waitress waiting on those 20 beach chairs and beds from 8am till late evening. I noticed a regular guest like us request a lawn chair from in that reserved area, there were a lot of unoccupied chairs in the reserved section at that time....she was refused to take a lawn chair out of that area. So the hotel has double standard regulation. While this reserved area was waited on at all times with drinks fruit and fresh water, the rest on the beach area were not. They had one waitress come around taking drink orders, in the entire week we were there, we saw her twice, the only time we ordered drinks on the beach. They are very limited in staff. And something is just not right with the staff s attitude. They are not the usual happy waiters and waitresses, I got the impression they were not happy, and it rubs off on the tourists. Even though we always tip, they take the tip but ....so what!!! no big deal. When we arrived the mini bar was bare, when I asked the house maid, she told me to call the reception. OUt of the 7 days we were there our rooms were made up five times, I would go back to my room at 4 30 ish, and twice it was not done, when she came knocking at 5. had to send her back, as we were showering and frankly was not the time to have the made in our room. The morning buffet was in my opinion not very good, we could sit outside, for they had about 10 tables set outside, ...no salt and pepper , and you had to ask for your utensils. The waiter would bring your coffee, but neghlect to provide utensils, we are talking about 7:30am now. We would ask for ashtray the waitress would say yes, and never come back. Like i stated earlier, something is missing here, and the staff is not quite there. The breakfast and lunch buffet, were soso, definitely not five star either. The same meals day after day, they pile up fried eggs, and do not provide the proper laddles to pick them up, so you have to take them with prongs..... It s the little details that are missing with this hotel that does not make it a five star resort. The restaurants.....TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ABOVE. The japanese restaurant had wonderful service, wonderful delicious, beautiful presentation , and again great food. The italian Dolce Vita....THE SAME AS THE YOOKOOSO, food, service , presentation definitely a 5 star. The Charro, mexican....well consider this one like the buffet, service was poor. NewYears eve, we were spoiled. They gave it all on dec. 31st, They had arranged a ROYAL BUFFET SUPPER, all restaurants were closed, and the entire guests were at the buffet, They had ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING, from lobster tails , Tbone steaks, salmon steaks, sushi, godiva chocolates, white and dark chocolate fountains, Loads of fruits , smoked salmon, smoked fish, prosciutto, and i can go on and on, They had arranged white tables, with all the party favors, live band, mariachi, and at midnight fireworks.. DEFINITELY A SUCCESS, AND WORTH FIVE STAR. So this hotel , hovers over 3.5 to 5 star, would not take much effort for them to get up to the five star. Staff needs to be happier and more at guests service. Breakfast and lunch buffet could be improved. They would pile up about 5 lbs of bacon on the grill, and grill it all at once, hence bacon usually not fully cooked. You see, it s little things like that. I paid the price of a five star resort, probably because of the holiday season, I was told it was a five, but definitely not worth the price nor the stars they advertise.

There are definately more pros than cons. But as with any property there is always room for improvement. One of the first things I would like to comment on is the fact that this property is located along a stretch of the beach along with about nine other resorts north of town. It is located an honest 15 - 20 minute drive north of Playa del Carmen, so if you think you will be able to walk out of your resort and down 5th Ave visiting the different shops - you are mistaken. It cost us $20.00 one way to take a taxi into town. I was told you could also take el cheapo for around 30 pesos but I did not try it. The resort does have a shuttle that goes into town twice a day at 10:00am and 2:00pm if you want to go at any other time, you need to pay your own way. Also, this resort has a very small beach area if that is important to you. It has the same amount of ocean front as most properties, but being the way the land curves they had to build a retention wall along most of their waterfront in order not to lose any land. There is a nice glass wall & boardwalk along the retention wall to walk on. Another question I've heard ask is it worth paying the extra money for the privelege area or not. Personally I felt like it was worth the extra money. We never had to wait for dinner seating, while we saw some people get turned away and told to come back as much as an hour later. We had a private area on the beach and never had a problem with chairs. Our server on the beach was the nicest person I've ever met. If everyone was like Azucena the world would truely be a better place. Everytime she came to ask us if we would like something and bring it back to us she would curtsey and say \"my pleasure\". There was a \"romantic\" dinner at poolside or beach that had a special menu that was wonderful. In the main breakfast area there was a private dining area that was much quieter than the main dining room. The main server we had in there, Alberto, was awesome. If he is not the head waiter he needs to be promoted. Although there were many good waiters, Alberto surpassed them all. His expertise should be used in training new waiters. Staying in the privelege area also allowed you to order off of the menu if you did not want to go through the buffet. We personnally never did order off of the menu. I heard some people comment that some of the food on the buffet was not very warm. We never felt that was a problem because Aurora would always make you an omelet on the grill for breakfast or chicken, steak, or fish for lunch. Always with a smile. Another benefit of the privelege section is a selection of pillows. The pillows they usually put on the bed are rock hard. We forgot this was a benefit the first few nights and I slept on my travel pillow because the normal pillows on the bed are so hard. The Dive It! Scuba and Fun Center is great! They have catamarans free to use. They also offer scuba, snorkeling and para sailing for a fee. We felt they were very reasonable. The biggest disappointment was the price for massages at the spa. The spa manager, Dulce Santana, did not have a very good grasp of marketing concepts. She would rather charge exorbant prices and see her massage therapists stand idle 50 - 75 percent of the day. The cheapest price we were given was $150.00 for a couples massage for 50 minutes. In Playa del Carmen at Veronica's Massage you can get a couples massage for $50.00 for 50 minutes. When we talked with other people staying at the resort. This was the opinion of every guest we spoke with whether they were from the United States, Canada, or Europe. So if massages are one of the main reasons you are going to Mexico for a relaxing vacation I would go to a different resort actually located in town so you can walk to a cheaper place. I emailed the spa twice before leaving asking for prices and packages for the massages being this was one of the main reasons we chose to go to Mexico. After talking with friend who had gone this summer, they had commented on how good and cheap the messages were. Reading on Trip Advisor we read how cheap and good the massages were in Playa. We felt like we were held captive and ripped off at this resort being they advertised they were in Playa del Carmen. One wouldn't think you would have to look at a satellite map to see how far they are actually located outside of Playa del Carmen. If you don't ever want to leave the resort this is a great place. If you want to do anything outside of the resort you will feel like you're being held captive. If the General Manager, Giovanni Gil, is aware of the pricing structure at the spa then he is aware of people getting ripped off at his property. If he is not aware of the pricing structure at the spa he is not doing his job properly. Next time we will choose a different resort souly because of the location and pricing structure of the spa!", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcestershire", "Title": "\u201cFab,Relaxing,Holiday\u201d", "Author": "gemloo", "ReviewID": "UR122525635", "Content": "After booking this in May after looking at lots of hotels the reviews were excellent but a few weeks before we left they got worse and worse and wondering what we had let ourselves into. Our advise ignore them, this was the best all inclusive we have done. The hotel is exceptionaly clean and well maintained, staff are always smiling and attentive and say hello whether its the gardener or a waiter. The food was wonderful and always hot. The mexican and oriental al a carte were excellent but italian not to same standard and what they offer you can get on the buffet anyway so we didnt see the point. The bar service in the lobby was a bit slow and normaly a wait, not enough waiters wondering around to see if you wanted a drink which we felt for a hotel of this standard could be better. The pool and beach area are lovely, yes if you postiton yourself the end of the pool where bar is and entertainment its noisy which you would expect. The beach also this side is a little rocky with a lot of seaweed. If you go the other side by massage area its fine loads of sunbeds as well. The one thing that does need sorting out are sunbeds as on shabby side and not enough parasols by pool. Rooms are excellent only complaint was bed being a bit hard but nothing else. We stayed over Christmas and New Year and the celebrations were amazing the hotel pulled all the stops out and all section managers mingled with guests and wanted to know if they were having a good time. We thought that this was a lovely touch. Our only complaint is the spa staff who during the day by the pool and beach are always hassling you offering a free massage to see if you like it. Dont as you will be hassled even more as someone we got chatting to made that mistake and treatments are not cheap and being noisey we had a look at spa and compared to rest of hotel it is very shabby and tired looking. If they sorted that out and prices made more reasonable they may get a few more takers as in our second week they were around in evening too so must be struggling is our opinion. Thomson rep Carlos was excellent there if you needed him and always helpful, didnt push you into buying trips either and advise at welcome meeting very good and brief only 20 minutes so not a morning of your holiday which has happened before.

No screaming, running around the pool causing havoc at 7a.m. when your choosing to lay in for a bit before breakfast. We travel at least 3 times a year and do love Mexico. This hotel staff is so dialed into the tourist industry. From the smooth check in with complimentary cocktail and a smile. The only road block came when we asked real nice for a ocean view or pool view and were told they were sold out which they were not sold out at the ocean views. It was much better to understand when a manager stepped in and apologized for the miss information that the rooms were pre booked upon booking from our end ocean front for extra money. Our room was with a garden view and that was fine. Your never in the room except to sleep. The bed was better then most hotels and the air conditioner was not that bad, had allot worse on our travels. However our room had a very musty smell when we stepped in. Which we were tired, only 2 hours sleep night before and let it slide. We got use to it I guess. When your room is assigned please take a good strong wif and change room if not happy. The smell came home with us and took 2 laundry tries to get smell out of all clothes, even the ones not used. Fabreeze for all the luggage and a good night to air out. Now onto a better note the food was fantastic for Buffet and again staff amazing all dialed in. Enjoy the several cool looking raccoons on the property. They will follow you and greet you at your room in the morning. Some people feed them so they are very trusting of you, not suppose to. The Al Carte was a little hard to get into around the grill Japanese. Tried 3 times to book the Grill spot for the 2 of us, always ended up at the tables. Taking pictures of the wonderful talented chef. The Italian Restaurant by far is the best and no limits of how many nights you can go. With salad bar, soup and pasta appetizer you don't need the entree and the dessert, it's way too much The Christmas Eve presentation of the grounds near the buffet was fabulous. 200 men and women put together Ice figures and also a full ice Santa Chair and Ginger Bread House. An Ice display that the wine was displayed on. Fantastic Horn player he did many walk around requests and came right over and played for you. Felt like you were the only 2 there. This is by far one of the best staff we have ever seen anywhere. They treat you like royalty from the gals offering you mini neck massages daily to entice you to use facility on property. Which is top notch. Again we travel allot and were told to go to Playa Del Carmen by cab not the hotel shuttle your only there in town for 1 and half hours to 2 max. We used one hour for 2 massages for $50, instead of hotel $150 for 2. Fantastic, clean well trained gals downtown to cater to you as a special guest. We would not go to Mayan Rivera this time of year too windy. We much prefer the other side of Mexico Puerto Vallarta. We also own 4 weeks of Time Share and still prefer this style of travel the best. We would however tell other people we know to give it a try. Clean Hotel, Excellent Management, Excellent Rep for Transat Holidays, take the 15 minute intro to the area and hotel next morning. No time share pitch just straight forward information. If you like night life and have ever been to Vegas this is as close as you will get to it at Coco Bongo. With show and music and Tributes artists to the stars. Worth the $40 a person leave at 10p.m. come back at 3:30a.m on bus from hotel, nap in the day time. Where ever you go, have fun. The Hotel is one of the largest properties in the area. Great tanning areas. Just don't make the mistake of laying on the white beds in the preferred area like we did not knowing.

We asked for a Mattress Topper and they brought us a pillow-top and that helped a great deal. They also had our room decorated for our honeymoon and gave us the Romantic Dinner which was amazing (2nd story beachfront gazebo and a multi-course dinner with all the trimmings).

We wanted a completely chilled out R & R holiday and thats exactly what we got. After reading some of the mixed reviews before we left we were a little bit unsure that the hotel was going to live up to what we read in the brochure, but we can without a doubt comfirm that we have no complaints at all. On our arrival after a very long 11 and half hour flight we were greeted by very friendly hotel staff who gave us a drink whilst checking in, we were then escorted to our room which was lovely just like the picture in the brochure. The hotel grounds are immaculate as we found the rest of the hotel, the staff work very hard in all areas and always have a friendly smile and greet you with \"hola\" when you see them. The hotel restaurants are all good especially the Japenese, we highly recommend sitting around the grill to eat the food it's amazing and the entertainment whilist its being cooked is great fun!!! The entertainment staff are very hard working, during the day there are crazy games by the pool, beach volleyball and a daily holdem poker game that you can join in with. If you dont want to get involved and just relax by the pools or on the beach theres no pressure you can just watch. I had great fun watching whilst my other half took part in a couple of the ball games by the pool and won a coco bongo cup! We would give a big thumbs up to all the entertainment staff especially Ricardo who was great fun and again we would like tho thank him for sorting out our night at Coco Bongo which was by far the best club we have ever been to, if you get chance please go you will not be dissapointed amazing night!!!! Alot of people were moaning about the beach but to be honest we went on it everyday and thought it was ok, the sea is not the best but thats because of tropical storms they had a few months ago and its upset the sea bed a little but hey thats nature not alot you can do about that, we walked along the beach both sides of the hotel and to be honest we found our hotel to have the best spot. If you do want to swim if you walk along the beach to the left about 15 minutes you will come to the fresh water lagoon which is lovely loads of fish to see if you want to snorkle. There is so much more we could probably say about Ocean Maya we had a fantastic time and would definately return, again a big thankyou to all the staff for making our stay a good one.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa Canada", "Title": "\u201cOcean Maya Super Relaxing Place- No kids\u201d", "Author": "Mark C", "ReviewID": "UR122337129", "Content": "Just got back from the Ocean Maya Royale (December 23-30 2011). We really enjoyed our week at this resort. If you want a nice relaxing holiday without kids screaming all day long then this is the place to book. I will review each area of the hotel. My wife and I travel 3 -4 times a year and have been to a lot of nice places all over the Caribbean, Canada, US, Europe etc.. so I think our opion should hold some weight for a review. I hate people that rate places badly because of one or two trivial things they had go wrong on their vacation. This resort is a real 4* but not a 5* RESORT : Very nice grounds, impeccably maintained by very friendly staff. This resort is low rise buildings, which I prefer over hi rise buildings. Every area of this hotel is very clean. People had mentioned a lot of mosquitos in other reviews and bed bugs but we did not find this to be true at least the week we were there. ROOMS :We were in a Privledge suite which was clean and very nice and also a good size. Beds are a lot more comfortable than most resorts in mexico and they also have a pillow selection that you can pick a nice pillow. The only issue was the air conditioner. The system stays on all of the time and even on low fan speed it is very noisy, although you do get used to the sound it has an effect of blocking out any noises outside. Sort of a white noise filter. Room staff were excellent and cleaning was prompt and thorough each day. POOL and BEACH : The pool area is very nice with lots of seats. The resort was pretty full over the Xmas week and it never seemed busy around the pool or beach area. The beach is nice but be aware that the beach is small where you can swim in the water. There is a boardwalk for most of the area that you can't access the water. We were also in the Privledge area that was blocked off just for these guests with personal service. This was really nice and the service was excellent. There was one young server who went out of her way to take care of all the guests and should be given employee of the month for sure. I forgot her name but she was expecting a baby in a few months. There are also lots of watersports you can do including Scuba Diving ($$) If you like pool games they do this everyday, but it was not crazy loud like a lot of resorts with a bunch of drunken people yelling and screaming. FOOD : Food was pretty good if you chose carefully. Lots of fresh meats and fish that they would grill for you in the buffett but as all buffets go, they get to be repetitous after a week. They also had a great Japanese restaurant, Italian was OK and the Mexican had a nice atmosphere and good kebobs down by the beach. Drinks were fine except for the wine. They only had wine from Mexico that was included but you could buy full bottles from different countries. I don't understand their thinking for the wine. If you had the Privledge option you could get premium drinks but not premium wine. Maybe management will pick up on this and include it. Premium wine by the glass should be included. SPA :My wife and I had several spa treatments, which I usually don't do but they have a great massage therapist (Diana) who was AMAZING. This added to the overall stress relieving week that we were at the resort. My wife had a facial that was so good I almost had to carry her out of the spa. If you negotiate you can get some pretty good couples packages so don't pay full price if you don't have to. OVERALL IMPRESSION: We had a nice relaxing week at the Royale and the staff are great. My only complaint is they advertise late checkout as part of the Privledge package but it was not available because our room was needed for an early checkin. It would probably not been a big deal for the manager to give these guests another room and our room for a later checkin. Sometimes little things can @#$# you off , but that would not turn me off for a return visit to this hotel. Don't worry about any of the lousy reviews. We have friends who complain about every place they have been too so that is just the way some people are. Book this place and enjoy a week of peace and quiet. PS : If you are a young couple looking for a party place you probably would be better off at one of the bigger places in the Mayan Riviera.

Definitely liked the layout of the villas, there are 30 odd spread out on the property with 8 rooms in each. A second floor room made a difference for me as I had a nice view from the balcony. The rooms are clean but of course have the smells that all resorts have in a high humidity area, air conditioned and on the beach. Easy to get used to, after the first day you don't notice it. Beds are harder which again I have found is the norm everywhere and the pillows are rocks. For sleepers like me they might consider a special store of softer pillows available on request. Food was good and plentiful, lots of variety. I did the 7 day bit because no matter where you are more than 7 days you can get bored with the menu. The buffet was probably the best with lots of fresh fruits and salads. Two pools and a swim up bar abut the beach area. The pools were clean and the water well mauntained. I did find the loud speakers for getting people up for games and other entertainment was a little bothersome. I was doing a good impression of a slug on a lounger but others wanted to a little more so why complain. Just tuned it out. Definitely a lack of beach area and not enough loungers. The beach was washed away recently and they have had to rebuild a small section. For anyone who wants to plunge into the ocean, this isnt the place. The beach is brutal with many hidden obstacles underwater like rocks and mangrove stumps. A one click walk up the beach was about the only place to go swimming in the ocean. The grounds are lovely and well maintained. Lots of wildlife and the coatis (raccoon looking) were so funny at night, especially when one squared off against the local cat. Good stand off there. This resort is definitely for couples only. Would not recommend it for a solo traveller looking to have a party type vacation. I did ok because I wanted R&R and got lots as it is quiet after 10 bells. The staff work very hard to make sure you enjoy yourself. Yes it is advisable to throw a few good tips out there early to insure that you are attended to but who can blame these folks. They are not paid all that well and do rely on tips to get by. A special mention to Francisco who worked in the Mexican restaurant. He is so personable and fun at all times. Also Sashkia (aka Training), lovely lady with a wonderful disposition, Yvonne ( thanks for the loan of the cell phone) and Loudres who took good care of my room. Miguel and Manuel also in the Mex restaurant ( killer banana margaritas). Honourable mention goes to Daniel the night security guard, what a character! One area that the resort could work on is transportation. Since you are 7 km north of Playa a cab ride is $20 one way so it gets expensive. They should consider two daily shuttle bus runs into Playa.

We especially enjoyed -- the beautiful, quiet setting. The resorts sits about 2/3 of a mile in from the main highway right on the beach. The grounds are beautiful, if somewhat simply landscaped. The room we had was good sized and updated with a modern style. The resort does a decent job on energy/water conservation. The resort has two nice pools -- one essentially a giant wading pool from when the resort allowed kids, the other deeper with jetted loungers. We also enjoyed the local wildlife -- Coati, racoon, iguana, and a variety of birds are common. We liked the fact that you didn't need reservations at the restaurants (although one busy night found it difficult to get into the Italian restaurant and that those with premium or \"privelege\" status could evidently make reservations). Finally, the resort has a really nice exercise room and spa. The sauna and hot and cold jetted soaking tubs in the spa are included in the room fee on a reservation basis and were very nice. The staff without exception are friendly and helpful! Things that were good but could have been better? The food is good but... Unlike other all inclusives we have been to the restaurant menu is same every day and the choices somewhat limited. That said we enjoyed both the Japanese and Itailian restaurants. The main buffet up by the lobby has a good selection, but much of the food in the warming trays was barely warm. They do have a grill though with cook to order that serves up your choices hot and fresh. The restaurant poolside is smaller with less selection but the food seemed to be more fresh and hot. They also cook to order. Overall the quality of the fruit was just fair to good in comparison to other resorts we have been to in the area. As mentioned the room was nice, but the beds characteristically (for Mexico) were rock hard. We take a foam pad for the bed and vacuum seal it to compress it so it fits in our luggage -- it really helps. They have a \"pillow menu\" but only for \"privilege\" guests. The bathroom is nice, but the shower is small. Also, our room was very nice, but we talked to several other people who complained about their rooms -- that they smelled musty, like mold or like the sewer -- so if you get a room like that don't hesitate to ask to be moved. The hotel provides a free shuttle to Playa del Carmen, but has very limited space. If you want to take advantage of that service you need to make a reservation with the tour director the day before, and be at his desk when he arrives just before 8 am. Make arrangements for transfers to/from the airport/hotel before you arrive. If you just rely on taxi's you will find it very expensive (i.e., a taxi from the hotel to the airport is $100 -- made through a private tour company reduced our cost to $40 for non-stop ride for my wife and I). The beach is...non-existant. That's only a slight exaggeration. If you are looking for a traditional beach to swim from you'll have to wander next door to the next resort over. Ocean Maya only has a small beach from which they launch water activities. That area is also where the topless sunbathing seems to be concentrated (this is to the right of the two pools)...the adjoining beach is to the left of the two pools. The pool and nightly entertainment is OK -- the staff work hard to make it fun. The evening entertainment doesn't start until 9:30 pm which is a little later than some places. The only other annoyance we experienced was the continual hawking of massage services. I think we had more people approach us asking if we wanted a massage as we had asking if we needed another drink.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cDidn't live up to expectations !\u201d", "Author": "natalie b", "ReviewID": "UR122189069", "Content": "We had a very diferent experience to some of the people who have Reviewed recently.

The negatives sadly outway the possitives for our holiday experience the only possitive for us were that there were no children, the main reason for choosing this hotel and in a nutshell the negatives were, too much pestering on the site by the massage team, be it beach, lounge, terrace, lobby areas.

Ricardo is the \"rock star\" entertainer who makes all the shows fun and humorous and keeps everybody on their feet. Jess kept everybody in shape for the water aerobics and fitness classes.

We have stayed at many other all-inclusive hotels in the Riviera Maya part of Mexico but this was our first time at an H10. First I will list the things we liked about this hotel. The food was very good. There were four restaurants to choose from in the evening and we liked the food at all of them. Everything was located within comfortable walking distance from the rooms. The staff were all very friendly, polite, and helpful. The daytime entertainment around the pool was good. We met a lot of great people from all around the world. If not for these fellow vacationers we would have been pretty bored. We actually had a great time, but only because of the people we met and made friends with from all around the world. Now I will list the things we did not like. The rooms had bed bugs. We noticed as soon as we got there that some people had some real noticeable red puffy sore looking insect bites on their arm and legs. We asked a couple of the people what they were from and they didn\u2019t know. They said they didn\u2019t see any bugs but got bit sometime while staying at this hotel. One lady we spoke with was covered with bites. She had to have had at least 100 bites all over her body. She told us that she actually went to see a doctor while there and he put her on some antibiotics. We also saw some of the workers that laundry the bed sheets and they were covered in bites. Needless to say, we didn\u2019t sleep very well. My wife ended up with about 15 bites and I only got bit twice. They are very nasty bites and seem to be taking a long time to heal. Hopefully they will not leave scars. The hotel management does not seem to be concerned about this problem, probably because they either don't know how, or do not want to fix it. Watch out for Dean. He will be one of the first people you meet upon check-in. He has a desk in the front lobby and his job seems to be to try to trick people into attending a time-share presentation for H10. As soon as we checked in and we not even to our room yet he greeted us and said he would like to have one of his staff give us a tour around the property so that we would know where everything was during our stay. We thought this sounded like a good idea so we agreed. He introduced us to Christine. She started asking us questions about our kids, previous vacations, income, and ect. I was suspicious so I asked if this was a time-share presentation which she admitted to. We said we were only interested in a tour of the facilities, not a presentation. Her answer was \u201cok then\u201d and she walked away and never did show us around. Kind of comical really. The tour was not needed anyway because the place is not very big and it is easy to find everything on your own. There are only two actual bars on the property. One by the pool, which always seemed to close at about 6:00 pm. We thought it closed way too early. Then the only other bar was the one in the hotel lobby. It was open until 1:00 am, which was better, but still a lot of people would have liked to stay longer. The Mexican restaurant had a little side bar but very limited drinks we available there and they closed early, so we didn\u2019t use it much. The nightly shows were very poor. These were the worst shows we have seen in our traveling experience. There just didn\u2019t seem to be much talent there\u2026sorry. In conclusion, if the hotel would admit to, and fix the bed bug problem we would stay there again. That was the biggest problem with our stay.

Make the effort to get to know them, they will transform your holiday if you are at all outgoing. Five stars for them. The hotel itself is very nice, very American in style which suited us. Everything is well laid out and no one we spoke to complained of being out on a limb. We stayed in Room 806 which wasn't perfect but still very comfortable and quiet being an upstairs room. It wasn't perfect because the tap was wobbly and like others have said the shower door didn't close properly but there was no major leaks for us, just a small (1/10 of a cup) amount of water made its way out on to the floor and was immediately soaked up using the floor towel. The room was clean comfortable and everything worked so no complaints. Next to the entertainment staff the food was the BEST thing about this hotel. I read so many complaints on here about cold or luke warm food that I had concerns BUT.... The style is mainly high quality buffet. There is a large and varied choice in the main restaurant at every meal time, food is mainly kept in hot trays warmed from underneath so take the food from the bottom of the trays and it is HOT (with the exception of the chips). You have to pounce on a freshly fried batch of chips to get really hot ones which is 11am at the pool restaurant and 12:30 at the main restaurant. Also at the main restaurant there are two huge cooking plates and four woks manned by staff ready to cook for you there and then. What is on offer on the cooking plates/woks changes daily but every three days or so it cycled around steaks, tuna, chicken, large prawns, pork chops, burgers, omelettes, pasta etc. Take any of these freshly cooked options and it is hot hot hot. So apart from the lack of a continuous supply of hot chips we have no complaints. We did however avoid having lunch at the pool restaurant because the selection available is much smaller and due to the air flow in the restaurant the food was not as hot. The drinks were good but not great in my opinion, because the mixers used are mainly from the gun, so orange/cranberry juice is a Schweppes type juice, not carton (except for mango) or freshly squeezed. Mikes coffee shop was great, like having your own inclusive Starbucks; the Mocha Frappe is to die for! I have run out of time to say more, other than this was one of our top holidays (after the Maldives, Phi Phi Island and South Africa).

We like ...clean, secure, a smaller property, with a good beach and preferably adults only without spending a pile of money. We do not need over the top pampering. We stayed at the Ocean Maya Royale Adults only property for 8 nights in Early December. We read all the reviews prior to going and felt pretty well informed on what to expect. We booked thru orbitz and our shuttle was Gray line. No issues with either company and would recommend them. When we arrived the front desk area was prompt and shuttled us over to the guest services desk where a beaming and friendly Susanna checked us in. She then escorted us to our room and explained along the way where everything was. Due to the package we purchased with Orbitz we were given an upgraded room upon availablity. WE got it! Very nice Suite with beautiful white leather furniture, king size bed, Sparkling wine in the fridge and a nice touch of sweets on a platter. The patio has a nice patio set and a Jacuzzi tub for two. We did not have an ocean view we were however a whopping 100 steps from the pool and beach! How can you beat that! Ahh..great way to start out our vacation. We loved the Italian Restarant best! Very good food. Friendly waiters and a very pleasant Maitre de. The Japanese was fun. We were able to get a show table and Nick did a great job including all of us in the \"show\" we had us from the U.S. a couple from Sweden and another couple from Argentina? and he did a great job of melding us all together. Fun! The buffets, plenty to eat here nothing to go Amazing about but good, and plentiful. The breakfast omletes were my fave. Hot and fresh and the gal was always smiling. The Mexican was very good I just wished they offered either at this restaurant or on the buffet more \"mexican choices\" more Tostada's , and sopa's etc...we had an amazing candlelit dinner on the beach under a full moon. Yummy shrimp and steak. Inquire at guest services about setting this up. Wonderful! Our waiter was exclusive to us and did a wonderful, wonderful job! I highly recommend this. We loved our room it was spacious. The bed comfy. A full dresser for storage along with a few drawers in the closet. Inquire at the front desk for a lock and key for the safe.

Everyone seemed to be on their laptop or cell phones etc. There is an internet cafe albeit a bit pricey in my opinion and that is when you could find them open. Luis is a wonderful on site photographer. He does an amazing job. We didn't have pix taken but I admired his work and wished I had time to do a session. Take a short walk down the beach to Tres Rio's. (Three Rivers) what an amazing natural area! It's worth the walk. The beach. Ahhh, as we are beach people and really don't care about the pool this is important to us. Unfortunetly for this resort Hurricane Wilma took back about 30' of beautiful beach. Due to erosion they had to build a concrete wall. They did a great job with what they had to work with. The only thing is you are sitting \"above\" the ocean and looking down from the beach. This is not your typical \"beach sand then ocean view\" it is however still pretty. There is an area near the pool that has alot of trees along with a board walk and easy access to the pool and then an area on each side that is closer with water entry. It's an odd situation but again, it's what they had to work with due to storms and I think they did a great job and we hung out on the beach the entire time. The beach and pools are very close together, a quick walk to the clean bathrooms and the bar area. There was a gal that would scoot across the beach and take a drink order at various times but it most times was quicker to just get up and get your own. Javier, javier, javier! the best bartender! He did a great job at the pool. He could mix up drinks and send you on your way in no time and always with a smile. He was our favorite of the whole trip. There were a few bartenders in the Main Lobby at night that we could not get to smile for anything! geesh! The waitresses in the lobby did a great job and were always zooming back and forth from the lobby to the bar. Speaking of the lobby it is very pretty and at night it is where pretty much everyone just hangs out, plays cards, has drinks, there is a sax player that I thought was very good and loved the ambiance that he added. We liked stopping by the guest services desk at night and chatting it up with Sussana and Judy at and learning of the area and things about the resort. They are great gals and an assest to the guest services area. I witnessed several guests storming up to the desk being demanding and rude and they painted on a smile and took care of them with great patience. We also got to meet Maria the Assistant Manager. Very lovely lady and a pleasure to get to meet her. We loved our stay at the OMR. Our room was way near the beach and the pools and we liked that as that is our favorite place to be and also because we liked a little walk to breakfast and in the evening to walk off our indulgences . haha. The area of improvement I could see is: Better loungers on the beach. They were the old fashioned white resin ones with super, super, saggy blue backing. Ouch. I do see where they are slowly implementing new ones here and there but if they are catering to adults they need to speed that up just a bit. Also, I would suggest more of the little \"tables\" in the beach area. I saw only maybe three total on the beach. One other improvment was the few certain bartenders that just were not \"friendly\" ...hey if you are in customer service you should at least deliver a \"hello, how may I help you\" and a smidge of a smile. There were a few that were scowly. And it had nothing to do with tipping because trust me ..we are generous tippers where deserved. And lastly my other suggestion would be more music choices near the pool. We hung out on the beach and I can tell you each play list each and everyday. Kiss I was made for loving you and Michael Jackson Thriller 8 days in a row , many times a day. Mix it up. We love all kinds of music just not the same 30 songs over and over. Maids, and lawnworkers etc..there was not one that you would pass and they wouldn't offer a \"hola' they did a a great job and their pride shows. OUr room was always clean and well stocked. The beer was fresh and cold. The alcohol was very good and good choices. They have a \"privlege shelf\" with even more \"top shelf\" but we found plenty of very good brands on our level. Yes, they had some bottom brand but just ask specifially for say, Barcardi or Captain Morgan's. etc... We didn't take the shuttle to PDC as it was offered from 10 a.m. till 2:00 and for me..that is prime time for the beach. I kinda wish they would offer it from say 3:00-7:00 or something of that nature. But we just took a cab. $20.00 each way. Split it with another couple if you can and it's not so bad. Or take a walk out to the highway and catch a collectivo. We did not do that as it was dark out and lots of traffic and road construction going on we didn't need to get hit just to save $20.00. The ugly...not sure if they were American or Canadians (we are from the US) but where ever they were from I was embarrased for them. There was a group of about 8 ladies that pulled 8 beach chairs together on the beach, tossed their stuff on them an hogged them but never once returned to the chairs to use them. Others were walking up and down the beach hoping for a chair to sit on and they and many others play the stupid towel game. Anyway, this group of ladies were beyond loud, beyond obnoxious the more they drank. Screaming at the top of their lungs about their sex toys, screaming to the bartenders get them this or that, dropping f-bombs like they were the only ones there. Sad. Hey I like to have as much fun as the next guy but not when you act like you are the only ones who paid for their vacation. Oh well, we moved further from the pool beach area so we didn't have to listen to them \"as much\". This is of no fault of the hotel just a reminder that others are there to enjoy themselves too. I know I have been all over the board with what I am remembering while I am typing but I am trying to remember the things that were important to me in planning my trip. I hope that the info has proved helpful feel free to send me a pm if you have more questions and we will try to help. We would return if the price was right.

The water sports included hobie cat sail boats and kayaks. We enjoyed para sailing as well. The entertainment group keeps you going. Water volleyball, morning walking tour, poker by the pool, pilates, salsa, sushi making lesson, bingo etc. Very impressed with the towel lady who would come by and ask if you would like a dry towel throughout the day. We also couldn't believe the service. The girl around the pool continually asking if we needed a drink. Just remember to tip as these people work very hard, in the heat. Music playing throughout, saxophones was a nice touch. The only negative was not enough sunbeds and the condition of the ones they did have. Also, people would put their towels to reverse these seats and not even be around to use them. Shame on them as there were signs stating not to do this. The resort did not want to remove the towels as they did not want to make anyone unhappy but would try to find you seats. Overall not a five start but well worth what we paid for.

I'll start by saying myself and boyfriend booked this holiday through Thomson Holidays.It was a good price,but mainly because it was a newly refurbished hotel and converted to adults only. I myself have been to Mexico twice before but to the Iberostar chain and had no problems,so trying a H10 hotel was a new experience and also another part of Mexico. So i will give my review as honest as i can be.Must warn you I have a feeling it may be a long review it was that good :-) but you will appreciate it as it gives you a lot of good facts. Arrival-Monday 21st November: After a 10hr and 40mins flight from Manchester Airport we arrived into Cancun airport with the Thomson rep there to greet us with a few staff to take our cases to the coach-must i say make sure you have some $1 notes as these come in handy at the airport and places around Mexico to tip the locals. The minute the cases was on the coach we was asked by the guy for a tip. I didn't mind as I expected this before from previous experience travelling here,so you can't really refuse them, but they accept in any currency. A $1 bill is plenty to give them. The coach transfer to this hotel is approximately 45 mins and we was the first drop off which makes a change as we are always last everywhere else. I suffer really bad travel sickness and this coach transfer was the best I've been on with fully air-conditioned coach so I was fine. As soon as you set of the rep starts to talk and try and sell you drinks on the coach-its not worth it as what you are charged is really expensive and its worth waiting for your all inclusive to start. It was $5 for a bottle of Corona(we don't really drink)but the cans of coke was still $3 so it isn't worth it. The rest of the coach transfer the rep goes through the different hotels and excursions thats you pass on your way. Arrival at the Ocean Maya Royale Hotel.: First impressions when you arrive at the Ocean Maya Royale, are really fantastic. The outside landscaping of the hotel is really tidy,and very clean. The gardens are well maintained and you can see this throughout the hotel. The lobby is beautiful too,again very clean and tidy. We was greeted with a drink on arrival but it was very watery so didn't bother with it. Check in was so quick and easy here,your Passport details taken and your room key/safe key and towel keys are given to you. You must treasure your safe key a it is $50 to replace. The staff are all very friendly and didn't have a problem with any member of staff,and what is good they all speak a number of languages and surprisingly the English is fantastic. Rooms: When we arrived we got given a room in block 27. When we got to it, it turned out to be at the back of the block and on the bottom floor with the view being bushes/trees. I had requested at the time of booking, a balcony room so I was not happy with this and my boyfriend said he could not stay in that room due to the bushes and trees as he knew it would be bitten even worse than what he gets bitten.(which is a lot)Impressions of this room was not so good anyway,so I went back to reception and explained we do not want a bottom floor room and straight away they gave us a room in block 32 with a balcony. This was a much bigger and better room from the first room and we was happy with the view on this one. The beds are hard but I found these to be comfy but my boyfriend never likes the beds abroad anyway. The first night was the worse night ever because of the air-conditioning. It didn't work,and it kept getting warm. I wasn't too bothered during the nights but my partner is so he wasn't happy. Then the worse came the next morning when he went to take a shower. As nice as the bathroom looked, i spent the whole time mopping up the floor as the shower flooded most of the room. Straight away onto reception-they sent someone up within an hour but I said I'm not staying in this room any longer as it had to be mopped when we first arrived to it as well and there was too many problems with this room. Last but least we got given room 606. I have to say this was the best room ever-the size of the room was fantastic,the bathroom was perfect and the view was still nice. Everything worked too which was the main thing and it took about an hour for the air-conditioning to get sorted but when it was it worked like magic. We only had one problem over the 2 weeks we stayed there and that was some ice had formed so it was leaking but someone came to fix this within 15 mins. The position of this room was excellent too as it was near the lobby and eating areas and also ideally located near pool/beach. We was happy with this room. The bed was much more comfy than the other one. Word of warning-when the maids come to clean your room they leave your door open and this is a major issue as loads of mosquitoes get in to the room and although you cannot see them or think they are there they are worse when you are sleeping as they bite you more at night. The doors are left open for about 15 mins when they clean your room and this can be anytime from 9am-6pm they can clean your room so beware of this. Also the mini fridge is great if it worked.ours didn't work,but we wasn't too bothered as we both waited till the morning for drinks. We just used the water even if it wasn't cold but you get 3 cans of fizzy beverages,2 bottles of water and 2 cans of beer. Ideally more water would be beneficial and somewhere near by to get some ice if required. Oh and the television in the room is a Samsung LCD flat screen TV-this is not very load at all,as my partner is hard of hearing he really struggled with this even with assistance. Beach/Pool Area The first few days we went to the beach as this is the area I love when going on holiday. My impressions was mixed because to me the beach is like a triangle with three different angles to it. You have the far left hand side,where you can play beach volleyball and can get into the sea,this part of the beach was ok but was full of seaweed and the ocean was very dirty. Then the middle section of the beach is actually on a man made boardwalk-which was different,but still very nice. This section was fab and the sand was white sands. This is where we sat for the first few days.but then you have the far right hand side of the beach where all the water sports are done and this is the side shown on Thomson website,and believe me it is nothing like the brochures. Ive seen this for myself and I was very disappointed. It was very very dirty and littered with potentially feet cutting rocks and debris. Also in the middle of the beach is the privilege area. Well this to us was just a chance for them to make some money. They shared the same beach with us except it was roped off and raked every morning-the sand being raked. On the main beach it was done every other morning but there is nothing special as the sand is sand. What was an issue with this area is that by 9-930am you would find no sun beds available whether you are at the beach or pool(which are footsteps away from each other)and in the Privilege area you would find 3/4 of the area empty and you are not allowed to use them and you are expected to lie on the beach. The difference was that they got cushions on a sun lounger and a pillow too,and they are meant to get there very own butler but all we saw was one lady(who was pregnant too)dealing with everyone in this area. This is not how it s advertised. Thankfully we didn't pay the extra as we didn't feel it was value for money for the special beds/butler service or premium alcoholic drinks. As I mentioned above we are not really drinkers. We didn't have a problem with with sun beds as i got up at 630am every morning anyway and reserved them. There are signs to say not to reserve them but everyone ignores these. But I heard that if enough people complain they bring some in a van. After these few days on the beach we decided to sit around the pool. The pools are fantastic,cleaned every morning. There only 2 pools,one smallish pool and one considerably bigger but with a shallow section. The smaller pool was used for the activities that was done by the entertainment team along with a Jacuzzi section and Jacuzzi Mosaic beds in the pool too. They feel extremely weird as the pools are freezing and take a bit of getting used too. The pool bar is located in the smaller pool,again very nice bar staff and always happy to help. Entertainment Staff Well where do I begin here?? It was the best entertainment staff I have ever met.They are all so friendly and just didn't want to leave them behind. They start around the pool between 10-1030am with activities such as water volleyball,yoga,water aerobics...then as you get toward lunchtime it goes into the crazy game which was my favourite so funny,beach volleyball and dance lessons and then in the afternoon you have Texas Holde'm Poker :-) this was the one thing I played every day and night if it was on.It was a different member of staff that played it every day but my favourite was playing with Am\u00c5nda and Ricardo :-).The Staff would come round and get you involved with the activities and if you didn't want to you just say no and they would leave you to it although myself I get involved in a lot of activities so no really wasn't an answer for me to them lol :-) they self voted me into some things and I wasn't aware until like 15 minutes before but I didn't mind. The Entertainment didn't stop there as it went into the night too.It would restart in the lobby about 630pm with the Saxophone player and then by about 8pm the entertainment staff would be back out getting ready for the nights show. The shows was great especially the ones with the staff in,but some nights they would get other groups or staff to put on shows. All of them are brill dancers and singers and are great at what they do.(Jess please don't put your white contacts in again doing your acrobats-it was freaky :-S)Then after the shows there was dancing in the lobby,again I would dance as i love to do this.My favourite was dancing with Ricardo :-) as he used to do this little side to side dance lol :-) it was cute. But his dancing was the best and his enthusiasm too. Then after that you had a choice to go into Coco Bonga-this is $65pp and I don't drink so it wasn't worth it to me. I had just as much fun at the hotel with the staff anyway. Some nights they had Karaoke too. I got up-well kind of forced to get up by Ricardo and Am\u00c5nda but I did it a few times and so did they but in Spanish :-( would prefer to hear you all in English guys!! There is nothing more I can say about these guys except I had a fantastic time with you all and you will be missed very much but I'm sure we will all keep in touch. :-) Make sure you do! Restaurants/Food To begin there is 5 restaurants if you want to include Mikes Coffee bar :-) First one is the Main buffet-La Hacienda-Located near the lobby. This gives a variety of food but a bit you have to do a bit mix and match on your plates. The problem is with myself I only eat Beef on holiday,my partner will eat everything. The beef is really nice but I could never find something nice to go with it like potatoes/chips when I wanted it at night. It would be there at lunchtime but never in the evening. There is fish(which isn't a fish that has been tasted in England before)there is chicken,seafood,pork,pasta and soup. Like i said a variety but the tastes and the way it is cooked is very different. My partner said a lot of the foods was nice in this restaurant just need more choice. Second Buffet restaurant was El Charro-this is located around the pool area.This was used for lunchtime buffet,we used this a couple of times but found the food quality in here isn't as good as the La Hacienda at lunchtime. There is only a few things on offer here like hamburgers and chilli. Beware that the burgers are not advertised as hamburgers or beef burgers. Like i mentioned earlier i only eat beef and i ordered one of these and i knew it wasn't beef but couldn't put my finger on what it was. Its ok for a quick snack or the ice-creams as they are to die for :-) yummy. Next restaurant is the La Dolce Vita(Italian)this was originally located on the beach but due to a hurricane had to be moved to the lobby area. Apparently the one near the beach is due to open in 20 days. La Dolce Vita is a A La Carte, and when open is sectioned of from the La Hacienda. We tried this restaurant twice as it was nice. Only problem is that from the menu you choose 2 main courses(pasta/meat dish) then dessert and they are main course portions that you would find in England so we was always full and had to skip dessert each time although they did sound nice.Highly recommended this restaurant. Next A La Carte is the El Charro (Mexican). Now we didn't try this restaurant and I wish I did but my partner said he didn't fancy the food in there but some friends we met in resort said that the food is fantastic.Sometimes spicy but really nice. Last but not least is the Yookoso (Japanese) i don't like japanese but I decided to give it a go for the sake of my boyfriend.The setting is really nice inside and the decor too. This again you don't choose much from the menu is very much set for you apart from you choose your meat for the main course. Sushi/skewers/soup/main/dessert is how it works. Of what I tried I enjoyed and my favourite was the main course which was Beef Teriyaki. Mikes coffee bar is fab if you fancy a snack and coffee in the late afternoon.The mocha is the best mocha I have ever had-highly recommended. I think I have just about covered everything here,but just a tip-take Mexican pesos,as we took Dollars as that was what I had taken in the past and obviously all change is given back in pesos and we found out that twice we was short changed. We also did 2 excursions while out there and booked them through a company based there.The excursions was COBA and XEL-HA. They was fantastic. $119pp but for each tour you got all your transport/food/drinks/excursion included. Very good value for money. Coba you visit a tranquil cave with chemical free waters-it is magical. Then you go to the local town and do the zip-wiring/abseiling and walking.Then you do lunch and then Coba itself which is very cultural but still very interesting. Xel-ha is a watermark where you can snorkel,swim with dolphins if you wish,cliff jumping,lazy dingy river,zip-wiring and lazy on the chairs/hammocks. We loved Xel-ha but it is a long day as it leaves at 735am and doesn't get back to the hotel until 715pm as it only leave the park at 6pm. We did the park by 4pm so really there should be no reason why the coaches couldn't leave at 5pm which would be better for most people. I think I should of given enough information here for you to want to go to this hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone as we enjoyed the whole holiday. A big thank you to Ricardo,Am\u00c5nda,Fernie,Jes,Omar,Amy-Jean and Miguel for a fantastic holiday and for giving me plenty of memories that will not be forgotten. Also to all the staff in the restaurants and reception and the other parts of the hotel. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

First impressions where good we received a drink on arrival and the staff are very polite and appeared accommodating. As it was our honeymoon we thought we might upgrade but the hotel wanted an extra $100 a night and we simply did not think it was worth that for a bath in the room. The reception staff also explained that we would get privileged treatment if we pay the $100 a night extra, we enquired as to what this was and they explained it meant we would get name brand drinks and separate areas to eat and sunbathe. Still we though this an unnecessary luxury at an inflated price as we had paid \u00a32500 for the holiday in the first place. Pro's Some of the staff where friendly and genuinely wanted to help. The waitresses around the pool and at the reception bar where great. The Bar staff where good also and where tipped accordingly. The grounds where well kept The wildlife around the hotel, iguanas, coatimundi, praying mantis and raccoons to name a few. Staff in the ''al a carte restaurants where great. Tapanyaki restaurant food and chef ( This guy was fun really entertaining) Good water sports centre ( Sergio was a great help cheers Amigo!) Nice white sand so your feet don't burn The burgers! Now I never thought I would say that being a foodie person but see below. Con's Most of the main Buffet staff apart from the lady fresh meat chef and a couple of the waiters. Example: one morning myself and my wife were getting picked up for an excursion and the buffet is meant to open at 7am so we went in at 7am and explained that we needed to eat before we left due to us going on an excursion the petite lady who we fist spoke to said no five minute even though we had explained our situation. Then the manager I believe his name is Ulysses more or less shooed us out of the restaurant. So we did not get to have breakfast before a two and a half hour journey with no guaranteed food source on arrival. 365 rooms and about 150 sun loungers!!!!! You had to be up at 6am to get a spot although there are signs all over telling people not to reserve loungers they still do!! This is so frustrating and I'm sure we all know who the culprits are... Outside of the rooms there was a dead Praying mantis and cockroach for 5 days! Rank! This is not a chill out hotel. We chose Riviera Maya as we wanted a more chilled out holiday otherwise we would have chosen Cancun. The entertainment staff are forever on your back, the same 3 CD's are on all day I could tell you the order of every song and what time there on! Being showed to a table you don't want to sit at when there's next to nobody in the restaurants and being looked at like dirt when you ask if you can go to a more favourable spot. Luke warm food. We did not get to try any traditional Mexican food in the hotel! Why??? Doctor charged us \u00a3286.66 for a diarea cure (I hope our insurance will cover this!) Quit allot of loud mouth obnoxious people around the pool bar all day long trying to out do each other on who's having the best time. Flat disgusting beer ( Although the cocktails where ok) Thomson excursions are twice the price of external operators go to Playa Del Carmen and see Sergio down near the ferry port he's trustworthy and very helpful. The entertainment shows where funny and not because they where good Saxophone music everywhere!!! Why! Why! Why! It did our heads in and the reception plays elevator music all day I don't know why they would think anyone under 90 would like it?! Very small resort Massages $99 each!! Every time we left the hotel we had a great time, but a bit of advice for you if your thinking of going to Coco Bongo (Playa Del Carmen)...it should hold around 2500 people they cram in around 5000 and at $65 each plus the bar staff want tipping all the time it's rather expensive. The show was good and the music banging but it was like being in a tin of sardines. If you want an 18to30 type holiday experience crossed with a retirement home at night then this is the place for you. Mexico we love you! Ocean Maya Royale we hope we will never see you again.

The Staff was very friendly, attentive and spoke excellent English. The landscaping was beautiful and it seemed like every day the staff was manicuring a different part of the grounds. We had a great room that was in one of the two-story, 8-room outbuildings near the water. Ours was between the watersports area and the pool and afforded us a great view of the Carribean and the huge pool. Others in our group had rooms in the hotel type rooms and it seems as though those are older and not quite as nice. I would recommend only staying in the outbuildings (sorry, not sure what they are called). There are four restaurants on premises. Asian themed, Italian themed, mexican themed and a multi-ethnicity buffet. In the off season, one of the themed restaurants was closed each day. The food ranged from quite good to excellent, with the asian themed being the favorite within our large group. (BTW, if you are travelling off season, it is still in the Tropics and you still need to wear sunscreen, no matter the month!) There are a few shows, etc on premises and while the production values are not great, the same staff that runs the poker games, spanish lessons, scavenger hunts, swimming lessons, dance lessons, etc, during the day, also participate in the shows at nightly. On a decent length stay, you come to know the friendly entertainment staff and it is nice to see (and support) them in their shows. (Expect a lot of lip-syncing, but still see a show at least once.) A trip into Playa del Carmen is an easy and inexpensive bus trip away, coordinated by the concierge and well worth it. The hotel also brings outside vendors into their central plaza area a few evenings and they do have a lot of the same things you will find in town, for suprisingly similar prices. And just like every other vendor in Mexico, you can negotiate/haggle. If you are prepared to walk away, you will get your best price. The standard alcohol available is of lower, but still drinkable quality (The house tequila is actually a low-proof \"licor con tequila\"). I didn't ever get a bad drink, but I don't remember many stiff drinks. To be honest, with the heat and activity, I didn't mind being able to drink 20 drinks during the day with no ill-affect. They do offer an upgraded liquor package, which will afford you access to the normal top-shelf items. That's a personal call.

Very small vanity area Poorly laid out bathroom, no privacy in the toilet area since there is a fogged/glass door with about 3 inches of open space top and bottom.

Customer Service: Pros:Very very very nice people, English language is widely spoken Cons: This is where the real problem came in. Despite the hotel being super nice we had a slight fiasco with out membership bracelet. Each guest will get a bracelet at check in. When we checked in we received a bright neon green bracelet and was told since we were Privilege H10 members we would get exclusive accesses to the beach, special rooms, and allowed to make reservations . On the third day of our vacation, after spending 2 of the first days on the private beach section, we were told we had to leave because our membership/bracelets were not the correct one. Mind you I had asked the front desk twice about our bracelets and the difference between the other guest. So after gathering all of our things and taking the lengthy hot walk back to the main hotel we had to discuss it with the front office. The entire ordeal was very embarrassing and very inconveniencing. Also even though they advertise change service, a needed service in a foreign country, the two days I asked they didn't have any change available. Atmosphere: pros: adults only, very calm an relaxing environment, and lots of old and out of shape people running around topless and in speedos making me feel great about myself in my more conservative swim suite. Shops: There are only 4 very over priced shops. Beach: Very clean, lots of beach loungers and umbrellas, a nice bar with music and all kinds of drinks. Overall cleanliness: The hotel staff was always cleaning. The hotel was very clean and nice. Hotel activities: Cons: Expensive, a very rude 3rd party activity vendor, cash only which is a nusiance, and most are off site. Pros: The hotel did have a couple of activities: Jet skiing (which was awesome), para-sailing, and windsurfing Food Quality: It was a average. Two buffets and three restaurants. The food is NEVER hot as it should be Or as fresh, on ALL days and at ALL times of the day. For example I even waited for some fresh hash browns and they tasted cold and old. How does that happen if they just supposedly made them?! Variety: Plenty of variety way more than I could have imagined.

We were not disappointed. Although the hotel bills itself as 5 star, it is definitely more 4 star as rated by the travel agent. The grounds are beautiful, lush green grass, trees and flowers every and are kept immaculate. The wildlife that roam around the grounds are so cute, coatis (so curious of humans and almost tame), raccoons, agoutis and iguanas, loads of them! The rooms are modern, spacious and the housekeeping staff are excellent, cleaning the room, changing the towels and re-filling the minibar every day. One day we returned to the room around 5pm and the bed was unmade. Assuming there was no maid service that day we made the bed ourselves, however, the maid showed, stripped our poor handywork and re-made the bed properly. The food is ok but we found, as with any all inclusive dining, it becomes a bit samey, samey towards the end of the week. We went into Playa Del Carmen to eat one night and for 2 trips out during the day, just for a change of scenery. 5th Avenue is a good mix of bars, restaurants and gift shops selling the usual holiday souvenirs. It was nice strolling down there with all the vendors trying to entice you into their shops, all promising something different (although it isn't). Taxi costs about \u00a310 each way. Getting a sunbed around the pool is difficult unless you get up at the crack of dawn and reserve one with your towel. Although there are signs around the pool asking for this not be done, everyone does it to guarantee a bed. The beds are shabby, and really do need replacing. Come on H10, this is a good hotel, good sunbeds are required! The staff (despite some other reviews on this site) were always friendly, pollite and curteous and willing to provide you with whatever you needed.

Our travel was booked through JetBlue.com directly and we scored direct flights from Boston each way even though we booked one week ahead of our trip. Let me start by saying, I have been traveling to PDC for 16 years and have only stayed at the same resort twice (Sandos Playacar). I arranged our own transportation to/from Cancun thru entertainment-plus.net as I always do and still highly recommend them. R/T transportation from Cancun airport is $80 for 2. They take you directly to/from your resort with no other stops or traveler's in your van. We arrived at OMR at Noon and for the first time ever, were told that our room would not be ready until 3pm. Front desk offered to let us change into swimsuits, but would not let us check in to our room. This was a bit disappointing since the resort was clearly only around half occupied. We grabbed lunch, some cocktails and toured the grounds. Headed back to front desk at 2:30 to find our room was ready. We received our key and were sent on our way...they said our luggage would follow shortly and it did. ROOM: No complaints here. Clean room with well stocked refrigerator every day of our trip. Room was 1608 which was one row of rooms in from the pool/beach and a 3 minute walk in the other direction to the lobby and dining area. Room was cleaned everyday by 3pm. Only minor inconvenience was that we only had two towels each day. I prefer to have two but we never called for more we just dealt with it. Beds were the same firmness as we have experienced at every resort in Mexico, pillows were foam ~ no feather pillows. A/C worked perfectly and there was plenty of hot water for showers. FOOD: No complaints here either. If you have traveled all-inclusives then you know what you will be getting. Note: Best food I have ever had was at Iberostar Tucan in Playacar. We never went to specialty restaurants but spoke to a few guests who were happy with them. Oddly, this resort only offers room service to Premium guests. Coffee bar was nice every afternoon and lobby bar had better drinks than the pool bar. EXCURSIONS: We went to 5th Avenue on two separate days (Apx.10 minutes south). Once on our own via a taxi due to a cloudy afternoon. Second time via the free shuttle bus from resort. You must sign up for this at 8am the morning prior to when you want to go. No problems with this free service but the bus only holds around 20 people and it fills up early. Shuttle leaves resort at noon and returns at 5pm. It was extremely hot the day we took the shuttle and felt the 5 hours was just long enough since we have been there many times over the years. Exchange rate when we were there was $13 pesos to $1 us currency. If you charge a purchase this is the rate you get. If you pay cash, most vendors will only give you $10 to $1. Felt a bit cheated, but what can you do? I do recommend 1921 tequilla creme if you want to purchase alcohol. They sell it at the airport and it was something different that was a big hit when I brought it home to my family. It is like a 'Baileys\", drink it refrigerated in a shot glass...kind of a sipping desert drink. My son put it in his coffee. I checked when back in MA and would need to drive an hour to Albany NY to purchase in the states. Not sold in MA. As this trip was for pure relaxation, we did not take any other day trips. POOL/BEACH: This is why I had to drop a bit in my score of this resort. The pools were very clean (no children!) and they were certainly large enough. BIG problem is the lounge chairs. They all need to be replaced as they are sagging very low and offer no support. Note to management...this is why we come to relax at the pool/beach and these chairs were the worst I have ever seen. BIGGER problem, I would rate the beach at this resort a 2 out of 10 at best and that's pushing it. 60% of the beach is just a boardwalk that the waves crash into, you cannot go in the water in front of this boardwalk. Facing the water, there are small cove like beaches to the left and right of this boardwalk. I saw very little difference between the two of these except the chairs to the left are a bit better. Sadly, this beach water is not the beautiful turquoise color you expect to see. I was not inspired to take out my camera at all on this beach. Maybe it was the time of year, I normally travel to PDC in May but there was also a seaweed problem and the beach was very rocky. I have gotten used to the beach in Playacar...10 minutes further south makes a WORLD of difference. Playacar beaches have sugar fine white sand, no rocks and that gorgeous turquoise color water that I pay for and expect to enjoy. On a positive note, we walked to the left as others have suggested to see where a river forms a good snorkeling spot just past the Blue Bay Resort. That beach had a 2 foot wide band of brown/black slime on the shore and as the waves hit the sand the color of the water there was dark brown. NO ONE was swimming in it. We have far better beaches up north in CT! When compared to that area, our beach was better but still a disappointment to us. We never sat on the beach, we just stayed by the pool. The drinks at pool bar lacked alcohol, nothing special to write about. You are better off sticking to beer. Overall, the resort is pleasant. Grounds are immaculate, palm trees and fun wildlife everywhere you look. We met some of the nicest people on this trip and the staff was friendly. If only they had a better beach!!

We would have preferred a combination safe Our big complaint about the room is that we could never get washrags. We had to call and then wait everyday. we even left the maids tip folded in the dirty washrags to give her a hint and that did not work either. Food: Food was good, variety of restaurants at night, good service but the place was understaffed and so service was not as good as it should have been for this type of place. It was not because the staff that was there did not work hard - they worked very hard - they just had to cover too much of an area to provide good service. Beach: Beach is ok but not the best. Part of the beach area has a boardwalk and so you are not walking along the water. there is access on each side but one side was rocky and the other side was a small area boardered by a pier. The water was not too clear when we were there. Very little service at the beach unless you walk up to the bar or do the upgrade to privilage. We did the upgrade to Privilage in October and because it rained all week it was a waste of money. We tried to get our money back but were treated badly by the lady at the Privilage area when I asked for a refund. We understand that they could not control the rain, but they could have met us half way rather than treat me bad! Other than good beach service, you do not get much for the money. We did not pay for the upgrade in November nor would we advise anyone to pay to be upgraded. We would have liked better beach service for the non-privilage area. again, understaffed. We were there in low season and our last couple days guests were scrambling for beach chairs. There were also very few tables to use on the beach so you had to hold your drink if you did not get out early enough to get a table. Pools: two great pools, one swimup bar, very clean. They host many daily activities by the pool. Javier and Ebber provided great service at the pool bar. They worked very hard and made us the best Mojito's!! Gill and Marciella were also very helpful and friendly when we had questions or needed assistance~ The resort did provide a very nice beach party/luncheon one afternoon for guests. Lobby is a great place to hang out at night or when raining. staff works hard to serve guests. Overall - it is a decent place, grounds and rooms are kept very clean and nice.

The entire resort is peaceful and serene, and you cannot help but to relax and enjoy. We spent a lot of time in the hammocks (where my feet got sunburned)! There was some construction going on due to a recent hurricane, but it did not disturb us in the least. The pools are well maintained, and always seemed to be crystal clear. The swim up bar is awesome. There is a local named Roberto that gives henna tattoos located in between the two pools \u2013 make sure you see him. He does wonderful work, and is fun to talk to! The room was always kept clean, and Josephina did a wonderful job during our stay. Thanks!!! The rest of the grounds are professionally maintained and groomed.

From the time our hotel is booked, I go to the hotel site and read reviews, look at pictures and check out everything there is to know about the hotel. I've read good reviews and bad reviews about this hotel and let me tell you, this hotel was probably the best we've stayed in so far. First of all the whole staff is very friendly and will certainly go out of their way to help you with anything you need or want. We had upgraded through our Travel Agent for an oceanview room and I emailed them to make sure we got one because it was our anniversary. They emailed me and said they would make sure we had the room we wanted. We had an awesome room with the beach, pools and the Mexican restaurant steps away. The walk to and from the lobby is a little bit of a walk, but the grounds are just gorgeous with animals and iguanas roaming about that we enjoyed it. Not one single worker at that hotel would walk by without an \"hola\". The pool bar has by far the coolest bartenders, Edgar and Javier. They are fun to talk to and watch. The \"premium\" upgrade is so not worth it unless you want the beds on the beach and, they say, the best liquor. We still got the best liquor because the bartenders are awesome. This was just my observation as far as upgrading, but we didn't seem to get any less than the premiums and we saved that upgrade money. I will say that if you want to go into Playa, the cab ride is $20 each way. They have a free shuttle that leaves at 12:00 and comes back at 5:00, but we went and came back when we wanted, so we paid. If you get money from any atm either at the hotel or on 5th ave, their cost is outrageous, but when you need cash, you'll pay it. They are in the process of building a new restaurant and it was by our room. One reviewer on trip advisory said the noise from the building and the noise from the machines clearing the beach woke them up at all hours of the night and early in the morning, but we slept like a baby. The beds are firm and very comfortable. Also mentioned was the water leaked onto the floor when taking a shower. It does, but instead of griping about it, just put a towel down. I think people that have these little gripes are too nit-picky! I will say the food could have been better, but the food is pretty much the same at all the inclusive hotels, so I wasn't expecting anything out of this world, but you won't go hungry!

Someone in our family gave us a week, we just paid the daily rate and our plane tickets. We arranged our airport transportation through TraficTours through email and it was $18 a person round trip. It's about a 45 minute drive to the resort from the airport. Just so you know, since we were guests of a premium member, we were given gold bracelets and had all the same amenities as a premium member. We arrived via van driven by someone from TraficTours. They unloaded our luggage, we were checked in at the premium desk. We then were taken to the place in the lobby for us to sign up to take a tour. We declined, they want you to go to a \"VIP breakfast\" to give you the pitch for buying a timeshare. From what we've been told, it's about 1 1/2 hours. Once we said no, they didn't bother us again about it. Our luggage was brought to our room. The room was very nice, a suite with a king sized bed, a fold out couch, TV, fridge, chair. We had a banner on our door, Just Married as it was the honeymoon we had never gotten to take. We also had an invite to dinner with the executive chef on Tuesday night, a card saying that we needed to make a reservation for breakfast in bed and dinner for two on the beach. We ate at the Italian place on Sunday night. It's been temporarily moved from the beach to a partitioned part of La Hacendia. The food was ok, nothing special. As we were premium, they put us in the wine cooler, which is where they set the privilege area. It was a little chilly, but nice. The service is great, all the staff is wonderful in the restaurants. We went to Mike's coffee, which is near the bar restrooms, before the steps to the spa. Great service by Karolina who is usually in there. They are open from 4-11 pm. Smoothies, iced tea, lattes, coffee, espresso, sweets for your tummy all the time too. There is a cooler with cake goodies, little sandwiches too. Cakes and sweet breads on the counter. Monday we went to the buffet at La Hacienda for breakfast, it's a buffet, but if you are privileged you can order off of a menu...its kept in the podium at the entrance of the doors to the privileged seating. You have to ask for it, or just get one. I think it should be handed to you or even on the table as we didn't know we could do that until Wednesday. Tuesday we went to the chefs dinner at the Oreintal restaurant, Yookoso. Very good food, the chef doesn't speak very much English, so she had a translator, Amy. Amy speaks excellent English and is part of the entertainment crew. One way to become more fluent is to get practice! (Wednesday we had a thank you gift when we returned to the room, chocolate covered strawberries and a note to review the dinner on TripAdvisor.) There were vendors out in the plaza by the lobby. Most are mass produced made in China, I'm sure. Some were definitely made in Mexico though. You can talk the t shirt guy down, he started at 1700 pesos ($17 USD), exchange rate with most vendors is 10%, easy to figure out. Just move the decimal point to the left. I bought a shirt for $15 USD, although hubby thought I could have gotten it for $10 usd. One of the vendors is pretty rude though, the guy with the necklaces and bracelets. You can buy the bracelets in the hotel lobby gift shop (more on that later), but, you don't take the item someone wants to purchase out of the person's hand and be rude about it. I didn't even walk by his table the rest of the time we were there. Wednesday we went on a trip to Tulum. Gerry at TraficTours set that up for us. He's great, very knowledgeable and has pretty great English! He's in the lobby every day from 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. taking an hour for lunch at 1 p.m. I think. We went on a bus, we picked up a few passengers in Playa Del Carmen, it took a while to get there, but, there was a/c on the bus. After going to another hotel, near Tulum, we switched buses. After arriving at Tulum we were split up into two groups, English speaking and Spanish speaking. We had a great guide, he's Mayan through his mother and knew a lot of history and information about all the ruins and the area. We were able to go on our own after a while. We didn't go swimming, there were a LOT of people down there, but, we had our suits on underneath. There's no restrooms in that area, just in the town before Tulum, so wear your suit and bring some clothes and a towel. Also bring sun tan lotion and mosquito spray. The bus driver will try to sell you water for $2 and mosquito repellant for $8. We didn't need either, there were very few mosquitoes in November, but, there's a lot of standing water. If we could have, we would have rented a car and driven ourselves. It would have taken half the time and I think that the cars are around $80 for 24 hours. Thursday morning we had our breakfast in bed. We had the American breakfast. Even though I had asked, there was no syrup for the pancakes and the eggs weren't cooked the way we had asked. But, it was nice and filling and we didn't eat until dinner. Thursday night we went to a show. There was a Mariachi band, singer and dancers, it was awesome! Bring your camera to this show, you will want photos during and after as well. There's also a Mayan guy that the photographer brings around so you can get a photo with him. Wait until Saturday night, they bring in Mayan dancers, you can pose with them for free. The vendors are back again, but, there's a Mayan lady that hand paints Mayan calendars and other Mayan things on leather. Find her and talk to her, she's awesome and her work is great. I bought a 10 x 10 square with the Mayan calendar on it and a bookmark as well. She burned my name into the bookmark. She's full Mayan and has a LOT of information for you if you want to ask her questions. All the other vendors are the same as the other night though. We tried the Italian place again on Friday. We went with another couple, sat in the main part of the restaurant vs. the premium section. There's a waiter there that's a joker, I think his name is Romy. Then we did another show, it was a circus show, very scary but good. Scary as there is no padding or anything under the performers at all. It was amazing! Remember to bring your camera, you will want to take photos during the show. Saturday we had our \"romantica\" dinner on the beach in the two story hut. It was awesome. It was 5 courses and the moon was out on the water, very nice! We went to a show afterwards, the Mayan dancer show\u2026it was incredible and I'm glad I had video on my camera to get everything!! You can get photos afterwards with the dancers if you want. There was a band that did a few songs that I recognized, like \"Sweet Home Alabama\". We were leaving early the next day, so we didn't stay too long. Things that bugged us: Trying to charge us for a phone call we never made at checkout. Make sure you only use the phone in the room if you need to call the front desk. It's really expensive to call from the room. We didn't have our cell phones on at all. Who would we call? I think that the maid called someone on our room phone! Marabella was the stand in for Azusena \"White Flower\" on Azusena's day off. She didn't even roam around after a few hours, she was at the pool bar with her friends. I went to the bathroom by the pool bar and she and two other friends were in there talking away. She was lazy and I wouldn't suggest that she be a server at all anywhere on the grounds. She just stood around and didn't ask you if you wanted anything, you had to FIND her to get ice, water or anything. The food didn't really bug us, but, it wasn't really great either. It was just okay. I found that I liked most of the food after a few days. I tried new things, but, I mainly ate fruit, bread and salad. There was a variety if you went to the different places for dinner, but, for lunch, it was just the two choices: The Mexican place near the pool or the buffet near the lobby. The hotel gift shops take USD or Pesos, but, only gives back change in Pesos. What? If you take USD, you should give change back in USD. That happened in the lobby too, we paid with cash when we arrived and we got back some Pesos and coins. No biggie there as it was just $2 and change, but, with the gift shop it was like $15. They put the Premium rooms near the kitchen. Early morning and in the evening you can hear the clanking of plates from the kitchen as that building is right there. The hotel is a little removed from everything. There is a free shuttle through the hotel that goes to the shopping district in Playa del Carmen daily, but, it's way too long from what we've been told, to stay in that town. It's close enough that you should be able to go and pick people up after an hour. Seriously, 5 hours for shopping? Who does that? Things we liked: The grounds are gorgeous! Don't even look at the photos on TripAdvisor or on the actual hotel website, they will not do the place justice. Just laying on the beach all day on the chairs or sun beds, looking at the water. The premium section has pads on the chairs and there are sun beds. Also there's books, sunscreen, water, water bottles, fruit, beer, wet wash cloths, and a great hostess/person that brings you drinks, unless it's her day off. KID FREE!! This resort just went adult only this summer. We love kids, our kids. We wanted a vacation that was for adults and we got one. Our kids are grown! It was a little quiet at times as it was just adults everywhere, but, it was nice. A safe in the room. They give you a key and lock when you check in. Don't lose it, or you will be charged I think $60 for it as they have to drill the safe. It's small, but, we put our passports, watches, my Nook, wallets, iPod in it. I think that a tablet would fit in it. We just locked our suitcases if we were leaving our computers in the room. The A/C worked really well, we turned it off during the day and had it on at night to block out the noise of neighbors. People that were great: Rudy in the water sports shack. He does a great snorkeling trip for $35. My hubby went on it and he's been snorkeling before. They go about 3-4 miles out and you can see the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, which is the second largest in the World. It's about 1 1/2 hours and you see a lot if you pay attention to the guide. Javier at the pool bar. He's so fun and works great with the other bartender whose name is Eber I think. If you give him $2 or so the first few days, he will always serve you quickly! Besides we always tip for good service. Isabel who is a hostess at the buffet and then the Mexican restaurant. She's awesome, so polite and smiles a lot. Azusena \"White Flower\". She works every day with a smile on her face in the premium beach section. She's pregnant and due in February, so, if you go after that, I don't know who will be there. Take these things with you, you will need them: Sun screen! We went in early November and the sun was really hot. We took 3 bottles of 10 oz. each and used one bottle and started on another one and we were there 7 days. In the gift shop it's $30 USD per bottle. Mosquito spray if you are doing any tours at all. A jacket/sweater as it was pretty windy when we went, on the water and a little chilly in some of the restaurants. You may want some jeans/sweats at night. I contacted Maria (the asst. manager) after reading a few of the reviews. She hooked us up!

The only positive things about this hotel are the great variation of food and the nice hotel complex but the service and the contact with the guests was absolut terrible. Moreover the beach and the equipment on it was very old and dirty so no suggestion for going to swim in the sea at this area. After the first day we wondering that our room wasn't clean up. No problem, we called the service to ask for clean up but nothing happened. On the next day again nobody clean up our room we called again and asked why no one will come and asked to clean up our rooms continuously and they told us only: Ok, if you want. Our mini bar also wasnt't filled up so we havent got any fresh water and mostly every day we had to dial the number for the guest service. After some calls nobody answers us anymore at the phone and every time we had to go to the reception to ask again to get some bottles of fresh water. We got no excuses for such brassiness. We have never had such a rotten guest service. Allover the staff in the restaurants was very friendly appart from the staff at the lounge bar they were very brazen. I have nothing against music and animation at the hotel complex but not in such a loudness and after 12 o'clock in the evening. We heard the music up to our room which was far from the hotel lounge by closed windows and it was hard to get sleep. The worst thing was on our arrival day. The day before we asked for a wake up call, a taki and someone who will take our luggage because we had to go to the airport at 2.30 am but really nothing happend. No wake up call, no luggage service and no taxi so we had to organize it all on our own and had a lot of stress.

But Ocean Maya on the otherhand...!!!\u201d", "Author": "JenniferFryatt", "ReviewID": "UR120601465", "Content": "Me and my partner booked this holiday at the end on January, this year! We waited nearly 10 months for this beautiful break...and by the time it came round we couldn't have needed the break more..... We got back this morning and although my holiday was okay... I can't help but feel let down and dissapointed in Ocean Maya Royale. Let me explain in further detail.....starting with the good points. 1. The grounds were beautiful. They were lovely and well looked after. Absolutely lovely. 2. The pools... Were enjoyable to be around. The entertainment staff - Omar and Amy in particular were great and couldn't do enough to keep you entertained. A joy to be around. 3. Our room/ rooms (explain later on) were kept clean and tidy everyday. No complaints there. 3. The beach. It was okay. In comparison to the other beaches either side of ours... we defiantly had the better one. However the pictures in the brochures looked alot different - werent quite what we were expecting! 4. Our holiday Rep was fab and very helpful. Gave us lots of info and was always available. Very friendly. 5. The spa was excellent! We both had a full body massage it was amazing! Definitely worth it's money! Edwardo who worked at the Spa was exceptionally friendly and everytime he saw us around the pool...he remembered our names and made the effort to approach us. He was a delight. Now for the not so good.... 1. The food! One word - DISGUSTING!!! Theres there no other Word to discribe it. The same thing was served every single day in the buffet restaurant. The Italian, Mexican and Japanese food was equally Vile! If you are looking for lovely food this hotel is not for you. The money we took with us for excursions was spent on meals in playa del Carmen because the food became unbearable to eat. Never did I think I would come home a stone lighter from a holiday than when I left!!!... It's a first!! However Alfredo, one of our waiters in the buffet area was very friendly and nothing was to much trouble for him. 2. Don't bother paying extra for a ocean view room. Only do so if your an early bird and don't mind being woken up at 5am every morning by a large truck/ tractor which evens/ cleans the hotels sand. I addressed this issue with reception who told me they'd sort the problem out & look into it for us. Next morning at 5.20am... what do you know!!! Again at reception I address the issue again as different staff were on duty. They told me they'd sort it out and after a heated discussion, I asked for a manager. After the staff speaking amongst themselves in Spanish for a good 5-10 minutes amongst themselves, A gentleman appears and then informs me that in regards to my complaint there was nothing he could do in regards to the wildlife noise!! WHAT?? So not only was I tired but annoyed that the staff had fobbed me off for the past 2 days and not understood what I said from the beginning. I must have explained the situation at least 8-10 times at the minimum! They told me another room would not be available until the following day- promising somewhere quieter. Next day... My partner and I go to reception again and they inform us that there's no need to move us now as they had arranged for the tractor/ truck to start on the otherside of the beach first. The beach is only 100 yards long so instead of being woken up at 5 it would now be 5.15! How considerate of them! After kicking up and after 4 day they eventually moved us to a privileged room... which wasa little quieter but the room was not much better than our previous one. If I'd payed a large amount extra to be a \"privileged member\" I would not have been impressed to say the least. 3. The smell of sewers lingered around certain parts of the hotel which smelt disgusting! Especially when your feeling queasy as it is. 4. The evening entertainment was poor, it was embarrassing to watch...we found ourselves in bed by 9pm most evenings watching a film instead as that was more entertaining. 5. The \"Margarita Lounge\" advertised on ocean mayas website which looks very picturesque is actually in the process of being built. Nothing like a bit of false advertising!!!! 6. As much as we loved the pools the music. My god! The same CD was played over and over again! I think if I hear Adeles, rolling in the deep one more time... I'll shoot myself. 7. The Walls at this hotel are redicilously thin!! We could hear absolutely everything to doors being slammed, clear conversations in the corridoor outside our room, Upstairs walking around sounded like they were actually walking around in our room. I didn't sleep all the way through.... Not one night due to the noise..... The best bit was being woken up at 7.30am to hear next door being violently sick! Lovely!!! 8. The shuttle bus. Ran once a day and held only 20 people! 20!!! The hotel holds the capacity for hundreds so to get a place on that bus was practically impossible. And a pretty pointless service to be honest with you. The points above could have so easily ruined our holiday... And it so almost did. We meet some lovely people at the resort...went in to playa del Carmen, which was lovely! We swam with the dolphins which was an excellent experience which made our holiday. If it werent for these reasons I would have wanted to go home by day 4! My advise to you is go else where, we spent the best of 3k on this holiday and it unfortunately wasn't worth it's money!!! This hotel is no way a 5*... lucky to be classed as a 3 if that. I'd definitely come back to playa del Carmen...

We did not do the massages but heard from quite a few people that they were awesome. We met some great people, shout out to Lovee & Ernesto & to a great group from Spain that were tons of fun. The only thing that I really can say was bad was the poor shape that the pool lounge chairs are in. They really need new ones. Also I dont think the beach is the best to get out in the water but it didnt bother us because we dont do that anyway. The beds in the room were hard but I slept pretty sound most every night.

The entire staff was pleasant and anxious to keep us happy. Just to name a few, Hosea at the buffett, Omar at the activity desk, Javier at the pool bar and the girl that serviced our room Anatolia. Everyone met us with smiles and enjoyed serving us. Everyone was great. We have stayed at \"fancier\" resorts but this resort was a solid performer and gave us a very comfortable vacation with a very reasonable price. We paid $1634(USD) for 7 nights and that was with non stop flights out of Atlanta. I would rate the OMR a solid 4 out of 5. The resort could improve by replacing the worn out beach/pool loungers, some of the food was not kept warm, and the beer in the room was lousy. Not much to complain about and for sure did not ruin our vacation. When I read the bad reviews I just thought those people were expecting too much and probably impossible to please. The gardens are beautiful and well maintained. Be sure to take some Avon Skin-so-soft for the misquitos. The mangroves (natural areas) harbour the pesky creatures. The pools are crystal clear. The resort was only at 40% occupancy. Not sure if it was because of Rina or the end of the hurricane/rainy season. The weather was very good, 80's in the day and high 60's at night. Only had one rainy day. We really enjoyed the racoons. They will approach you in search of food. Do not be afraid. They will take the food gently from your hand. There was one racoon that camped out at the restaurant at the pool and looked like he was well fed. Please show respect for them. They were there long before the resort was. We did not join the Privilege Club because it sure would not have been worth the extra expense, in our opinion. We politely declined the Privilege and the offer to the time share presentation and was not approached again. The food was more than acceptable. We did the Italian and the Japanese and enjoyed both. The buffett had a decent variety and was good every meal. Look at the \"special\" at the buffett. It is different every night and was very good when we tried it. I must say that we are not picky eaters. We would not hesitate to stay at the OMR again. It was a comfortable, relaxing vacation for us. We had no problems with the resort and its offerings.

On arrival to the hotel our luggage was carried straight from the coach transfer cabin to our rooms. Check in was fast and easy and a hotel representative showed us around the resort and took us to where we were staying. Our immediate impressions were fantastic. Having never been to Mexico before, we didn't know what to expect. It is true to say that we were pleasantly surprised; the grounds were spotless, kept well and beautiful. The resort is enshrouded in lush gardens and waterfalls and is inhabited by exotic birds, iguanas and racoons. All of which are very friendly and cute. On arrival to our room we were impressed with not only the cleanliness but also the standard of the room itself. The bed was huge, comfortable and spotless. There are plenty of conveniences such as towels and toiletries and there's also a large plasma TV. The marble floor does well to keep the room cool in the hot, humid climate and the air conditioning was faultless. We were staying in room 3032 on the ground floor, which has a balcony with table and chairs and is only 2 minutes walk from the pool, beach, restaurants, bars and nightlife on the resort. Finally, the shower was great, plenty of hot water. In terms of daytime entertainment or relaxation I think this hotel has the perfect balance. There are two large pools, equally as well kept and inviting, one quiet with a relaxing atmosphere and another for daytime activities with music and a swim-up bar. Being a young couple in our twenties we opted mostly for the activity pool. The staff were very entertaining, we played water volleyball almost everyday and sometimes tequila volleyball (not for the faint-hearted). The swim-up bar was great with plenty of staff and amazing drinks even for non-premier customers, you must try their gin fizz and mud lights cocktails. However, if you wanted a quieter, more relaxing option then the other beach was perfect. Situated at the rear of the premium beach and still only one hundered yards from the poolside bar, it is quiet and peaceful. As well as this, the beach is merely 10 steps away from the pool. We experienced the idyllic white sands and turqoise waters of Mexico's coastland and often took bread into the sea to feed the jumping angel fish. The beach was clean and the waters warm, when we walked along the stretch of sand past other resorts to visit the lagoon we found that ours was certainly the best maintained, others laden with sandbags and seaweed. In terms of the food on offer we were slightly hesitant and anxious given some of the poor reviews on Trip Advisor. Given this, we truely don't understand what expectations these people had before going here, the food was fantastic. I have never had so much choice and variety as I did on this resort. For breakfast there is a buffet in the main lobby. There are cereals, yougurts, fresh fruit, smoothies, pastries, omlettes, english breakfasts and any drink you could desire. There are four restaurants; Japanese, Mexican, Italian and a buffet. On our first night we went to the Mexican, we were greeted with banana cocktails which were constantly topped up and we chose from an extensive menu of tarditional Mexican dishes. The food was served quickly, looked great and tasted even better. During the day we mostly ate here, simply because the food was great and it is situated so close to the pool. However, on evenings we ventured to the others. The Italian was nice, but the Japanese was our favourite with a more adventurous menu. We only stayed one week in Mexico, regrettably, therefore we were limited as to what excursions we could take. Our main trip was to Xtreme Adventures Cancun, an adventure park about 40 minutes drive away from the resort. This is great for active people, the visit includes zipwiring through the jungle, quad biking, jumping from a cliff into a beautiful lagoon with trpoical fish and concludes with an underground cave; the most idyllic place of all. Evening entertainment was superb. There was professional salsa dancing, a history of Mexican culture night, karaoke and we were fortunate enough to be there during the week of Mexican independence day. On this night there were food stalls, decorations and a dancefloor, all outdoors. In conclusion, we thoroughly enjoyed our week in Mexico. Above all else, what made our stay was the people. The staff were fantastic, attentive and more than happy to help with any enquiries. On one occasion I had lost my ticket for an excursion we were going on. We were really disappointed because this meant that we couldn't go, but, at the very last minute one of the waiters from the breakfast service ran over to us with the ticket. This demonstrates just how great they were. We met many people from all over the world and some from closer to home. We couldn't have hoped for better people, staff, rooms or amenities than we had. For this reason we are already booking up for next year, and this time for two weeks. We look forwards to a truely faultless and memorable holiday.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryville, Tennessee, United States", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing trip\u201d", "Author": "Casey R", "ReviewID": "UR120160757", "Content": "My wife and I were there the first week of October for our 5th anniversary and had a great time. I read a review which complained about noise from the pool but we were staying in the room closest to the pool bar and all of the pool activities and we weren't bothered at all by any outside noise. If you decide to go you will meet many delightful people. Alfredo, Susanna, Rudy, and Amy Jean were a few of our favorites. I'm not good with names so I have forgotten a few but I was suprised by how far the staff would go out of their way to make us happy. Susanna gave us a staff umbrella when all of the other umbrellas were gone and another girl booked us a romantic dinner for two without us giving her proper notice because we decided we wanted to do it our last night there. The staff was great and I just wish that I had more money so that I could have tipped tham all. You can't book an ocean view room online but they were more than happy to give us one at no extra charge when we got there. It was actually considered a downgrade from our priviledge suite but it was more than adequate for us. If you want to go shopping I recommend going to Cancun which will cost you $90 - $100 round trip in a taxi and you can rent a car at the resort for about the same price for 24 hours. Make sure you let your bank know that you are leaving the country if you don't want your debit card frozen and I would still take an extra Visa or Mastercard just in case. The only thing we didn't like was the timeshare presentation. They gave us $100 to sit through it but it wasn't worth it to give up our vacation time. I advise anyone going to Mexico not to take any special deals or money at the airport or the resort to sit through a presentation or \"resort tour\".

Having visited Cancun before, we wanted somewhere quieter and more relaxing and we were influenced in our choice by the claim on the OMR's website that there was a 'calm and exclusive atmosphere'. Nothing could be further from the truth thanks to the incessant racket coming from the poolside bar which effectively ruined our holiday. We were not aware in advance, but the theory here is that there are two pools - a 'quiet' pool and a 'crazy' pool. The further theory is that the noise and activities are restricted to the 'crazy' pool. What absolute nonsense. The two pools are less than five meters apart and the dreadful music can be heard - loudly - fifty meters away on the beach! So, 'quiet' pool - not a chance. And, this stuff is not background music. Example, 'Boom, Boom. Come Up To My Room' was one of the staff's favourites. This is the root of the problem. The two poolside bar staff and the animations team are allowed to play this rubbish - at 1,000 decibels - because they think that it is 'cool' and clever. The average age of the guests during our stay would have been mid fifties, the average age of the 'poolside crew' would be mid twenties. Unfortunately, there was also a hard core of younger, typically American guests who hogged the poolside bar. The hard core changed every few days as they were usually there for 2-3 days to 'party' (not sure why they didn't go to Cancun?) but there was always this handful who seemed to give the 'poolside crew' all the encouragement they needed. Not that the poolside bar staff or the animations people needed much encouragement. We complained repeatedly about the volume of the music and occasionally got a half hour's respite but that was about it. There was one corner of the beach, about 100 meters away from the two pools, where it was just about possible to escape the racket but that was next to the construction site of the 'Margarita Lounge'. (To be honest, construction noise was actually an improvement on 'Boom, Boom. Come Up To My Room'). This incessant racket quite literally ruined our holiday. It is utterly beyond belief that a small group of junior staff can be allowed to dictate so much of the customer experience - and destroy that experience. This is complete self indulgence on the part of these junior staff - however - they are being allowed to get away with it by the Management of the Hotel who really should get to grips with this issue. The Management need to make up their mind about the customer base they are pitching at. Is it Club 18-30 or 'calm and exclusive'? Right now they seem to be caught between two stools. It is a real shame because the OMR has a lot going for it, not least almost all the other staff, who are great. We say 'almost all' because there is one really sleazy guy whose job is to try to sell massages and spa treatments but who is a real pest and won't take 'no' for an answer. Other than this really sleazy guy and the 'poolside crew', though, the rest of the staff can't do enough for you. They are always cheerful, friendly and obliging - and extraordinarily hard working. Never more so than when the resort was hit by a tropical storm for two days during our stay and the staff had to 'batten down the hatches'. The staff could not have done more to ensure our safety and well being and that is greatly to their credit. (Mind you, listening to 75 mph winds for a couple of days was eminently preferable to listening to 'Boom, Boom Come Up To My Room'.) So, the staff, for the most part, were great. The Hotel's location and grounds are also huge assets. The grounds are lovely and beautifully maintained, again, by a cheerful and hard working group of grounds staff. Our room was OK, other than its location didn't have much of a view or get much sun but that's the luck of the draw. It was well appointed (though only one mirror - in the bathroom - and not full length - should be addressed) and clean, thanks to our charming and very obliging maid. Our other big issue was the food, which ranged from bland to downright awful (two successive 'Chef's Specials' completely inedible). Superficially, there seemed to be plenty of choice, with a large range of food on offer in the Main Restaurant, and the further options of the Italian, Mexican and Japanese a la carte restaurants (though they were occasionally closed) but, again, the food was awfully bland and repetitive. The two best meals we had in the fortnight was lunch in Playa del Carmen at an authentic Mexican restaurant and dinner in Cancun at a fabulous Argentinian restaurant. Also, the standard wine on offer was undrinkable but we overcame this by insisting on getting the wine on offer to 'Privilege' clients. Unfortunately, this has affected our 'drinks rating' as it otherwise flowed freely and some of the cocktails on offer were great. Two other minor issues. First, only one shuttle bus per day to Playa del Carmen, taking a maximum of 20 people, was not enough. Given that the Hotel really is in the middle of nowhere, this service should be round the clock. Second, the evening entertainment is of a very rudimentary nature. Basically, it is the animations team dressing up in different costumes every night and making a lot of noise (which is their core competence.) Overall, therefore we were terribly disappointed - we did not get the 'calm atmosphere' which we had expected and we thought that the food was poor. This Hotel is not 5 star. Thomson's (the UK Tour Operator) are right to rate it 4T - and that's maybe even a stretch). It's a shame because, as we have said, the Hotel does have a lot going for it - not least (most of) the staff and we feel sorry to be so scathing as most of them work so very hard - BUT - they are being let down by their poolside colleagues and the standard of the food.

I loved the saxophonist in the dining room, he always had a smile and a wave for me and what a joy eating breakfast to the sultry tones of the sax and the haunting tunes on the flute. We read a lot of negative reviews about the beach......all I can say is I don't know where they came from. The beach was clean, plentiful sun beds and the sea was lovely. The evening entertainment was exceptional, the animation team worked really hard day and night to make sure there was plenty to see and do. Especially Ricardo.....the small pool had something going on all day, volley ball, aqua aerobics, games etc and the swim up bar was fab. The cocktails were amazing especially the banana margueurita and strawberry daiquiri. The gardens were immaculate and the wildlife was a joy to see every day. All in all Ocean Maya was a lovely resort, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who want to visit Riveira Maya. We would definitely go back for a return visit. It was great not having children around as well.

In my opinion it is at least a 5 star. We stayed 10/15-10/22 and despite the first 2 days of rain,had a great vacation. The staff and hotel grounds were beyond our expectations. From the buffet Alfredo and Alberto were the best. The lobby bar Nacho and Benjamin worked very hard to make our drinks special.The beach/pool waitress(name?) gave exceptional service. We got room service a few nights and I would recommend the veggie wraps.Omar brought our food quickly despite the downpour with friendly service. We ate at the mexican restaurant and loved the beef filet. At the italian we had cheese ravioli and liked that as well.We did not have reservations at either place and got right in.The buffet had a variety of food that was delicious. We miss our new friends Alberto and Alfredo at the buffet.We do not have service like this in the U.S. The shuttle to Play Del Carmen was nice for an afternoon of shopping. You need to make reservations the day before at the tour desk. We met people from England, the 4 friends from Canada, anniversary family from Canada, Gary and Michelle from PA, and hey U.K and many more. It was nice talking with all of you! This was my 6th time to the area and would love to return to the OMR.We liked the adults only aspect.The ocean water was not clear due to the storms that they had. They worked hard daily cleaning the seaweed and debris from the beach and always with smile.Take a 15 min. walk to the left of the beach to the lazy river lagoon.It is worth the walk.Seeing resorts along the way,OMR was the nicest. I did not see the need to upgrade to privileged. Our room 3608 was an ocean view second floor.They are rebuilding the italian restaurant so the construction was a bit noisy but not enough to spoil our vacation.Our friends had ground floor ocean view in 3601. They got alot of wildlife on their patio from coatis to raccoon.Our building was right by the beach and pool area and quiet at night. We traveled through Apple Vacations as I had in the past and were very displeased with the service. We spent much time looking for our rep at the tour desk as he was never there during posted hours.However this does not reflect on the resort itself as we will not use Apple in the future. We would definitely return to OMR or go to any of the H10 resorts.It was a wonderful much needed vacation.

We enjoyed our stay and met some great people. We were in cube 9 room 903 that had ocean view. I had wrote in advance and let them know that it was both our birthday and aniversay and they set us up in a wonderful room. Within 45 min of arrival a plate of little pastries and bottle of tequilla showed up for special day and on my actual birthday a cake and bottle of wine. My husband and I both loved the property very much in our room we had the stock fridge, great selecton of toiletries (razor, toothbrush, comb, mouthwash, bodywash, shampoo, shoe shine and sewing kit) couch and chair balcony chair and table and roomsafe. We booked throught delta vacations so we recieved orange wrist bands which did give us the opportunity to make reseveration at the special resturants, we never did. We never had any problem to getting in if if we wanted to go. We were not huge fans of the food but we did not go hungry, however we did not gain weight. I did not find it warm in the resturant so they may have fixed that. I really don't know how to say this but I have to, I have been to mexico six times and I have not read so much as I have here on the poor behavior of americans and canadians. Really lets get past that this is vacation and the party team runs around and gets ppl involved in lots of games and fun. In six years of comming to in all inclusive have I have seen the hotel manager and hotel security come down to the pool, but this did happen for a group of people from across the pond, I am not going to get into details because it would not be fair to them. What I am trying to say is this is a vacation spot and set up to cater to having fun. We had a great time with our freinds we met from everywhere and never once did I sit back and think anything diffrent with the good time brought to a hault because of an incident that was not americans or canadians. We did however say that if he had to pay for what he had done we would help him out because I was unfortunate. With all that being said I would like to say on the most part this is a fairly calm place and yes they do have tequila vollleyball, contest in the pool and loud music and they do allow women to sunbathe topless. It is what it is and that is why this is a vacation and why we have trip advisor do your research and know before you go. The grounds are awsome I love the sidewalk that go all the way through this place we were almost as far as you could get for the resturants but that was great. We had the beach right off our balcony. The wild life is great too. My husband and I would like to thank the staff and hotel management for the wonderful time we had.

The resort is sort of in the middle of nowhere and a taxi ride to most nearby locations are $20 per person each way.

Long before the Resorts started to pop up everywhere. I have therefore stayed at quite a few of the long list of Resorts along the strip and I can only say that this Resort is one of the finest I have ever stayed at. So much so I am coming back next week for another week! I met the second in charge, Maria Lopez several years ago while staying at The Ocean Coral up the road towards Cancun and stayed there several times over the years and was always treated with the best care, service and kindness anyone could expect! I found out that Maria was promoted to The Ocean Mays and wanted to try it out. There are no disappointments with this Resort at all! There are always going to be the people that have bad things to say, and quite frankly I will say this. I agree with some of the complaints but for a reason! Folks, this is \"MEXICO\", not The Turks & Caicos Islands or St. Lucia! I have always felt that that people just want to compare this to their 'Best\" vacation ever and forget to realize that in Mexico things are a little different! I will tell you this, I don't care if you stayed at Secrets, The Iberostar chain or any other Resort, they all have their issues. As they should. They employ hundreds of people and with that comes things that just happen. I however have found the staff and management at The h10 resorts to bend over backwards for everyone! If you need something, just ask for Maria! I will guarantee she will do whatever she can to make your stay warm and inviting! Food complaints. Listen. Try cooking for 1200 people or more and hope you satisfy everyone all of the time. Not going to happen! However, I am a picky eater and always found something to fill up on and 9 out of 10 times it was always very good. The drinks are not watered down and further more, I felt they were better than most places. If ytou go with an open mind and don't expect this to be Sandals, you will have a great experience! The rooms are great, the pools are wondereful, it's adult only, the beach is supurb and the entertainment staff are always fun! Just be realistic and you won't find many down here that compare. remember everyone has an off day or week. All Resorts no matter what the cost fail to meet to everyones expectations all the time.

I read reviews before I went and have only one thing to say....where were you staying???. This place was beautiful and the staff without exception were so warm and friendly and so helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and the Spa girls looked after me supremely well....especially Diana who worked her magic on my injured shoulder. The Restaurant staff including Manager Pedro Pech and his boys Alfredo, Jose Ramon Perez, Manuel and Alberto. The Bar staff inc Nacho, Jorge and Benjamin. Also the Animation Team especially Amy Jean and Fernie. Dulce at Reception was fab too and they all helped me practice my limited Spanish. Claudia V our room maid did a supreme job of keeping the place spotless despite the intense humidity. I truly admire that lady. The patience of all the staff in dealing with loud rude and totally lacking in respect from visitors from North America and Canada was to their great creditability. I very nearly had to point out to some people just how ignorant they were...however I am a proud Scot and know how to represent my Country and not let it or myself down. Also I have to mention the \"wild animals\" which some North Americans complained about...these were little racoon type creatures which were timid and just came round by the restaurant area at the pool.They never bothered anyone except stupid people who should have known better. There are also some iguanas at the stunning water feature and all they do is sit and bask in the sun or hide when it rains.

We spent our honeymoon there and our first anniversary at the Ocean Maya. Five nights with airfare to Secrets $2100, to Ocean Maya $1700. Just as a basis to start. The rooms are nice. They are in square two-story buildings with four rooms per floor. This means fewer shared walls, and some appreciable seclusion. We never once even heard our neighbors. Rooms are clean for the most part, but when we tried to get soiled stained towels exchanged, we found them hung back up instead. The bed was comfortable and came with a huge assortment of pillows to pick from. Very important since I think a great pillow can make up quite a lot of the difference with a poor mattress. The restaurants. Honestly the restaurants are the bane of this resort. And it isn't for the staff. The staff and servers are hospitable and attentive. They just aren't given much to work with. The food was decently prepared but frequently lacking in signature ingredients. A Margherita pizza with no basil isn't a Margherita pizza. It's just bread with slices of tomato and in this case some funky substitute for mozzarella. Same think goes for a Caprese salad. What's odd here is that my ministrone soup had fresh basil floating in it. The Japanese restaurant was a crushing disappointment. After 5 nights of phenomenal sushi next door at Secrets, the restaurant here is like the truck stop of sushi. Not for the atmosphere, which is really quite nice, as is the Teppanyaki station and service. But the sushi is really, really poor. On top of that we couldn't even order it. If you choose the sit down service it comes as a variety sampler. None of it can be reordered, and the sashimi and nigiri on the menu just aren't available for some reason. This would be something you could overlook except that it was their best restaurant. And somehow still closed 2 days out of the 5 we were there. Mike's coffee shop is great and has a pretty good barrista. The bars are understaffed though. The pool itself is great, as is the deck, and the beach is perfect. The shockingly awful problem here is that guests tend to \"reserve\" lounges at 6-7am with property or pool towels and not return for most of the day, and the hotel management does nothing to dissuade them. So at 10am, good luck finding anything at all with even some shade. I managed to find one lone lounge in the shade and while pulling another over to join it, had someone claim that since the one next to the original was his wife's, so was the empty one. They put towels and personal affects on it and didn't come back for SIX hours. This was never the case at Secrets. The jacuzzi is part of the spa, and is available for all, but only until 6:30 and has no shade whatsoever. 85F outside, 105 in the jacuzzi? Sounds appealing right? Next door, it's available all day and night and tucked up against the south side of the beach-side restaurant. I was happy to see that H10 has taken this over and made it adults only. Our room at Secrets overlooked the property, and every morning last year the sound of kids running about was unwelcome when trying to leave the world behind. The events put on by the staff every night are fun, and the staff is very passionate about the place, but it seems horribly managed. We had no notice until the day of, what activities were offered, so those were typically missed because we found out too late. You can't get people to participate if they don't know. And you can't shut down half of your restaurants every night and keep a resort full of people happy if they're waiting a full hour for a poorly executed meal. Until I read here that these problems are fixed, I'm not going back. Here or another H10. Oh, as an aside, very European crowd. We didn't meet another couple from the U.S. while there.

My girlfriend and I traveled here for my 30th birthday the end of May 2011 into the beginning of June. When we first pulled up to the hotel lobby we were greeted by the bell boy who took our bags aside while we checked in. Check in was speedy and two fresh made drinks were brought to us immediately. Neither one of us could get over how amazing the inside of the lobby was. Fountains, sculptures, and other decor that was top notch!!! It looked as if it was right out of a 5 star hotel in a movie. We couldn't believe our eyes... I've been to many upscale hotels around Boston, New York, Miami, Napa Valley, Killarney and Dublin Ireland and this one was in its own class. Albeit not really a hotel, the lobby could be compared in that category. Once you exit the lobby you walk by a long infinity edge fountain that is in a courtyard type setting. It is flanked by restaurants and tables and chairs on either side with a set of steps leading down toward the pathways to the \"villas\" at the end. In between the sets of steps is this gigantic and beautiful set of ponds and waterfalls. It appears as if it is used for weddings and or photo shoots. Very relaxing just to sit and listen to the water and amient music playing around it. Room We arrived at our room and immediately noticed the decor, a mix of modern and what appeared to be traditional Mexican art. Very well staged. The fridge was stocked with beer and soda. The patio had a table and chairs on it. The shower did leak out of the bottom like other people have commented on. Not a big deal, I'm not there to shower all day long. The bathroom sink was a vessel sink which was very modern and easy on the eyes. Overall I wish my master suite at home had some of these amenities. Again, very well thought out, the use of marble tile, glass, and simplistic lines and colors make it very appealing to the senses. The AC was great. The bed was so so. It was a hard bed but I never once complained of my back hurting. We had an upstairs unit so noise was not an issue. We were somewhere in the middle of the ocean maya campus between the beach and the lobby. This actually made sense from a traveling perspective as we never had a long walk to either the pool/beach or the restaurants. Sure the beach was nice to look at but I didn't miss looking at it. If you want to stare at the beach, take a walk there and stare at it. No one is stopping you. The villas aren't tall enough to get that WOW factor of the view of the ocean like a high rise on the beach. Pool/Beach My two favorite places. Before I left I bought my girlfriend and I Bubba Kegs at Wal-Mart. If you don't know what they are google it. I would give it to Javier or Eber at the pool bar and ask for Bacardi and diet coke \"muy fuerte\" which means very strong! Honestly, I like good alcohol and we didn't do the privileged upgrade. The only thing I was missing out on was some JW Black label, and a couple of other high end scotches. I didn't see any Grey Goose like someone else said they saw. Who cares, absolute, Bacardi, Sky, Smirnoff, Sauza Hornitos, and all the other \"premium\" liquors were available. Just not the \"ultra premium\". Ok back to the pool and beach, I got sidetracked. The pool bar was great, I wish there were more seats at it and sometimes it was a little hard for Eber and Javier to know if you were down there, just give a friendly shout up to them. No problem. The pool was nice, the half submerged loungers in one end of the pool bar pool were neat. They have massagers that come on during 30min rotations with the Jacuzzi pump. You'll understand when you see it. The non-pool bar pool was more for relaxing. The beach was awesome. There was service no matter where you sat. The privileged area was no big woop. In fact the whole privilege thing was no big whoop. We never had to make a reservation, wait for a table or the hibachi at the Japanese restaurant. Back to the beach. I was slightly disappointed when I thought I could take the hobie cat out for free as part of the all inclusive. They guy wanted $30 for a one time training fee. I thought this should've been included. I skipped it cause the gf didn't see herself out there for whatever reason. She planted herself under a palapa for most of the days and it was very relaxing when I was under it as well. We never had trouble finding a place to sit on the beach or the pool. Some of the chairs were busted but we just didn't sit in those, obviously. OKAY here's what you should know about the beach, it's a SECRET so don't tell. If you walk towards the ocean and then left down the beach, about 15min later you come to this cold water lagoon that kicks butt!! It's filled with fish and sea life. It's blue and green and fast moving out to the ocean. Once you see the red/brown foot bridge your there. I think it was by Tres rios or a little past it, don't quote me. This was the most scenic place I saw in the Riviera Maya. It's breathtaking, words cannot describe it. There are these dead trees sticking up on the shore line that make for nice photos. You'll see, I promise. Back to the resort beach. There was crud in the water, I know they try hard to keep the seaweed out of it but it\u2019s an ongoing job 24/7. The boardwalk is actually a nice touch, it breaks up the horizon line with a place to stand and admire the beautiful paradise you are currently finding yourself immersed in. Water was warm, drinks were cold, sun was hot, palm trees were swaying, and the vibe was spot on at this beach. The pool was really warm, pool bar was a place to meet people both in and out of the water, and the activity crew worked hard to include everyone. Food Food at the buffet was decent. You have to get creative to find something you'll like. I was on a diet before I went so I stuck to mashed avocado and made a salad with lettuce and some tomatoes. It was very fresh and kept me going. There was lots of fruits, and Mexican dishes like taquitos and chips and salsa. I don't remember everything but I'd give it a solid C+/B-. the restaurants were decent. The Japanese place was lots of fun, food was good too B+/A-. We met a couple there that we still keep in touch with and hung out for the rest of our trip with. The Italian place let me down on one dish they said they would have the first night we were there and neglected to have the rest of our entire trip. Oh well. The food there was good too, B+/A-. Never got to the Mexican place so I can't judge. Coffee place was nice, they had desserts and espresso which was nice after dinner. Charros was more like fast food and fried food. Never ate there, can't comment. It was right next to the pool. Overall experience It was our first time to Mexico. This place impressed the heck out of me. Being an all adults place, I don't think I will ever go anywhere else where kids are allowed when I travel to the Riviera Maya. We met lots of people on their honeymoons and anniversaries. Everyone you talk to who's visiting is enthralled with the place. And to that end so were we. My hat goes off to the staff and their warm hospitality and \"hola's\" everywhere you go. These people are genuine as it gets. If you didn't like this place you've failed at life already. One last note I'm writing this review because I just booked another trip back here yesterday for next week to celebrate our one year anniversary. Short notice I know, but after doing research of other resorts, my girlfriend and I couldn't find anything to outclass this place. I need to give this place the propper review it deserved several months ago when I should've done it.

The hotel must be the cleanest we have ever been in, from the foyer, the grounds, the pool and our room which was cleaned every day. The management and staff were some of the friendliest we have encountered and nothing was too much trouble. The beds in our room two doubles were superb, excellent air conditioning and shower.

Thank you for your excellent service with a smile. We have just two comments to make; change the music now and again. Mexico is famous for its guitars yet all we heard a meal times was background funeral music; Also when taking people to their table in the buffet restaurant please walk round the outside and not through the centre where people are walking with food.

I fully agree with all the good reviews about this hotel. Rooms very nice, Grounds fantastic, food and drink very good, Staff could not be better. Special thanks to the Thomson rep Noe (aka danny devito) he was very helpful. All i would say in warning to anyone looking for a quiet time this is probably not the hotel for you. The hotel has two swimming pools. 1. the small pool with the swim up bar where the majority of the activities take place. The loud rap music starts at 10am and goes on until the bar closes at 7pm, by which time the noise level is increased by the addition of the alcohol fuelled guests (ususaly American) who seem unable to have a conversation without shouting at each other even when the music is not playing. 2. The large pool is supposed to be the quiet poll but unforntunately this is only 10feet from the small pool and there is no escaping the the rap music. In addition this pool also has a speaker system which plays different music to its small relation and only suceeds in increasing the noise level. In my opinion this hotel is bordering on the club 18 - 30 type, so if you like that type of thing then it is probably the perfect place to go. If you want some peace and quiet I suggest you look somewhere else.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lanarkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat but not Excellent\u201d", "Author": "cjdLanarkshire", "ReviewID": "UR118946172", "Content": "On arrival at the hotel we were wowed by the fantastic grounds and lobby entrance, it looked amazing. The staff are all fantastic especially Alberto, Viscente and the lovely Acuzena at the privilege section of the beach. To begin with we were upgraded to privilege guest system which meant we were put in privilege accomodation block which was near the kitchen and could be very noisy. Louis Castillo was fantastic and helped secure a move to the honeymoon suite which had a jaccuzzi on the terrace for which we were very grateful. The only complaints we had was that there was a lot of building work being carried out on the privilege section of the beach which did curtail or relaxation somewhat, the food in the buffet was often cold if you did not manage to get there when it was being placed on the counter, however the staff were always willing to bring hot food if you requested it. My personal opinion is that the hotel should ditch the privilige system it does create a two tier system and some people we spoke to said they felt like \"peasants\" as they were not in the privilege system. The staff also fail to recognise the privilege bands and you need to request the air conditioned areas in the restaurants and the premium drinks. If I was to return to this hotel I would definately not pay the $700 extra to upgrade to privilege for 2 weeks. I do not believe it is good value for money and would not reccommend it. There was a welsh couple there with us who actually requested and got their money back. All in all the staff were fantastic including young Felix and all the animation team, however Alberto our waiter at breakfast and lunch was fantastic as was Acuzena on the privilege section on the beach nothing was too much trouble for her. The manager of the hotel should be very proud of all his staff. Unfortunately he has a very male chauvanistic attitude towards female guests which left a very bad taste in my mouth. A word of warning to guests heading out this month, building work has started on the beach spa and Italian restaurant near the beach and may be noisy with the demolition of the old building and sounds of heavy machinery being heard during the construction of the the new one. Overall had a great holiday and met some wonderful people with whom we hope to meet again. Hotel is in need of air conditioning in public areas as it is very humid, apart from needing new sun beds on the beach and the pool area smartened up its a good value for money hotel.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStaff make this place GREAT!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "L W", "ReviewID": "UR118901548", "Content": "Well, I just returned from the Ocean Maya 2 days ago and I have not had one bad thing to say about it. I was hesitant at first to book our trip b/c I had seen some very mixed reviews. Couldn't be happier that we chose to stay at this resort. It is a smaller resort so everything is close. Buffets are close, pool is close, beach is close. It is not your typical 15 minute walk to go and grab breakfast in the morning. The resort wasn't full when we went, so that made our trip enjoyable as well. It is an adult only resort, so if you have a problem with women being on the beach topless....then you should probably stay somewhere else. We went with a 22 year old, a 31 year old, and a 55 year old.......and we all enjoyed ourselves. We all found things about the resort that we loved. I do not enjoy spending my time in the pool when I go to a place with such a stunnign beach, but others that I went with were in the pool non-stop. The pools are very clean and the temp is awesome. They have activities in the pool every day. Aquasize, water polo, tequila volleyball. The activities that the staff put on are a lot of fun. Polo, Ricardo, Jess, and Omar are fabulous!!!! They are bound to make your trip extremely enjoyable. Always have a smile on their faces and always making it fun for everyone. The swim-up bar is a hot spot and the bartenders are great. javier made our time there so much fun. Again...always smiling. The beach is fabulous. Clean, well maintained and the water is crystal clear here. Nice sandy bottom that you walk out on forever. There are fish that swim up to you while in the water and they are amazing. I am a beach lover and this beach for me...was top notch. It is fairly large for how small the resort is and if you upgrade to priviledged (we did), you can have your very own cabana for the day on the beach. Food was good. I am a failry picky eater and I always found something to eat. The buffets have a wide variety of food and it is always warm and fresh. You can always have fresj meat cooked for you, stir fry's, omelettes in teh morning, eggs.....the sky is the limit. Rooms are fine. Nothing spectacular, but very nice and clean. We had to switch rooms b/c our air conditioner did not work.......but this was no problem at all and they were very apologetic. The grounds are immaculate as well. Anytime of the day you can see someone cleaning, gardening, wiping, etc. They take great pride in the place. The spa was nice. We had a pedicure and massage...both were great. A little pricey, but worth the relaxation. There is wildlife around the grounds as well. Monkeys, iguanas, and coaties (super cute). Entertainment at night was always really good. Something different every evening. We really enjoyed the shows. We were never approached by anyone to buy into timeshares or anything silly like that so I am not sure where those reviews were coming from. All in all, we loved it here and had a fabulous time. I think sometimes people just have one thing set them off and then get into a rut and view everything as bad. Some people are too picky for their own good.

On arrival we was greeted by staff with a welcome drink. Check- in took less than 10 minutes and we were at the back of the queue. The porters did take quite a while to bring our suitcases but maybe it just felt like ages because we wanted to get to the beach as soon as possible. I could not fault the room..It was spotless! Our fridge was refilled everyday and the maid done a brilliant job of cleaning our room. The pool was lovely we tended to stay round the quieter pool however you do have to get up early if you want sunbeds with an umbrella as they are limited. The food was good except like most all inclusive some of the buffet was cold however they you can have items cooked for you which we opted for or just get there early. The A la carte restaurants were lovely especially as you do not need to book. By the end of the two weeks i did feel the food was getting a bit samey however i don't know what else they could have provided maybe it was just because i ate so much and had tried basically everything. We went to the spa for a couples massage (it was really good) however probably best to book when you arrive as you are given a 30 percent off voucher. I also had my haircut which i was really impressed with and we used the jacuzzi and steam rooms. My boyfriend used the gym on quite a few occassions and said it was really good. I couldnt fault the hotel at all and the staff were so friendly the only issue i had was the rudeness of some of the tourists. I hardly heard any please or thank you's and felt really sorry for the staff. All in all i loved the hotel, except it is quite a way from cancun and a 15 min taxi from playa del carmen. One day we decided to get the local buses to cancun, it was definately an experience i wont forget. The bus stopped right outside the hotel and we got onto this cramped minibus which was carrying the local mexicans to work and then when we had to change buses to get onto the bus for the hotel zone the locals could not help enough despite the fact we could not speak a word of spainish they showed us where to go and told us which bus to get. It only cost about \u00a35 for the two of us to get to cancun and a cab charges at least \u00a325. I would recommend swimming with dolphins however book this direct with dolphin discovery as it is much cheaper and you still get transport and lunch depending on the programme you pick.

The food was great and plenty of it we were not to keen on the mexican restaurant but everyone's taste is different, the oriental and italian were very good, limited menu choice but very good food none the less. Don't bother taking the bus into playa del carmen unles you want to be hasseled by shop keepers (worse than egypt) go in to cancun well just outside cancun, bubba gummps, o'briens plus many more, much better. Usually we don't bother going to the rep meetings the next day but this one is well worth it and quite entertaining. When you arrive at the airport, be prepared for a lengthy delay to get to your transfere bus, nearly 2 hours it took us getting thru immigration, collect our bags then all bags are xray'd before you leave for your hotel, also there is a charge when you come to leave mexico of \u00a340 or $60 each airport tax... The one point I can say which is not so good in our oppinon is that we enjoy a walk into towns and shopping areas bars etc when we go on holiday but this hotel is quite isolated and doesn't allow you that freedom unless you take a bus or cab. Take a small umbrella it does rain and some times in the evening especialy when your dressed for dinner, the wife was caught out and didn't half make a mess of her hair lol Don't bother upgrading to privelage people we spoke to said it is not worth the $25 each per day.

Prior to booking this hotel we read both negative and postive reviews on trip advisor and having stayed here for the last 2 weeks (8/9/11 - 22/9/11) I am amazed that people have negative points to say about this hotel. Upon arrival we were met with a very warm reception and given a welcome drink (Island Cooler), had a very quick check in and escorted to our room with our bags very swiftly. The room was very clean and comfortable with a huge bed and kept immaculate by the hotel staff each morning. There is a mini fridge in the room which is restocked daily and is part of the all inclusive package. There are 4 restaurants to choose from (mexican, italian, japanese and buffet) we liked all 4 restaurants always found something to eat and each had something special to show you such as the mayan coffee in the mexican and the japanese show table. Regardless of where we went the food was always excellent. Privilege upgrade - not required as in our opinion not value for money. The beach is fantastic and there are plenty of parasols on the beach in the mornings for you to laze around on all day although we did put towels down each morning but most people were doing this anyway. The beach boys work tirelessly keeping the beach immaculate for every guest to enjoy. The best part about this hotel is the staff each and everyone of them are fantastic people who greeted you with a smile and \"hola\" all the time. They pride themselves on making your experience in the hotel an enjoyable and friendly one and nothing is too much trouble. The entertainment staff (Omar, Jes, Amy, Nelly and Fernanda) are fantastic and really try and get you involved in the activities but dont push you into them either. The night -time entertainement is put on by the entertainment staff who work incredibly hard organising each show and i throughly enjoyed the Grease night! We only went on 1 trip to Xel ha as we have done everything before on our 1st holiday to Mexico. The trip was well organised and we were taken care of throughout the trip (booked through Thomson rep - Noe AKA Danny Divito who is absolutely fantastic!) The hotel also has a photography centre and you can book a photo shoot which we took full advantage of. Our photo shoot was with Evann who is very talented and we had ours at Sunrise which was amazing and so worth getting up at 05am for. We would like to thank the staff at the Ocean maya royale for making our holiday a truely memorable one!", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hereford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Paradise Ignore Bad Reviews\u201d", "Author": "Trudi H", "ReviewID": "UR118464350", "Content": "Before leaving to Cancun my Boyfreind and I had very mixed reviews about going to Mexico during so called 'Hurricane Season' and to this resort after reading some of the harsh reviews people had left! I found that I constantly checked the weather forecast as it said rain rain and thunderstorms on a daily basis, however most of the rain that we did experience was throughout the night and a few down pours on the beach apart from that I wish we stocked up on Factor 30 as we had to buy some out there as it was soo hot! My first impression of the resort itself on arrival was 'wow' I dont know what people expected but the people and service at this resort were nothing but freindly! The open lobby was amazing and a great atmosphere to go with it. We were greeted with a cold drink and directed to our rooms which again the first impression was great! Although during our first week we had some problems with our rooms so had to move twice this was sorted but we felt there was some lack of communication and that we could have been compensated for this but we didnt want to let that ruin our holiday! :o) I also had mixed reviews about the beach and what to expect lets just say that you dont get white sand like that in many places and although some rainy nights washed up a bit of seaweed the BeachBoy worked Very Hard to clean this up! We watched him daily and couldnt believe how hard he worked! Also 200 yards to the right of the beach there is a lovely place to swim and the fish just swim up to you (as people feed them).I wish we had walked up to the left of the beach past the sand bags as people said there was a lagoon that way. Anyway the staff at this resort could not do anymore for us thank you to Fernadas in the main restaurant who was there breakfast and lunch time- always smiling and doing his best to go out of his way to make us comfortable :o).. we did not need to lift many fingers on our relaxing holiday as the service was amazing from waitress service on the beach, to making sure we had clean towels, i even tried to help myself to my own drink in the main restaurant whoops and I was told that they would bring in to me and to sit back down, thank you to the great Chefs who cook in front of you one Chef even brought my boyfriends steak to him and cooked him a few extras as he had to wait for some more to come out. Thank you to Oskar for looking after us during independance night, ( the tequillas were not so great-ha)! The best thing about travelling to Mexico were the many excursions you can go on so many to choose from, would recommend the FatCat for snorkelling and a great guide too, the dolphin discovery and manatees and shark was a great experience, also meeting such nice people on the trip to Coba made it worth while, the pick up point was also great buses were always on time and guides very helpful which didnt make it a chore to tip. Lastly thank you very much to Danny! (Noel) our rep your welcoming meeting was fantastico! and it was a pleasure coming to see you to chat and book our trips to also learn about your family and your love of parting (famous in birmingham ;o) ) food, and watching fighting! ;o) also the freindly people that we met on the beach! We will certainly be heading back to Mexico one day and I wish it was tomorrow!!

A special mention goes to the entertainment team, Polo, Amy, Nelly, Fernanda, Riccardo, Jess, Omar and Miguel ! They worked so hard day in day out whether it be to get people involved in daytime activities or to get to know people in general and make them feel comfortable with getting involved. Always on the go an of an evening always produced a great show. Could not fault any of them in the slightest and I thank them all for making it such a tremendous holiday. Another special mention goes to Luiz Castillo, who was always very helpful to us, he organised for us to go to Coco Bongo's at very short notice an be a gold member. If i knew everybodys name at the hotel I would give them all a mention because every single one of them deserve it from the bell boys to the bar staff to the cleaners to the entertainment staff they always had a smile on their faces and made it such a special holiday. The A La Carte restaurants were beautiful, especially the japanese an no need to reserve unless to do the Tapin Yaki (unsure about spelling) Will definitely be travelling to this hotel very very soon again, holiday blues big time. One thing I would give advice to people travelling to the Ocean Maya Royale is that their is no need to upgrade to be a premium guest, its not real value for money because at the end of the day alls you really get more is the balinese beds, a seperated section of the restaurants and a selection of other drinks. Dont get me wrong the balinese beds look nice but their is so much going on round the pools throughout the day that you'll end up round there. But saying that, that doesn't take anything away from the hotel had an absolute scream, and would like to thank everyone that made it so enjoyable !

We spent the Thanksgiving holiday through December 2010 in the Riviera Maya. We got through the airport in Cancun pretty fast. Our Lomis Representative met us at the curb. We had to wait for quite a while to load into the van though. As we drove from the Cancun Airport to the resort, we saw police with guns pointing at our van as we drove past. We were told that there was a world conference in Cancun so security was tight and present. It was intimidating to say the least. We stayed at the Ocean Maya Royale, an H10 hotel. We booked the all-inclusive trip through our travel agent - the vacation was a \"Funjet\" vacation. When we arrived at the hotel it took a while before we could get our room. While we waited, the hotel staff gave us a delicious, tropical drink to enjoy. The trip started out good, but we ended up very disappointed. Funjet's representative was Lomis Travel. The Lomis Representative who drove us to the hotel was polite, engaging and very nice. Unfortunately, he was only dropping us off at our hotel. We had a different Lomas Representative at the hotel who we didn't find to be helpful. We had no orientation to the hotel or to sight seeing activities. We had to find out on our own what activites and amenities were available. We found that there was a language barrier - we do not speak Spanish and it seemed that most of the people at the resort only understood bits of English. Although the hotel grounds were very nice, I found the hotel staff to be less than accommodating. Some of the problems we encountered were no beverages in our refrigerators (other than 2 bottles of water) - I asked the hotel to be sure we had at least 6 bottles a day because that was the only thing I could drink (I do not drink liquor) - it took them a couple days for us to get the water, but we finally did. The water falls outside of the hotel lobby was dry, I guess it was under construction. Service was less than desireable in the restaurants. We sat for 2 hours in the Italian restaurant before our dinner was served. I do recommend the Japanese Restaurant - the food was very good and our waiter put on quite a show as he cooked our food for us. It was the highlight of our eating experience. Highly recommend the Japanese Restaurant. The buffet had the same food, which gets boring after a week of eating it. I do recommend the chips & salsa and guacamole - delicious! I would make nachos for lunch each day - it was the only thing I ate fromt he buffet. The drinks were very good. All the drinks were refreshing and the bartenders were generous with the liquor. The entertainment was good. It seems that all the hotel workers do it all. We saw our waiter in the show - he was one of the dancers. We saw one of the dancers at the breakfast buffet the next morning helping to clear tables. Some workers were great. We had one waiter who was very social and liked talking with us and hearing about Chicago. He said he had an uncle in Chicago and was saving his money to move to Chicago. Our room was okay - nothing plush, just a place to sleep. We had a constant water leak by the bathroom sink. The floor in the bathroom was always wet - we had to place towels on the floor to absorb the water. We called building management and they sent a repair person out twice to fix it, but it was never resolved. One thing you want to watch out for is wristband discrimination. Before we travel, I always read the TripAdvisor forum and there were many posts about wrist bands, but my travel agent told me that there shouldn't be anything to worry about. We received white wristbands at the hotel that gave us access to the resort, drinks and restaurants. However, we did feel discriminated against because we did not have a black wristband. The guests wearing the black wristbands had preferred service. In fact, there was a segregated area on the beach at the hotel that was roped off so that only people wearing black wristbands could sit there - in beautiful lounge chairs with canopies. We could not sit there because of our white wristbands. We friended some Canadians who were wearing the black wristbands and they said they didn't know of white bands - and they paid less money for their trip than we did, as did some French people that we met who also had the black wristbands. Obviously, the TripAdvisor comments were correct. We took a couple trips which were awesome. We went to Tulum. I highly recommend Tulumn - it is an amazing historical place to visit. It was very hot, so make sure you dress for the heat and bring a swim suit - there is a beautiful beach that you can enjoy. Lomis Travel arranged our trip and didn't tell us about the beach, so we weren't able to swim in the water. The ancient ruins are beautiful - if you like history, you will love Tulum. We took an Outback ATV and Cenotes trip and visited a Mayan Village. The trip was wonderful until the end when my son had a very bad ATV accident and ended up in a hospital in Playa del Carmen. He suffered a concussion, hematoma, neck/back strain and deep tissue bruises to his hip (of course, cuts, abrasions and bruises). Please be very careful when you take these tours. The tour driver was unable to help us. There was no medical services provided, no ambulance, no precautions whatsoever out in that jungle - we never felt so helpless. We had to bring our son back to the hotel and call a doctor to come to the hotel. The doctor then called for an ambulance who took him to the hospital. Please note that drivers do not move to the right side of the road in Mexico for emergency vehicles. And, ambulance drivers stop for all red lights. It felt as though it took forever to get to the hospital. We were so happy to return home. Our family had some good times and enjoyed parts of our vacation, but we've decided that we will stay away from Mexico in the future. It was our first visit and our last.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort for the Money!\u201d", "Author": "supergirlteacher", "ReviewID": "UR118206991", "Content": "Stayed at the Ocean Maya last March Break (sorry a little slow on the review!) and had a BLAST!!

For such a long flight you didnt really get that much without paying for it, so just be aware take plenty of drinks and snacks on-board with you otherwise you will be penny-less. The hotel was absolutely brilliant, the service was magnificent and we both felt pampered and looked after for the whole holiday. The cocktail on check in was very welcome especially when wearing hot sticky UK clothes. The hotel gardens are exquisite and was comparable to walking through a zoo with lizards, butterfly's and birds every where! The villas and suites were amazing, a good size, Huge bed, Amazing air conditioning and constantly topped up free mini bar...very good! The only issue was the shower which kept flooding onto the floor and needed mopping up after every shower. The restaurants were of a very high standard, the mexican restaurant was our favourite due to the quality of food, the service and the AMAZING Banana margaritas they bring you! The buffet had a huge selection of foods from all over the world and was plentiful! The Oriental restaurant was good, but a bit confusing as there was a set menu of Sushi and Chinese mains. The Italian was average food was ok but not brilliant! Enough said about that one. The breakfast buffet again was plentiful and the freshly made omelettes are very tasty! The hotel also gave us a free romantic meal and breakfast in bed and a bottle of wine as we were on our Honeymoon which topped off the holiday! The pools and beach are beautiful and if your an early bird you can go for a swim in the sea on your own if your there about 6 am ish. The thatched parasols on the beach and coconut palms are simply idyllic and swinging away in the hammocks with a Mojito is pure bliss! The pool bar staff are brilliant and work so hard, the waiters who bring you drinks are great and do a wonderful job! The range of cocktails is HUGE and we worked through the 25 on the menu, plus a few of their own concoctions too! Also we found out you can hand feed fish in the sea with seaweed which was a brilliant experience and if you walk left on the beach for about 10 minutes there is a very beautiful lagoon which is cold water and surrounded by mangrove. It is certainly worth checking out and you can get good pictures of pelicans sitting on mangrove stumps! The evening entertainment was OK, quite chilled and finished early but if want a relaxing, chilled holiday then it is fine! A few cockneys were moaning about the lack of night life in the hotel but they didnt seem keen on the art of conversation which was really interesting meeting people from all over the world and chatting!

My review is going to be very long because I am going to be very detailed about my entire experience so bear with me. I read all the reviews before picking this place, some good, some bad but I went any way because I wanted to experience it for myself. Boy, I should have listened to the reviewers. First of all, let me warn you that Cancun is very, very hot and if you are not use to hot weather beware. I'm from the Midwest and was not use to the heat. It's because they are closer to the equator so the heat is there. As soon as you make it through customs, timeshare ppl at the airport are trying to get you but keep walking until you make it outside to see your shuttle service. Upon arriving at the resort no one greeted us to get our bags, nor did we receive a warm towel (like at the other resorts the shuttle dropped other guests at), nor did we receive a welcome drink. We arrived around 1pm so we couldn't check into our room. They have a writstband system which sucks to me, colors: white-basic, orange-apple vacations or other vacation sevice and blue-privilege. I dont want to ever vacation again at a place that put ppl in different catergories. I dont like to be treated differently because of my wristband. The lobby is very hot no air conditioning. So we walked the grounds and ate at the buffet until we were able to check into our room. The grounds were very beautiful you can tell they take pride in keeping the place looking great. Our room was very nice, very clean and the air worked perfectly. My husband tried to sit in the chair and almost fell because it was broken. The TV stations are in Spanish and they have a few English channels. But I was able to watch a football game and the MTV award while we were there. Food: there are 3 resturants and 1 buffet. the Japanese was the best by far. If you have the privilege band you can make reservations for all the resturants if you dont, you have to try and get a reservation. The Italian was just ok tons of food. You would think being in Mexico you will receive true Mexican food oh no, the Mexican resturant has Tex Mex food but they have the friendliest ppl working there Ingrid, Alberto and Eduardo were all great and made sure we were always well taken care of. The buffet was so freaking hot that you could not really enjoy your food. They did have plenty of food to chose from for breakfast lunch and dinner. pools: There are 2 pools on the resort. You have to get up pretty early to put your towels out to make sure you have a spot. Swim up bar was always rocking. Javier was the best bartender there. If you go, ask for the Javier special or the ticket to fly. oh my, ticket to fly is my new drink. I saw the entertainment staff I think after our 4th day there. I didnt even know they had an entertainment staff. I believe they need to work harder at getting ppl involved in activities. The pool closer to the Mexican resturant is very quiet and laid back. They do have a section roped off for the PRIVILEGE guest. The spa ppl are very pushy, no means no stop harassing ppl while they are on vacation. There was no photography on grounds but then I was told you had to make an appointment for them to take your pictures WHAT?? drinks: if you have the PRIVILEGE band you can get top shelf like sky blue, grey goose etc.. all others get house brand. I really didn't care just make me something that's going to get me drunk. The night before my anniversary, they were working on the roof of the Mexican resturant all night until the next day. My husband and I didnt get any sleep because of all the banging. I called the front desk and was told other ppl have called in and complained about the noise. Went to the front desk and spoke to the manager Fabio Tesser about the noise we experience. He rewarded us with a PRIVILEGE band wow!! I also had to sign a waiver that I wouldn't sue them in the future!!! Our anniversary dinner was very romantic, it was held pool side by the Mexican resturant. The food was not enough so we had to end up ordering an entree off the menu. We were well taken care of by Ingrid and Alberto. The banana margarita was to die for. I did not have any telephone service while there. So I had to purchase a phone card from the lobby gift shop. I went there 4 times and was told each time they didnt have any. I was started to get fustrated because I needed to contact my kids. So I was speaking to some other ppl on the resort, I had one of the ladies go into the shop and asked for a calling card and she was told they had them. I had just left out of the shop asking for the same card. I went back in and asked for the card again and was told oh yeah we have them. I went directly to the front desk and spoke to Dulce who stated maybe she didnt understand what I asking for. I went off and stated she knew exactly what I wanted maybe she just didnt want to sell ime one because of my color. I did experience racism there and did not like it. We did do the shuttle to Playa De Carmen which is a 5 hour tour. They were trying to sell us everything from legal to illegal items, go figure. I believe the tour is a little too long. It can be done within 3 hours. Every night was a different themed night. I meet some great and friendly ppl. It rained 4 out of the 8 days we were there. We could not do any beach activities because the water was bad the entire time we were there which means there were red flags on the pools. Would I return to this resort? The answer is no and I do not recommend this place to anyone. They need to work on so many things I will not list them all.

Anyway... the real reason I am writing this is because of the after the vacation customer service we received with regards to the hotel chains H10 Club points. We stayed in the hotel with two other couples the first week of March 2011. For ever stay you gain points on their H10 Club cards. Well, at least you are suppose to, that is if the hotel does it's job and sends in your membership number for your stay!!!! Now that we are thinking about re-booking our two vacations a year with the same hotel, I have been notified that my points were not sent in, and no one from the hotel chain can do anything about it as it is their policy that your points have to be sent in within three months of your stay. Something the hotel didn't do. So the customer loses in the end. Great customer service on the part of the hotel and the chain.

Shower was amazing, and very big. Beach: Very clean water and sand. We always could find a hut at different times of the day. Pool: Lovely, 2 seperate pools, both were nice. The pool with the swim up bar had seats that had jets, they were AWESOME!! There was almost always someone at the swimup bar to serve us drinks. Restaurants: Very very very good food. Something good all the time. The breakfast at the buffet was always good. Loved having them make omlets to our liking. Japanese show was great, very exciting and cook was very nice. Mexician restaurant also very delicious! The wildlife animals were very cute. Javier was always very helpful by the swimup bar area.

Out of the three places we have stayed, it was 2/3. It was not great, but it wasn't terrible either. I would like to say, that if you are going with a comparatively inexpensive all inclusive resort, you should keep that in mind! It is not going to be fine, gourmet food or lavish accomodations! So, I am strictly comparing it to similar all inclusive resorts. First off all, I definitely recommend the upgrade. The exclusive beach area has personalized service, great chairs, and american beer in cans! You also get to sit in the ONLY air conditioned areas of the restaurants, which you really come to appreciate. Other than that, not much benefit as far as we could tell. You can order expensive brands of liquor, but we saw others doing so as well, and it seemed to be working! What I did NOT like was that even with the upgrade, you were only allowed 2 cans of beer (Montego) in your room refrigerator per day. Extra cans are available for $3 each!!! That is ridiculous! Another reason why I liked the cans at the priviledge beach area... You also have to pay extra for the \"romantic dinner\" ($50-$90 per person). Other resorts include this free of charge with the upgrade. Note... You only get 2 bottles of water, 2 cokes, and 2 sprites as well. Extras are charged to your room! The rooms were always \"damp', but were very cool. The only complaint about the room was the bed. There is no box springs and the mattress was very thin and hard. Otherwise, it was clean and comfortable. As others have said, there is a lot of seaweed in the ocean. Still, the beach was decent and nice for sun bathing or taking a stroll. If you don't mind the seaweed, the water is great. The pool areas are very nice, but not enough chairs. People have them all spoken for by 9am! The worst part was the food. Again, I do not expect gourmet at a reasonably priced all inclusive resort. The specialty restaurants were good (Italian and Japanese) but the buffets were not appealing to us at all. There is a large selection at all the buffets and you shouldn't starve by any means, but the food is sub standard. Mike's Coffee Shop in the evenings is very good though! The best part was the staff and the drinks. Javier the pool bartender was fabulous. There was also a guy who worked at Mike's Coffee Shop at night who was totally awesome! I regret that I didn't remember his name. The beer tastes better than other resorts we have visited, although I'd say it is still about 50% the alcohol of the beer I drink at home. The mixed drinks do not appear to be watered down, but I am generally only a beer drinker so I am not sure. The shows at night are similar to other resorts and fun to watch. Most of the staff are very friendly. The only one who was not was our \"concierge\", when I declined the breakfast meeting where they try to sell you membership! He became bvery defensive and rude when we would not agree to attend. Others told us it was a 3+ hour presentation!!! NO THANKS!!! Overall, we had a good time, but we would not return to this resort. There are better places for the same price.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic hotel and a brilliant holiday\u201d", "Author": "Patrick T", "ReviewID": "UR117829852", "Content": "We stayed at the Ocean Maya in August 2011 and had a fantastic time. The resort is set in fantastic gardens with exotic plants and manicured lawns. The accommodation was low-rise and discreetly built so as to avoid the stereotypical hotel block and this made the site enormously attractive. In the gardens there was a wide range of wildlife from tejons to iguana, a range of birds to see and excellent views into the sea to spot a myriad of fish and ray. The rooms were large, well furnished and air-conditioned with servicing daily. Water was proved as were a range of free drinks in the mini-bar. The beach and pool areas were excellent and kept clean by a team of good humoured staff who took time out to teach us a few Mayan words and the bar service at the pool was first class especially Ivonne, Azucena (thank you ladies) and the barman Eber but not forgetting Maricena - the lady of the towels and books who excellent good humour was fantastic. the food at the resort was excellent too with a wide range to suit all tastes from Mexican to Italian, Japanese to European - the waiters were all great! at the bar at reception i can only say a massive thank you to Imelda, Shaday and Marbella who kept us stocked up in cocktails especially mojitos! - the staff throughout the hotel wore tireless and invariably friendly and pleasant. we had a great time at this resort - this part of Mexico is not for everyone because it was very hot and humid but if you don't mind that this is the place to relax and enjoy yourself - we recommend it unreservedly!", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe everything that you read!!\u201d", "Author": "Shelley B", "ReviewID": "UR117597295", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in August. Before travelling to Mexico we read the reviews and couldn't believe the difference when we arrived. We had a fantastic time and would definately return without a doubt. The hotel is set on beautiful grounds with staff working non-stop to ensure that it is always looking its best. The local animals that you see wandering around add to the delight of the hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean and offer everything that you would expect in a hotel room. Yes the shower leaks a little but its not a big deal as other reviews had suggested. The air conditioning is a welcomed relief as well as the restocked fridge. The hotel has 4 restaurants and our favourite was the Mexican. We tried all of the others and althought the buffet was good we were fed up of the food by the end of the second week. Breakfast was always good and the service in all of the restaurants was excellent. The staff at the hotel are always smiling and helpful whether they are waiters, cleaners or maintenance. They go out of thier way to say hello and smile. The pool and beach areas are excellent. Staff work hard to keep it clean and tidy. Some of the sun beds could do with being replaced but as long as you are at the pool/beach early enough you can easily find a decent one. The privelage area does seem a bit pointless as you are far from the pool and can't access the sea easily but you do get a personal waiter and the lovely double sunbeds. Overall we had a fantastic time. The entertainment staff are friendly and enthusiastic working through the day providing activities such as water polo, beach volleyball and a walking tour to the lagoon. This walk we would recommend. At night you can expect shows such as Grease, a Mayan Show and karaoke as well as many others.

Reception/ Arrival: When we first arrived, the hotel did not allow us to go to our rooms for about an hour because 3:00 pm was official check in time. However, a man named Luis who introduced himself as our VIP concierge immediately whisked us away to a concierge desk. Luis seemed nice and got us drinks, but immediately proceeded to try to get us to spend more money by booking appointments at the spa. When we told him we would look it over, his tone dropped a little of its \"silkiness\" and he proceeded to tell us that we were \"invited\" to a VIP breakfast tomorrow at 9:00 am. When I asked what this was about, he told us that we would lose out on a $100 if we didn't go and that it was a showing of the privileged section of the hotel. When I flat out refused, because based on other reviews I knew where this was going, he became downright obnoxious and asked, \"Well, I guess you are okay with loosing $100 huh? You can afford it?\" However, we quickly concluded our meeting with Luis and proceeded to our room. Another thing to bear in mind while you are down there, the current exchange rate from dollar to peso is approximately 13.5 pesos to a US dollar. The front desk trades at 12 pesos to a US dollar while the gift shops and the vendors that come twice a week deal at 10 pesos to a US dollar. You might want to change your money into pesos in order to get what you pay for. Also, they often do not have change in your currency and use that as a way to give you your change in pesos and you lose money that way. Room: The room was really nice and clean. Our air-conditioning worked beautifully and there was not a bug in sight. Our villa was feet away from the pools and the Mexican restaurant El Charro. The bathroom is spacious and pretty and the shower is big enough for two people. (giggle) However, we ended up using all of our drawers and closet space and still did not have a lot of room left over. Even though this was not a problem for us, if you are traveling as a couple with a lot of stuff, there may not be a lot of room for your things. The other issue was the television. While we were away, our home state of New York was among several other states getting hit by hurricane Irene. When we tried to turn on BBC or CNN, or any other channel for that matter, most of them simply do not show up on the screen. Many of the channels are like regardless of whether they are English or Spanish. There were only a handful of channels on the television that worked constantly. The other problem we had with the room was housekeeping. Even though the housekeepers are very helpful, efficient, and friendly, they do have a fixed schedule for cleaning the rooms. Even when we tried to schedule a time for the housekeepers to come and clean, because they do not even try to clean if you are in the room, they came an hour early while we were sleeping. We had a king bed in our room, which was fairly comfortable, but the sheets were a little scratchy and if you keep the room pretty cool, the covers may not be adequate. Pool/ Beach: I am not going to lie; I did not set foot in the pools because I love the beach. However, they were very clean and lively. There is obviously a difference between the pool with the pool bar and its nearby part of the beach and the shallow pool by the Mexican restaurant and its nearby part of the beach. We preferred the part without the bar because we are not heavy drinkers and enjoyed the quieter side more. If you love activities, drinking in the pool, and ping-pong, and corn hole there is all of that in the middle of the two pools. Our part of the beach was beautiful. Even though there is some seaweed, which increases and decreases according to the weather, if you love the ocean and sand it is not going to bother you. There are no sharp rocks or anything dangerous. In the morning there are schools of fish and sometimes, if you are lucky, sea turtles in the water. The only downside is the lack of seating under shade. There are workers who are building more tiki huts but there aren\u2019t always enough and you have to wait until someone leaves, which is not very often. Food: In our opinion, and we are people who take our food very seriously, the food at the resort was subpar. The only food that actually deserved the adjective tasty was the cuisine at the Mexican restaurant and a handful of items at the buffet. The Italian restaurant, La Dolce Vita, is a hit and miss and the Japanese restaurant is a disaster. However, there is Mike\u2019s coffee shop, a hidden jewel where delightful smoothies and delicious coffee is brewed; the woman who works there knows what she is doing. The food at the Mexican restaurant is not the best Mexican food around, however it is the best food on the resort. At whatever you do, stay away from room service except for the hamburgers and fruit plates. In the end, you cannot except great food from this resort, just edible and occasionally tasty food. Regarding water, there is bottled and filtered water in the restaurants, the bars, and the mini bar in the room (it is restocked daily). However, the water from the faucets, and showerheads in the room and the taps outside are unfiltered. This was not a problem for us. Service: The staff, especially the people who work the most tedious and lower jobs, are the friendliest people around. They will stop whatever they are doing to help you. They always have a smile on their face and try to be as helpful as possible. Be warned, some of the do not speak more than 2 words of English. Everybody at the front desk, at the restaurants, and the shops speak English. It is the staff that does the cleaning and other tasks who may not speak English, but they are all as helpful as possible. Activities: We did not indulge in any activity besides snorkeling. I went twice because it was $35 per person for an hour and twenty minutes through the resort\u2019s dive shop. That was a great value compared to the other offers. The dive shop is very friendly and they do their best to make the trip enjoyable. Other activities such as windsurfing, jet skiing, and Parasailing all came with a price, but some of them could be haggled down. Weather: The weather while we were there was absolutely gorgeous. We had rain only once in the middle of the night. The bugs were not nearly as bad as everyone made them out to be. You definitely need to pack a bottle of bug spray, but you will not need more than a bottle. In addition, sunscreen is essential.

Having just returned home from our trip, I am so sad to be back to reality! After reading some of the reviews I am confused as to whether I was at the same hotel. I have nothing but fond memories of my trip and cannot speak highly enough of our experience. Mexico totally exceeded my expectations and the all inclusive experience was completely foreign to me. I thought I might get cabin fever but with a few trips out to local towns, historic sites and beautiful oceans I could not complain!! I would recommend hiring a car if you want to see the historic Coba (well worth hiring a bike and climbing the pyramid for stunning jungle views!). Chichen Itza is also well worth a visit, although the magic is slightly stolen by the market stalls, but be prepared for haggling for a bargain if in the market for some souvenirs. Other tours on offer or places worth a visit, Xel-Ha for snorkelling and some amazing fish. Swinging through trees and quad biking through the jungle to Cenotes was brilliant if you enjoy eating dust!!! Playa Del Carmen has a great tourist vibe if you enjoy a haggle in the day, massive white beach or a boogie at night, Mandala's was good fun and of course Cocobongo's....what can i say?! Brilliant! Back to the hotel experience. The food at the restaurants, were rarely disappointing, so much choice, if a little random at times but amazing fish!!! The Japenese was our favourite completely delicious and they put on a great show, well worth it! The staff are a mixed bunch, as with any large company and we all have our bad days! On the whole they went out of their way to please and greeted you with a smile. These people work such long hours and in pretty tough conditions, I take my hat off to them! Polo, Emanuel, Ingrid, Alberto and Felix were among those who I cannot speak highly enough of! The entertainment team in particular made our holiday. A young team who go out of their way to make you laugh and smile, to make your holiday a memorable one! Not sure it is in their job description to babysit you if you drink too much at the pool bar though!!! They have a jam packed program of events to keep those interested, busy throughout the day and evening. I went home singing 'Hola Senioras' a song which becomes familiar if you like a bit of water aerobics!!! Special thanks to Polo, such a genuine and endearing person who always had time for you. A real credit to the resort! He remembered our names from day one and always came to see if we were ok. He is a natural entertainer, who clearly enjoys getting dressed up and strutting his stuff. His energy and enthusiasm is amazing and he took his role seriously to achieve the highest ranking 'No 1 entertainer' title with some pretty nifty magic skills! He also went over and above the call of duty after a heavy night out at Cocobongo's, forever grateful. Although I am thinking the late nights may be affecting his volley ball skills!!!! My only suggestion for the hotel is to get some more mats and a gym ball in the gym!!!!!! To summarise in a sentence, I would definately recommend the hotel, great food, great people, great times!!!!

We had such an amazing time.. After reading many reviews on trip advisor I thought I'd mention a few things that some people left out and comment on the negative reviews. It takes about a half hour to 40 min to get to the hotel from cancun. Check in: Prior to checking in I had emailed Maria Lopez informing her that my boyfriend and I would be celebrating our anniversary and that I wanted to set up a romantic dinner. I had also emailed her requesting a room near the pool/beach on the second floor with a terrace. Upon checking in and meeting with guest services we were informed that we had gotten the room I requested and we received orange bracelets that allowed us to make reservations and have room service. Everyone welcomed us with a smile and an \"hola\" , and we were given any drink of our choice.. You must try their margaritas and strawberry daiquiri. Room: The rooms were wonderful. When we entered our room we were given a bottle of wine with a plate of desserts. I must say that the plate was not cleaned up until the second day of our stay. The showers are great, others have stated that it takes a while for the hot water to come on but this is not the case. Water does however leak out of the shower glass doors; but all you have to do is put a towel on the floor. Bring q-tips, shampoo, and conditioner - although they provide you w/ shampoo/conditioner it leaves your hair feeling knotty. The AC works very well; our room was always nice and cool. We stayed in room 907 and it was amazing! Try to request that room because it is closest to the beach and pool and the mexican restaurant. The sink in our bathroom had a leak and when we went to the front desk to notify them they sent someone up immediately to fix it [btw this was at 10pm]. The beds were okay, spacious however every morning we would wake up with back pain; this went away once we walked around a bit though. Food: The Japanese restaurant: [Yokooso]- We went their on our first night; sadly it was closed on Sunday so we were not able to go there on our last night. Def do the hibachi! the workers provide great entertainment and get all guests involved. The food was delicious. We did not go to El Charro for dinner because it was simply way too hot in there since they did not have an AC or fan. There lunch was okay; they had burgers pizza salads etc. The buffet had a wonderful breakfast- they had everything from fruits, yogurt, cereal, make your own omelets, jello in martini glasses, pancakes, hash browns, bacon, sausage..so yummy! I do have to say that the dinner at the buffet was not good... Great breakfast place and lunch.. but it lacked in dinner. The Italian restaurant was nice I would have wanted more sauce, bigger portions of pasta but it was good. Pool/Beach: I'm not sure why everyone is complaining about the beach. There are some areas in which the water is murky but all you have to do is swim further in. The water is nice and warm, the sand feels like mud.. Sand on the beach is so soft and white.. The chairs by the pool do get filled up quickly. Take advantage of the walking tour, we didn't get to do it but you are taken to a wonderful lagoon filled with tropical fish. The lobby does not have an AC and it does have free wifi which is not provided in your room; so bring your laptops! If you want to use the computers in the lobby you have to pay for it. Bring mosquito spray [OFF!] with you because there are many mosquitoes at the resort. Take advantage of the trip to playa del carmen as well. If you have any questions feel free to email me. A special thank you to maria lopez for making this trip so memorable and for our special dinner by the beach. Can't wait to return. Privilege: Personally I would not upgrade to the privilege; it seemed that most people were wearing either white or orange bracelets.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cThe NOT SO all inclusive resort in the Riviera Maya\u201d", "Author": "oufinny", "ReviewID": "UR117103813", "Content": "Where to begin... let's start with the good and then get to the bad. Good points: 1 - Room was clean and house keeping did an adequate job to keep it that way. 2 - Other reviews say the A/C does not work well, it works very well in fact. 3 - Bar tenders (with the exception of a few, see below) are very good and will ensure you have a good time. I will get back to this later though, it has its downsides too. 4 - Pool bar is excellent, we met a lot of great couples there and made fast friends. The actual swim up bar does not always have someone there so you have to be patient at time or just call up to Javier or Jairo (good guys for sure). 5 - Hotel grounds and beach area are all kept very clean. It was nice but by no means impressive. Bad Points: 1 - Time share was UN-FREAKING believable, the biggest waste of time. Unless you want to be told spending $39K USD is a good idea and almost forced to stay to get some BS $120 credit, don't bother. 2 - There is no all inclusive in this resort. You will see a selection of mediocre alcohol, ok booze and some premium choices. Unless you are part of the Privilege area you don't have access to it and it is not even offered to the Privilege people unless they ask. I call BS on that and we, along with other couples, told the hotel management staff who seriously could care less. Also, that $120 credit I mentioned above, I could hardly use it for anything at the hotel and when I didn't use it all, I couldn't even get a credit with the difference. I swear, these people don't understand fourth grade math and won't do anything no matter how logical you are with them. 3 - Customer service with the hotel staff was abysmal and they care nothing about even the people who pay for the highest dollar packages. Why do I know this, we met a couple in the honeymoon suite (saw their room too, same as ours just with a Jacuzzi on the balcony) and they had all kinds of problems with the staff their whole trip. 4 - The wrist bands, here is the breakdown: White - base level, get the least, no international drinks just cheap mexican knock offs and cannot make reservations in the restaurants. Orange - Maya deluxe package per bookit.com, this gives you SOME international drinks, reservations and a dinner by the pool. Oh don't think they will work to schedule that or even mention it to you, half the staff doesn't even know the difference and will do nothing to explain it unless you force it out of them. Black/Privilege - Best of the best, top shelf drinks, beach dinner, the rest I cannot say for sure as we had orange. Rooms are the same as what the we stayed in so it is really $150/pp for better drinks IF they give it to you. 5 - Restaurants are adequate at best and breakfast is the best. Each meal after that gets increasingly worse. My GF and I both got sick, me being VERY SICK at that, and they would not even own up to it when I know there were multiple complaints all given the same day. Japanese - 2/5 Italian - 1/5 Mexican - 1/5 (I can get better in Houston with my eyes closed) Really all that can be said is if you want to know what it must have been like to be on the Titanic where a very few are privileged and the rest are just fodder, this is the resort for you but don't expect to get more for paying more either. There are so many beautiful resorts in the area I say spend less and go to them; you will be happy you did as we heard from people we met in town and on some excursions. Excursions: Rio Secreto is spectacular though the food at the end is a let down, besides that I would say it is totally worth it. Met some great couples, had an absolute blast and saw some unbelievable sites. Don't pass this up given the chance. We also snorkeled with the hotel dive shop, reef is nice but the equipment is CHEAP. Do it elsewhere, you get what you pay for, simple enough. Bar and bar tenders revisited (the bad) - These guys over serve to the point one lady almost drowned and had to be dragged out of the pool before she died (yes this happened, I met her and she was not pleased it was allowed to happen and just plain embarassed). The day before that, a girl had to be carried out though she was conscious this time but ended up falling and about smashing her face in two if she did not miss the side of the pool. The \"lifeguards\", so ironic in this case, were responsible for getting both completed smashed and should be fired. Watch yourself, there are no limits here and they get a kick out of watching you make a fool of yourself. Exercise some self control and you will be fine; you have been warned. Final thoughts - We had fun mainly because we got lucky and met some fun people we spent a lot of time with. Others we talked to did not and all were met, conversed with, got to know well or had a drink with said they would not go back. There is a saying here in America that is very fitting, \"you can spit-shine s**t but it is still s**t,\" well ladies and gentlemen of trip advisor, that is in a nutshell the Ocean Maya. Oh yeah and the fact they have no information about the not so all inclusive levels on bookit.com, here and the hotel website should tell you all you need to know about this shaddy place. Keep in mind I got back today and all of this is fresh so I put all the detail I can to help. The area is great, tons to do and not too expensive, find another place to hang your hat and throw back a cold one with friends and loved ones.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton", "Title": "\u201cJUST AMAZING\u201d", "Author": "DOCDRAPER", "ReviewID": "UR117072004", "Content": "My wife and I got back yesterday. The hotel is wonderful, the staff are very hard working and extremely friendly. The rooms are superb, the fridges are full of beer, fanta, sprite and water which you can help yourself too as part of the all inclusive experience. If you are going all inclusive, the hotel also includes room service in the basis. However, the firstchoice website does not mention this. We had aproblem with the room on the second day, in that the sink unit would not seal properly (it has the pop up closure system). I went down to reception where the staff were only too happy to help. In fact by the time we got back from lunch, an hour later, the sink was fixed! I thought this was a one off, but no! At the end of our first week the patio doors stopped opening. I went down to reception again and told them about the problem (about 12 midday). By the time we came off the beach at 3pm, the door was working and had clearly been fixed. The location is excellent for the beach, with the sea so close. However, if you want clear water you need to walk onto the beach and turn right and walk about 200 meters and the water changes and becomes clear to the point that you can see fish and sting rays if you're carefull and quiet. In connection with beach, the sun loungers need a bit of work, they don't currently have matresses on them. However, this is being actively improved, before we left on Saturday afternoon, matresses were being added and new loungers were being rolled out. The pool is good, but a word of caution, the deep section is only one side of the pool furthest from the restraunt, at 8 feet deep. The rest of the pool is no deeper than 4 to 4 and a half feet. However, in the warm dry weather the pool feels like a warm bath wich is lovely. The wildlife in hotel grounds is just lovely. There are all sorts of diffrent sized lizards and birds. At lunch, a Koti (look this up on google images) comes to visit. There are also racoons as well.

The whole place is kept immaculate . If I had any moaning todo it was the food, on the whole it was good with plenty of choice, but not always HOT enough for my liking and I'm talking temperatures not spice's and sometimes not cooked thorough but if you tell them to cook it alittle longer it wasn't an issue . My husband on the other hand likes his red meat alittle on the rare side. The mexican restaurant was quite bland food, the Italian was pretty good and the Japanese was fair but most people you spoke to rated it highly. The other moaning issue is although the SAXOPHONE player is a very talented man it does get alittle boring to listen to every night , alittle more of the mexican feel would have been much more appreciated. There are two pools one of which is where most of the games are played should you wish to join in, the other abit quieter . We did find you had to get there early in the morning to get a bed by the pool with an umbrella . Mikes coffee bar is great with little snacks in the fridge you can help yourself to. The rooms are of good standard, could do with a full length mirror though. Trips are plentiful if wanted, we booked one trip through our rep Wendy, she was very good at her job. we went on little speed boats through the mangroves and out to sea where weather permitting you can have a snorkle. We got our own taxi to Player del carmen , a very busy place , if you like shopping I'm sure you'll love it , but you do tend to get hassled along the way.

Our check in experience was wonderful. I can't remember her name but she provided the BEST service we received during our stay. It was my husband's birthday while we were down there and she gave us complimentary wine and cake during our \"special dinner\" to celebrate his big day. We arrived late afternoon and were starving after traveling all day so we ordered room service, it was okay, however it took 2 days for the maids to remove the dishes from our room. We did choose the upgrade to Privilege and thoroughly enjoyed the Bali beds on the beach as well as the variety of drinks for us to choose from (including Crown Royale, Skyy Vodka, Sapphire Gin, Jager, Jack Daniels, among others...no redbull). Upon touring the grounds we did notice a beautiful waterfall, plants and flowers. There was also a family of some sort of lemur living outside our room. Daily the mom, dad, and babies would come out to play in the yard and they were very fun to watch! We also passed a few lizards on the walk to and from the beach and pool. The food is good, it's not 5 star so as long as you don't go with super high expectations you will be satisfied. Our favorite meal was at the Mexican Restaurant, El Charro, the guacamole was pretty fantastic. We also enjoyed the Japanese (a touch salty) and Italian, the buffet was our least favorite, although there is a lot of variety and made to order options. It seemed as though they were reusing the fry oil because things that were cooked in it just had a weird taste to them. The beach is nice!! I was so worried based on other peoples' reviews that it would be disgusting however it wasn't at all. The water was warm and we swam in it, along with others. We took walks along the beach to the other hotels as well. We didn't do any of the water sports but it appeared others had a great time sailing and renting the jet skis. One day there was quite a bit of seaweed that washed up however both our hotel and the ones on either side worked diligently to clean the beach for the guests, early in the morning. Don't let the boardwalk/wall of the Privilege Area bother you. It is a beautiful view and a VERY SHORT walk to the open beach area. There is also a pier. Our favorite thing, hands down, was the pool. It had a nice swim up bar with friendly bartenders who showed everyone equal attention and we never waited long for a drink (make sure to bring your own cup from home...I recommend the Turvis Tumbler). We played pool volleyball daily and my husband played corn hole on the pool patio. There is also ping pong, water aerobics, water polo and dancing to participate in and around the pool. There was entertainment nightly and our favorite was the Grease musical. It was very entertaining and I sang along with all of the songs. The only small concern is that there isn't any AC or even a fan in the auditorium so it was quite uncomfortable by the time the show was over. Finally, our one and only issue. We purchased a transfer to and from the airport through bookit.com for Best Way Travel to shuttle us back and forth. While neither of these companies have anything to do with the hotel, there is an employee of Best Way Travel that frequents the hotel to assist with travel arrangements. Our representative didn't show up on multiple occasions when we had scheduled appointments to meet with him. This would in no way reflect upon the hotel however the hotel staff lied to us and told us that he was there and we just missed him, basically accusing us of being crazy and that we had sat in the lobby for over 45 minutes, with another couple, and he was there the whole time. When we finally got in touch with him he admitted that he hadn't been there on the previously established time frames and he did apologize. It really wouldn't have been that big of a deal if 3 different members of the staff at the hotel hadn't tried to cover up for him.

The meat was cooked nice but there was no flavor. There was no spice, no seasoning just plain. Buffet restaurants- There was a wide range of choice for breakfast. Lunch was the same thing and found it was cold in the snack bar. Evening meal was standard, and we found there was a long cue between 8 and 10. We usually went around 7. Drinks- A fair choice and full of alcohol. Staff- Very friendly. Found they would do anything for you and constantly smiling and happy. Never moaned and so so polite. Dressed very smart.

There was a quiet, silent room which was amazing with some beds in there and a meditation section which was lovely. Air con- The bedrooms had great air con.

Imelda and Isabella were also great staff. Our personal favorite was Vicente. He provided us incredible service every morning and sometimes later in the day always remembering what we liked ! Spent much of our time on the beds however, we did go on a katamaran ride with Douglas - it and he were amazing ! We loved talking with Douglas as we coasted in the beautiful blue waters ! Also took an hour long snorkeling trip. Can't remember the staffs' names but it was one of the best snorkeling trips I've ever experienced - all kinds of fish and coral- well worth it ! Daniel from Italy was also a pleasure to talk to and share information. The pool/entertainment staff, along with bartenders, and towel staff in the pool area were great ! Enjoyed the water aerobics-leader was very funny ! Had a good time talking with Fernanda who was very friendly and personable. We both had the deep tissue massages in the gorgeous spa. Receptionist, Mercedes and Vienna did a fantastic job ! Just about every evening, hearing Juan the saxophonist/flutist was a treat ! As we are early risers and crash early, being able to relax with an after dinner drink and be entertained was nice. With regard to the nightly shows, we only attended one as we retire early. Staff worked really hard but the lack of air conditioning made it tough(we talked to staff about this and they are working to resolve this problem). We have heard people complain about the beach. I have no complaints. Yes, there are some dark spots close to shore on a short stretch of the beach, but all you have to do is walk about 5 minutes to the right and the water is incredibly clear. All in all it was a great vacation, particularly for the price and I would highly recommend it !", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value & A Very Enjoyable Stay\u201d", "Author": "jjkreading", "ReviewID": "UR116649921", "Content": "Stayed for a fortnight at the Ocean Maya with a family of 6 (youngest was 18 as the hotel has stopped taking children from this year which is a shame). The entry to the hotel is impressive as when you come off the main road there is a long drive through almost sub-tropical jungle. We had a speedy registration and were taken to our villa block (the rooms are all in similar villa buildings housing about 6 bedrooms). The rooms were all in very good condition (recent refurbishment). Large beds, sofas, flat screen cable television, very efficient air conditioning, patio overlooking the immaculate gardens. The bathroom was large although no bath and shower only. Cleaning standards were very good throughout our stay. The hotel beach has attracted criticism from some reviewers. I could find nothing wrong with it. There were 2 entries to the sea (a decking has been built over part of the sea). No rocks to speak of, although plenty of seaweed! There were 2 good size swimming pools (one with a swim up bar) that appeared to be very clean. Sunbeds availability was no problem (although rather uncomfortable). People did seem to get up early to place towels on them but we normally hit the pool / beach area about 11.00 and we always got 6 beds by the pool or on the beach. There were plenty of umbrellas for shade from the sun. The all inclusive package was very good. It was 24 hours and covered the restaurants, bars, room service and all non-motorised water sports. We also had a free mini-bar in our room which was restocked daily (our travel rep said that it was only UK tourists that received this service?). There was an active entertainments team with plenty of beach sports and shows every night. Food was good. The main buffet restaurant had plenty of choice and also 2 cooking stations. One was for pasta and the other was to cook any food of your choice available (usually steak, pork chops, fish, chicken etc). There was a Japanese restaurant where you could have a small table or sit around the cooker with show cooking going on. Japanese food is not to my personal taste but it would be enjoyable for many. The Italian restaurant (the original Italian by the beach burnt down earlier in the year and it is now a sectioned off part of the main buffet restaurant) was good (although my daughter was disappointed that there was no pizza on the menu!). The Mexican restaurant by the swimming pools was excellent. The service there was top class and make sure that you experience the making of their Tequila coffees (a lot of flames are involved). There was no need to book for the a la carte restaurants and you could visit them as many times as you like during your stay. There are a few down sides. No air conditioning in the main restaurant or lobby made it somewhat uncomfortable. We had a couple of problems with room service. My daughter\u2019s television was not working when we arrived and it took to the next day to have it fixed and this was after I went to reception to get an explanation for the inactivity. Same daughter also found that her towels had not been replaced one day and phoned reception to inform them. They were not provided until the following day (had I known at the time I would have paid another visit to reception myself). The common factor with the service issues was Reception but in general the service at the hotel was very good especially in the restaurants. They did struggle sometimes to find a table to accommodate a party of 6 and I did have to demonstrate a couple of times how to put 2 tables together! Some reviewers have complained about the smell in the grounds. There is an occasional sulphur type odour but the hotel and travel rep assured everyone that it was the mangroves and not sewage. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay at the Ocean Maya (apart from the mosquitoes so take plenty of spray) and I would certainly recommend the resort.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merida, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cNice property, badly let down by poor management.

Overall, we enjoyed ourselves, and our stay, however there were many small issues which, if corrected would make this an INCREDIBLE resort. Lack of onsite management seems to be the main problem, presumably compounded by lack of interest from corporate management. Room was very nice, clean, comfortable bed, good shower (which leaked onto the floor if the water was allowed to spray against the glass door), airconditioning worked well, and we slept well - once that is we had dealt with the clouds of mosquitos which invaded our room everytime we opened the door. Our request for the hotel to do something about the mosquitos was responded to by them sending an employee with a large spray; he sprayed the room, and not a single mosquito was killed, clearly the bug spray they use does not work. Frustrated, later in the evening we drove to the Oxxo store on the main road outside the hotel and bought a can of Raid - came back, sprayed, and 20 minutes later we had solved the problem. We continued to spray the room ourselves every day, and kept the mosquitos away. Yes, it is mosquito season - we live in Yucatan, and are very familiar with this fact - our big complaint however was the failure of the hotel to have effective control in place. I requested to speak to the duty manager in the evening around 8pm, to discuss the problem, however was informed that he had 'gone home' and would be back tomorrow. What kind of hotel of this size has no manager on duty at 8pm?? The pools and beach areas were pleasant and well maintained; as many other reviewers have noted, the sun beds are terrible, and badly in need of replacements. We enjoyed the pool bar, and drank mojitos there each day... Food - we found in general the food to be average, and it seemed to be bland and uninteresting, presumably to attempt to cater for the rather diverse nationalities represented in the guests. By so doing, it basically meant that none of the food was very good. We ate one evening in each of the restaurants, and were unimpressed with the Mexican or Italian a la carte options. The Oriental restaurant was the best of the three, rating slightly above average... Table management seemed poor, at times there was a wait for a table when the restaurant was half empty; it seems to me that this was due more to lack of staff than any other reason. We did not participate in any activities or night entertainment, so cannot comment on them. Staff in general were friendly but detached, we did not get a 'wow' feeling from anyone, despite the fact that we both speak Spanish (and my partner being Mexican). The best thing about the resort is the fact that it is Adults Only - makes for a lovely quiet atmosphere, with no screaming kids or babies! A big plus in my opinion... Overall we had a good time, but were disappointed in many aspects. I will be contacting H10 headquarters with my suggestions for improvement.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cA little piece of paradise awaits!\u201d", "Author": "RoseyEdmonton", "ReviewID": "UR116405535", "Content": "My husband and I just got back from the Maya Riveria yesterday!!

After checking out prices and many trip advisor reviews, we decided on Ocean Maya Royale and believe it or not, the price of the stay was comparable to our local beach trip. We stayed at the Ocean Maya Royale for 5 nights from July 30th -August 4, 2011. The resort was great and met our expectations, especially for the price. All the pictures on the resort web site were true to form, very beautiful. Upon arrival, we got upgraded to a Privilege room as all the deluxe rooms were filled. We were asked if we wanted to purchase the privilege package(which includes room service, beds on the beach, air conditioned dining in the buffett etc) but once we said no, we were never asked again. Our room had a view of the villas which although not a sea view, was nice. The bed itself had a foam mattress topper and was not comfortable to me but it was tolerable for 5 nights. The fitted sheets were like sand paper. We found it better to sleep on the top sheet as it was not as worn. The room had a mildew odor which I understand can be common at many beach resorts. We requested an air freshner in the room but never received it. As soon as a left the front desk for the request, I knew it wasn't going to be taken care of as the staff was friendly but didn't seem to take my request for an air freshner seriously. I just bought some inscents when we went on the shopping trip into Playa del Carmen (which was very hard to find) and that seems to help a lot. So you may want to pack your favorite air freshner plug ins or scented candles from home in case your room has that issue. There was great AC in our room and the shower always had consistent hot water. The mini bar stocked with water, beer, sodas and liquior was nice. We had to ask a few times for it to be refilled but it was always done promptly. Unlike some resorts we'd been to, where there was constant harrassment to buy things and purchase excursions, we did not experience that at Ocean Maya. You may be asked to purchase your excursions through your travel agency or airport transfer company. If not, there is a tour agent that is always in the lobby 7am to 5pm that can book you on a tour of your liking. We purchased the Tulum tour for $43 per person that included our transportation, entrance fee and guide. I read on trip advisor that others just took a taxi to Tulum and paid for the entrance fee and a tour guide when they arrived. I can't imagine the taxi being cheaper as it was a long trip. The Tulum beach area was great. After being taking the tour in the scorching heat, it was nice to get into the clear blue water- so wear your bathing suit. There is nowhere to change once you enter the ruins. We also took a wonderful fishing trip at Maroma Paradise and were very pleased. The food was good at La Hacienda, the buffett restaurant, with different varieties for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The a la cart speciality restaurants were very nice-Mostly the atmosphere than the food. But as far as the food, I enjoyed the Mexican and Japanese restaurants the best. There were plenty of iguanas and racoon type creatures roaming about but none of them bother you. Take some bug spray as you will need it especially at night if you hang out anywhere on the resort (your room, the lobby area, the entertainment theatre) but that is to be expected- just be prepared! The staff throughout the resort were friendly. Do remember to bring cash as it is just necessary, although the resort states that tips are included, to tip those that provide good service. There were a few that on our last day/night we sought out to give a tip to because they were consistently friendly to us. The tips although just a few dollars seems to be very appreciated. You will need your cash on the excursions for tipping the bus drivers and excursion guides. The resort offers free transportation into Playa del Carmen for shopping that you must book a reservation on a day in advance. The shopping trip had a tour guide to give you history on the area and lead you to a store to hear about Tequila making and give you samples, if you wish. There were nightly shows and events. The Coco Bongo staff work hard to get you involved in activities at the pool and in the evening at the shows. It's kinda funny to see the pool volley ball leader dancing in the show at night but it was entertaining. Two pools were always warm and very nice. One quiet and one lively most of the day. The beach was nice to look at but not clear blue. In fact, it was very not blue at all, more brown. I never got in. The gym was small but nice. It had everything in it that you would need for a workout. I regret not utilizing the spa services as it seemed to be a lot of services offered for great prices like the couples massage for $160 US dollars. Sure there were things that could have been better (better mattress and sheets, no mildew smell) but overall, Ocean Maya is a beautiful resort with great atmosphere, good food, friendly staff and reasonably priced- It has a lot of potential to be a five star.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birkenhead, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHad an excellent time, but still came away disappointed\u201d", "Author": "Andy-T-87", "ReviewID": "UR116290820", "Content": "With it's 5 star rating and new refurbishment, my partner and I expected a high quality hotel which we had obtained a two week holiday at for an excellent price. I many areas this was the case as in the first week we were very happy with the hotel. It wasn't until the second week that cracks started to appear and we noticed that the hotel was lacking in areas although it has the potential to be a quality hotel. Location: We felt the hotel was located in a great place. It is a 15-20min taxi journey (which only costs 200 pesos/\u00a314) to Playa del Carmen centre. It is also only 35-45mins away from Cancun which has many attractions and the airport (the first stop of the airport transfer). Front desk service: We thought the guys at the front desk were excellent throughout our holiday. They have a doorman system where when you leave the hotel (unless you have checked out) they take down your room number to ensure you return. The reception team are there 24hrs a day and the few times we had to deal with them, they made sure we were seen to asap. Main hotel area: This part of the hotel we never really understood. We called it an open planned lobby (don't know the correct term), but basically the hotel doesn't have a front door and only has large sliding doors on the beach side for when there is wind and rain. Now in Mexico it is usually around 100% humidity and 30oC, coupled with this open plan, there is no value in using air conditioning. At night, when you just want to chill with a beer/cocktail, it is impossible as it gets so hot and unbarable as there is no respite from the humidity. We felt that if they could find a way to cool that area down, then the place would be perfect as if has many comfortable seats and a great bar service with guys willing to do most drinks you like as well as running a nightly snack service between 23:30 and 6:00. There is also a shop and free wifi which comes in handy from time to time. Food: Attached to the main lobby is the main buffet restaurant (which is also temporarily home to the Italian a la carte). Here, we were greeted every morning and night by a host/hostess who were always helpful and friendly, we would be seated and then greeted by a waitor/waitress who would get you anything at all. We met a couple and one of them was gluten intolerant and a veggie. Everytime they came in a waitor would show them what they couldn't have so they didn't eat anything they shouldn't (they were also provided a printed piece of paper explaining this in Spanish so there wouldn't be any confusion). We felt that the food was great to start with but we found that by the second week, we had already eaten everything at least once before and therefore got very tired of hotel food by the time we left. They have some great ideas, but again, we felt that the hotel isn't meeting it's potential in this area. We found that we ate some of the best food we have had, but also the worst which shouldn't happen in a 5 star hotel. Highlights included, fantastic beef from a barbeque, great selection of fruit and salad and also terrible, processed cheese (I like my cheese) and 'cuts of meat' that was definately from a Tesco Value pack. (6-7/10) There are 3 'a la carte' restaurants (Italian, Japanese and Mexican) we only managed to try the Italian and Japanese. We were not impressed with the Italian what so ever. When I eat Italian, I expect, tomatoe, cheese, garlic etc. Like I said before, processed cheese, not much of a tomatoe taste in the bolognese sauce and no taste of garlic in any of my dishes. We tried this once, never again. However, it was always really busy, so maybe it is the liking of others. (4/10) The Japanese al a carte however is fantastic. It runs on a Mon, Wed, Fri and Sat. We went there twice and we would have done it every night if we could. Sushi, rice, meat, soup, all tasted fantastic and the 'ambience' was lovely. I would recommend this to anyone going to the hotel. One tip: get there before 19:00 otherwise you won't get in, it is that busy. (9/10) Lastly, there is a lunchtime restaurant that is open from 11:00 - 17:00 which is good for a late breakfast and for lunch. Much like the main restaurant but has chips, pizza, nachos etc. We liked this restaurant as it served something different everyday and when we got peckish we could go there easily as it is right by the 'quiet' pool. (8-9/10) Room: When we arrived we were very happy with the room, it was cool due to a good air con. We had two double beds in our room which wasn't entirely to our liking but there are ways to make them into one big bed which we ended up doing. The shower and toilet are in a separate room, shower was lovely although the hot water was tempermental at times. One scary thought was the toilet. Because they haven't updated their drainage system yet, they ask for you to put as little toilet paper down the toilet, instead providing you with a bin?!? I hardly fulfilled this request. There is then a door which doesn't have a lock, more a divider on a hinge to my partners 'prep area' where there was a big mirror and a sink. This was never a problem for us. We had a perfectly sized wardrobe (take some of your own hangers), which has a safety deposit box in it which is locked with a key. It also houses an iron and board. There was a TV which had cable channels which were mainly in Spanish but had some English speaking programmes on. A fridge was in the room which was stocked up daily with soft drinks, beer and water (which is free to use for all British guests only). An alarm clock, telephone and dressing gown with slippers were also provided. We went on our anniversary which my partner had informed them of and they provided use with chocolates and sparkling white wine (which they classed as champagne). We only experienced two problems, the sheets, like others have mentioned can be like sleeping on sand paper. My partner is quite fussy with what she sleeps on and she had to discard them everynight and sleep on another (you get 3 per bed). It was only because of this that we came across our 2nd problem. One night she noticed blood stains on the sheet which was new and supposedly cleaned. We were gutted by this so we informed our rep this following morning (who was fantastic by the way) and they were changed instantly. All in all, very comfortable and to our liking. (8/10) Pool/Beach area: There is a towel service which you get a towel card each and you can swap or collect between 08:00 - 18:00. There are two pools in the hotel, one is the 'quiet' one, the other not so. The not so one is where the pool bar is (which you can swim to and sit at) and where all the music is played. This was great for the first couple of days when you're adapting to the heat and wanted to bathe in the water with a beer. However, you do have to put up with the party go-ers, they 'own' the area and we found were very loud, so wouldn't recommend that area if you're trying to relax. The second pool is a lot quieter and where you find most couples chilling in and the one we usually used. Both were pretty clean although they collected sand from the pillocks who walked straight into it from the beach. Beach area is ok, the sunbeds need replacing as most of them don't have support, so if you have back problems, I would recommend an early start each day to select a good bed. Sand was pretty much as clean as it could be but many ants are around that bite so I would watch out for them and maybe wear repellant. I wouldn't recommend going into the sea, this area of Mexico has been hit hard by the BP oil spill and visible oil is still washing up on the shores all the way down the Riviera Maya. If you want a beach holiday with a nice sea, go to Cancun, doesn't seem to be that affected. (7/10) Entertainment: There is a hotel entertainment team who are brilliant. The guys who mix in with everyone are all great and will do anything to make sure you enjoy your hols. During the day they provide beach and water volleyball, water polo, football and drinking games (e.g. beer drinking contest, which weren't too 'spring break-ish'). They also take guests to Coco-Bongos as they have their own VIP area but we didn't do this. At night, the entertainment lacks substantially. There is saxophone player that you will hear the first night you get there and every night after. If he isn't performing that night then he is in the restaurant providing background music and it does grate on you after a while. After him there are also acts from professional acts and the entertainment team. All shows are good but it seemed they didn't have any real structure as two shows were performed twice when we were there. They have a big theatre with a stage and we felt that this was another huge disappointment as it wasn't reaching its potential. (6/10) Misc: The most bizarre thing about the hotel is the Priviledge service. This is an upgrade split into two sections, a room and service upgrade or a service upgrade. We did neither but for what we could see, for $50 per person per night you can get a suite and the service, for $25 per person per night you can get the service which just didn't seem worth it. You get padded beds on the beach, branded drinks and pre-bookable options for the a la carte restaurants. The annoying thing about the presence of this service is that the hotel feels they have to find things to make it worth the money, which also includes air conditioned rooms in the restaurant. Why the hotel would want to include this for just Priviledge customers is beyond me. Don't understand the service and why it is in place, for \u00a3250 each for two weeks, it just ain't worth it, I hope they get rid of it soon. Overall, this hotel is good to very good. With help from the travel companies and customer feedback, this hotel could be one of the best in Playa del Carmen, the bits I have mentioned could be easily rectified, hence the reason for our disappointment. I wouldn't go out and about and recommend it (yet!) but I certainly wouldn't want to put people off the hotel because it helped us have an excellent two weeks in Mexico. (8/10) Tips: Take insect repellant and apply liberally every evening and when going on coach journeys. Take an extra beach towel Take a small bottle of high factor sun cream as it is difficult not to burn Gents, don't take trousers!! Not needed for restaurant as shorts are allowed and it is far too hot and humid to wear them, even at night, trust me! Ladies, my partner suggests, do not take long dresses unless 'flowey' as again it is too hot and humid to withstand wearing them.

The rooms are kinda as advertised, there aren't uprgrAded liqours or beers In the fridge. In fact the only kind of beer they have on the property is budweiser and some beer in a blue can. No corona no dos equis no modelo. The bathroom ammenities were also not upgraded and were terrible. Ohhh and the room service... We ordered in one night and I almost threw up! The pizza was worse than a frozen pizza and the French fries tasted like they were cooked twice! Disgusting. 4. The food, if u have any kind of taste buds you will not find this food edible! My boyfriend is an ex marine who will eat anything, and he couldnt even stomach the food. Unless your trying to lose weight this is not a hotel that values food, it puts more into the presentAtion than actual taste. Oh and al a carte here means they bring u what they want. Every single restaurant is disgusting and I found myself spitting out my food multiple times. 5. The drinks are mediocre the bartenders were friendly but they are using the cheapest liquor possible even if u bought the privilege package. 6. The pool was awesome and this is what we enjoyed the most. The beach was not crowded but it's also not clear. It's not like tulum or cancun, more like a CleAner version of the gulf. 7. There is no entertainment at the hotel we went back to our rooms early each night. The entertainment staff tries but it's really kinda boring. We Did catch one cool show with Mayan dancers. 8. Go to tulum or isla de mujeres!! We loved those places the water is beautiful and the people are lovely. 9. All in all this hotel is at best a 3 stAr the food is truly terrible and the people In the lobby are not friendly. As u get closer to the pool the stAff gets friendlier. 10. I will not stay here again nor recommend this hotel. The majority of there advertisement is false, I wish I would have listened to the reviews. We heard from another couple that excellence was good and from another that tresrios was terrible as well. Spend the extra money and stay in a true 4 or 5 star hotel.

Then you realize that the lack of clarity about the \"privilege\" and the high-pressure and less-than-up-front disclosure of the \"H10 Premium\" sales pitch leave folks frustrated. You know it's not Sandals when you book it, and you definitely know why after a few hours there. You are wisked from the check-in desk to the H10 Premium desk where you are asked about your travel plans-- she's wearing an H10 shirt so you assume she's an employee of the hotel. You will be offered an incentive (they start with a free spa treatment)-- if you hold out, you can get at least $160 for use on tours (although one couple was offered $300). You will be told that the rep will talk to you over breakfast and then give you a tour-- the sales pitch starts AFTER BREAKFAST and takes at least 2 hours. You will be given no brochures or price list for this VACATION CLUB and they will refuse to stop the pitch even after you've explained that there is just no money in the budget for it. After nearly 2 1/2 hours, I explained that they were getting very frustrating, that we had been told that the \"tour\" would only take about an hour and that we had had enought. If you are interested, here are some bottom line numbers--- they will sell you 20,000 RCI points (they call it a 10,000 point plan that they double), one free all inclusive week at the Ocean Maya every other year (starting the day you pay for your package) and at least 2 weeks worth of room as tthe Ocean Maya every year as well (but you will need to pay the per diem rate for the all-inclusive features). This package will cost about $7500. They will look for a 25% downpayment, but will play with that as well. Now for the actual resort-- it's tough to be entirely objective when your vacation has started with a bit of deception and some high-pressured sales tactics, but here goes some objectivity: 1. The beach is fine-- if you walk up and down the coast, you'll see that the Ocean Maya beach is fine. The Ocean Maya beach is as clean, if not cleaner, than most. 2. The pools are large and clean (although the tile could use some scrubbing and there were tiles missing at the swim-up bar). 3. Staff is great-- very friendly, all have fair skill with English and seem genuinely kind. 4. The restaurants are o.k.-- nothing great, but adequate. None of them, except for the Japenese, is adequately air conditioned-- they dont even have ceiling fans. As a result, avoid the Mexican (which has no A/C at all). 5. There is no outdoor snack bar-- which is odd for an all-inclusive. So, if you want a quick burger, or something to nibble on, you need to leave the beach or the pool, put on your sandles and shirt and trudge over to the un-airconditioned Il Charro restaurant. This, in my opinion, after the heavy-handed sales pitch, is the biggest shortfall of the Ocean Maya. And, they will stop you if you are leaving with food. As a result, and this is only my hunch, lots of folks skip lunch, which leads to a fair number of inebriated guests at the swim-up bar. 6. The \"special\" bracelets: The \"privilege\" bracelets can cost about $25/person per day. You get to sit in the air conditioned part of each dining room which is a plus and for breakfast, they wait on you (if you don't want to go to the buffet). Just because you have the privilege bracelet doesn't mean that all your drinks are necessarily made with the upgraded alcohol, so caveat emptor. Also, they \"privilege\" part of the beach includes padded chaises, waitress service (for drinks) and they have fruit at that part of the beach. We upgraded for our last day and it was worth it. But, if you add up a week's worth of upgrades ($300) I don't know if the Ocean Maya is as good a bargain as the other resorts. 7. POOR COMMUNICATON: The front desk is understaffed. They do not provide good written information about the privilege program and when you check-in, you'll be taking yoruself to your room (with your bags to follow). It's just not the sort of treatment one would expect from a resort. 8. ROOMS. The rooms are fine-- clean and neat. The beds are not as comfortable as most people would expect and they are actually a little short (king size width, but not length). We stayed in the standard room which would have been fine. As for the allegedly \"stocked\" minibar-- that is a bit of an overstatement as it included a few cans of soda, two beers and bottled water. BOTTOM LINE-- I got to spend a week on the beach with the girl of my dreams for our honeymoon. Heavy-handed vacation club sales pitches and lousy air conditioning weren't going to prevent me from having a great time.

The rooms are of a very high standard although the beds aren't great If you have booked then don't worry!!!!

The restaurant does need air con but other than that it is clean and well staffed The grounds are immaculate and so are the pools. The communal areas could do with a bit of snagging as the tiles are chipped etc. On the whole it was a decent place 4 star at best, for the older traveller it wouldn't be recomended but otherwise its a good hotel and you will have a go holiday but I doub yu'd want to go back.

We would gladly return to the previous four, but NEVER to Ocean Maya. There are far better hotels for the same, or slightly more money. We received NONE of our promised (in writing) amenities such as liquor in the mini-bar, ice in the room, bottle of Tequila, and lobster dinner to name a few. ROOMS - Feel like Motel 6. Small, one sink in the bathroom. Mis-matched furnishings. The night tables were wooden cubes that were spray painted shiny blue. There is no full length mirror in the place and I had to stand on a chair to use the make-up mirror in the bathroom. You need to be at least 5'6'' to even have a peek. The beds have no box springs - that is why they are so hard, as others have stated. They are mattresses placed on a plywood box. Yes, the sheets feel like sand paper. They would have been made into drop cloths at my house. Renovation = flat screen TV and new paint. However, our cleaning person did a fabulous job keeping the room spotless. We left her a tip every day and received plenty of towels. FRONT DESK - Forget it. It took us over two hours at check-in to receive the type of room that we had confirmation for. Confirmation from the H-10 management and Continental Vacations. Our \"personal\" concierge was useless. Our thermostat for the A/C had to be re-programmed two days into our stay. We called/visited the front desk four times. The nighttime room temperature was 86 degrees. The next day it was fixed by dumb luck when we ran into our waiter from the night before who asked why we were so upset as we walked back from the front desk. He promised to send a maintenance man ASAP. Less than fifteen minutes later, a nice man showed up and it took him less than five minutes to fix the problem. People at the front desk smile and nod - that's it. GROUNDS - Beautiful and well maintained. The waterfalls and flowers are exceptional. The grounds keepers are always busy, there is no trash, no empty glasses; the resort is wonderful to view. However, that beauty does not save the experience. POOLS - Beautiful as well. The entertainment staff also does a great job at making everyone a part of the fun and the activities were well received by all. BEVERAGES - We were forced to upgrade to \"Privledge.\" As another reviewer stated, if you want to drink any alcohol that you have ever heard of, you need to upgrade. Mexican liquor was used in all of the many varieties of sweet, fruity drinks that people ordered. There is Corona on tap, if you only drink beer. We are middle-aged grown-ups and we avoid most blender made concoctions. The top-shelf stuff is right there for all to see, but unless you upgrade, it will not be yours. You need that precious black bracelet. Even Absolut Vodka is considered top-shelf. There are signs saying \"Privledge\" on anything that is worth drinking. Yes, we did try small bribes before we made the decision to upgrade - to no avail. FOOD - There were some above average dishes, but these were few and far between. What is listed on the menu in the Italian Restaurant as filet of beef, is actually chuck steak. Chuck was the best cut of beef served anywhere. I don't even want to know what the hamburgers were made out of. As others have said, the buffet was the same thing every day. It was difficult to even make a salad at lunch. The best choice was a grilled chicken breast with Fast Fries. Much of the food is unrecognizable. However, if you want to fill up on desserts and bread, it could work out for you. Yes, there was a lot of \"slop\" at the buffets. BEACH & OCEAN - We got to lay on the padded chaise lounges overlooking the Caribbean because we upgraded to Privledge. We also had waitress service that was fabulous, though we only asked for bottles of water and ice. We had our own personal ice bucket that was replenished throughout the day and snacks. It was unfair to us that all guests are not afforded this luxury. The sand is white and powdery. Some of the beaches in Playa have coarse, brown sand. There was some seaweed wash-up, but the workers did their best to rake it up. The water was cloudy throughout our stay, which is unusual for the Caribbean. We walked about two miles in each direction, and this was one of the nicest beaches. It was not small when other resorts are considered. However, whether it be oil or mangrove deposits, the water was stagnant and BLACK just 1/4 mile away from the resort. Perhaps that is why the water is cloudy - UGH. RESTAURANTS AND RESERVATIONS - We sat in the air-conditioned sections of the restaurants. The dining room was sweltering for others - even at breakfast. This is appalling, as there were some older guests who did not upgrade. We walked out of the the Mexican Restaurant. Never have we seen such poor quality Mexican food in Mexico. They actually took nacho cheese sauce and mixed it with macaroni (just picture that) and called it Macaroni and Cheese. Even Kraft out of a box looks better. The table cooking at the Oriental Restaurant was a wonderful show, but the shrimp looked and tasted like the mini shrimp out of a can. The chicken and beef were better, but everything was very salty. Minestrone soup in the Italian was wonderful, but thank God we were sitting in the air-conditioned section. We watched others fan themselves as they ate. We were allowed to make dinner reservations; every restaurant is not open every day, though. Other guests waited in line. SHADY DEALINGS - OK we upgraded to save our vacation. We were quoted two different prices to upgrade $40 or $50 per day per couple. However, we went on a time share presentation (first ever) and got the cost reduced to $105 each for eight days. The time share is not really the type of time share that we are familiar with, but a points program to use at various places. The price went from $40,000 to $7,000 as time went by.

Had a great time however that was b/c of the awesome group we went with - not b/c of the hotel. We knew we booked a 'budget friendly, all inclusive, adults only' resort, and didn't expect the world by any means. We're all in our 30s and 40s from North Carolina...4 couples and 2 single gals....It wasn't a horrible place but we definitely were disappointed in many areas. We've stayed at other spots (like right next door at Secrets Capri) and felt this didn't live up. Definitely would not recommend it. If you're broke and just wanting to go to Mexico, then it's fine. If you want to not have to stop at McDonalds on the way back from an excursion b/c you'd rather eat there than the resort, book another spot. (and yes we did that) Food/Restaurants: Was like a bad K&W cafeteria experience. We weren't looking for anything super exquisite, but we did expect the food to be good...it wasn't. We have all been to many all inclusive resorts and I get the whole 'mass production' idea, but this wasn't acceptable. We had one decent meal at the Hibachi Grill the final night (sitting AT the grill), but other than that, the best item was the Club sandwich from room service, which wasn't gourmet by any means. All of the restaurants were very unwilling to accommodate our group (to sit together); even after 2 left and it was just us 8. None were air conditioned which made it almost unbearable at times...and no fans might I add. No breeze either b/c of the placement of the setup...plus mosquitos also joined you for dinner. The drinks were weak, but a couple requests for extra liquor shots was never an issue - they were happy to do so. Staff: a few were very nice; some were extremely rude. Polo, Jess, Omar, Eber, Javier, Hector, and Amy = all AMAZING!!!! We would FB you if we knew your last names! Some of the staff should be fired. Very surprising as we had never had this issue before on vacations abroad. All in all, most did nothing to go out of their way to make sure you were happy or to assist you or to accommodate your request. The pool/entertainment staff were by far the friendliest (named above). When we arrived the front desk was irritated b/c we didn't have some 'ticket' we needed with our hotel reservation info on it. They found it an oddity to just simply look up our names in the system. They got irritated which of course made us irritated as we bickered with them in 100 degree temps upon arrival. Not a great first impression by any means. We got it worked out. All rooms for our group were very close to ea other which was great (requested prior). Resort seems very understaffed, which is prob why some of the ppl are so moody - they are very overworked perhaps. Room: Nice, clean, modern, spacious room. The beds were like bricks but we knew that going in. We all seemed to wear ourselves out enough during the day to sleep well with no complaints there. The showers leaked water onto the floor and our hot water went out several times but we made do. AC in the rooms froze us to death....which was fabulous! it was nice knowing we had that to come back to after sweating to death at dinner. (seriously dripping sweat) Pool: 2 pools....the one pool bar was only one sided and usually only staffed by 1 or possibly 2 bartenders; extremely difficult to get a drink - again, we made do with our thermoses we brought from home. (DEFINITELY BRING YOUR OWN THERMOS) We didn't see a need at all to upgrade to the black band privilege status. The boys wanted it b/c of the nicer liquor, but again, we made do. The only other benefit we saw was the ability to use the cabanas - which were in a place with no breeze, and you could eat in a separate room in a couple of the restaurants....again, not a big deal for us. We grabbed chairs before 8AM ea morning and no one ever messed w/ our stuff or tried to take the chairs. Beautiful view of ocean from pool. Beach: Water was dark and dirty - we stayed at the pool. Sand was white and pretty but the shore wasn't spectacular by any means. Grounds/Vegetation: Beautiful. Very manicured, beautiful plants and paths. Loved seeing the iguanas, raccoons, and lemurs around the place. Night Entertainment: We enjoyed it b/c we made friends w/ the entertainment staff and it was comical to see them do the shows. We visited Isla Muheras (the island of beautiful women)....catamaran tour, snorkeling, shopping, buffet, etc.....fabulous excursion. $80 (all day, all alcohol/drinks/food included) We also went to Selvatica for zip lining, ATVing and swimming in a sink hole....SO much fun....best part of the trip. Would recommend to everyone. $110 (approx 6 hrs) DEFINITELY GO!!!! You also get a buffet there (included) and it was by FAR the best meal of the trip...the staff there completely goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great time.

A fun week long all-inclusive getaway!! Right? Wrong. Day 1: Pool bar ran out of ice. OK... we waited about 15 mins, gave up, ordered a beer and swam away. A few minutes later, I hear a blender. I swim up, ask for my drink and am told that I can not have it b/c \"We are closed.\" I said \"No, I have been waiting on this drink for over 30 minutes and I want it.\" He made me (and my friend) a NON-alcoholic version of the drink we'd been waiting on. 2nd full day - We are having b-fast with the sales person (This is a vacation package kind of place... sort of like a timeshare) to hear the pitch to join H10. I asked for champagne. \"We are out\"... OK, I'll have bottled water \"I can't give you a bottle\"... \"Well, what can I have?\" So he brought me water in a glass. Less than 5 minutes later, a man walks from the back with a large bowl FULL of ice and champagne bottles!!!!! After touring the property, the sales person takes us for the sales pitch. He orders us a round of Strawberry Mojitos. Server leaves and returns with regular Mojitos and tells the sales guy that \"We are out of strawberry.\" He says, \"What? I get strawberry everyday. Please try to find some.\" Server says, \"OK' then goes and sits in a booth with another server!!! 3rd day - my husband was sick with diahrrea and vomiting presumably b/c he drank a bottled water from our mini-fridge that had been refilled with tap water and returned to our fridge. That is speculation, of course, but the seal was broken on the water and he assumed that I had opened it... which I hadn't. In any case, around 9am I went down to find meds and get waters for him to keep him hydrated. I asked the front desk \"No, we can't give you water. That person arrives at 10\" I say, \"OK, please send that person to my room with water.\" \"Sure\" was my answer. I went to bfast to get my husband some food to try to eat and I asked the hostess for waters to take to the room. She did look for waters in the back but was unable to produce any. At 12:30pm, we still have NO water. I went back to the front desk and asked again. She said that the manager said that I can not have extra waters in my room. I said that I'd need to talk with the manager. I went to have lunch in the buffet and the manager came to my table. Accusingly he asked, \"Why do you want so many waters, maam?\" (I had asked for 6-8 bottles) I described my husbands' conditiion and said that I wanted the waters to have in the fridge so that I didn't have to walk down and have this conversation everytime he needed more water. The manager said, \"Well, you can't have 6 waters. You can only have 3.\" He suggested I give my husband coke. Coke? Really? That turned into a heated discussion and I ended up BARGAINING with this man to get WATER for my husband. He said the waters would be brought up \"right away\". I am sure you can guess that these waters did not arrive right away. It was more like 530pm AND I had to argue with the worker to get the extra water promised by the manager! When I returned to the room from lunch, my husband had a fever. So, it is 1pm - he's had NO water b/c I couldn't get anyone to give me any and now he has a fever. I called the medic. I didn't know what else to do. $315 USD later, my husband did start to get better. This particular day, it took me BARGAINING with a manager for water, our friend PURCHASING water in the gift shop of an all-inclusive where we've paid to be and the medic ORDERING the staff to get us more waters for his medicenes.

First thing anyone who moans about this hotel are obviously hard to please or shall i say impossible. Service - was fantastic everyone is so friendly and will bend over backwards for you. Ana on the front desk was lovely and helpful, our maid in block 26 was brilliant our rooms were always spotless and vry vry clean, our mini bar was always filled, claudia the waitress at breakfast and serving drinks round the pool is amazing so so so nice and funny and a bloody hard worker, there are many more but il be here all day so last but not least our favourite the brilliant George the waiter in the mexican restaurant 3pm till 11pm is one of those guys tht would bend over backwards for you, example i asked him if there was any chocolate icecream as it was not in the freezer and he said give me a second, i left the restsurant to go back to the pool as george was busy, half an hour later he found us by the pool with chocolate icecream in a cup with a cone that he went out his way to get for me :0) tht is service. Say hi to george from adam and lisa thanks. Rooms- all decorated modern and all vry clean and well maintained. Pools- fantastic - There ars two pools one thts fun and lively and one thts quiet and chilled. Beach- Was ok, some days clearer then others which did not bother us as if u walk 5 to 10 mins up the beach to the left u will find a lagoon crystal clear water its beautiful. Food- was good and my boyfriend is a vry fussy eater and he enjoyed the food. Two things to try tht was our favourite mexican restaurant have the fillet steak and the japanese tapeyake restaurant.

They would have different nights like Mexican night BUT it's the same thing we had been eating. Rice, Stirfry meat, cold fries, WELL DONE burgers, flies over the fruit and vegetables, cold pizza and that is kept under light, breakfast is a whole nother story - SLOP!!! Restaurants - VERY HOT WITH NO A/C OR FANS Bars - The one at the pool stunk so bad everyday that you could not get out of the sun to enjoy a drink to save your sole because you couldn't breathe.

LMFAO we went to hime with two main questions \"he said I don't have time right now can you come back later?\" Hmmm so we went above his head to the manager and he was so so but at least he listened although after the conversation he did mention that there are MANY other hotels to stay at. Let me mention something here to you readers, My husband and I vacation alot and we had never experienced such a low life hotel as we did this past week. Now hey we have had other trips that were not all that great but we made do and had fun, this hotel NOT SO MUCH. On the plane ride home we looked at each other and all we could do is laugh and shake our heads. The only thing that we came up with is that the bell boy that took our bags to our room was the MOST happiest friendly guy.

This is an adults only hotel and although it is officially a five star hotel, First Choice give it four stars which is probably more accurate. The grounds are incredibly well kept and absolutely beautiful. The pool area is lovely but there are not enough parasols around the pools so, even though the hotel was nowhere near full, there was always a bit of a rush to get a sun bed with some shade. The beach area is nice (with more sun beds with shade there than around the pools). Some of the sun beds have seen better days but, hopefully, as the hotel has only recently been upgraded they will replace them in the near future. Also, the supply of beach towels sometimes ran out during the day. The refurbished rooms are excellent and look as attractive as they do in the photos; the bathrooms are very good with a big walk in shower. We found the bed quite hard, as were the pillows, but everyone has different requirements so what was hard for us would be OK for others. One criticism was that we sometimes found the cleaning was done very late in the day (once as late as 5.00pm which is ridiculous as we wanted to start getting ready for the evening around that time). However, the rooms were kept very clean with frequent linen changes. The restaurants were good; there are four in total (buffet, Oriental, Mexican and Italian) but as the weather was not as good as it could be and the hotel was not full, they occasionally closed one or two in the evening which meant that the choice was not always there. This was disappointing and they should stop doing it unless they want to be inundated with complaints. After all, one of the considerations in booking a hotel is the choice of la carte restaurants. However, the food overall was very good and most members of the staff are helpful and friendly. Having free wifi in the lobby is a nice bonus; it whiled away some time when it was raining to sit checking emails with a strawberry daiquiri by my side! There\u2019s also a coffee shop just off the lobby which served very good coffees but \u2013 again \u2013 frustratingly it did not always open. Another negative was the hotel frequently ran out of drinks - there was no tonic for the first three days we were there, then they ran out of tonic later in the trip; they also ran out of sparkling wine on at least two occasions. The hotel was nowhere near full and this just should not have happened. Someone needs to be managing the stock better, methinks! There is a free shuttle to Playa del Carmen which has to be booked the day before and there are a limited number of places. We did not take this opportunity but used a taxi so that we could be more flexible with regard to timings. It\u2019s a lovely town and well worth the visit. At the hotel, there is an option to upgrade (at a cost of \u00a320 a day) to the \u2018Privilege\u2019 option. This gave guests better rooms but what we \u2013 the non-Privilege guests \u2013 saw was a small offshoot of the dining room (although they still chose their food from the same buffet that we did!) and premium drinks. The other obvious benefit for them \u2013 and the thing we did not like - was the fact that there was a roped off area on the beach for Privilege guests, with beautiful sun beds and other benefits. Wonderful! BUT, it should not have been right in the middle of the beach used by everyone else! If the hotel wants to get a five star rating EVERYONE should get the benefit of the Privilege guests, even if we all have to pay a little more for it. There should not be such an \u2018in-your-face\u2019 \u2018them and us\u2019 scenario. Most of the people we spoke to had the same view. Apart from that \u2013 and apart from the abysmal weather \u2013 we had a wonderful time and I\u2019m sure you will too.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales/Llanelli", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed Holiday, but two weeks was to long\u201d", "Author": "naomigriff", "ReviewID": "UR115521556", "Content": "Just got home from the H10, me and my bf stayed here for two weeks.

Hotel has lovely pools with the entertainment team doing activities throughout the day,they were great. The staff in this hotel are SOOO lovely they cannot do enough for you. \"Ingrid, who works in the resturants greeting you as you arrive was lovely. During the first week I loved the food however after a week I was getting sick of it, it was Very repetitive. The a la carte resturants r very nice exspecially the Italian and Japanease. NNot all the resturants had air con which i thought was a bit mad. I really did not enjoy the breakfasts here i could not wait to get home to have a nice one. The room service was TERRIBLE.... Im not fussy but the first time we ordered we had a pizza, it turned up and it was not cooked proparly. Secound time we ordered the chips were nice again the pizza was not cooked. Third time we ordered our food never turned up. In the mexican resturant in the daytime the pizza there again would never be cooked enough. I did not like sitting in the privilage section of the La Hacienda Resturant I would always ask to sit with everyone else. Everytime I sat in the privilage section there would be lots of bugs around. and flys in the nets, i just didnt find it very clean there. The hotel suprisingly had lots of young couples staying here and there was a lively pool which was good to be around as it had a holiday atmosphere, but dont think it is full of young people getting drunk because it is not, we noticed it was more the 30,40 somethings being the loudest. I was soooo dissapointed with the hotels beach, we went to playa del carmen for the day which we loved and the sea and beach there is AMAZING, it had crystal clear water and white sand- a proper carribbean beach. Unfortunately the beach at the hotel is just as good as somewhere like cyprus/greece. :-( During the two weeks we had 3/4 days of rain.... On one of the days we went to Cancun, reception recommended we catch a mini white bus that will pass the outside of the hotel and then go onto the R1 bus in Cancun, we did this ourselves and it total it cost the two of \u00a39.00 return , which was fab. The Locals are just soo helpful. I loved mexico, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel however if i were to return I would stay in Playacar or in the Sensatori or the El Dorado Seaside Suites. I also heard someone talking about lots of women topless, that is crazy. You would probably find 2/3 women a day topless and none of them you would see walking around they would be lying on a lounger.

We booked through Thomson holidays on the standard A/I 7 nights holiday. In our experience, the grounds area beautiful, the room was more than adequate although they were sometimes a little slack on re-stocking your mini bar with water etc but we just used to fill our water bottles up at the pool bar. Water and soft drinks were easily accessible at all bars and restaurants. No reservation is required to dine in any of the al la carte restaurants. We ate in alternative ones each evening with sometimes a maximum of an hour wait but if you prepare for this then a pre dinner drink with new found friends is always pleasant. If you really dont want to wait then the buffet restaurant is available with a walk in and eat option. Unfortunately neither tthe Mexican or the Italian restaurants have airconditioning currently but i believe that is something that will be changed fairly soon. In summary: Beautiful gardens, tasty food in al la carte restaurants, although buffet not bad, we just enjoyed the waiter service and menu options in al la carte. Pool bar sometimes a little slow on service, but good variety of drinks available and many cocktails to try. Staff throughout the hotel were very friendly and courteous. Comfortable rooms. Many trips available to book, but suggest you ask about for other guest feedback as some trips sound fantastic and others really not good value for money. Currently it is Whale Shark season but i really do not recommend this trip as it cost \u00a3140 per person and we spent 10 minutes in the water with the whale sharks.

We wanted to make sure and let everyone know about our stay. I believe that you must know the reviewer before you accept their review. A homeless person would give this resort a 5 star rating, but a prince from Egypt would most likely give it a bad rating. We are a young couple from the states, middle class, and love to travel. We have stayed in this area of Mexico twice now, as well as many resorts and hotels all over the United States. We are not hard to please, and not generally very picky...but we absolutely do not tolerate dirty hotels and bad food. This resort has neither. First of all, the entertainment staff are truly special people. My wife and I wanted to stay much longer just to get to know them better. Yes, some of the stuff they do is a bit silly, but they worked incredibly hard to make our stay more enjoyable. If you don't know this, those guys live at the resort 24/7, and they work some insane hours. I would say this was the best part of this resort, and if any of the hotel management is reading this, they all need a raise!! We booked the Privilege package, and it was nice to have the upgraded room but if you are wondering whether to spend the extra money or not, I would say it's not a big deal. If your budget allows it, go ahead and spend the extra...we did get a few perks like a reserved area at the beach which was very nice. The chairs and beds fill up super early, so this was helpful. Rooms: Room was clean and very nice. Beds were firm but we slept just fine. After being out in the hot sun all day, had no troubles sleeping. Again, cleanliness is a big deal for us, and there were multiple mornings that I walked by a room being cleaned and I was impressed. They had a huge floor scrubber and polisher that they were using to wax the floors!!! At first I thought this was just a once a month deal or something, but I saw it almost every morning at a different room, so this must be their standard cleaning checklist. The rooms are definitely clean, nothing to worry about here. Beach: To all those writing bad reviews on this beach, honestly I am not sure what beach they went to, because this beach is one of the better beaches along this stretch of resorts. Don't believe me, discover for yourself. Take the beautiful walk up to the fresh water streams that flow into the ocean, some really cool fish in there! Along the way, you will pass some resorts that have pretty awful beaches, and then you will realize how nice Ocean Maya keeps their beach up. Pool: There is a couple pools here, both very large in size....so plenty of room to swim around. In the mornings the entertainment staff will do water aerobics, fun stuff! My wife roped me into this one of the mornings, but it was fun. Water is clean, and I always saw staff cleaning and tending to the pool. Food: This is always make and break for a lot of people, including us. If there is a weak spot at this resort, I would say it's the food. If they took a little more time, effort and money into upgrading the quality and presentation of their food, this resort might jump into that 4 to 4.5 star category real quick. Let me say that the food was not bad at all, my wife and I always found something to eat. The food areas are very clean and we never felt sick eating anything from this resort. The fruit was very fresh and the meets always fresh. The Japanese place was by far the best, make sure to eat there one of the nights. Staff: This goes both ways for me. Some of the staff clearly are over worked and under paid, and this shows in their service. The bartenders were always working hard, and I was impressed. Some of the other staff seemed to be fatigued or tired, probably due to the 16 hour days they are required to work. My suggestion to the hotel management, your staff reflect the quality and service of the resort as a whole....even a few bad apples will ruin the whole carton. I must mention the entertainment staff again, big shout out to Jess and Ricardo who took us to CocoBongo one of the nights! Wish we could get in touch again, we definitely miss you two!! Final Verdict: I give this resort a 3.8 rating, again for the money that we spent we got an incredible deal. We were NOT expecting this resort to be this nice, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a nice, small intimate feel to it, the flowers and vegetation make the resort absolutely beautiful. The walk to the beach every day was my favorite part. You do catch the sewer smell along the way, but it wasn't bad...I honestly am not sure what people complain about...I wouldn't have even noticed if I hadn't read everyone complaining about it. SUPER clean resort, VERY nice, GOOD food, and AMAZING vacation, would definitely go back to this resort in a heart beat. Got a great deal on this. Please feel free to contact me if you have any specific questions, would love to answer them.

The restaurant staff had been pre-warned and arrange balloons and confetti for the table. They also provided a small birthday cake and this was carried in by the restaurant manager (Cesar) and all of the waiters, who sang happy birthday (much to my husbands embarrasment). Our wedding anniversary was spend on one of the tours - the Columbus Cruise at Cancun. This was a couples tour with only 5 couples on each tour. This was a very enjoyable evening with great company and food, taken on one of the bays in Cancun and provided us with some great opportunities for photographs, including the setting of the sun over the bay.

To begin with the receptionists were friendly, the place look very welcoming. Our room wasn't ready for a few hours so they took care of our luggage and we went to explore. The beach here is VERY small but plenty of lounge chairs. 2 pools to cool off in. Yes they are right beside the sand so, ... YES there is sand in the pool. There are only 1 main bar at the lobby, a swim up bar at the pool and another small bar beside the pool side restaurant. There is a fair amount of strolling from the main building to wherever but the exercise never hurt me and there was always friendly people out to chat with(hint:as long as you are friendly too. A smile goes a long way). There is no bath tub in my room just a shower but big enough for 2 ;). the room had slightly stained and cracked walls but there was always work being done around the resort so it didn't ruin my day. the balcony was great, after a day out we always came back to a restocked, cleaned room. If they didn't reload the fridge with what I was looking for(water or beer) a quick call and it was delivered very quickly and guaranteed the next day it was full with that. My only complaints were that the shower floors were too smooth and needed some kind of texture in them, and I would have liked a lounge chair on my patio for after a day out we sat there, talked with other guests, and watched the wild life. There are 4 restaurants and all were first come first serve. The only one with any kind of line up was the Japanese but we accomodated for it. If I found something I didn't like, I didn't scream and holler, I got something else next time. Thats the fun of trying new things out. The gym was very small so if I couldn't get a machine I just went for a nice walk down the beach past other resorts. The beach water was very cloudy and rough not the best for swimming during my stay due to a storm that came by but it got better by the end of my stay. Leaving the resort to go out to the road to catch the bus to go shopping is quite a hike so take water or catch a cab from the main entrance. The main problem experienced the whole trip was the yelling from other guests who \"EXPECT THIS, or DEMAND THAT\" and the things they were whining about were very minor.

The bed sheets did not fit on the bed and kept bunching up. I woke up with a headache and backache every morning. We had a saw a small lizard in our room that was in the blinds. When we saw it we called the front desk and I told them and asked them to have someone come and get the lizard out of our room. The lady LAUGHED at me and said they would send someone over but after an hour no one came. We realized they would not help us and we slept with the lizard in our room! We also had ants in our room. The couch in our room had a nasty brown spot on it. The Food: TERRIBLE- most of it was cold, greasy, undercooked, raw or half cooked! My husband and I were eating at El Charro and a huge cockroach was on him, he flicked it off and it ran into the kitchen area. At La Hacienda, I ordered Salmon. IT WAS RAW and slimy in the middle. When I told the waitress, she said that that is the way that they cook it. I told her I would not eat raw fish! The last day that we were there the food was the worst and I only ate a few things off my plate. When the waitress came, she turned her back to me and said, \"You didnt finish\". I was in shock she talked to me like I was 5! The food was terrible. I lived on cheese, bread and dessert the last two days. Drunk People: For some reason there were a lot of people from England. A lot of 20 something\u2019s. Most of the time they were drunk, loud and obnoxious. We met a nice British couple who actually said they are ashamed of the way their fellow country men and women are acting. Breasts and more Breasts: Lots of women sunbathe and swim topless.

We booked this hotel through Expedia and booked our flights separately with Thomson Airways from London Gatwick to cancun, the flight time was approximately 10 hours. The hotel itself is situated just off of the main highway from Cancun to Tulum. We took a limo from the airport as we were celebrating our honeymoon, for this we used Lomas Travel (you can read my separate review). The hotel itself is owned by H10 who have a selection of hotels worldwide, there is another just north of the Ocean Maya. Once you have made your way from the highway to the hotel you will be welcomed by a large modern hobby containing several shops, a bar, lounge area, excursion desk and coffee bar. There is a general shop selling cigarettes, drinks, sun cream etc all at your usual over inflated prices. There is also a craft shop, jewellery shop and leather shop. A free shuttle bus runs everyday to Playa del Carmen but you need to book the day before. It leaves around 1pm and comes back at 5pm.Above the lobby is the spa which has various treatments, watch out for the daily specials. There is also a hot and cold Jacuzzi situated outside-something I am sure not too many guests find. To get to this you need to go through the spa centre. On the first floor with the Spa is the gym. As you move out through the lobby you find an outside seating area. In this area there is now the Italian, Japanese and buffet restaurants (the Italian which was down on the beach burned down on the first night we stayed at the hotel). In the evening they also have some evening shows and a disco but they are not the best I have seen. The rooms at the Ocean Maya are of a good quality, as you would expect for a recently refurbished hotel boasting 5 stars. We booked a honeymoon suite which included the privilege upgrade (you can also pay extra for the privilege upgrade when you check in. This allows you to book In ai the a la carte restaurants, premium drinks and an exclusive area on the beach and in the buffet restaurant. When we arrived we were told that these had been over booked and that they were upgrading us to a Romance suite. The difference between these rooms was that the Jacuzzi should have been outside on the balcony but in the Romance suite it is inside, there is also a lounge area in your room which is great for chilling out in. The draw back is that the balcony is very small, it only has enough room for a small table and chairs. This didn\u2019t bother us too much as we liked the room to escape from the heat and there were quite a few mosquito\u2019s about. Down by the beach there is a very limited beach area, if you are looking for an amazing beach this hotel does not have it. What it does have is hammocks, 2 swimming pools (one of which has a swim up bar ), water sports, the exclusive area for the privilege guest with Balinese beds and luxury cushions. The Mexican restaurant is also located here and is open for snacks at lunch. The food at the Ocean Maya Royale on the whole was good. We stayed for 2 weeks and we were just starting to get bored with the selection. The quality of the a la carte restaurants was good and the buffet restaurant is one of the better ones I have been too. There are international foods available during lunchtime and the evening at the buffet restaurant near the lobby. El Charro at the beach does burgers and nachos at lunch time and Mexican in the evening. Another thing you can also order pizza from the bar in the lobby late at night. On the whole I would definitely recommend this hotel to people, we had a few problems with the room and issues with room service but apart from those minor set backs we had a very enjoyable stay at the Ocean Maya Royale. I don\u2019t think that you will be disappointed if you visit this hotel. The shuttle bus to Playa del Carmen is good, there is plenty of shops selling the normal tourist things and plenty of bars and restaurants. Expect to pay around 100 pesos for 4 beers. Regarding trips and prices for things I wanted to finish off with some information about that. There are plenty of trips available at the hotel and as you have probably guessed they are somewhat more expensive then outside of the hotel but be warned. We took the shuttle bus down to Playa del Carmen and booked some trips down there, we used 2 separate companies. The first was OK but we had a guide who didn\u2019t speak much English and they switched the new bus halfway through the trip for a bus that misfired and the second was a disaster. After paying a deposit that day they collected us from the hotel, we paid the balance but then we were told that the trip had been cancelled, we were left on the curb side. We went to the shop and asked for a refund but they did not have enough money to give us it back because the man with the money had gone on another trip, we are only talking $120 not much. After arguing for 45 minutes we negotiated a private tour so not all was lost. You can catch the local bus to Tulum, Coba and Cancun and it costs around $5. Entrance to Tulum and Coba is around $5 so if you feel brave you can save yourself a lot of money. We only found that out after we had already been. A taxi to Cancun is about 900 pesos, on the way back haggle and you can get it for around 700 pesos or take the bus from the end of the road.

When we arrived they were giving out glasses of champagne to enjoy while we checked in, which didn't take long and the staff where very friendly. Are room wasn't ready for another half hour so we went to the bar and enjoyed the all inclusive, the bar and lobby are beautiful, and there is comfortable seating in a very spacious area. You can get almost every cocktail imaginable even if it isn't on the menu (recommend the 'Miami vice') big selection of spirits but if you want the well known brands such as southern comfort, jack daniels and dissarano you have be one of the 'Privileged' guest's. Luckily am a big corona lover cause this was really the only beer you could get on tap, god knows what you do if you only like cider cause I don't think you can get it... We ended up staying around the bar making friends with other couples and sampling the different cocktails for a good 2 hours before we headed off to the room. To get to the rooms you walk out into an open seating area with a big water feature, this is where 3 of the restaurants are (Italian, Japanese and the main buffet restaurant) past this you head down steps that surround a very romantic waterfall area (lots of pictures of this on the website). The grounds are beautiful and on our short stroll to the room we noticed plenty off wildlife, iguana's are easy to come by and if your lucky you can get a visit from the white nosed raccoon. The room was more then I expected, we had 2 double beds, mini fridge that was filled with water, beer, coke, fanta, sprite (this got refilled each day), aircon was awsome, dont know what i would have done without it. The hotel has 2 pools, only really spent time in the one with that bar and was lovely to just cool down and have a beer when you got too hot from sun bathing, we never had a problem getting a deck chair, even one with a parasol (but we would put our towels down on the way to breakfast about half 8), the only thing I can fault was the beech, its not the beech you would go to spend the day snorkelling and swimming because as alot of people say their is alot of seaweed, but if you walk to the left past the volleyball court and keep going down the beech for about 15 mins you end up at a stunning lagoon with clear water full of fish and golden sand (it does have beds, deckchairs and stuff but this is for the local hotel guests) don't forget to take some bottles of water with you know because its a bit out of the way if you get thirsty and in mexico you are always thirsty lol. I found it really hard to understand how some people could not enjoy the food? Their was so much choice which changed daily, some people must eat in some pretty fancy places if they thought the hotels food was not up to scratch. Our favourite restaurant was the Italian, even when we struggled to finish the dessert after the previous 3 courses left us bursting haha. If anybody is going this time of season you might be worried what the weather will be like seen as the forecasts on iPhone's and the like say thunderstorms everyday. No need to worry, there might be a 5 minute downpour in the middle of scorching day. Some days will be cloudy and a bit miserable but your looking at maybe 2 out 7 days. When the weather is bad the lobby tends to be really busy because everybody is just chilling at the bar and taking advantage of the free internet, the animation team provide games to keep people entertained, got roped into a hardcore game of 'Jenga' which involved tequila shots, cheers Ricardo! Playa del Carmen is well worth a visit, its got so much to other, you can get a free shuttle bus at 12:00 and pick up at 5:00 but make sure you book the day before as its first come first serve and it only takes about 25 people. 5th avenue is the tourist hotspot with loads of shops, bars and restaurants, be prepared to get harassed by the local's showing you their stalls. When you get to the beech you will be amazed, the nicest beech i have ever been on, so clean and spacious. In my opinion I don't think it is worth going privileged, $50 a cople a day is no way worth some beds on a beach and local spirits, the standard services are more then good enough. All the staff and TBH all Mexicans just seem to be happy all the time, very friendly people. Overall we had a fantastic holiday, and the hotel went beyond all expectations. Would defiantly go again and I think it would be hard for any couple to not enjoy themselves at this hotel.

Admittedly, for our last trip to the area we stayed at a 5-star property and this time, we were looking for something more budget-concious. And I guess that is exactly what we found. All in all, you really do get what you pay for. Pros: -the rooms were clean and spacious -the pools were very nice -landscaping at the resort is lovely -most the service we received was courteous and helpful -good availabilty on chairs by the pool and ocean Cons: -the beach area. It wasn't swimmable at all the entire time we were there. There was so much seaweed/grass that the ocean was black, although we did see workers come through once or twice a day to try and clean up the beach area as much as possible. -drink service on the beach. Several days we were laying out by the beach for 8+ hours and only had someone come by once or twice per day (even with tipping). At the last resort we stayed, they had waitresses come through for drink orders every hour or so-- much more convenient. -the food. The food is just not great. Don't get me wrong, it's edible and if food isn't all that important to you, I'm sure won't have a problem with any of the restaurants, but I enjoy good food and this wasn't. The buffets are typical bland hotel-catered food. The Italian restaurant offered overcooked meats and fish. The Mexican place was alright, but not a ton of variety. My favorite was probably the Japanese restaurant, but even there the entree was a disappointment (though do fill up on appetizers, those were great!) -following through on offered services. When we booked through the hotel website, they claimed they were offering free shuttle service to and from the airport, however we discovered upon arrival at the airport that no such service existed. We ended up having to overpay for a taxi since we had no other means of getting to the hotel. And the hotel did nothing to try and assuage the issue.

The water isn't beautiful right on the resort, but the beach is kept very clean. Not really anything they can do about the water now that the resort is built on it can they? The showers are strange in that there is only half a door so the floor gets completely flooded, but we just put our beach towels down. I have stayed at H10 Ocean Coral & Turquesa in Puerto Morales (about 15 minutes closer to Cancun) 4 times and while it is much larger resort, I think I liked it slighlty better, but it depends on what you are looking for. Ocean Maya is adults only. Ocean Coral & Turquesa is not. Spa is fabulous at both resorts and I have found the staff to be very pleasant (especially the restaurant wait staff and the Privelege Beach section waiter/waitress who are generally fabulous). My only real complaint is that I can't seem to get the room I reserve. I always go with a friend and ask for double beds but regardless of my early request on the reservation, I always get the king sized bed then they have to change my room and it is never ready and/or as nice a room or has the ocean view as I was guaranteed when I purchased the H10 \"Vacation\" club (i.e. floating week timeshare). It's not a huge issue, but it is frustrating and I often spend at least the first night of my vacation feeling a bit \"taken\" in having paid for something I am not receiving. I am not one to complain or want to move once I am unpacked, so I generally just pout and deal with it. All that to say, if you have a special request, you may want to call the resort direct the day before arriving and see if you can get that request taken care of - I think I may try that my next time around.

Our mini fridge was always stocked with pop, water, and cervezas. :) The ocean view room was very \"worth it\".. we woke up each morning and opened the curtains to a view overlooking the swim up bar, beach, and ocean. We loved being next to the swim up bar because we could enjoy the music all day, too. The beach was beautiful and well-maintained. We woke up early one morning and snagged first row. There were always activities and night time shows going on if we were interested. I won a surf contest in the pool one day. Ha! The food was nothing like I heard about most all-inclusive resorts. We loved the variety, and the Japanese steak house was our favorite for dinner. We were also given a private table next to the pool with a bottle of champagne and five course feast one night to celebrate our new life together! Make sure to let them know if you'd like a romantic dinner by the pool, too. I'm not sure if you must tell them your are on your honeymoon or if the dinner is for all lovebirds. I recommend visiting the Mayan Ruins and beach at Tulum and/or Xel Ha if you've never been. The water at Tulum was unreal(wear your swimsuits)! Also we loved Coco Bongo (so much we stayed till 5AM!) which is an awesome night club that Ocean Maya provided transportation and information about. My favorite parts of the Ocean Maya were the friendliness of the staff, beautiful beach and landscaping, the Japanese and Mexican restaurants, coconut ice cream, updated rooms, and the two pools!

Our refrigerator was restocked daily w/ water, sodas, beer & liquor (for free). The pools were sparkling clean always, but note that the pool and pool bar close VERY early. All food and drinks are at the front of the resort after 8pm. This is a resort that is beautiful but spread out so be prepared to do alot of walking.

Tried the Japanese and Italian a la carte resteraunts and both were great! Japanese was our favorite, went twice in the four nights we were there. The rooms were extremely spacious and well done. The bed wasn't the best, but we had no trouble sleeping after our relaxing days by the beach! Loved having our own balcony and the well stocked mini bar. The staff was great and extremely helpful. Gave us a free romantic dinner since it was our honeymoon which was scrumptious! Everyone you passed had a smile and a hello. The spa was amazing.

If a nice beach at your resort is secondary, then there's a lot to recommend about this place. It's beautiful and it's friendly. The grounds are gorgeous and well-landscaped. There are flowers and lovely swaying palms everywhere. The rooms are nice large, nicely decorated and had the best bed I've experienced in Mexico. The showers take a while to warm up most of the time, but they get there. The staff was wonderful as well. They great you at your shuttle with smiles and glasses of champagne. We were shown to our room, but we ran into a somewhat lost couple that obviously wasn't. I don't know why the difference. But everyone you see along the way offers you a smile and an \"hola\". They were all kind and attentive. There are two pools--a deeper one with a shallow ledge around the side, and another with a swim up bar. There are plenty of places to eat. Yookoso, the asian restaurant; Dolce Vida, the Italian restaurant now located at the back of La Hacienda since it burned down; Charro, snack bar during the day and a la carte Mexican at night; and La Hacienda, the buffet restaurant. The food was good, though not great, and had a nice rotating selection. There are also several bars and a coffee shop. Our best meal was at Dolce Vida, but we had most of our meals at La Hacienda. There's nightly entertainment, which we saw some of and was fun. They have a place to book tours right in the lobby, which we used for two tours. There are shpps and free wifi in the lobby as well. The place feels a bit isolated. It's not, really. They're shoulder to shoulder with other resorts in both directions. But it is far, far back from the road. They offer a daily shuttle to Playa del Carmen (12-5 daily booked in advance). There are also taxi cabs. It's different from when we were in Cancun, though, and could simply go outside and catch a bus any time we wanted. They offer pretty much everything you need right on the resort. I really wanted to go into Playa to do some shopping, but our chance was ruined by lousy weather. The bad part is the beach. Most of the beach front has been replaced by a wall/boardwalk. There's beach on either side, but the water was never as clear as what we had in Cancun. Plus, the entire time we were there the red flags were out. Maybe we just had bad luck. We took a walk up the beach and found that most resorts had sandbagged their beach fronts and were little better. Speaking of walking up the beach, head left and walk to where there's a fresh water stream flowing into the ocean, it's really nice. You'll be crossing across other resorts beaches, but don't worry, all beaches are federal property in Mexico. In all, I would definitely recommend it. However, if you're really after the beach I'd look elsewhere.

The grounds are amazing and extremely well kept and designed in such a way that the local wildlife move freely around, the wildlife you see is fantastic. The rooms are large and expectionally clean and very comfortable. There are four resteraunts within the complex: La Hacienda which caters a la carte for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is a wide and varied selection of food all of which is delicious (even if you don't know what it is...you've got try it) Yookoso is the Japanese resteraunt, you can have an intimate dinner for two, or sit with others as you watch the chef perform his magic as he prepres your food in front of you. La Dolce Vita is the Italian, the food here was fantastic. I can't say more than that. El Charro is the Mexican resteraunt poolside. During the day it provides a full and varied a la carte menu throughout the afternoon, again the food is beautiful. Then in the evening it is transformed into a traditional mexican menu, again fantastic. There are two pools next to each other, one has the swim up bar ( for those in the party spirit) or if you are there for a more relaxing time there is the larger second pool. That's the decor and the facilities covered. Now what made this holiday just that little bit more special was the staff. All the staff are on the go all day every day working as hard as they can to make sure the place looks fantastic and you, as the customer, are happy. from the groundstaff, cleaners, maintenance guys and supervisors moving about the place each has a smile on their face and are always approachable if you have a query or request. If they can't help then within minutes you will have someone with you who can. They deserve a lot of praise for the work they do. The bar staff and waiting on staff also deserve praise alone. The service is amazing whether you are seated having a meal or lazing poolside, they are constantly on the go to ensure you have a drink and are comfortable.Then you have the entertainment staff....they are enthusiastic, young and work hard during the day to get as many people involved in events as they can then in the evening they put on themed evenings in the theatre. Superb. We have just come back from spending 11 days here and loved every second. On an individual note Maria Lopez (sub director) is fantastic, approachable and welcoming.

Upon arrival, we approached the main check-in desk but were diverted to the Privilege check-in desk instead. I did not purchase the Privilege option, but after some back-and-forth with the desk clerk, was informed that we would receive the privilege perks, but not a privilege room, since they were all king rooms and we wanted a double room. DO NOT spend extra money for the \"privilege\" services. Unless you drink like a fish and need premium liquor, it's not worth it. The privilege section of the beach is behind a glass wall and is the furthest away from the pools and beach areas. On the one day that we did park ourselves at the privilege section of the beach (only because there were no umbrellas available at the pool), an attendant brought us two bottles of water in an ice bucket, but they were warm and the bucket contained no ice. No one ever returned to take drink or food orders. The two pools are absolutely beautiful, but each morning, staff cleaned the pools (with bleach!) while guests were lounging and swimming in them. Yuck! At a high-end resort, guests don't want to see ongoing maintenance, let alone be exposed to noxious chemicals. These things should be done after hours once guests have departed. Ok, now the food. Yuck, yucker, and yuckiest. I know that many all-inclusives don't splurge on food, but the buffets were full of strange and unrecognizable dishes, very few fresh vegetables, and questionable, gelatinous mystery desserts.

My stay was probably less enjoyable than it could have been due to a head cold I had / the fact that my ears wouldn't equalize the entire time I was there - in no way the resort's fault! :) The hotel is more in the Cancun Riviera area than the Mayan Riviera area and the beach is really sub par. The food at the buffet was lacking in variety and wasn't the greatest. The disco was tiny and empty. We went into Playa del Carmen for most dinners - the one a la carte dinner I had at the resort wasn't bad. On the day of check out, I left my room with suitcase in tote to head to the front desk to check out. They couldn't check me out without the lock and key for the room safe (a bit of a hassle - the room safe should be combination locked / not with a key) so I returned to the room. The room door was open and a hose had been run from the bathroom out to where some men were working. The key and lock to the safe were gone. The tip I left for the maid was gone and no one seemed to know what had happened to either. When I went back to the front desk to explain that hotel staff had been in my room they delayed me for a while to investigate - I was getting pretty upset as the 4 of us were leaving for the airport. I guess things like this probably don't happen very often, but it was EXTREMELY frustrating at the time - I felt like I was being shaken down for the key deposit (which they ended up relenting on).

Location-20-30min away from cancun airport (depending on how many other stops you have while in trasport) Grounds-very well kept. birds, trees, iguanas, lizards, rodants are great. Rooms-kept clean and redone. beds were super hard. we asked for mattress pad and was told they didn't have any (talking to another couple later they told us that they received a pad after they asked for one). so we ended up taking the mattress out of the hidaway bed from th couch in our room, ordered 6 more pillows to put on top of that and then piled some more blankets on that. it worked ok. we are used to soft beds. The maids must have missed our room one day for cleaning, not a big deal to us. Pool-well kept, clean, good temp, not very crowded. Beach-always seemed to be enough chairs. looked nicer and larger then other resorts nearby. water was VERY murky compared to the beach water in the town of playa del carmen playa del carmen-10-20min cab ride (around $15-$20) will get you to 5th avenue...the touristy strip/street with all the shops and stands to buy things at. neat little street. a block or two down is the beach. we were adventurous and took the Collectivo (public transport) into town for 15-20pesos (roughly $1.50-$2). you have to walk the 10-20min down the resort road to get to the main highway, cross that road and wait at the 'bus stop'.get off on the last stop, walk down a few blocks and it puts you at 5th ave. not hard and people are helpful. cozumel-ferry is $13 one way and is right off the beach by 5th ave in playa del carmen.about a 25min ferry ride. very pretty. food-we are foodies and the food here is pretty much just hotel food. they try, but we were always wishing for something a bit more mature for the pallet. it is edible and for most would be satisfing. entertainment-we did not attend any entertainment but everynight there was something. karaoke, DJ, sax player, fiesta ect... drinks-pretty good. mojitos were yummy! and it was easy to find a bar to get a drink. wifi-in the lobby only wishes-more variety of eating, better food selection, prettier water in the beach, softer beds. overall this is a good place to stay. every place has its negatives but nothing at this hotel would lead me to tell people not to stay there. it is what you make it.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic and great value for money!\u201d", "Author": "MelandJudy", "ReviewID": "UR114337583", "Content": "Food was fantastic and there was a selection of meat and fish that was cooked in front of you every evening together with a Chef's speciality.

Taxi arrived at resort and we were greated with champange. Check-in was painless, then we were escorted to our rooms. Nice and clean. beds were a little hard but we managed. Hotel faciities were lovely. Our villa was close to the pool/beach but far from everything else. Its an all-inclusive resort with about 2-3 different places to eat for breakfast/lunch but with a few more options for dinner. Food was good with plenty variety. Lovely staff. I have to mention the few staff members that really went the extra mile for us: Javier, who greeted us on arrival. Very sweet and funny. Amy Jean and Nallely who were apart of the entertainment staff, introduced us to a game of \"spoons\" which we played with other guests. We had soo much fun. Marianna and Azucenna who were apart of the food services were sooo pleasant and helpful. One negative were the many couples we saw. Almost the entire resort was full of couples which made it hard for us to really mingle with the other guests. Except for Becky and Jim who were the sweetest, most welcoming, and cutest couple there!!. So if you're single..this isnt the place for you. Another negative were the spa prices...they were equal to the prices in Beverly Hills. So we opted for a cheaper place in Playa del Carmen!!

The rooms are large and well decorated and kept spotlessly clean. The beds are huge the matresses are firm but not uncomfortable, and there is a free mini bar that is re stocked every day. I think all rooms have a balcony, we were told we had a pool view but we had a massive palm tree outside which did not worry us as it gave us a bit more privacy. The gardens were spectacular and well maintained there was not a leaf or a blade of grass out of place, in fact there was not so much as a cigarette end to be found anywhere in the grounds. There was plenty of wildlife to watch as well. The staff from the litter pickers right up to management were friendly with a ready smile and greeting as soon as they met you nothing was too much trouble and they all worked exceptionall hard to make our holiday special. The pool area was plenty big enough with ample sun beds and the beach was only a few yards further, there was no need to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve a bed there was always plenty, though shade around the pool was at a premium. The beach was soft white sand and the sea was as warm as bath water. There were 2 days when the sea weed got quite bad but the staff were quick to clear it and it did not stop us swimming in the sea. The Italian restaurant burnt down while we were there but this did not reflect on the efficiency of the service in the other restaurants, We never had to wait for a table and the waiters were really attentive our plates were cleared as soon as we put our knives and forks down and our drinks replenished as soon as the glass was getting low. The food though not cordon blue was excellent well cooked and presented and plenty of variety. My only critism of the entire fortnight was that they cremated the bacon, other than that the food could not be faulted. A word of warning beware of some of the sauces if you dont like hot spicey food I was caught out a couple of times so if I wasnt sure I would sample before loading my plate. The entertainment was varied and the animation team worked hard without being too intrusive, I have to mention the little waitresses in the bar who worked tirelessly racing about with trays laden with various bright cokoured cocktails they did not stop all night yet still had time for a beaming smile and goodnight at the end of a busy shift and the men behind the bar were unbelievable mixing dozens of cocktails all at once, another word of warning they are over generous with their measures of alcohol so allthough the cocktails taste lovely they do come with quite a kick.

Good variety of food in buffet really lovely plenty of choice and changed regulary so always fresh. There was always nice salads, fruit, ham, cheese, taco's, chips, rice then a variety of other things that changed daily. Yeah you can get bored but use your imagination you can made toasties at breakfast and sandwiches etc with food availlable. Theres hot sauces etc that can spice up some of the bland food. Also enjoyed the a la carte it was nice for a change. Staff were really nice we did tip and perhaps that made a difference but we always had a drink in front of us and it was refilled before we had time to ask. Imelda was particulary attentive. You had to be up early if you wanted a parasol and a bed at the pool as they were both scarce but there was always beds on the beach but it was a bit hot for us. We put towels out at 6.30 and sometimes struggled to get a parasol. We walked along the beach every day there is some lovely views the beach is quite nice and yeah the seaweed was bad and some parts of the sea were really dirty but thats just nature if we wanted a swim we used the pool. You get beach towels and we changed them daily no charge but its probably an idea to take your own as we did find some people tried to use our beds. The main thing we loved was that it was adult only hotel, if only the flight was the same!! There was a fire when we stayed and we were evacuated out of our room at 3.00am to 7.00am. The hotel staff were amazing and kept us up to date and were really helpful and attentive. But Thomson rep didn't do a thing I half expected him to come and see us the next day to make sure we were OK but we heard nothing really disappointed. We paid for a sea view room and if you squinted out the window and I stood on my tiptoes you could see a small bit of beach so dont waste money for this it was handy to be near the pool though but not for the amount of money paid to upgrade think i would take my chance next time. Great choice of drinks included without upgrading to privelage. There was smirnoff, absolut, havana rum, bacardi corona on tap and a whole lst of others and it was typical spanish measures.

We paid about the same as the Ocean Coral so we expected it to be similar. It was not. We've been to the Cancun/Playa area about 8 times and we know what to expect. I felt even with the low price we paid, we should have gotten better. PROS: - Rooms were nicely decorated and spacious. - Pool was nice and refreshing. - A la carte restaurants were better than the buffet and atmosphere was nice. - Grounds were immaculate. - Front desk staff was nicer than most I've experienced. CONS: - Upon checking in and them knowing it was the start of our honeymoon, they put us in a room with 2 double beds. Really??? lol. They changed it after we asked, but come on!! A little customer service please! - There should have been about 100 more pool loungers. I've never been to a resort with so few. - Food at the buffet was DISGUSTING. And it was just okay at the other restaurants. - Beds were hard as a rock. Worse than your average Mexico hotel. - Drinks were AWFUL. I stopped drinking alcohol it was so bad. Bartenders were RUDE. Heard many other people comment on the same thing while we were there. - Service was terrible. It took my husband 25 minutes at one point to get us two drinks. NO, I'm not exaggerating. I thought he got lost, but when I went to find him, he was sitting on a stool at the bar being ignored. - Coffee shop opens at 4pm?!? What??? - Swim up bar smallest I've ever seen. - Beach/ocean water gross (But I knew that going in, so I don't count this against them). - \"Towel game\" worst than any other resort I have EVER stayed at. EVER. You absolutely have to have a towel on a pool lounger before 6:15am or you won't get one. I understand the resort can't control people but they should remove towels if the chairs stay unattended for more than an hour. Also, adding a lot more chairs (because there is room) would help. Overall, we knew we weren't getting luxury, but it was worse than we expected. Sister hotel in Puerto Morelos is MUCH, MUCH better!

Staff: The staff, for the most part, was incredible. Claudia in the main dining room was incredible, as were Javier and Eber at the pool bar. The front desk staff were decent, but we had to argue with them on several occasions to make things right. Room: Our first room was hot. The A/C was not working well. I complained 7 times before I insisted that they move us. I requested that they give us privilege bands, which they ultimately did. The bands were good, but ultimately not worth the hassel of moving rooms. USA Transfers: GREAT. We stopped for some food on the way down. I unintentionally overpaid the driver, and he came back in to give me back the money. He was incredibly honest, and not many people would have done that. Great for USA Transfers. Other guests: It baffled me how rude some of the guests were to the bartenders and waitstaff, like they were entitled to things. It was plain rude. If you treat the staff with respect, I assure you, they will take great care of you. Food: The food was not great, and got old by the end of the trip. We are not picky people and found food we liked, but a few more days would have been difficult. The Japanese place (at the hibachi) was great. Jesus was excellent. Utlimately, you get what you pay for. Next time, we will pass on the all-inclusive, and if we head back down to Playa Del Carmen area again, we will spend more money for a better place.

Rm 3601 is ground floor & right near the pool, beach, and the Italian & Mexican Restaurants. People did rise early to claim their lounge chairs but there was always enough to go around. It appears our beach was much nicer then our neighboring hotels but those that snorkel complained it was cloudy. Wait staff incredible, especially Claudia in dining room, Karina & Azetera (white flower) on the beach and Perla at customer service. Some complained about the food selections but my sister and I were happy with our choices. Liked the Italian restaurant the best, Japanese was ok for the experience, food OK. Didn\u2019t try the Mexican as we had enough exposure during our stay. Entertainment staff were great and really tried to involve you during the day, loved Amy Jean. Only suggestion would be to get a large printout of the ongoing activities during your stay. Perla did give us this on request. Would be good to be given upon check in just to know what is going on. Also, would suggest a schedule of the daily dinner buffet as these are themed and would be good to know ahead of time before scheduling specialty restaurants. We missed a fab seafood night as we had already made reservations at the Italian. They provide free shuttle to Playa del Carmen each day @ 12:00 to return @ 4:45.

Also, the shows they put on were really cool! Transportation to the city cost about 20 dollars American one way but going downtown is worth it. If you book with the hotel, depending on the bar it will cost anywhere between 40-70 dollars and they generally provide transportation and all you can drink service. Going by yourself is also fun and the town seems very safe.

Lots of iguanas and a few of the \"raccoons\" who would actually come and take treats if you offered them. Resort was small enough that you could walk everywhere comfortably - no need for a shuttle. Pools were great - one without the pool bar was shallow at one end and had ledges that were perfect for laying in the water to read a book, or sitting to talk and have a drink. The other pool had a bar, and a section that had built-in lounges with jacuzzi. We asked for a room close to pools and we got one, but it had no view, being behind the pool-side restaurant, but it was okay. Rooms are not large. We had two double beds, sheets were kind of scratchy, but everything was very clean. There was a desk with 3 drawers and fridge. One chair ; closet had shelves for storage and a safe. No mirror in the room except bathroom, which made it hard when both of us were trying to get ready. Bathrooms were very nice - loved the floors and the big shower and vessel sink. We ate at the Hacienda buffet usually, and they kept our drinks filled, and quickly took away empty plates. I always found plenty to eat, but by the last day, was a little bored - not too much variety, day to day, but I I thought everything was good. Tons of fresh fruit, of course. There was always a variety of meats, beef, pork, chicken, pastas, salads, breads. I thought it was kind of odd that there wasn't a lot of authentic Mexican food. One night, they served Mexican outside, and had great tacos, but not a lot of other dishes that I would've expected. The second night we were there, the Italian restaurant burned to the ground - a little scary for us to watch (it's VERY hard to get fire-fighting equipment through resort so practically impossible to put out.) There was also a Japanese restaurant; we went there one night, but that night, they were serving Italian (since no Italian restaurant!) it was elegant and food was good - not great, but good. I think that overall, the resort's food was kind of bland. I didn't really encounter anything that was really tasty, or a surprise. But again, I always found something to eat, so not really a complaint. There was a coffee cafe where we went for some good frappes, etc., but it was near the lobby and restaurant, a long way to walk from room and it was closed most of the time. I think one of my biggest complaints is that I would've really liked to have coffee on my balcony in the morning. They had the one-cup coffee makers in the room, but coffee was terrible, and usually didn't include creamer. There was a smaller restaurant right by the pool that served lunches, if they would've served coffee in the morning, it would've been perfect. it was just very inconvenient to have to get dressed up in the morning to walk up to restaurant for coffee, and if you asked for it \"to go\", they would give you a styrofoam cup with no lid. It WAS nice, however, that they kept the room fridges stocked with Coke, water, Sprite, orange, beer, etc. My other complaint is that it was VERY difficult to get a chair by the pool. I got up and went to pool at 6 a.m. the second morning, and found almost every chair was already draped with a towel or book; apparently, people claimed them before going to bed, or got up really early. They did this at both pools and on the small beach. There were not enough chairs or umbrellas to accommodate, and this was the off-season, so not sure what they do when hotel is busy! I had a sunburn and even with sunblock, I couldn't take the sun without umbrella all day, so I found myself getting up WAY early and joining the \"chair stealer\" crowd! I think they could alleviate this by just putting out more chairs and umbrellas. There was a set-up at the pool to paint pottery, but the boy who ran it did not speak any English, and I never once saw anyone do that. The entertainment staff came around and asked people to play volleyball or aerobics, but they were nice if you said no. It was usually pretty easy to get drinks at pool - they had someone who came around. However, drinks at the pool will NOT get you drunk - very, very little alcohol in ANYthing that I ordered. In fact, there was not a single thing that I drank anywhere at the resort that had more than a hint of alcohol. But I didn't really mind, or I'd have gone to bar and asked for more. Oh - one strange thing - - they do not give you straws! The only place at resort that you could get a straw was at the bar in lobby. We would got there and get a drink after breakfast, just so we could have a straw the rest of the day at pool. Seemed very odd to me. We went into Playa del Carment to shop a few times - it's a quick taxi from resort - 7 or 8 miles? Anyway, it's $20 each way, although we usually got our return trip a few dollars cheaper. We didn't go on any excursions this trip, although I've done Xel-ha and Tulum before and I recommend doing those. Resort has vendors come in and set up about every other night to sell souveniers, jewelry, art, etc., but much, much better deals could be done in town. This was a very nice resort, and unbeatable for the price. Great place to lie around, soak up the sun, and relax!", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic staff, shame about the food.\u201d", "Author": "Braveheart57", "ReviewID": "UR110701207", "Content": "We have just returned from the Ocean Royale yesterday and although we did enjoy our holiday, you paid your money so you may as well make the best of it,but it just wasn't great. Here is our opinion on the holiday. Sun Loungers:- to get a lounger with a parasol you need to get up a 6am, YES 6 IN THE MORNING. On our first morning we wakened up at 5.45 and went out on the balcony to have a look at the view and I was shocked to see the towels round the pool. This went on every single day of our holiday despite us complaining to the rep. To get a lounger with some kind of shade you need to be up and 6am every day. Its just ridiculous. Same in the evening, after dinner, trying to get a table on the terace is a joke Nothing to do with space, there simply is not enough tables and chairs for the amount of guests. Restuarants:- The buffet restuarant, the food was nearly always cold, meat undercooked and very repetitive. Mexican, not to bad but not great. Itaian, this was really nice but unfortunately it burned down whilst we were there (nothing to do with me, I wasn't cooking:) Japanese, this was lovely apart from the chef reminding us to tip him before we left. How could we forget, he said it about 3 times. Rooms:- the room was nice, we upgraded to a sea view and it was lovely. The only downside was it wasn't cleaned until late afternoon. One night the maid turned up a 6.30 to clean the room. and on 4 occasions we had to phone for clean towels. Priviledge Section, not worth the money. $20 per person per day and for your money you get branded drinks, you MAY get shown into the priviledge section of the dining room and you can go to the priviledge section of the beach which have the ballanese beds. Beach:- the beach is not very nice. There is a small bit at the hotel that is ok but it doesn't compare to the beach at Cancun. Pools:- the pool bar is at the \"quiet\" pool so it was NOT QUIET. The other pool has the pool games i.e volley ball etc. Staff:- the staff were fantastic, sooo hard working and nothing is to much trouble for them. I can't speak highly enough of them. The hotel needs to address these issues and if it does things will certainly improve.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cAwesome trip - loved it!!\u201d", "Author": "rockies2011", "ReviewID": "UR110644330", "Content": "My husband & I met our English friends at the resort and stayed for 10 great days.

Accommodation and service We did have a few problems with our room but we reported this to the reception staff and they offered us another room which was much better. We had a problem with the TV in our second room but this was dealt with promptly by maintenance. We feel that the staff were very accomodating and welcoming. The staff always greeted you with a smile and a polite hello and they could not do enough for you. Food The food was excellent, always plenty of choice and the food was of a very good standard. We would recommend that you dine in the mexican restaurant and ask Jorge for a special mayan coffee - it is out of this world! We were very sorry to see that Dolce Vita Restaurant (Italian) destroyed by fire during our stay and we hope that the hotel will be able to reconstruct the Dolce Vita very soon. We were delighted to hear that whilst the Italian restaurant had been destroyed the staff from this restaurant had been kept on and the hotel were continuing to offer its Italian menu in an alternative location within the hotel as soon as the day after. Well done!! Excursions offered by Thomson We went on quite a few excursions with Thomson and some of the excursions left us a little disappointed as we felt that not all excursions were good value for money. We did give feedback to our Thomson rep in the hope that Thomson will provide more comprehensive information about their excursions before offering these to future holidaymakers. We did the Chichen Itza full day tour by bus and this was a very long day but worth every penny. We did the Captain Hook night excursion and this was very cheesy but very entertaining and good value for money. Great for kids and big kids!! Try to get a seat on the deck rather than up at the top as you will get a better view of the show and get more involved. We did the Sian Kaan jungle tour (full day - a very long day!) It was advertised as a 1 and a 1/2 hour transfer and that breakfast would be included. You should be warned that you do have a 1 and a 1/2 hour transfer from the hotel but this is to the truck that you spend a further 2 and a 1/2 hours (at least) transferring to Sian Kaan. Breakfast is not provided until you reach Sian Kaan so you don't get anything to eat until 11 to 11.30am and this is a small pancake with a bit of cheese on top. The trip was a good experience however the transfer to and from the hotel to Sian Kaan was like an endurance test. We both had very sore backs and one of the people on our tour got his eye cut open and his glasses broken by a palm branch that hit him whilst travelling on the truck through the jungle terrain. Overall the trip was not worth the money that we paid for it and not what we had expected. The Playa Bar crawl and Coco Bongos trip began as a fantastic night out until we reached Coco Bongos. Coco Bongos was so packed with people that we could not see the show from where the Thomson reps had reserved. When we tried to move to see the show we were told to return to our places, we tried to stand on benches to see (as advised by Thomson reps) and we were told off by the bar staff. The drinks in Coco Bongos were supposed to be all inclusive but and when we were offered shots by the girls in Coco Bongos (advertised as free) we were then charged. We mentioned this to the Thomson reps but they didn't seem interested. We got a taxi back to the hotel 30 minutes into arriving at Coco Bongos. Quality and Value for Money The Hotel was fantastic and we would defnitely recommend to family and friends, we have not stayed at a Sandals resort but we have heard a lot of people say that this Hotel is just as good.

This was our first trip and we feel we made the right decision for the price that we paid. Hotel- The hotel was beautiful, comparable to some 5 star resorts in terms of beauty. While checking in you will see a nice grand lobby with marble floors a giant bar and plenty of couch loungers with open doors out the the courtyard that had the Asian restaurant and buffett on both sides. The courtyard is where the evening entertainment happens and is a nice place just to sit and have a drink. Restaurants- There are 3 different selections, Mexican, Asain, and Itailan. We loved the mexican as we can eat Mex food everyday. Not the best I have eaten but definitely edible and comparable to other AI. Make sure you ask for the Mayan coffee. It is a great show. We ate at the Mex on our anniversary night and I had emailed the resort ahead of time for a reservation and they where super helping. My wife had been looking for cheesecake all trip and on our anniversary night they gave us a small cheese cake with Happy anniversary. It was a very nice gesture. The asian was very good as well, you can smell the garlic they load up on the food while cooking at the Hibatchi. Jesus put up a great show. We did not get to try out the Italian due to a fire that burnt it down the morning we where going to eat there. The buffet during dinner was my least favorite dinner, it was asian night and I could not find anything I liked and I am no picky eater. I am hoping that it was just due to they where overwhelmed due to the fire. Because breakfast and lunch at the buffet was great. I feel like i am turned into a ninja turtle from all the guacamole that i ate. I really would return here for the price we paid.

Almost everything about this hotel is spot-on with a few VERY minor complaints. I shall start with some of the many positives: Check-in is professional and quick and performed by genuinley happy and cheerful staff with a good command of English. The Bell-Boy who showed us to our room, although having limited English stayed with us until he was happy that we were conversant with the operaration of the facilities in the room. The rooms are of a higher standard than is usual in All Inclusives, at least the ones we have stayed in. This is due to the resort having recently undergone a refurbishment following the transition to \"Adults Only\". The grounds are simply stunning. The team of gardeners work constantly to maintain the obvious high standard. The staff in general are the most pleasant bunch you could meet, and special mention must go to to Lobby bar waitresses, the impecable Imelda and Shaday (AKA Smiler). The nick-name says it all. She beams throughout her shift and lights up the place. When we arrived there were three speciality restaurants, Japanese, Mexican and Italian. Unfortunately during our stay the Italian restaurant burnt to the ground during the night. Thankfully no-one was hurt but there was some inconvenience caused to those whose rooms were close to the restaurant. The food throughout the resort was of a good standard and even the pickiest of eaters should find something to please them. Now for the minor gripes: The beach isn't the best. There are two beaches separated by a boardwalk which has a plexi-glass screen that acts as a windbreak. Both sections of beach have a problem with seaweed coming ashore in large amounts. The beach attendants work continously to clear the seaweed, but it is a never-ending task especially when the sea is anything other than flat calm. The water is murky and the sea floor feels slimy to walk on. There is no wildlife to see so snorkling is a bit of a waste of time. There are never enough beds with shade, and even the ones with shade are snapped up before 7am. When you go down to the beach or pool in the morning, every bed has towels draped over them.... and there is not one person in sight. They have all been \"Reserved\" by inconsiderate people who often don't show up until late morning. This simply is not fair but is a re-occuring theme at this type of hotel, and the management seem reluctant to address the problem. As stated earlier, these are fairly insignificant issues when taken in context with the rest of the experience at this hotel.

Unless you want to waste a day of your precious vacation for a \"gift\", run away. We sat down w/ the VIP Concierge but didn't go for the presentation - we did see a bunch of people being ushered around, though. Didn't look like fun.

Because I am able to compare our experience last year to this one - go to the Ocean Coral - more & better food choices, more pools, more & better beach area, bigger lobby w/ more places to sit and relax in and out. One last thing, don't leave anything on the floor or any food in your room - little tiny ants or something get in your bags and swarm on a dirty plate or glass.

This was the first time in many years that my wife and I have been with all three of my adult daughters for a vacation. We have been to many All-Inclusive resorts in Punta Cana, Cancun and a non-inclusive in Aruba. We were looking for this vacation to be the best ever... and it was, thanks to: * Bookit.com- Outstanding, helpful, organized service. I would recommend Bookit to all and we will now choose Bookit as our #1 source for travel. Chris, our travel advisor, went above and beyond to find us the best value for our party of seven. Travel with ease describes it best. Vouchers for resort, transfers and links for airfare were straight forward and very user friendly. Thanks Chris and kudos to Bookit! * Best Day Travel- our travel representative for Bookit at the Ocean Maya. Augusto was courteous and very helpful, especially during the one and only hitch in our stay (see below). Best Day also handled our transfers also and we were promptly met by BD rep at airport and promptly taken to the resort. Return trip transfer was also right on time. * Delta- great flight experience, flew from Lexington, Ky through ATL to Cancun. However, baggage was beat up badly- torn, mashed, dented and zipper broken during handling. :-( to TSA for Baggage being ransacked during inspection at customs and not returned to proper packing order. :-) to TSA for helpful, easy, non groping customs and security. Now to the H10 Ocean Maya: What a pleasant surprise! Some other reviewers ( like the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers) expect Caviar and Lobster for every meal at $20 per night. We have very realistic expectations and the H10-OM met and exceeded them all! Hotel staff and resort grounds- Front desk and concierge service was so courteous and eager to serve. In particular, Luis @ guest services was the best we have seen and deserves a raise in salary(LOL!). Management was everywhere to be seen throughout the resort. Grounds were gorgeous and the pools (especially the quiet pool) were perfect temp and clean as could be. Rooms were immaculately and well stocked daily. My wife and I were in room 1406- first floor, right off the walkway and perfectly located in the center between pool/beach and lobby/buffet/shows. The desk staff accomodated my request for a central room due to my COPD and they granted my request with pleasure and went out of there way to keep looking until they found what they thought would best suit our needs. Food- Fantastic @ breakfast- Gerardo (Johnny Depp) made us eggs cooked to order and omelettes that were perfect. Much to choose from. our server,Vincente, is to be commended- what a sweet polite man! and he has such nice hair! Lunch at Charro, near the pool was great with slections such as pizza, great burgers, salads, meats, fish, vegan selections and a wonderful staff. Dinner at the buffet was as expected- not the best gourmet cusine, but always had plenty to choose from. Mexican theme night was awesome though! Street tacos, etc.- felt like we were actually experiencing Cinco de Mayo @ the resort. The reservation restaurants- all three were awesome! Japanese tepanyaki/hibachi (Jesus is a Ninja!- very entertaining) was as good as back home. we ate there twice. Italian was fantastic and surprisingly authentic. Perfectly seasoned and well presented. It was the pleasing shocker of our food experience at H10-OC. Wish we could have gone there again! The Mexican made us miserable...with delight !!! So much food ! We needed pillows for a siesta after eating there. We ate there 3 times. Reservations were easy and got the times we wanted all but once, but still got us close to our requested time. We give these restaurants 6 stars! The Food manager, chefs and staff deserve all the praise in the world for their menus and service. The best food at any AI resort we have ever had... bar none! Food so nice, I'll say it twice! The best AI food at any AI resort! At any price! Mikes coffee shop was also great! Hot and frozen coffee drinks of all kinds in a relaxed atmosphere! Bars- Noe @ Charro is El Hombre! Miami Vice, Banana Mama, Mojito, tequila shots, Corona beer highly recommended! Did not miss upcale booze at all. Lobby bar was busy at night after the shows, but service was still good. Swim up bar was okay... a little loud for our taste, but not unruly and service was fine. Shows and Entertainment- We normally go to the AI shows expecting shows so bad that they are great comedic entertainment. Not at H10-OM. \"Grease\" show was cheesy in a good way and was very entertaining. The Mexican show and Mayan shows were the highlight. The \"Circus\" show was also good. \"at the Movies\" was performed by the animation staff and was funny and entertaining. The H10-OM choreographer has put together some very entertain shows and the animation staff is hard working, eager to please, engaging and most of all- not in your face, dragging you to participate. Special kudos to our new friend Polo. He made our stay at the H10-OM unforgettable, with such personal attention and wonderful conversations with all the family. We miss him already and hope he is there when we return. Amy Jean was always cheerful, though experiencing a difficult family illness. Our prayers are with you. H10-OM should take great pride in the animation staff! There was a special Barbeque Beach Blast one afternoon at the beach with great food (including Payaya! -yum yum). The band from Cuba was awesome! There had a 70s 80s pop rock band another night that was also very good. Every night after the shows, there would be a DJ playing in a disco area just off the showroom. Not a real discoteque, but we made it a party anyway. There were a number of shops also, but take plenty of sunscreen... it is expensive there! The outdoor Karaoke Night was an all out funfest for our family and all that participated. Now to the only negative part of our stay. USE THE SAFES! We used safes always EXCEPT one night. After pooling and drinking until 5 pm, we went to our room for a nap until 7 pm and then waking, showering and going to dinner reserved for 8 pm. The rooms have a card slot on the interior side from the door for inserting the room key and turning on all the lights and outlets in the room. The AC stays on w/o the card. Every time the card is taken out, the alarm clock blinks 12:00 and needs rest. So, on this particular day I decided to use my cell phone for my alarm. The alarm went off at 7 and I hit the snooze and after one more alarm, I shut it off. My wife wakes me, telling me it is 10 minutes util 8. I jump from bed into the shower, shave, dry my hair, dress and went out the door in a mad rush... leaving my smartphone on the nightstand. Upon our return at 10:30 pm, the phone was gone! We immediately reported the missing phone to the front desk. Nelson, the night security supervisor was swiftly at our door and did a computerized check on our electronic door lock to see who had entered the room during that time period. He stated that we would get the report the next day. We discovered that the rear patio door had been tampered with. Nelson dusted the door for fingerprints and told us to not touch the patio door area and to not let any of the staff use that door. The next day, the Security Manager, Delphin, met with us to brief us on the investigation. Luis at guest services let me use the hotel computer to suspend my phone service and also called my cell provider, so that I could report the theft and make sure that my service was cancelled. Delphin is a very thorough investigator and told us that he intervied all employees who had been in the room during our stay. He said that he could confirm that the phone had been seen on the nightstand by the cleaning staff that night. It was his though that someone other than the cleaning staff probably entered through the patio door while we were gone and exited the same way, so that they would not be detected by the electronic lock on the front door. WE feel bad for our loss and also feel bad for the resort management, as they have only had 2 thefts reported since January 2011. USE THE SAFE! H10-OM management offered us upgrades or anything they could do to try to compensate us for our loss. It is a terrible thing for the actions of one bad apple to reflect badly on the reputation of the whole resort. We will be getting a report from H10-OM on the results of their investigation. Delphin and the security staff are impressively courteous and professional and showed genuine concern for our misfortune. Thank you Delphin, Nelson and Luis for your consirable assistance and concern. This is a professionally run resort with high standards for it's employees and high regard for it's guests. I will say it one more time- USE THE SAFE AT ALL TIMES! However, I know that safe or no safe, guests should feel that their belongings are safe and secure. We are disappointed that this happened to us, but Maria and all the management staff are disappointed also and have assured us that they do not take this lightly and will always work toward perfecting the security of the resort. So, in the end, even our misfortune has a positive reflection on the H10 Ocean Maya resort, in our opinion. Final result of this review: The best All Inclusive resort, management, staff, food, drinks, pool, bars, shows of ANY resort we have been to, AT ANY PRICE! This is the best bang for your buck you could ever get for a Mayan Riviera vacation. Thanks to Maria (Miss Tripadvisor 2011) and all at Ocean Maya for a wonderful vacation for my family. p.s.- the \"all adult\" as of May 2011 was a great move. Just keep the spring breakers away (there were none during our stay) and you will have great success in the future. SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT YEAR FOR SURE!

Most of the time, if you want to eat around dinner time, if you dont join their Premium Package that they offer, you'll have to wait in line for your turn to eat. Premium Package is $20/day/person. Even if the restaurants are not full, they'll make you wait so they could reserve seats for people who do have Premium. Restaurants are not open on time as scheduled, and if you just even step inside, you'll be asked to leave. They always open 20-30mins late. Those of you who plan on doing excursions in the morning, you wont get to eat anything since only one buffet restaurant would be open, and it's always open late. There are a bunch of iguanas around the resort, their big and nasty looking. if you plan on taking pictures around the resort, look out for them. Sometimes even when you're sitting in a restaurant eating, those iguanas would crawl in and no one would chase them out because they dont mind having iguanas crawling under their tables, i guess. Also, around night time, if you're eating out on a deck, look out for racoons. They're big and they're everywhere.

This was a really great hotel on the beach, not too big, with roomy accommodation set in beautiful gardens, and with an abundance of great food and drink. I've never come across a harder working hotel where everybody goes out of their way to say hello or help out. The lobby is large and welcoming, with shops, a bar and a coffee shop. This leads out to a nice courtyard with a rectangular ornamental pool with fountains to relax around. Here you'll find the the main buffet, the Japanese restaurant, the theatre and outdoor evening entertainment. There's also markets on two or three evenings a week. From the courtyard you then head past a beautiful rock garden with waterfall down through the grounds to the rooms. All of the rooms are spacious and modern. There are 37 villas set throughout the grounds, most with 8 rooms (4 up, 4 down). Our room had a king size bed, a terrace, free safe, closet with iron and board, sofa, armchair, desk, table, a coffee maker, free minibar and a flat screen telly. The bathroom was also modern, with the shower and toilet separate from the basin area, where you'll find a hairdryer and shower/shampoo/moisturiser potions. The only thing missing was the promised bathrobe and slippers. The maid service was efficient, although we didn't get any towel artwork - not that we were bothered. The villas are separated by the most immaculate grounds, which the staff work tirelessly to maintain. Some of the flora are labelled, as you might find in a botanical garden, with some iguanas and other wildlife occasionally flitting through. All paths lead to the seafront area where there are two pools, one with a swim-up bar and both with sunbathing ledges built into the pool - perfect for sunbathing and staying cool at the same time. There were plenty of sun loungers around the pool and beach. It's true that it's sometimes a little difficult to find a spot, but we always found somewhere. The hammocks were pretty good fun too. Staff weave throughout the pool and beach areas to bring you drinks. There's also low-key animation from friendly staff who then double-up as performers in the theatre later. You can also get a sea-front massage by the pool, though it's not cheap. There's not a huge amount of beach since part of it has been turned into a boardwalk - though this is quite picturesque in itself. The sea was warm, although quite choppy so not good for extended bouts of swimming or snorkelling, but fine for paddling or wading. Some reviewers have commented on the water - this is down to fine particles of seaweed, not dirt. At one end of the beach by a tide break and the boardwalk these particles can be so fine that the water sometimes appears almost black. This depends on the weather conditions out at sea and is not the hotel's fault. And everyday there are staff on the beach with the thankless job of raking up sea weed. It's really not as bad as some people have made out, and only limited to one small section of the beach. Food was great. The main buffet had an incredible selection, with a grill station for cooking beef, pork, chicken or fish to order, along with an impressive selection of pre-prepared dishes. There was also a pasta station and omelette station, and an extensive collection of desserts. The house red wine was pretty good also. In addition to the buffet there were three a-la carte restaurants - Japanese (by the courtyard), Mexican (by the pool) and Italian (by the beach). The best thing about these was that they were walk-in restaurants which didn't require pre-booking. The food at each was stunning. Tips: Try the Mayan coffee at the Mexican restaurant, prepared with flaming brandy. This, like everything else you'll find, is all inclusive. Also, try the coffee shop in the lobby. Ask for a selection of appetizers at the Japanese and Mexican restaurants. Visit Playa Del Carmen, Tulum or Chichen Itza. If you're a scuba diver, don't bother with the hotel dive centre, it costs a fortune -$125 for a 2-tank dive. I ended up choosing DiveMike in Playa del Carmen - a great outfit who only charged $55, and will also pick you up. Try the cenotes - cavern dives, or the wreck of the Mama Vina.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa City, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cA different perspective and review. . . .\u201d", "Author": "meegle76", "ReviewID": "UR109804447", "Content": "Hi all, I'm going to take a bit of a risk here, but I think it's an honest assessment (albeit a subjective one). I'm going to start off by saying I AM an American and these are topics of conversation that are not broached in public. I rarely write these reviews, but felt that it was worth the time. I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this resort, when the reality is, I believe that all resorts will be about the same. The bigger issue is this: IT IS MEXICO. What you have, for the most part (not ALL, but MOST) is gobs of Americans looking to be served in a way fit for a king. .. but true to the American way, they want to do it for $72 a night. Think about what Mexico is derived of. . .this is a very, very poor country (well hidden as you drive to one straight road that leads you to resort after resort which are hidden near the gulf off of the main strip). The people serving you are wonderful and hard-working and most likely, if they are older, are trying to support their families off of their wages. Because of this (and in other tourist hot spots) of course the resorts will maximize their abilities to sell, sell, sell. My point is this: if you are a mullet-wearing, sun burning, chain-smoking, obese American who spends his or her day drunk and is looking for his/her vacation of a lifetime: you've found it! If you're 18 years old or a college student and want to have a vacation in a drunken haze with your friends, do it! This is for YOU! Who cares what the rooms or the grounds are like? You won't be in your room. Non-stop drinking and food-that's all you need and you've got it! If you are a couple who is looking for a getaway, for a comfortable bed and a haven to get away for a few days-spend the extra grand to go to Fiji, Hawaii, Belize or Sweden. These are places that do NOT need tourism to survive. Mexico is not one of these places. It simply DOES NOT matter what resort you go to. Even if you upgrade as we did in this resort (Privileged) this does not mean there is an increase in quality. The fact is that yes, the resorts are as pictured.

I read the reviews and did a lot of research before booking as I ALWAYS do. So when Our bed was so hard my Husband had to sleep on the couch I asked for a pad . It was thin but we gave it a try . The next day we were going on an all day excursion and I went to the front desk and requested \"a PAD' for the bed and told them we would be out until 7pm so they had plenty of time to do it. he wrote my name on a list with other people requesting the same . No PAD when when we came back 12 hours later exhausted ,so I called the front desk and asked to speak to a manager , I was told he was out to lunch so I asked please have him call when he returns . He must still be eating because he never called. Finally someone came to my room and put blankets over the mattress and it helped a little .I booked this place and one of my things is I like room service in the morning to have fresh hot coffee and sit on the Patio enjoying nature while my Hubby sleeps in .It states there is room service .. Yeah only from11 am -11 pm as i was told by the front desk when i wanted coffee in the morning i was told only the Privelege get morning room service , I know i have a coffee maker in the room and a fridge but the fridge wouldn't keep the milk cold enough and i am on vacation. I was told i could upgrade to privelege for $20.00 each ($40.00) extra per day .No I don't think so .I have stayed at Secrets, LeBlanc and a few others and never was treated like i was looked down on for not being \"Priveleged\"So Mgmt needs to step up . I kept getting sales pitches and was offered $50.00 then $100.00 then $200.00 to go to a 90 min sales pitch , How many times do i need to say NOT INTERESTED!!! So besides that I must say the rest of the staff , food , grounds and tours were Excellent . This place has so much potential if Mgmt . could get it's act together .

I stayed at Catalonia Royal Tulum last year and thets where I will go again It ran circles around this place .I feel sorry for the ones that do a good job , Like i said food was the best ever and i got great drinks with almost any liquor I wanted..

As everyone says, the grounds are absolutely gorgeous. My husband and I love the concept of the villas which consist of 8 guest rooms (4 up and 4 down.) The rooms were very quiet. We never once heard our neighbors. The rooms are exactly as shown on their website. The walk-in shower is awesome. At every resort in Mexico that we have stayed at (22 in all) the beds have been firm. This seems to be the Mexican way, which is just fine with us as we prefer firm mattresses. Don't understand how anyone can give a negative review on the food. It was the best ever at any Mexican resort. At the La Hacienda Buffet your can find whatever you want for breakfast. For lunch and dinner there was a very good selection of meat and fish (pick whichever for them to grill for you) or choose from the big selection of other hot dishes, and don't forget the yummy ice cream for dessert. Yookoso, the Japanese, excellent show and good food. El Dolce Vita, the Italian, we did not eat here, but other guests raved about it. El Charro is the snack bar during the day (hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, and an assortment of hot dishes) and the Mexican restaurant for dinner. Wonderful food and service, thanks to Jorge and Manuel. How about those Banana Margueritas! Some people on Trip Advisor cmplained about weak drinks. Why wouldn't they just ask for more liquor in their drink? Just ask Ignacio at the Lobby Bar and David at the Pool Bar. If they don't know your preferences, just let them know. This should be no grounds for complaint. On another issue, we did notice a slight septice smell on one of the walkways, however, it lasted for about 3 steps. Definitely not a big deal. On our last day, Omar and Ricardo from the Entertainment Staff joined us for lunch. They truly love their jobs, and it definitely shows. Although, we were not Priviledge, we could not have been treated any better. Thanks again to the very gracious Maria Lopez, who had a big hand in making this such a great vacation.

Maria at the hotel was very helpful it resolving a reservation issue before we even arrived. Having stayed at another resort last year, every hotel has its positive points. For Ocean Maya those very positive items include the hotel layout with a number of separate buildings, the well manicured grounds, the friendly & responsive staff, (waiters Felix and Alberto were great, as was the chef Jesus at the Japanese restaurant), the breakfast buffet, the room decor, the two pools, as well as an overall safe & fun environment. Some items that were fine but not overly impressive included the Italian restaurant (at least not the night we ate there -- our group liked, in order the Japanese by far, the Mexican, the general Buffet, and then the Italian), the shower door does leak (although it does help when exiting, to draw the glass door towards you), the hard bed, the room safe is not large enough to fit a laptop (but there were no problems with room security), the immediate beach is not the best for swimming (it got better after a 15 minute walk to the right), the nightly entertainment was somewhat haphazard and not quite up to par with larger hotels (but that is not why we chose the hotel in the first place). Because our group went on excursions 4 different days (Tulum, Xplor, Xel-Ha, and Chichen-Itza), there was a little more expense in taking 7 of us into Playa Del Carmen, which takes about 15 minutes. Most of the taxis ,hold only 3 to 4 people, although we got to know Jorge (a hotel cab driver) who had a small van that held 7. We tried a number of different modes of transportation. We used the colectivo (about $35 pesos a person to Playa) which means you walk the 15 minutes or so out from the hotel to the street, and the same when you return. This works better with a smaller number of people as it may take a few attempts to find a van with enough room. We also negotiated a rate with Jorge to take us all to Xel-Ha (we couldn't believe he waited for us from 9:30 until 5:15 to exit the park). We have also taken the ADO bus before, which are nicer than U.S. buses. And one day we even took the hotel, free shuttle to Playa - it leaves at noon, returns at 5 pm and requires that you sign up for it on the day prior. If you want to allocate some of your money for other things other than a hotel, such as shopping , excursions, and getting to know Mexico, yet still have a quality hotel that does not feel like a budget resort then you will be pleased with the Ocean Maya - we were. Travel Tips: 1) Make sure you take an insulated thermos or bottle - it can be convenient for beach drinks but it can be a life saver at Chechin-Itza if you fill it with ice before leaving the hotel. 2) Get a H10 membership and it is possible to receive 10% off your bill 3) Take some good water shoes - a must for Xplor and other beach activities 4) The all inclusive tickets for Xel-Ha, Xcaret, Xplor or even Chichen-Itza, include lunch and the food is good ! 5) You may want to take a laminated copy of your passport while traveling locally and leave the original one in your hotel room safe. 6) Take a number of $1 bills with you for tipping the maids, waiters, servers and for shopping when they may not have change for larger bills. 7) You can get a discount buying park tickets online to Xel-Ha, Xcaret, Xplor and even a larger discount when you purchase tickets to more than one park. 8) Check out Xplor, it is awesome! Arrive at the park when it opens, do the zip lines before it gets crowded and be sure to see the incredible sights in the caves when taking the the river swim -- it is unbelievable !.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peace River", "Title": "\u201cI have to say it\u201d", "Author": "PRBubba", "ReviewID": "UR108868821", "Content": "The last night of our stay at this hotel, we had something stolen from our room.

Facilities The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The rooms are clean and well designed. The linens are not very good quality. The cooling system works great. Beach The sand is fine white clean sand. The ocean water is not what you expect in the Carribean. It is more like the Atlantic Ocean. Chairs were always hard to find and many were broken. Food The food is not excellent but very plentiful. There was always some fresh fruit and good fish. I did notice that cheaper food is used. For example if you order beef filet you get beef with no bone not fillet migon and lamb is a lamb steak not lamb chops. Service Service was very hit or miss. We always had an excellent waiter at the buffet. We tipped and he ask that we always reguest his section which we did. If we wanted a drink at the pool or beach we got it ourselves. There were not many beach waiters. The bartenders work hard but are not wervice oriented. One day they ran out of plastic cups and told the guest to go to the other bar and get a glass. None of the staff seems able to honor any special reguest. Everyone does work hard but hard work does not always mean good service. Now for my personal openion.

Something that hasn't occurred to us in other resorts, what an excellent treatment. \"Thanks to all the amazing Staff at the Ocean Maya\" Javier (Bellman): Excellent services and communicator Ignacio (Lobby Bartender - Day Shift) Excellent MOJITOS - What a Superstar Guy! Claudia (Guest Service) Courteous and well informed. Our Cleaning Lady (Villa 10) Sorry we forgot her name our sincere apologies BUT She was amazing on top of everything! Jesus Arsona (Sushi Chef of Yookoso) Very attentive to all guest at the habachi table, excellent communicator, and the cuisine was I have no words for it! 5 Stars! And best of all Maria L. Thank you for your amazing Hospitality and taking your time & effort in accommodating us. Above & Beyond our expectations. Reviews: Ok, let's be frank here! It became an ONLY ADULT Hotel on May 1st we got there May 4th. We wanted to relax and we did. Yes, Ocean Maya was bombarded with Spaniard (young adults); they were rude, disrespectful to STAFF & Guests.... but we CANNOT disqualified OVERALL the PROS of this hotel because of this minor mis-hap on these young rudely kids. Ocean Maya is a huge facility and we found tranquility even on this turmoil moment. Remember folks, experience enables you to recognize a mistake. We came with a Mission to Mexico (Relax & Enjoy Mexico) Restaurant (Food Overall): All eateries had a special and distinctive quality! -Mike's Coffee Shop: Excellent Lattes if you are a Coffee Lover like myself. They have a variety of teas (Hot & Cold) and Mini-sandwiches and pastries. (Location near the Lobby Bar) -La Hacienda-Buffet: What can I say, Gourmet FOOD all the way (Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner)! Very Fresh, High Quality - Grade A. We read so many comments on trip advisor and we were wondering if we were on the same HOTEL. This was nothing but Fabulous food people! And Lots of it. Oh before I forget they make some awesome gourmet dark & white chocolate with fresh fruit fillings! Try their desserts too Yummy! (Location exiting the Lobby) -El Charro: How people been saying for a while....OMG. Authentic Mexican Cuisine! What more can you ask! Excellent Tacos, Seafood, Plantano Tequila. (Location Near the 2nd Pool) -La Dolce Vita: The food was good. Our favorite dishes was the Spinach Parmigiano Soup and the Linguini with Alfredo sauce with a touch of ham and mushroom. Also the Ravioli was fantastic. Beverages (Bars) Lobby Bar - I think this was our hang out spot, very beautiful bar, Drink were superb to be frank NOT water down. Maybe it was our luck! All other bars were just okay. Each bar has a hidden gem you just have to try them all and discover which one is your favorite. Rooms: The rooms were very modern, spacious, eccentric, beautiful, and best of all comfortable. We had a BIG KING size Bed, flat screen tv, balcony, Sofa bed, love chair, two night stand, beautiful bathroom oh and the FLOORS are amazing. Our Villa was #10 it's only a few steps away from the beach and pool! Activities: They have many activities on the Hotel Premises, to be frank we never ever got bored! Everything was well organized. Saxophone melodies, Karaoke, the night shows were very entertainment and funny, We were there for 5 de Mayo- they went all out in celebrating this day, the food and shows were amazing with the mariachis and locals vendors, Also they have Theme night for a disco, Music was up to date from Spanish to English, pool tables, many fantastic activities trust us you will never get bored here. Oh yes the hotel has a couple of shops. Did I mention Ocean Maya provides Free Shuttle Bus to 5th Avenue (Playa del Carmen) Oh yes! Definitely a plus. Cleanliness - One word - SUPERB! This hotels is very well kept! Property (Pool & Beach) -Pool on the Right has the Swim up BAR and 4 massage chairs and a jacuzzi. Very spacious pool. This is were all the activities occurs. -Pool on the Left - RELAXING mode pool so nice to just chill for the day! This was our favorite. -Oh the Beach: What can I say we asked about what happened to the beach, we were told that they got hit by hurricane and it take time for the beach to clean itself. We can't stop Mother Nature and we can't control the currents. But folks listen sometime is beautiful sometime it was gloomy. But other than that we did enjoyed our stay. - Hammocks: Oh boy we spent almost 50% of time here before sunset! It was Glorious! Now they have 10 hammocks overall (so pick and choice you color preference)... we got the party starting! To Finalize the review: Overall- If you are looking for Rest & Relaxation with a touch of luxury. You should stay at the Ocean Maya you wont regret it. It definitely compete with other upscale resorts at the Riviera Maya and this one is a keeper on our list !

Dishonest advertising about \"No Springbreakers\" not!\u201d", "Author": "donjulioforpresident", "ReviewID": "UR107595683", "Content": "Everything stated regarding the beautiful grounds is absolutely true! The place is kept immaculate, by far the most impressive resort we could see walking 30+ minutes in both directions on the beach. The staff is just as everyone states, they were wonderfull, and did everything in their power to make us comfortable. Unfortunately they couldn't kick the couple hundred very young (supposed to be) adults out of the resort! The hotel advertises \"No Spring Breakers\", they can call it whatever they want, this was a bunch of children there to party it up just as you would see in Cancun in March (big reason we avoid Cancun). Very disrespectful to other guests, & the staff at OMR. A couple evenings hoping to have a few quiet drinks at the nice lobby bar (we read was very quiet after 9:00 PM) we found kids 8 deep at the bar, if you could get a drink they were carrying on so loud you couldn't have a conversation. That's when we figured out- leave the resort, & find what we wanted in PdC. We enjoyed the restraurants as far as AI goes. The rooms were fine, the beds were ok. The beach area was great regardless of what other reviewers have said, much cleaner than others in the area (other places seem to have a seaweed problem). Got a good spa package deal for my wife on her b-day, she said it was wonderful. And we met some great people that were adults! You may have seen an earlier review stating they could not get an English speaking channel on their TV, I've never stayed anywhere in MX where this was the case (10+ visits), & I didn't believe it. Well believe it! I really didn't care until the evening of 5/1 (I was on vacation who needs TV). However this just happened to be when the biggest news since 9/11 was announced. As an American who was very interested in hearing about the news of bin ladens death I was very dissappointed when I could not find an English speaking news channel. We called the front desk, they sent someone who said \"sorry\". As a home owner, with some passion for technology (TV's/ surround sound, etc.) I decided to take matters into my own hands, this is when I found the cable box was not even connected to the TV, they had ran a cable from the cable box out to the cable box in, no TV connection. Sort of a good disquise, however it was obvious whoever made the connection knew there was no use of the cable box whatsoever. I did make the correct connections, only to get a message something like \"you are unauthorized to use this cable box\". Fortunately our friends we traveled with did have a functioning cable box in their room, & we were able to watch some of the news we so wanted to see. All in all; the resort is beautiful, the staff is incredible, & we had a great time in spite of the kids, & we loved PdC. Not sure if I would go back, as I don't know if I can trust the owners, don't believe everything advertised! Next time we may look to get in/ closer to PdC.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Shore, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWarm and Welcoming :)\u201d", "Author": "barbiejz", "ReviewID": "UR107421748", "Content": "My girlfriends and I stayed here March 18-25 2011.

There is nothing \"DIRTY\" about this beach. It's nature, not a pool people! In fact, people from the neighboring hotel were coming to swim at our beach because it was nice and clean, not full of sludge like I observed on my walks. With regard to its size, how much beach does one need to have a dip? With regard to the negative reviews about the food, if you can't find something decent to eat then you're the kind of person who is just plain angry in life. If you want your food cooked a certain way, all you have to do is ask and they will. The staff is very accommodating. My only negative review is that the large amount of students from Spain were very disrespectful to the staff and the rest of the guests. They came back to the hotel from nearby nightclubs in the early am chanting loudly with absolutely no concern to the rest of the sleeping guests. They became an annoyance to the staff and the other guests.

Cleanliness and quality of staff are most important to me anywhere I stay and the previous reviews of the staff here helped me choose this Ocean Maya and I was not once disappointed. Upon arrival we were greeted with very friendly staff, check in was prompt and within a short time, we were whisked off to our room with a welcome drink in hand. The grounds were amazing and well kept, the pictures do not do this resort justice. The villas are so well kept and brightly painted. We booked an ocean view room and I contacted the hotel prior to our arrival to request a room with the best ocean view possible, Ocean Maya accommodated our request and we were not disappointed, the view from our 2nd floor room was incredible. The bed was firm but not uncomfortable and I slept wonderfully every night. My husband, who has back troubles, loved it. On the walk to the lobby area, there is a spot where you can smell sewer but it lasts for all of a few seconds, certainly nothing that affects the entire resort nor is it so bad that it could ruin an evening walk. We upgraded to the privilege service, we really didn't need it to make reservations for any of the restaurants as there was always room for us when we went to eat. Since neither my husband or I drink much, the top shelf liquor was not applicable. We never had trouble finding chairs under a palapa or on one of the Bali beds in the privilege section of the beach and what made the upgrade completely worth it for us was Azucena, the attendant in the beach area. She always had a smile, helped with with our Spanish and provided to us anything that we could want. Books and magazines on hand, cloths that were soaked in anise and water to refresh ourselves with, lemonade, cold water and ice buckets to sit beside our chairs. We enjoyed her company and conversation every day we spent at the beach. The staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful, there was always a smile and a \u201cHola\u201d or \u201cbuenos dias\u201d. We were always asked how our days were and many of the staff remembered our names which is outstanding considering the amount of visitors to this resort through out the year. Staff was always doing something from cleaning, to gardening, picking up garbage. These people work incredibly hard and are all very gracious. Our room was cleaned perfectly each day, the mini fridge was always stocked. The entertainment staff around the pool and beach area were great at trying to include guests in various activities and we had some really great water polo and volleyball games. Anywhere in this area, the people appreciate when visitors make an effort to learn some of their language and we had some great lessons with our broken Spanish from almost everyone we encountered and always with good humor. For the most part the food was good but not outstanding by any means but we always found something to eat and never went hungry. There is enough variety that even the fussiest of people (my husband) was able to find something. The food could be served at hotter temperatures nothing so drastic as to ruin the vacation for us. We were always happy to see Alberto's smiling at breakfast in the buffet dining room in the mornings and we really enjoyed the music from the saxophone player. We appreciated the smaller more intimate size of this resort and loved the villas instead of a huge resort. I can go on and on about what made Ocean Maya a great place to stay for us and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone that isn't expecting 10 star Trump luxury. If people are going to sweat the small stuff and allow minor issues to \"ruin\" a vacation for them then it doesn't matter where they stay, they'll find something to complain about. .", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax", "Title": "\u201cBest Resort Ever - Can't wait to return\u201d", "Author": "Johnny123Halifax", "ReviewID": "UR106906141", "Content": "Hi there, first of all, don't listen to the negative reviews. I always said I would never go back to the same resort twice, but I will go back to this one for sure. The Ocean Maya was amazing. We stayed from 14-21 April 2011, and had a great time. Lets break it down: Resort and staff - It is the most gorgeous breath taking place you will see. There is so much wildlife and lush tropical trees everywhere. It's so nice. We walked around the entire time going...\"paradise\". Everything is well maintain and clean. The staff were extremely friendly, and made you feel very welcome. Food and drink - The food was very good. We loved it. The Japanese was great and all the buffets were awesome. They even had a beach lunch which was so nice....live band and all. I couldn't have asked for better food. The drinks were very good, and strong. They made every kind of martini you can ask for. I recommend the chocolate martini....so good. Beach - Many people in the reviews complained about the beach. Sure it's not the nicest beach I have seen in my travels, but it was great. The water was warm and it was very gorgeous. Lots of areas to swim, and nice boardwalk. You can walk in the white sand for hours if you want. I had no complaints at all. They also had catamarans (no cost), jet skiing, para sailing, kayaks, windsurfing, all on site. It was great. If your young and like to party, this may not the place for you. Having said that, the resort organizes bar hopping trips many of the nights. You pay 30 bucks, and the staff will take you and a bus load of people out on the town in Playa Del carmen (big city only 15 minutes away). They will bring a bartender and will look after you big time. The bus leaves at 1030 pm and doesn't return until 4am. I think they also have a 9pm, which gets back at 2am. Pretty need if your young and want to party. For us we wanted a smaller place. If you are looking for a extremely romantic gorgeous location, the ocean Maya is the place to be. To be honest, I am online now seeing if I could go back to the Ocean Maya in the next few weeks. We got back just last week. That's how much I liked it there, and I am one of the those people who needs everything perfect and spends countless hours looking for various resorts. I recommend going to Playa Del Carmen. Such a nice place to visit and it's close. I would go in mid afternoon and staff until after dark. That way you get the day and evening, which had a different feel in the city big time. 19 bucks one way. Not to bad. The shuttle only hold 20 people and space is limited. This resort is also central to all the attractions. I recommend Tulum and Rio Secreto. They take you under ground in caves that are a million years old. You have to wear a wet suit, life vest and a helmet with a light on it. It will blow your mind. It's like your on a different planet. No joke. Best attraction we did for sure, but there are so many good ones. Well I have wrote a novel. Bottom line, it's a perfect place and our second trip to the H10 line. They have exceeded our expectations big time.

We booked our rooms about 2.5 months in advance for 3 nights at the Ocean Turquesa. Upon check-in, we were pulled to the side by one of the staff at the front desk. She told us (quietly and away from other guests) that the hotel has been overbooked due to a wedding. She was offering to transfer us to the Ocean Maya and upgrade us to the privileged service package along with a complimentary breakfast in bed. My wife and I were skeptical and asked what would happen if we did not want to go to the Maya. We were told that they were not certain when (or even if) a room would open up. The front desk told us that the Maya was the same class of hotel, just smaller and adults only. After some back and forth, we reluctantly accepted their offer and had to sign a paper stating that we accepted the change. This should have been our first warning sign of what was to come. We arrived at the Maya to find that this was not the same class of hotel as the Maya. There was no valet parking and the bellboys were non-existent (I thought I\u2019d have to take my own bag until he finally showed up). The facilities were much older. The chairs and lounges in the common areas were stained and in general, the wear and tear on the property was very noticeable. The walk to our room (bungalow style) from the lobby seemed endless and was the last thing that we needed after getting the run-around all day. When we finally got there, we saw that some of the floor tiles were cracked, the toiletries were not restocked, the service book was missing (which took them 24 hours to bring), the safe was broken and the minibar that supposedly came with the privileged service was empty. We tried to call to get the necessities and realized that the phone did not work as well. After the long walk back to the lobby, we found out that \u201cprivileged service\u201d and \u201cprivileged rooms\u201d are apparently two different things, something that the lady at the Turquesa failed to mention. After some arguing, we were offered a privileged room. When we inspected it, it was really no different from a standard room, just slightly bigger. In addition, this particular room had an infestation of ants that managed to bite my wife twice before we got out of there. After seeing all this, we just decided to cut our losses and stay at the room we were originally assigned. All the while, we were in contact with our travel agent to see if there was anything they could do to get us back to the Turquesa or get a refund for something that we clearly did not pay for. Other than racking up considerable roaming charges in calls, this proved to be fruitless. When we spoke with the managers at both the Maya and the Turquesa, they said there was nothing they could do and repeatedly said that we signed the paper that confirmed the transfer as if it were some sort of legal defense. After these headaches, we saw that this was an unwinnable battle so we decided to try and make the best of it. Unfortunately, the Ocean Maya did not want to comply. The food at the restaurants ranged from slightly below average to downright awful. When we went to the buffet, we found mussels shells in our pasta which indicates that either all their food is cooked together or the buffet itself is unsanitary. As far as the beach, there is none. The hotel is apparently on the shoreline of some rough waters, so all there is are lounges next to the where a beach would have been and an unsightly boardwalk that takes away any water view you could have while laying down. The \u201cprivileged\u201d areas are anything but \u2013 they are simply roped off from the rest of the lounges. There is no waiter service or any other benefits in the area, so honestly, what\u2019s the point? On top of all this, we were promised a complimentary room service breakfast on our last day. We called the day before as per their guidelines to place our order for 10:00 am the next day. However, when they had not shown up by 10:20, I called again. They said they were sending someone right away. My wife and I ordered scrambled eggs/ omelet, home fries, bacon, fruit, and tea. We received two orders of hard boiled eggs, bacon that looked like it had been scraped off a dirt road, hash browns, no fruit, and coffee. They obviously did not have our order and scrambled (unlike our eggs) to get whatever they could to us. I found this very unprofessional and not worthy of any hotel, let alone one of that supposed quality. Upon checkout, my bill had some phantom charges on it that I had to ask to clear up. We could not wait to leave and cannot see ourselves ever returning to an H10/Ocean property. We were lied to and deceived on multiple occasions and when we complained, the staff just shook their heads as if this was business as usual.

I went on vacation with my beautiful girlfriend, were both in our early 20's. The Vacation started off horrible. Flights were delayed we got to the hotel around 9pm, and we find out that they gave away our room (FML) after about an hour later we finished arguing with them, and they decided to give us the Honeymoon Suite instead of the Master Suite, which was totally fine by us. FOOD - A+ Lets me just give you some background info. We're Jews from NY and We went during passover vacation, now if you dont know what passover has to do with food, your not allowed to eat anything that has yeast in it (bread,pasta,rice,cake. etc). So you can take it from us that even though we were limited on out options everything was still AMAZINGLY delicious. Rooms - A The room were very modern, and very cozy. The bed was very big and comfortable, this was probably one of the first vacations we had that we didn't complain about one of us hogging the bed (I'm pretty sure it was a California King). The bathroom was great, Standup shower, closed toilet area. The TV always had something on ( it was cable from florida) and if there was nothing on TV, they had an on demand movie channel (10 bucks) which had great movies on it. BUT the best thing about this room was the outdoor jacuzzi, almost all of our night ended off in there with a bottle of comp champaign. The only complaint that I have about the room(and pretty much the whole vacay) was that if you left the toilet seat open, you can smell the sewage. Beach/Pool Area- A The only reason im giving an A and not an A+ , is because you couldn't swim in the ocean, either because it was too windy or just plain murky. But the pool was amazing, and the beach area was even better. They have entertainment there, and fun activities such as horseshoe,pool volleyball, ping pong, etc. I know that you aren't only going to be reading my review, but please take what i will tell you next to heart. GET THE PRIVILEGE SERVICES, you will not regret living like royalty for an extra whatever a day. The privilege services was the reason why our vacation was as great as it was. From the private area on the beach, the top shelve liquor, private air conditioned area in the restaurants, first selection to specialty restaurants, all the way to room service for anything on the menu (or even off of it).

The tempanyaki grill at the japanese was also excellent and the pool side mexican place had a good burgers and snacks for lunch. The staff is excellent and friendly. I cannot believe how hard they all work. The beach isn't that bad. You can go in the water, or you can just walk next door and there is a larger area for swimming, no big deal. And regarding this so-called sewer smell: it is the same smell that you smell as soon you exit the plan in Cancun. It didn't bother me one bit, i just chalked it up to being in a very humid, hot, tropical area of the world. One downside was the lack of beer choice. I will never drink corona again!!

The pool was nice and clean too. Food was average. Room was clean and the bathrooms were nice. Being a small resort, you don't have to walk miles from one side to the other. I enjoyed the iguanas and friendly wildlife on our walks.....however the septic stench that seemed to be place smack dab in the middle on the way to the lobby made the stroll less pleasurable. They overbooked the hotel so they offered us 2 nights at the Ocean Coral and Turquesa which was a nice change of scenery but our room was terrible! The bathroom had no door and not even a stall for the shower. The floor flooded continuously and all our belongings were damp by morning. The room reeked of mold and when we complained, they said there were no other rooms to move us to as they were completely booked also. When we returned to Ocean Maya we told them about this and they offered nothing. Infact, we had to wait from 10am to 3pm for a room to even become available. Meanwhile, our bags are locked up in a room. 2 of the 3 in our group were ill this day and just wanted to be in our room with a bathroom. One thing I noticed is there were never any apologies. It just is. I also want to caution everyone about their internet terminals in the lobby. You can feed it money or swipe your credit card, but it only works for a few minutes and then cuts you off. You cannot get your money back and when you complain, they tell you that the terminals do not belong to them, \"they are concessions\".....this is after we were told to come back on 3 different occasions and someone would try to fix it. The beach at Ocean Coral was amazing which made the 2 nights much more enjoyable, since there is absolutely no beach at Ocean Maya. Oh, and you get the same service without the privilege bracelet.

After arguing for about fifteen minutes, I had a manager finally agree to get us a room that was similar to the Romance Suite and we got the Honeymoon Suite. The room was amazing! Big, clean, had somewhat of a sewer smell but if you shut the toilet seat it isn't so bad. The hot tub was an added perk too! Downside was television had mostly Spanish channels, would have enjoyed more English-language channels. Bed was so big my boyfriend and I could roll around and still not touch each other! Privilege - whoever says don't get it is lying to you. It was such a relaxing experience to have a cabana everyday, waiter service, air-conditioned breakfast area and reservations to every restaurant without having to wake up early! Entertainment - we only caught the last night's entertainment. They took movie trailers and then did skits about it - it was great! Additionally, on Easter they did a Trivia game at the pool and dressed up as the Easter Bunny and his helpers. They filled egg shells with glitter and baby powder and the grand prize was a bottle of champagne (which I won!) Food - it was Passover most of the time my boyfriend and I were there so we were unable to eat anything with yeast, wheat or corn, yet we still had an abundance of food to eat! The food was AMAZING. From Hibachi to Italian to the buffet - we never went hungry! Service - Great!!! We love Alberto from the buffet and Antonio from Dolce Vita!

We have stayed several times at their sister resort the Ocean Coral & Turquesa, so thought this would be a safe bet. We had an excellent time and would return. It is not as large as OCT, and the beach is tiny in comparison as well, but the grounds are amazing, the staff excellent, and the buildings/rooms very comfortable and quiet. I think, however that they order their beds from the same place (both very firm!) Ocean Maya is a fairly quiet resort and even with the addition of 3 or 4 bus loads of Spanish and Portuguese teens while we were there, it remained fairly low key. I hadn't expected all these students, but in the end they were no problem. The two pools are side by side near the ocean, and we enjoyed swimming in them from time to time. They would benefit from adding more chairs around the pools. I have never seen chairs so sparsely set out around a pool. There were plenty of chairs on the beach. We paid the extra $20pp/day for the privilege service which turned out to be an excellent investment. It gave us access to the privilege area at the beach which includes 7 canopy loungers and many regular lounge chairs with extra padding. There was always space available no matter what time of day. And as a previous review stated, Azucena, the area attendant was excellent. Food in the 3 a la cartes was very good, and as there is no dress code for the restaurants, very comfortable. It's nice to be able to dress up for dinner, but I don't want to do it every day. If you like a quiet, pleasant, relaxing, peaceful holiday, I would recommend the Ocean Maya Royale. PS.

We booked it based on reviews we had read and the fact that the price was certainly right. We could not have picked a better resort at which to spend a very relaxing and lazy week. Our check-in was seamless. I really appreciated how the bell staff didn\u2019t fight with us to carry our bags when we opted to take them ourselves. The grounds of this hotel are phenomenal. So well kept; we saw people working on them all day every day, pruning, clipping, washing. Everyone there is quick with a \u201cHola\u201d or \u201cBuenos Dias\u201d as you walk past. Our room was great as well. My wife told our travel agent that we\u2019d like a garden view. That short of shocked me as we were headed to the ocean but the view we got was great. We were on the second floor of a villa type unit looking right into the canopy of a small jungle that separated us from the next villa. We were in building 25 which is a quick jaunt to the lobby and about a 5 minute stroll to the pools and beach. This gives a great opportunity to see the natural wildlife, lemurs, iguanas, birds, a cat, some other cool lizard that fans its neck and runs away on its hind legs, countless birds and geckos. Seeing the native wildlife is one of the great things about traveling. The critters we saw either ignored us or ran away. Some reviews have said the beds were hard. I'd call them firm and say that we had no trouble sleeping at all. The food was very good. There are three a la carte restaurants and the buffet. We were able to eat all our evening meals at the a la cartes and preferred the show at the Japanese, the venue at the Italian and the food at the Mexican. You will read other people\u2019s complaints about the food at the Japanese and Italian restaurants but think for a minute about what kind of burrito you would get in Tokio or Milan. They do a very good job with the food here, the baking is exquisite. We ate all kinds of buns and pastries that were very tasty. One of my biggest missions of the day was exploring the buffet to see what I could get them to put in my made to order omelets \u2013 so good. Sadly my wife only tried her first one on our last day. Prior to that she\u2019d been enjoying the fresh fruit, yogurt and granola for breakfast. The pool and beach are great. There are two pools, one with a swim up bar and one without and three beach areas. There is a beach area to the North from which you can see a pier and watch the volleyball court. In the middle there is a raised boardwalk area (some reviewers have called it a wall, but it\u2019s a board walk) that has a railing with Plexiglas inserts to block the wind so people who choose this section of the beach are protected. Then to the South there is a third beach area from which you can swim or take out a catamaran or jet ski. The para-sailing also leaves from near here. You won\u2019t find any better service anywhere than that which you receive from Azucena at the beach. She was working the boardwalk section when we were there. She is the \u2018white flower\u2019 that her name means. Every time she sees you she says hi and remembers your drink orders perfectly even if you, like me, switch from time to time. A couple of times the resort set up a little souvenir market in the main square. This was very nice as the vendors here understand their privilege of being on the resort and don\u2019t harass you or make you feel compelled to buy anything. There is also a souvenir vendor every day beside the one pool. My five pieces of advice are: 1: go to the dollar store and get yourself a soap dish. The bathrooms are beautiful but the sink space is modern and sparse so a soap dish will keep you from messing up the counter. 2: while our room did have an input for our iPod to the alarm clock it was a mono clock so if you are big into your music bring your own speakers. If you are not then it doesn\u2019t matter one bit. 3: change your money to pesos before you go down. If you are going from Canada and there\u2019s a Travellex in the airport they will buy back any unused pesos when you get back at no charge. Mexico is trying very hard to encourage the use of the Peso so some places won\u2019t take dollars. 4: eat at a Tapanyaki table in the Japanese restaurant early in your stay. The show is great and you\u2019ll get a chance to sit with some other visitors and make some good friends 5: always keep your camera with you \u2018cause you never know when one of the friends you met at the Tapanyaki table will all of a sudden take off because she\u2019s finally seen her first lemur and wants to get a closer look.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cquiet, very very quiet\u201d", "Author": "gonetosnorkle", "ReviewID": "UR105621753", "Content": "Just got back from this holiday, there is really nothing to do at this hotel.

The Hostess Estela at the buffet and Mexican restaurant/snack hut was always cheerful and helped me with my Spanish lessons :) That girl put in some crazy long hours but never complained, always had a huge smile and recognized us each time!

Karina, one of the servers from the pool bar fast became my new best friend! Always a great smile, super quick and fun to joke around with! She is amazing. The beach is fine, it's the ocean, sometimes you are going to get some seaweed. If you want to hang out at a nicer beach then head into Playa Del Carmen, bring your suit and hang out there. The bartenders at the lobby bar are a fun, great, mischievous bunch! ;) Always having fun with us and made some pretty powerful and yummy drinks!!! The coffee lounge fast became my favorite place after dinner for the yummiest lattes! The entertainment staff were adorable.

Don't be afraid to ask questions and check things out right away when you get there because your vacation will be over before you know it.

The food was amazing, no complaints at all there , the beach was really nice but a little windy, the red flags were up for the 5 days we stayed there.. Twice we walked about a 15 MIN up the beach to a natural cenote! its sooo cool,, fresh water gets pushed out in the ocean at this spot so its kind of like a small river coming through the sand thats crystal clear, and about 9 feet deep, so u can swim in it, and try swimming against it! sooo neat.. The locations perfect , $10.00 cab to 5th ave. we went to blue parrott down town for the 15th time, cant get enough of that night club!.. the grounds are very well kept, and theres no elevators! thats a major bonus cuz who wants to take elevators in a highrise, when you have a spot with tonnes of 3 story high villas! was perfect! The only complaint was its not 24 HR, so we came back from the bars at about 3 AM, and not a sole was around, everything was all closed up.. we tipytoed back to the room, and a security guard even escorted us worrying we would wake someone up I guess LOL But Honestly, this place is very great, friendly staff, great vibes here!", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAn amazing week!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "geomm74", "ReviewID": "UR103110856", "Content": "Where to begin.... I'll start with the negative.... NONE!!! Now for the positive. My girlfriend and I arrived to be met with cold drinks while we checked in. Since we checked in at 10am they put away our bags and pointed us in the direction of the pool. At the pool we met the two barkeeps. David and Aber (sp). They worked their butts off to keep the drinks full and both were very polite young men. After leaving the pool we checked into a beautiful, modern, clean room. During our stay we were welcomed one night to a yummy tray of deserts and on another night we found a bottle of red wine and strawberrys. As for the food.... We can't say enough about the Japanese restaurant. We ate there 3 times. Once we enjoyed hibachi and the other times had the most professional and nice waiter one could ask for. Thank you Hector! Now for the grounds. Clean, clean, clean and very beautiful!!! These men and women work around the clock to keep this place spotless! Even the lobby bar bathroom was spotless. The entertainment was also tons of fun! From the entertainment crew that got us in the pool to play volleyball to the crew that put on the night show. Thank you for a fun time full of great memories. If you want a smaller resort where you are not a number but a person, you need to stay at the Ocean maya. Every employee greeted us with a warm smile and a sincere hola as we crossed paths. The level of hospitality was amazing. We will return to Mexico next year for vacation. And we can't imagine staying anywhere else. Thank you staff at the Ocean maya royale.

We stayed in one of the honeymoon suites and it was fabulous. We had no complaints about the room except for the bed was a bit uncomfortable. I've never really been to a hotel where the bed wasn't though, so it's not really a complaint. The resort was so beautiful. We never got sick of it! Palm trees everywhere, awesome landscaping, just gorgeous. The staff was excellent everywhere in the buffet areas and at the bars. We had privilege wristbands so we got all of the top shelf liquors and drinks so that was definitely a plus. I'm a beer girl and pretty much all they had was Corona Extra on tap except for at the Japanese restaurant they had a light beer. Not sure if it was Modelo or just Corona light but that was my favorite. I would have preferred a light beer everywhere we went, but hey, it was what they had, it was good and I drank all sorts of other drinks as well. The Japanese restaurant was delicious, Mexican was good, and the Italian restaurant was delicious but for some reason that one was very slow at bringing out our food. It may have just been our waiter at the time or time of night or something, but it took forever. Good food there though as well. If you go to this resort, it is definitely worth it to upgrade to a privilege room if possible, because you are entitled to free room service and you get to sit in a special area even in the buffets, where a waiter gets your drinks and anything you would like to order from the menu. It is great. If you don't have a privilege room, you can upgrade to a privilege wristband for $20 more a day. I definitely think it's worth it! The buffet food was decent, better than some other places I have been to. But the food at the El Charro(Snack area) for lunch wasn't the greatest. I preferred breakfast and lunch in La Hacienda much better. The only complaint I have from our experience is the smell of sewage outside in one or two areas of the resort. It was kind of gross but there are ways to bypass so you don't have to smell it. Besides a few flaws, I thought it was a beautiful resort and no place is perfect. We had an awesome time and it is a great place to just relax and enjoy the beautiful weather, which was perfect by the way. The ocean was a hop, skip, and a jump away from our resort too so it wasn't a long walk at all to the beautiful beach and ocean. Not much night life at all, but always something going on in the theatre whether it be karaoke or a mini play or mariachi band. The music would usually stop before midnight though, so after that we would just drink near the lobby and talk with new people until 2 when the bar closed. Then we would go back to our room and drink, go to bed, or use the hot tub on our patio. The vendors came and sold stuff a couple nights a week which is nice too. You can barter with them just like you would in town. They never came into the resort during the day though and cannot bug you on the beach which was really nice. All in all, it was a really good vacation and we had an awesome time.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Amazing\u201d", "Author": "SheepyVancouver_BC", "ReviewID": "UR102848064", "Content": "My husband and I went to Ocean Maya in March 2011, and had the most wonderful time.

This is a great resort if you are looking to relax because it is smaller and more intimate , if you want more activities and livelier night life at a resort, I would recommend the Ocean Turquesa H10. The rooms are very clean, the atmosphere is more laid back and quiet and the cabanas on the beach are amazing! I would recommend upgrading to the Privilege package because you get access to premium liquor , VIP seating for all of your meals as well as the cabanas on the beach (which you need to get up before 7am to get one)! There were a few drawback thou, the beds were uncomfortable and the food at the buffet is ok. This price point of resort doesn't include much seafood at all, but the staff is very friendly and accommodating. One tip I will give, do NOT go to Senior Frogs!! The entertainment staff will take you to different \"hot spots\" (Coco Bongo is fun) but do not pay money to go to Senior Frogs. The bar was totally dead, the service was horrible and the place was an absolute hole in the wall.....please don't waste your money there!

We upgraded to a oceanview suite all I can say is \"wow\" we could watch the sun rise every morning over the ocean. The rooms were clean and spacious. Not alot of privacy in the bathroom as the glass door separating the toilet/shower area from the mirror/sink is a visual barrier only. The grounds were well kept and clean. The beach was small, but not the resort's fault as alot of it was spept away in hurricanes, and the mexican gov't hasnt helped restore that area. The staff was awesome everyone so pleasant and kind.

Rooms: It looks like they really put some work into their rooms. Everything seems to be refurbished and we have a nice flat screen tv with a lot of American channels. All the rooms are in a bungalow that has 8 rooms each and every room looked like it had a terrace. Food: We didn't go to any of the al a carte restaurants, but the morning and evening buffet was well stocked and very good. They had fresh salads, a pasta bar, I feel that anyone can find something that they will like. There wasn't a poolside snack bar that you could just quick grab and go, but rather more of a sit down buffet style restaurant located by the pool. It had nachos, burgers, salads, pizza, and fries among other things. Beach: The beach is the biggest downfall of this resort. I don't know if the wind was just really strong when we were there, but you can't swim it was way too choppy! Also, they do not have much of a beach, but rather a large wall to break the strong surf. On either side of the wall there is beach as far as you can see in both directions however, and the resort does have a few chairs on either side of the wall. I never felt that we had to get up super early to get a chair, if you weren't picky we always found something. Bracelets/ Privilege: I don't know why this resort has a \"Privilege Club.\" It's a nice resort, but defiantly not \"fancy\" enough to warrant a \"privilege\" section. It seems the only thing that the Privilege section got was a roped off section in front of a wall and Top Shelf booze instead of bar pours. Neither one of these services warrant and extra $100 night to me. We had a green \"regular\" bracelet and i feel we got just as good as service as anyone else.

I would have to say that this is one of my favourite all inclusive resorts that I've stayed at thus far. The whole experience was flawless. First of all, I have to say right from the start i was greeted with a delicious \"welcome drink\" which was nice for our grand arrival. This was just the beginning... Hotel-The room was absolutely stunning. It felt like I was staying in a \"boutique style\" hotel. It had the vessel sink in the bathroom with the glass shower. Since the hotel was renovated in August 2010, it is obviously relatively new. For those who are into winding down in the evening with some television, they do have satellite and you are able to find some English speaking channels like CNN, American Network, etc. I also loved the fact that is hotel is divided up into Villas. You don't have the congestion of people waiting at the elevators and its more private where you are staying. I really felt like I was staying in a private place. The grounds were also very well maintained and well looked after. When you first arrive in the lobby you will see that this not your ordinary hotel, its a modern, but cozy hotel that makes you feel quite comfortable. Food- I have to say that I am a very picky eater and I tend to suffer with stomach issues quite often, but my experience at the Ocean Maya was fantastic! I always felt great and the selection was pretty good as well. My favourite was the mexican restaurant. The portions were big and I couldn't even finish my desert. The Japanese was also good because we had the chef cook right in front of us. Very fun! We never tried the Italian, but we heard that people went back for seconds or thirds because they enjoyed it so much! The Buffet was always fully stacked and I must say, the mexicans are really into their fruits and vegetables. Delicious! Coffee House- I have to say that the coffee at this resort was out of this world. The flavour was amazing. At breakfast time, I was always sure to ask for a second cup, although i was already full. Their breakfast is \"american style\" . I.e- hot cakes, pancakes, french toast, scambled eggs, omelettes, toast, muffins, croissants, etc. You will not go hungry. Service- The service was terrific! They really do go out of their way to make you happy and satisfied. They also have a sense of humour, which i admire. I see that many reviews were positive, but I also see that some people were complaining about the silliest things. I must say, do not hesitate for one moment to stay at this place. You will love it! Those people who are complaining about this hotel are obviously the type who complain about everything and anything. They will always find something to complain about no matter where they stay, even its the four seasons! Don't hesitate and book this hotel today! Beach- The beach wasn't the greatest, it was rather small, but the pools are beautiful and I didn't mind having servers come and ask me what drink I'd like next!

From the moment we arrived after our flight we felt pampered...we were given a drink of refreshing fruit punch as we were waiting to check in and made use of the courtesy room to change into our summer clothes while we waited for our room to be ready (we arrived at 12:30 pm and rooms are ready around 3pm) A shower was available but we didn't make use of that. The next day we attended the one hour orientation session offered by Christine from Nolitours. Her presentation was excellent and answered all our questions. It is clear that she loves Mexico and her enthusiasm was infectious! We went on 3 excursions (snorkelling at Puerto Morelos, the Coba Myan Encounter and the Xplor theme park. ) All were excellent with wonderful guides. The gardens at Ocean Maya are beautiful, the rooms spacious and very clean and the staff very friendly and accomodating. Each and every staff member we passed when walking around the resort greeted us warmly and with a beautiful smile. We enjoyed all the restaurants especially the buffet which is available every night. There was lots of variety (fresh fish was amazing) and the service was friendly and efficient. We also enjoyed our dinners at the a la carte restaurants. The shows offered in the evening were very entertaining and fun. The traditional Mexican dancers were truly outstanding with a wonderful live band and amazing and colorful traditional dresses. This resort is a very relaxing spot with beautiful palm trees as well as hammocks and chairs to lounge on. We were pleased with the spa services (massages and a manicure) and enjoyed the live saxaphone music on several evenings. Although I was travelling without my husband I felt very comfortable sitting in the lobby enjoying a drink and a good book. The clientelle seemed to be mostly young and middle aged adults with a few teenagers and a few young families. As we were looking for peace and quiet this was the perfect get away.

We thought the grounds were so lush and green and kept immaculate. All of us decided to stay \"Privilige\" and for the most part enjoyed these services. The internet wi-fi worked for about 10 minutes on one day in our room, so that was disappointing. The rooms were very nice and quite modern. The bed was great! We had a balcony facing the garden and it was quiet and beautiful. We tried to use the breakfast in bed (as part of our Privilige package) but after 80 minutes we called and they said it would still be another half hour. The food was ok at this resort. I found the buffet had lots of options from meats, salads, fruit, fish etc, typical buffet. My husband and I did not like the Japanese Restaurant at all. We are not big on Asian food, however this was horrible. Our friends decided to give it another go and went another night and said it was better. The mexican restaurant again was ok, nothing special. We did however really enjoy the Italian restaurant, grilled lobster, soups, breads were very tasty. Entertainment was very good, they worked hard and put on a great show every evening. We enjoyed the luxury beds in the Privilege area on the beach, kept very clean with complimentary ice buckets, towells, sunscreen, champagne and books. We think that they should keep the Tiki Bar opened later at night, this is a good way to meet people instead of the set up the have now where everybody sits at their own tables. Reading other reviews I am not sure why someone said they only could pay with American Express, not true, I carried and paid with pesos, visa, canadian and US anywhere and everywhere. I had read before going that the mosquitos were quite bad. I never saw them as they must be very tiny, but I sure did feel them.

Ocean Maya had a nice offer and we decided to try. We arrived very late at night, the guy at the reception gave us a room and Privileged bracelets. Our first room was a total disappointment - it was very humid, musty, my passport became wet in the safe! So we asked to change the room right after the first night - but we moved to a different room only after the third (and only after a certain fight). The second room was on the second floor of the villa and was much better. Apparently later we have found out that EVERYBODY who got the room on the first floor was asking to move up, coz it's just impossible to stay in such a musty and humid place, sleep there, rest - terrible! Second disappointment was food. First day we went to the Japanese restaurant - bad bad bad, waste of time. Sushi and rolls are incredibly bad! I know it was Mexican resort, but i also don't live in Japan! Mexican restaurant was very average too, we hoped that at least the local cuisine will be good - but no, it was a buffet behind the scenes, and the waiters were simply bringing you food from the already prepared food! The only pleasant surprise was the Italian restaurant. But as we were not the only ones who realized it - the line to get a table was usually up to 30 min. Buffet lunch - not impressive, even though the variety was big, the quality was poor. Definitely not the 5 star hotel level. But to be fair - the BBQ on the beach was very good and tasty! Our third disappointment was personnel. They are all smiling to you and being nice - until you ask them to help you! The girl at the Privilage desk - rude and unprofessional. The Italian guy at the reception - Fabio - incredibly rude and mean. No complaints about the waiters in Italian restaurant, who even spoke Italian! One more thing that was just outrageous - internet. When we arrived - the wifi in the lobby was working. In 2 days it went down. Every day they were promising to have it fixed the next day, it lasted for 4 days, wasn't fixed and they always had an excuse WHY they can't have it fixed so far. Really? that's the 5 stars? I would say that the rating of the hotel was confusing. When you go to the 5 star hotel you expect the level of service. If you adjust it to the real level of 3 stars for this place - it's fine.

It was a disgusting stay and no service to speak of. My main memory was sewer smell 24hrs a day. I could go on and on but will spare you :-). This hotel is clean, beautiful and amazing staff. We would observe them working and interacting with people. The Mexican people are truly happy and love to make your trip memorable. Our room was large and cleaned daily/bar restocked. There was never a problem getting bottled water to go for day trips or in the room. It is very romantic for couples and I guess that is why it is changing in May to adult only. My friend and I still had a great time interacting with other tourists and the wonderful recreation staff (Laurena.....always in our hearts with her beautiful spirit). Our day trips were all great and would do more of them next time. Loved Xa ha park! Our negative experience was the Party Hoppers for 85 dollars plus 5 dollars tip. The first two places were ok. We did have VIP seating and service. The final place Coco Bongo was awful. We couldn\u2019t see anything from where we were. There was a lot of smoke (not cigarette) every fifteen minutes or so sent out into the crowd. If you have asthma take your puffers. The music was great and if we could of viewed the show it would of been better. I would suggest not going on a Fri or Sat for maybe less crowded. It was not possible to move on the second floor and leaving via the only exit was a nightmare. It is difficult to find your way out if you don\u2019t know this place. I hope there is never a need for emergency evacuation there. The show is worth seeing so go early not 11 pm at night and if possible during the week. Other people from the group left and went to another bar next door because it was too crowded. You do get a ride there and back to your hotel in the package. The next day we mentioned it Nolitours reps Catherine and all she said was did you tell the Party Hopper escort? We did speak to our server several times. The VIP area was already full before we arrived and it would have been better to stay on the main floor. From the main floor you can look up and view the show. My next visit I will not use Nolitours or Air Transit (no issues with the airline at all). We met some wonderful people and have great new memories. We bartered and met a lot of the local people on our shopping trips. Make sure to go to Playa del Carmen 5th avenue to shop. There is so much to see there we went twice. The staff, other visitors and beautiful grounds made it a wonderful vacation. I heard about the Privilage option on our last day. If you want 5 star then I would recommend upgrading.

My girlfriend and I stayed here and had the best time ever, we are both 22 and have no complaints. I will break things down: Grounds, building, location and cleanliness: The resort is beautiful and well maintained. Immaculate! there is someone constantly grooming and fixing the slightest details. The rooms are very nice and very clean. From the lobby to the beach it is at most a 2-3 minute walk, which is nothing when compared to other resorts. All the buildings are located on the way towards the beach. At one point a long the path there is a slight smell of sewer,if you may, but unless you stop and sit there to smell it you cant notice it anywhere. It really is such a small detail that you hardly notice. The location is good. not too far from Playa, the city. you can cab for $14 or take the bus ( not scary and actually nice) for 20 pesos, we did both. FOOD: The food was far better than I expected. The main buffet had so much to choose from. and had cooks there at every meal ( what they cooked depended on the meal) to cook fresh meats, pastas, omelets, and burgers. The service is exceptional and everyone is more than happy to help you enjoy your meal. There was also live saxophone at some meals. There is a juice bar at breakfast a long with bottles of alcohol at breakfast for you to use to your liking. I will say, however, you are ridiculous if you are expecting lobster and top cuisine like here in Canada or USA. We didn't get sick from the food either. There is food available pretty much 24/7. At the cafe you can order food after 11 until 6 I believe. we ordered a pizza at 430 am and had it delivered to our room. :) A la Carte: Japanese... it was very good actually, amazing service and if you sit at the grill there is a really nice show that they put on while they cook. Mexican... very good as well, a lot to select from on the menu and we both enjoyed our meals. the service again is remarkable. BAR: ***** We brought \" 1.5 Liter bubba kegs********** BRING A LARGE TRAVEL MUG OR SOMETHING LARGE TO TRANSPORT YOUR DRINK IN. !!! It was kinda crazy the amount alcohol they poured into one of these things. I questioned if it was even drinkable. But though the drinks had a lot of booze in them they tasted really good. They enjoyed pouring these large crazy drinks. There was not much for lineups. Sometimes a waitress would just serve you on the beach or in the lobby unexpectedly which was nice, or you could go to the bar and you get prompt service. Hardly had to wait for a drink at all. There was no problem getting hammered, really I can assure you that if you drink, you're going to get drunk. A hangover is more a reality you have to face than something you have to strive for. Entertainment: We absolutely loved the entertainment staff. We didn't get a chance to really meet or party with the guys, but the girls were amazing and always up for dancing and having a great time. Susana and Loraina (both) made our trip something we will never forget. They are really a lot of fun. Loraina (I hope I am spelling it right) took us to Coco Bongo. it was 45 usd and included open bar, admission, and transportation. She went with us and partied with us. She made she we had great service from the server, made sure we had a good table and made sure to keep our drink coming. She willingly drank with us and made us feel like VIP. It is a MUST DO we stayed until 3:30AM and even then she asked if we wanted to stay or go. There are sports and games put on by the entertainment staff all day, and at night (9:30) there is a nightly show. From local dance, singing, bands, to theater musicals. Afterwards there is music and dancing for the willing. The entertainment staff, usually Susana and the Lorainas would be there trying to get people to dance. We danced all night with them and pulled onlookers in to dance. It was a BLAST. It is what you make it. BEACH/POOL I looked at pictures and read reviews and I was worried, but the beach was good. There is a wall to protect the beach from storms/erosion. There is a section of beach beside a pool that isn't in front of the wall. The water is nice and blue/green. I had no problems swimming in it and enjoying the ocean. We usually got up at 7:30 -8 AM and went and threw a towel on a chair. We still found chairs after 9AM on a couple of mornings. I look at it as you are on vacation so why would you want to sleep in. Get up, grab a chair on the beautiful beach and sleep there. Its better than your dark room. I certainly wouldn't pay money to sleep in all day. The pools are nice and cool. really cool you down on a hot hot day. Clean as well. STAFF: Everyone is so friendly and make a point of saying hello as you pass by. Always smiling, always eager to serve, help, and do whatever they can to make you enjoy your stay. THANK YOU ALL! Everyone was AMAZING Key points: BRING A LARGE DRINK CONTAINER makes the trip that much better. Get up at 730-8:30 AM to reserve your chair/ ENJOY the beach participate and talk to the entertainment staff. They are genuine and a lot of fun. Go to the night shows. They are put on for you to enjoy If you are afraid to dance just participate in the dance lessons, or simply ask the entertainment staff to teach you. It's fun, easy and they enjoy your interest. Go to COCO BONGO with the staff. You will never forget your experience I promise! Go to Playa... in the after noon. its cooler temperature wise. Theres a bit of night life and the shops are easier to barter with.

Bear with me - this is a long review, but I\u2019m sure it will help! Last year, my boyfriend and I stayed at the sister H-10 hotel in Puerto Morelos (Ocean Coral y Turquesa) - and we didn\u2019t write about it in Trip Advisor, but we should have! I am in love with H-10 Resorts! We arrived before check in - Dulce at the front desk had a smile and information for us. She took our luggage, gave us the all inclusive bracelets, the towel cards, the lock for the safe and essentially said \u201cHave at it\u201d. Thankfully, we had packed a \u2018beach bag\u2019 for my carry on, so we were able to enjoy the resort the full 3 hours before we had a room. We immediately made friends with Ignacio - the bartender in the lobby during the \u2018mornings\u2019. He was always smiling while multi-tasking \u2026 especially taking care of very thirsty Americans! His attention to detail was impeccable - but to be honest, everyone who worked there had great attention to detail. For something sweet - try the Pink Lemonade. If you like spicy - try the \u201cOjo Rojo\u201d. :-) Jose in the coffee shop is an incredible person! Funny and full of life. Always smiling while making our espressos or cafe con leche\u2019s. We first met him after hitting the gym - and I tried to get my boyfriend to NOT hit the sweets fridge, but that didn\u2019t happen and Jose was laughing at our antics and he immediately became our friend! The next day he remembered our names and he makes my special cafe con leche with a smiley face. :-) He is just wonderful! A gem! The gym is \u2026 OK. It has circuit training and free weights and some cardio (elliptical, treadmill, bike). My only complaint is that one treadmill was not working, while the other one most definitely needs a tune up. But, who am I kidding - who goes on vacation and works out!?! If you do - sorry for offending you. I went to work out while the sun was setting - it was a beautiful view - all the birds flying, treetops as far as I could see, just gorgeous. The breakfast at \u201cLa Hacienda\u201d is phenomenal. Whatever you want - they have. Omlettes made to order? Done. Yogurt with granola? Si. Fresh fruit? Claro que si! Toast and jam? Si! Cottage cheese and veggies? Yep! Bloody Mary\u2019s or Mamosas? Indeed! Chilequiles? Oh my goodness, yes! Fresh slices of cheeses and meats? Ding, Ding, Ding! My man Jose would bring our 2 waters and make our coffee without even asking by the third or fourth day! I cannot say enough, the service is impeccable! Susana is the chef, you might not notice her because she is always busy cooking or serving, but when you do, her smile lights up the room! She is so friendly and so helpful, especially with my broken Spanish! I didn\u2019t do any of the spa treatments because I am not a \u2018spa\u2019 person, but it looked amazing in there! Our day consisted of: Sunrise around 6a, walking the beach until 7a, breakfast, nap, beach or excursion. When walking the beach - go left from our resort - like you are headed towards the Italian Restaurant. It might be 20 - 25 minutes to get there, but there is an amazing fresh water river to check out. TRUST ME! At night, we were mostly spent from the day. I understand when writers would say that this resort is not a party resort - if that is what you are looking for, you should check into something that is actually in the city of Playa del Carmen - or in the Hotel Zone in Cancun. At night in the lobby they would have live jazz. It was nice. Oh - also, in the lobby they have free WI-FI! How great is that!!! Also, what I really liked - On Thursdays, they have a \u2018Beach Party\u2019 where they have a BBQ, live music, dancing and do a presentation of all the head honchos of the hotel. It was really nice to see them and meet them. It really makes you feel like you mean something to them. I have to say, every time I saw a worker, they were always doing something : cleaning, sweeping, painting, wiping, fixing ... but they always said 'Hola' - I loved that! Walking through the grounds was like a mini-botanical garden. In closing, I understand that you can\u2019t please them all - reading the previous posts when I was searching for hotels for my spring break; I was really hesitant when I booked Ocean Maya. I guess I am writing this to make sure that no one feels the hesitation that I felt when I booked my room, but I am so glad we went! It was a perfect break from the long winters of Chicago. Some side notes from our trip: We took taxi\u2019s into Playa - depending on the taxi - he would charge us between $14 - 17 USD. Just ask before getting in, so you aren\u2019t surprised. It averaged about $15 USD. Avenida Quinta is a huge tourist destination. Be prepared for businesses having workers sitting outside the doors saying - \u201cAlmost Free\u201d. I do have to say - it is IDEAL people watching! Grab a beer at one of the many outdoor bars, chill and people watch.

The Japanese A la Cart was our Favorite.. They have Restaurant seating & you can also Request to sit around the Grill.. Both totally different experiences! With the Grill they make Stirfry in front of you with Entertainment During the cooking Process... Throwing Brocoli into our mouths.. Lighting Big Fires on the Grill.. TONES of fun! * Rooms --were Nice! BarFridge Restocked Everyday. There was 3 girls staying in our Room & only one Mirror.. Which made for Great difficult when it came time to get dolled up!! So my Recommendation for the Hotel would be to have more than One Mirror in Each Room! Otherwise Wonderful Rooms *Staff-- INCREDIBLE! Super friendly, accomodating & FUN! They encourage participatin in beach Games & Let you know about the fun happenings @ night (Senior frogs, cocobongo's, ect) If you do choose to go to one of the Resort trips to a Bar.. you get a great price which encludes a ride there, back & unlimited drinks there ANDThe staff come with you to ensure you have fun and get treated well!! Ricardo& Lorena Will always have a Place in our Hearts! Along with Omar and Gisella...<3 *Drinks-- The bartenders are veryy friendly as well! Yummy Drinks Before going on our trip I had read threw Hundreds of comments about the hotel to get an idea of what to be careful of and what to be sure we took part in..And really the only complaint I read was that the Hotel does NOT have a nightlife... and I can now say That I Very Much Agree! We are a Young Group 22-26 and of corse Wanting to partake in Some Latenight Mexico Fun.. However @ 2am they stop serving alcohol and by 2:45am they are politely trying to get you to go back to your Villas.. no beach bar.. no beach parties.. nadda! The party is moreso during the day at this resort. To Ensure we had Fun nights while we were there we went into playadel Carmen a couple nights to Cocobongos & Senior Frogs.. & We made sure to make friends with Other Partiers @ our Resort so by the End We had a Fun Crew that Would Stay up @ Night! Over all We had a Magnificent Time. I would Definitely Recommend this hotel to others and I would Definitely go there again!

We actually upgraded from another hotel, so I was glad we had such a positive experience. The staff was extremely friendly, greeted us with drinks, etc. However, like other reviews, the drinks were weak!! My boyfriend enjoyed the Mojitos though :-) Javier, the bellboy was really helpful and just a great, friendly guy. Lorena, who is part of the entertainment staff was also great. One night, we paid $45 each (USD) and she took us to Coco Bongo from 9p-2a. Transportation & drinks were included and we had a fabulous time! Our room was very nice. We were located right by the beach, pool and pool bar, which is a few minute walk from the lobby. Our shower did leak each time we took a shower, but it wasn't worth changing rooms over. The TV was nice and had English channels (someone on here said all channels were in Spanish--not the case). Food: the food was alright. We had Italian the 1st night (I enjoyed the seafood risotto and my boyfriend had a steak dish which he really liked). The Japanese was good too. That was the only place we went to twice. The Mexican restaurant was ok, but I felt sick the entire next day, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it. The buffet for breakfast & lunch was fine, but did get a little boring after the first few days. All in all though, for the cost and knowing it's an all-inclusive (where food is not always expected to be top-notch), the food met our expectations. We only did one excursion which we booked through the hotel (Rudy was his name). We paid $70 each (USD) to go ziplining, ATVing and to see (a.k.a jump from a 30 ft. cliff into) 2 cenotes, which are these gorgeous natural sink holes that are actually all over this part of Mexico. Google the word \"cenote\" and you'll see what I mean! Some tips/words of wisdom: -Do not rent a car. This was a big no-no!! We booked a car b/c it appeared to be just as expensive as paying someone to take us to and from the airport/hotel. When we picked the car up, we had to pay an extra $315 (USD) for insurance!! -If you want a beach chair, wake up early and put a towel/magazine on it. Beach chairs are hard to come by -This hotel is not actually in Playa del Carmen, it's about a 15 minute drive away -The beach area of the hotel is not so pretty, however, if you walk about 10 minutes down the beach, past a few other resorts, you will get to \"tres rios.\" You have to see it to believe it. There are these 3 small fresh water rivers that lead out to the ocean. Totally gorgeous and totally worth the walk!! We went there every day to relax, swim and wnjoy ourselves! -Great shopping on 5th Avenue in Playa. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

Also would have been nice to have a screen on the patio doors to let the evening breeze blow through, however again didn't mention it as it wasn't that big of a deal.

March 5/2011. It surpassed my expectations for a resort for the money we paid. The grounds and surroundings are immaculate. The service we received was excellent.

We received excellent housekeeping services. ( Villa 27 ) Lots of fresh towels, always a full mini bar with lots of water, and fresh coffee every morning to be made. Beds were firm, but that's what we like, and we had no trouble with the water pressure or air conditioning. The 3 a la carte restaurants , Mexican, Italian and Japenese, were excellent. We ate at these 4 times during our stay, and never needed a reservation. Sometimes you may have to wait 10 minutes, but the view is breathtaking and the wait was always worth it. There was an incredible variety of food at the buffett as well and lots of it. From the Mamosa's to the pastries. We did all our tours in the mornings, back to the resort by noon, and from there went and lied on the beach loungers. If you wanted a lounger by the pool, you did need to go early to get one for the day, but for us, we didn't find it an inconvience. As for the drinks, we always asked for doubles, and had no problem enjoying our beverages. I will say, our only complaint, was the wine. It was horrible. You could buy other ones, but the available wines, both red & wine , were not enjoyable for us. So we just drank something else! We didn't party all night, but if you wanted to there was always something going on, from CoCo Bongo's in Playa , shows in the theatre, the disco after 10:30 or visiting with people you meet. Mike's Cafe was became a hang out. Great Latte. One of the best parts of the stay was meeting Giselle from the entertainment group. Her energy was mesmorizing and her smile infectious.

The Italian was fun and again, very yummy. The Buffet has soo many choices, and most of everything we had was very tasty. The evening entertainment was fun.

There are so many choices you have to be a real picky eater to complain about the food here. We never heard of anyone getting sick or anything either. The only problem is that there really is NOT 24 hour food available unless you ask someone. We were in town until after 11pm one night and kept being told that snacks would be set up \"any minute\" in the coffee shop, which never happened. The bartender asked us what we wanted and had someone make cheeseburgers and fries for the 2 of us. This was very nice, but if we hadn't asked, we would've gone to bed hungry! Drinks: No problem with drinks at all! Try them all! LOL Entertainment: The mexican dancers and music at 9:30 was great! The other shows are ok, but we're not that into them anyway. We just sat in the courtyard and heard most of them going on in the theater. They did have an Oscar night while we were there, with champagne, strobe lights, Oscars and the whole works. They really do try to make it entertaining so no real complaints.....except....there is no music down at the pool bar from when daily activities end (usually about 3pm) until the bar closes there at 6pm. It would be nice to have a little background Mexican music for atmosphere....this was a big negative! Also the fact that the pool bar closes at 6pm is a real bummer! It's still sunny out! You have to go up to the lobby bar for drinks after 6. Excursions: We found them WELL worth the money! Horseback ridind and snorkelling was about 130US each and another day we did ziplining, repelling and snorkelling in a cenote for 86 US each. Great value and well worth it! Beach: I'm completely honest here and am NOT one of those \"hard to please\" people....sandy part was gorgeous but there was a red flag up and you could not swim in the water AT ALL! Garbage and weeds were at least 4 feet from the water's edge. They had one little pool boy out there ALL day long with a pitchfork and wheelbarrow. People were just shocked at the state of it and would take pics like we did and shake their heads in digust as they walked along the beach. One woman dropped her camera in the water off the boardwalk and everyone was surprised that she actually ventured in to get it! She came out looking like the loch ness monster! It's too bad because this beach may be prone to getting things wash up due to currents, etc...I don;t really know. But we were just surpised that they really did nothing to clean it up the entire time we were there. The landscaping and rooms are sooooo clean, they're immaculate! You will not find so much as a cig butt on the ground! We just wish you could swim there! Walk down the beach 10 or 20 min or go into Playa del Carmen. The beach there is UNREAL!!!! It's definately a must-see! Service: There were NO problems with the service. They are so nice and friendly, but be prepared with lots of tips money! Overall: The beach is very important to us so we would not return to this resort. They have their priorities off on this point and could easily have a crew of workers to work daily at the water. The one guy who had this monstrous job worked tirelessly all day and you wouldn't even know it by looking at the water. On the other hand, if you don't mind travelling to swim at a beach and want a great relaxing vacation, this is the place.

Ocean Maya has to be one of the best hotels due to food, service and entertainment. Check-in: Fast and efficient but not before 3pm can you check in as the rooms aren\u2019t ready. Rooms: We were in building room 902 bldg 9 with an ocean view. They are total of 36 villas with 8 units in each 4 on the bottom floor and 4 on top with 20 steps to the top level. The room was spacious l-shaped with a king size bed,desk, plasma t.v.,mini frig, couch and chair. The bathroom has only one sink with large walk in marble shower. The door to the toilet is only frosted glass. Privilege Building is located near the main lobby and consists of 3 floors with an elevator. These rooms are larger and more spacious than the villas. Food: Main buffet good variety with various themes in the evening such as Italian night, Mexican night, Caribbean night. Be sure to get there at 6:30pm as the main meat dish is gone later. Nights we were there they had prime rib roast, pork loin roast and whole mini chickens another night and there isn\u2019t any long line-ups as buffet is fast and quick. Lunch is in the Mexican restaurant with good variety, fish, steak or hamburger with lots of salads and fresh fruit and ice cream. On Thursday they have a beach party/BBQ from 12:30 to 3pm. Mike\u2019s Coffee: 4 to 11pm specialty coffees, tea, hot choc, and also baguettes and pastries Restaurants: Yookobo is a Japanese Restaurant with two tepanyaki tables running at a time (8 people at each). The menu has three sections appetizers, soups, main entr\u00e9e and dessert. Be sure to try the delicious fried banana and ice cream for dessert. There aren\u2019t any reservations you just show up at 6:30pm or later but the earlier you are you get right in and served faster. Charro is the Mexican Restaurant service is slow due to large number of tables there. Food is good with steak, meat platters, and quesadilla. The lime pie is a disappointment. LaDolce Vita is the Italian Restaurant down on the water. It has a marguerite bar in the middle and tables on either side. Our group enjoyed this one the most. I had grouper with brandy sauce on a bed of spinach. The pastas dishes were not good but the lasagna was great and so was the minestrone soup. Be sure to have the Italian coffee cake for dessert as it is delicious. Only place in hotel grounds where the mosquitoes are bad as restaurant is more open. Some restaurants are closed certain nights so be sure to check your calendar to see which are open. Dress code isn\u2019t very strict as long as it isn\u2019t wet. Entertainment: The entertainment is excellent with professional Mexican dancers Thursday night, Sat. is Mayan dancers, Sunday was Oscar night with the red carpet to walk down and you got your picture taken with an Oscar, Monday night was Movie night lip singing and dancing, Tuesday was great Grease show, Wed. was Ocean night with Karaoke (audience participation) not too good. Internet: Free WiFi in the main lobby only if you bring your own laptop. Internet cost to use their computers is $12 U.S an hour which can be divided into three units. There are also other internet machines for $10 an half hour. Beach: On the left side is a long walk out pier and the beach water is full of seaweed and not very clean. In front of the pool is a wooden walkway with plax a glass fence and on the right side is a very nice beach. There is always a shortage of pool/beach chairs which the staff knows about but do nothing about the situation. Free shuttle to Playa Del Carmen every day pickup at hotel is 12n and comes home at 5pm. Plan to book the shuttle a day ahead to get on. The bus holds 24 people. The taxi fare is 14 dollars from Playa del Carmen if you don\u2019t want to stay that long or 15 pesos with the Collectivo which stops outside hotel on highway and then a 15 minute walk to the hotel lobby. Tours are offered by your travel agent but also a guy walks along the beach and his tours are half price. We went to Coba for $60 which was all day with Coba, Cenote swimming, and Mayan Village tour in air conditioned van which holds 9 people and only stops twice for more people. Great service called Pleasant Tours [---] phone. They offer ten different tours just ask for a better price and he will lower the price he gives you. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and also go back again. In May it is to become an adult only hotel but there weren\u2019t many kids there now. There are 50% Canadian with the rest Mexican or United States citizens. Be sure to bring $50 U.S. dollars for tipping as you can\u2019t get any while there. There is an ATM machine in the hotel lobby. The U.S. dollar isn\u2019t accepted as freely as before and they prefer pesos.

If you get placed close to the lobby you can hear them playing the same disco music every night until 2am. Our room smelled like raw sewage and we had to eventually move to another room which took great effort to have the staff realize we were not enjoying our stay. When we arrived the lock on the balcony door was broken off and we couldn't lock the door. This was rectified quickly - the staff gave us a wood stick to lock the window. There are no screens on the windows - tons of mosquitos. The showers leak badly onto the floors and had to mop it up with towels. Had to ask 5 times over the course of 3 days to get face cloths in our room. Our refridgerator never worked at all. The cable they subscribe to is all in Spanish. The beds are hard as a rock. Ask for a blanket if you need one! They're nice and soft. After we switched to the new hotel room things went more smoothly. The rooms are very gorgeous and newly updated and do look nice and the majority of the staff is friendly and helpful. If you leave tips for the cleaning staff they treat you like royalty. They even make towel art to leave on the beds each day. If you have a problem with anything talk to the Nolitours people. They were most excellent and were able to resolve issues quickly. Or you can talk to guest services. I unfortunately had the pleasure of having to meet the resort doctor because I was stung by a sea urchin in Xel-Ha snorkelling park. He was very professional and knowledgeable and is looking out for the guests best interests. He saved me from having to go to the hospital in Playa. The beaches are really nice and the bar staff are great! The drinks are very weak (alcohol wise) but if you ask for doubles they're more than happy to oblige. It was really nice that they had a little drink special each day. It was a great way to try new and novel drink ideas that I would never have thought of ordering. We had an awful experience with the Italian a la carte restaurant. The food was so bad it was inedible and we ended up having to leave hungry. Instead of having 5 course meals at the a la cartes I would love to see this hotel focus on QUALITY over quantity. Some of the staff in the Mexican restaurant were very rude to us due to a misunderstanding on their part. One meal was ordered and another delivered and they refused to fix it and actually argued with us about it. The head chef that evening was very rude about the situation and dinner was spoiled - and on Valentines day too. The entertainment staff are genious when it comes to the traditional and mayan dancing. Be sure not to miss that! Skip the other shows - grease etc. Really hokey and not worth the time. I really didn't like it too much when the entertainment staff kept nagging us to join in their couples games and volleyball and disco dancing. Some people just don't want to participate and you shouldn't harass them about it. It was nice that you could book a sailboard for free! There were never enough beach chairs for all of the guests. Unless you get there at 7am and put all your stuff on chairs to reserve them there is no way you will get a lounger. I really appreciated the hammock area! That was very nice. Another suggestion that I have is to get more variety of music for the pool area. They played the same cd and the same few dance music songs the entire week. Beware of keeping your patio and windows open at night. Not only will the mosquitos get you but there are other animals such as raccoons that we witnessed the staff feeding. Because they're so used to getting hand outs as soon as they see you they run to you for food. Make sure you go for a long walk on the beach. If you head passed some other hotels there is a little stream/grotto which is PERFECT for snorkelling. The best a la carte restaurant was most definitely the Japanese restaurant. It was the most popular and you may have to wait a while to get in but it was definitely worth it! None of the other restaurants or the buffet ever had a wait to be seated. The gardens are immaculately kept! So beautiful with all the flowers and plants. The gardening staff do a wonderful job! Another thing that I appreciate was all the little extra things to do at the resort. They had a fellow daily who was doing henna tattoos. There were spa ladies who were willing to put corn rows into the young guests hair. Also there were some vendors along the pool with pretty Mexican souvenirs. A booth even with Mexican ceramics that they would let you paint for 10-25.00 usd depending on how elaborate the ceramic piece was. I don't think we'd bother staying at this resort again. There are just too many others out there that make the extra effort to ensure their guests are comfortable. And honestly the food which is a large part of the appeal of this resort was rather awful. Next time I will seriously consider staying right in Playa del Carmen in a hotel and eat along 5th avenue instead of in the hotel.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSmall Resort with beautiful grounds, but problems with mosquitos.\u201d", "Author": "whiteshell12", "ReviewID": "UR97524615", "Content": "Stayed Feb 13-20. Weather was awesome 27-29 C everyday. Check in was quick and efficient with a welcoming drink. Rooms were clean and updated. Showers take a long time to get hot water and the shower door leaks out onto the floor. Beds are a little too firm. Do not take a room in first 2 or 3 buildings close to disco bar in court yard because disco music can go on late. Had to ask for soap & coffee packs for room after 4 days (even when we tipped room cleaner everyday). Linens on bed are scratchy. No shortage of good pillows. No screens on sliding door to patio/garden area. Several mosquitos were coming in from the sheltered alcove area from the main door into the room whenever you entered or exited the room. Received numerous mosquito bites even after swatting them in room every evening. Very small mosquitos, but leave big welts. Buffet was good and always found the selection of fruits, pastrys and chicken appealing. Highly recommend Japanese a la carte. Go early and put your name on the list as there are \"no reservations\". Did not like Italian a la carte. Asparagus had a charred flavour and the beef was very salty (over tenderized?). Not nearly enough lounge chairs on beach. Reservation needed for loungers (put a towel or book or hat to reserve before 8:00 am) or you will not get a lounger when you want one. Many loungers were booked all day with little occupancy. Not nice. Pools are cold and not used too much. Beaches are kept very clean with lovely white sand. Grounds are kept immaculant with hard working grounds keepers. Staff are very friendly, helpful and polite. Tips are appreciated but not always expected. Plenty of weak mixed drink, lots of cervasa (beer), house white and red wines are not very appealing. Highly recommend the Spanish dancers and the Mayan show in the theater in the evening at 9:30 pm. Very nice shuttle service to Playa del Carmen. Pick up is 11:00 am and returns at 5:00 pm. Only holds 20-24 people (approx). You need to book the day before @ 8:00 am or take a taxi for around 15.00 US. Evening time in Playa del Carmen is amazing. Liked the size of the resort and not needing a shuttle to get around. Would not stay here again because I am still scratching mosquito bites and not enough lounge chairs for guests.

My husband and I upgraded to the privilege package and were very happy we did so. Gave us the ability to make reservations at the a la carte restaurants (all three were fantastic), access to the roped off section of the beach with the Balinese beach beds, top shelf alcohol, a separate dining space in the buffet, etc. For the first two reasons alone it was worth the money (cost us $20 per person per day for our stay). The a la cartes don't accept reservations unless you have the privilege bracelet so go early and put your name on the list, especially when the resort is full. And if you want to reserve a lounge chair at the beach or pool you pretty much have to be down there with a towel before 8 am or else you won't get one for the entire day. The resort really could use more chairs. Since we were in the upgraded section we never had to worry about reserving a place as, during our stay, there was always room in the roped off area. And we never had to go down to reserve one of the eight beds - we were quite fortunate that anytime we wanted a bed one was available. The beach is small, yes, but the sand is beautiful and you can swim on either side of the boardwalk. The two pools are cold, so be prepared! We didn't swim as much as we usually would as a result, but they sure were refreshing! One thing I loved was that you could see the ocean from the pools - beautiful! The grounds were beautifully manicured and you could tell much attention was paid to keeping them this way. The staff were fantastic - you couldn't walk past a single person without them saying Hola with a big smile. We loved Alberto, a waiter we came across day after day who always greeted us warmly and remembered exactly what we liked. And the wonderful waitress from the privilege beach section - I only wish I could remember her name! - was wonderful. So sweet, always smiling and happy to help, and great for a quick Spanish lesson. Rooms were nicely done, recently upgraded. Shower space is delightfully big enough for two and the towels are nice and plush. Beds are a bit hard as people have mentioned but we slept like babies so we really can't complain. Great closets help you to unpack and store everything easily and we loved the various lighting options - I could read in bed while my husband slept. Mini bar fridge was always stocked with four different kinds of pop and bottled water and there was a coffee maker in the room too which was nice. It even offered a variety of plug shapes at different places in the room to allow for many international plugs to work just fine. One thing - this is not a party resort. It's small and intimate - max 700 guests I believe - and that was exactly what we were looking for. It allowed you to see your fellow guests repeatedly which meant we got to meet a whole bunch of fantastic people and really enjoy their company. If you want a nice, laid back holiday that still has great shows and a mini disco after, then this is the place for you. Traditionally by the end of a week long trip I'm ready to go home but this time - this time I could have stayed longer, that's for sure. I was very sad to go!

First the food, being a buffet as usual you're prepared for average food. However, the buffet was fantastic! A lot of variety and each dish had great flavor to it! Oh the pastries, my favorite! The Japanese a la carte was delicious! Ask for the chop chop table if you want to sit around the chef making the dishes. Thanks Cesar for getting us a table so quickly! The rooms are all decorated very modern and the huge glass showers are great! Just a couple of things to advise you of, the beds are quite firm, it took awhile to get used to. And the bathroom has a glass door that does not reach the ground or floor, separating the toilet and bedroom, privacy is minimal. The spa offered a nice package that included a facial, spa pedicure, and massage for only $180usd. The nice thing was that you could spread out your treatments throughout your entire stay. So one day you can have the facial then next day the massage and so on. I recommend Jorge if you choose a massage... He's got magic hands! And finally the staff. All the staff were great at doing their job, especially the entertainment staff. Thanks to Jes and Omar for making water aerobics fun... Especially the massages after! Susanna for playing cards on a rainy day... And let's not forget the dance lessons that had me feeling like a pro after.

Beautifully manicured grounds, the rooms are very nice. The hotel is not too big so it is not crowded. Before we went we looked at the reviews to get an idea of this resort. Take most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. This place is fabulous. The little glitches are nothing that any hotel would not have. And they were nothing that would deter from a great stay. If your only concern is a beach and nothing else, this is not the place for you. There is a cement wall at the water line 2/3 of the way in front of the resort and they have built up the sand level with the wall with a nice boardwalk. This makes for a nice level beach, but you don't have a big area to swim in front. Saying that my wife loves her beach and waves and we just went up the beach either way to swim. This did not deter her from having a great time. The food here is awesome. There is something for everyone. From the person who loves fast food to the health nut. They have a juice bar at the beach restaurant that makes fruit and vegetable smoothies. My wife eats healthy so she liked that. For someone to complain about the variety of food and the flavour, they must eat caviar for breakfast!! Drinks were very good. Don't see how anyone can say they were watered down. They had Captian Morgan and Whisky just like at home and they were generous with it. Bottom line, beautiful resort and you will not be disappointed. Thanks for a wonderful stay Maria.

When you get back you have the weekend to get settled back in. My wife & I traveled here with another couple. We all wanted a relaxing, no thinking vacation right on the beach. We wanted good food, good drinks and good service. We got all 3. I would be remiss if I do not mention the hard working, polite & fun people working here that made our stay pleasurable. We spent most of our time at the poolside bar with David & Edwin. These guys work hard and still smile and have fun. They put in long days. In the lobby bar was Iggy or as we called him, Dr. Nacho with the medicine. He was always in good spirits as well. The restaurants were managed well by Ulysses. Alberto and Kenny are an excellent waiters. Wonderful people, all of them. Here's the specifics. Food - There is 4 restaurants. We ate at all of them. None of us ever had Japanese so we tried it. Not for us. We heard lots of good things about it but it just isn't for us. It's probably the smallest restaurant. The other 3 restaurants were very good, especially the Italian restaurant, wow! That was quite a surprise. Top notch food & presentation. The only improvement they can do here is move the restaurant up to the main complex away from the beach area where there is a man made bern of sorts to protect the shore. For some reason it creates a foul smell and we would catch it ever so often. This resort is going to go adults only this spring and that building would be a perfect place to transform into a band / dance place. The breakfast buffet had a large variety eveyday and was excellent. The buffet that was open all day for munching also had a fair amount of variety and very good. Room Service - We called room service one night. We couldn't locate a menu in our room so we just asked what was available. The person didn't tell us much that was available so we just asked about certain things we were hungry for that we thought made sense that they would have, burger, fries, hot dog... Yes! we have those. It took 45 minutes but that was ok. It was good when it got there. Entertainment - I think they have shows every night but we only made it to 2 of them. Both of them were very good. Beach - Earlier reviews weren't high on the beach, but we found it very nice and worked well for us. They built a boardwalk on most of their beach. I suspect it's to protect their beach from storms. They had a small beach area next to that, that we went to everyday. Our routine was get up early, go claim our 4 chairs & go for a nice long walk on the beach. We'd come back, go for breakfast & head out to our palapa and chairs for the day. We'd read and relax. Around noonish it was cocktail time. We would continue relaxing, reading, drinking and people watching. We maight go for a nap or another walk & then grab an afternoon snack. Later we would shower up & go get supper & maybe a show. Do it all over again the next day. Rooms - We had a 2nd level room and our friends had a ground floor room in the next building over. We couldn't get in the same building but that was ok. We both had \"Ocean View\" rooms. Technically we could see the ocean but it's not what some people might think as \"ocean side\". But that was ok with us. The rooms are large enuf and very nice. We had a king bed. We've been to many different places in Mexico and know to expect the beds to be hard. Nice flat screen. Very small frig. They would stock it daily with only 2 beers until I found the guy stocking and asked him to put as many as he could in there each day & then he did 4. I had read in earlier info on the resort that they stocked a bottle of tequilla in the rooms but they must've changed that cuz that wasn't the case, but no biggy. Our door lock stopped working so we had to get maintenance down to replace it. They came pronto and repaired it. We got room service each day. They don't do the folded towel animals here but we didn't mind. They don't always replenish everything so we would ask for things if needed and they kindly obliged. Trip to PDC - One day we took a taxi rde into PDC & spent the day there. That was nice but it was good to return to the resort and relax again. Grounds - The whole resort is well maintained and beautiful. They are constantly work ing on it. We admired the grounds wherever we went. Pools - Unfortunately the weather was unseasonably cold, cloudy & breezy when we were there. The pool isn't heated. I got in it once just to say we got in it. I sat in one of the 4 built in lounge chairs with jets in them. They would be nice on a hot day. The pools were very clean. Massage - We originally wanted to get an hour massage but we found the price higher than back home so we passed. Bracelet - There were 3 different bracelets, white, green and a black/yellow. The black/yellow was the 'privaleged' level that allowed you access to queen size lounge beds with canopies and waitresses. I think it also got you right in to the restaurants with no waiting but not positive. We had green bracelets which I'm told is above white. I asked someone what the green got us over the white and they just said special treatment. We could never tell a difference from white ot green. The only restaurant issue was when we tried to go to the Japanese place, there was a line & I dunno if we could've got right in or not cuz we decided to go the next night instead. Drinks - I don't drink beer so I had many different types of drinks that were all very good, some better than others & some we made up. David & Edwin were pretty creative. That was fun. Beer at most all-inclusives is usually keg beer and in plastic glasses. My wife and other couple were ok with it but would prefer much colder beer in cans. No complaints tho.

I was traveling with a friend and on the whole the trip was well worth repeating. I would go again, and I would recommend the resort to guests that enjoy the day but are not looking for a lot of nite life or individual attention. Every place has its good points and its bad. Checking in was a disaster, but after that things were relatively smooth. Ended up with a very nice room/ bathroom - absolutely no complaints. Pool bar service was extremely slow........The hotel could really help themselves out, by having extra staff there. It seemed to be a main complaint by most of the guests we met. Comparing the service to other resorts, it did not as well. .It wasnt the fun spot that other resorts have....On the other hand, it was not noisy - just very relaxing...... The animation/show staff were wonderful. Their shows were the best I have seen when compared to other resorts. The dancers, the Hoops and the Silks ,,,,,,WOW,,,,beyond amazing. .....Total 10 there....The Mayan show - very powerful.. - another 10.. I missed Grease, but heard it was really good and really fun. The animation staff were a super big plus for the resort.......They work so hard and it shows. Day time, nite time, meal time - great involvement. Lots to do, lots to see, and lots of fun to participate in. The food - well it could be better.....There was adequent amounts, but nothing that you could say was delicious except for the breads and the chocolate. I would not recommend the resort for its food, but it was pretty typical of 3/12 to 4 star... You wont go hungry. The Italian was the best of the 3 al la carts...........the spinach soup was really nice and the chicken dish and the beef dish were really good. Have to admit though.....seeing racoons coming into the dining area.......was just a big big NO...Screening needs to be placed so the little critters stay away....Some people however thought it was really neat, and were taking lots of pictures....The Mexican restaurant has fabulous \"special Mexican coffee\". It is a show in itself to see if prepared and then it is a real treat. The grounds at the Ocean Maya are really beautiful. Everything is so perfectly manicured, so pretty, so relaxing. One of the prettiest resorts I have ever been in. It felt very tropical - more then a 10 plus rating there. The rooms are nice - recently undergone renovations, so they are bright and nice. I liked the smaller buildings way better then a large hotel type resort....It was always a beautiful walk to get back to you room no matter where you stayed. The pools are really big and really nice. - from the pools you see the beach - not something you get to see very often - really wonderful views.......not enough cots, but if you get there real early in the morning (before breakfast) you can put your towel on a cot to safe them. The beach area is really nice, beautiful white soft sand. You can walk for miles to the right......and to the left you can walk about 10 minutes to the lagoon areas for a nice swim.....nice to see.... The resort is about 20 minutes to Playa del Carmen....a 14 dollar taxi ride (US),,,You can ask at the front desk for a taxi to be called. Max 4 to a taxi. Go in the evening - its real pretty and lots of places to have a good meal. Very touristy......busy, but really interesting to walk around..... I dont know how long 5th Ave is, but it must be a few miles of shops. Again, back to the 9:30 nitely shows.....The only nite, we really didnt like was the so called romance nite.............old cheesy music, focasing in on couples..........not a lot of involvement by the guests. The staff worked really hard to make the evening enjoyable, but it just didnt cut the cake......... Too many slow songs and couple type music. One nite there was a really fun dance hour or two - much more fun and laughter, and I am sure that most guests would prefer that over the romance nite. Fun nites are what is remembered..... If you are looking for a clean, well kept pretty resort, with pools right on the beach, decent nite shows - this is the place to be.

First week was at Hacienda Tres Rios-very nice resort. Second week was at Ocean Maya. It is located about 5 miles north of Playa del Carmen. It is tiered resort-that is there seem to be several levels of services offered to guests depending on what you pay. We bought this on auction for $40 per night so we got the basics. We had friends who had booked in several days earlier who warned us not to accept the main building as the air conditioning does not work. Of course they tried to put us ther but my wife was quick to say no. We got a very nice king room-it had been refurbished and had all conveniences including flat screen tv. It had a garden view, but that was fine as this resort only has a handful of oceanfront units. Food was fine. Not what you would expect based on the fact resort calls itself 5 star, but I cannot say I had an unpleasant meal. There was no lobster or fine quisine one would expect for this rating. We were advised the resort was 100% full, but they did not have sufficient staff at times to handle. On one occasion there was only one bartender handling both the pool bar and swim up bar. As well as basic guests we did not get premium liquor and were not allowed to make reservations at the restaurants. I will say the Japanese restaurant was excellent-tepanyaki table was great fun and our chef was very entertaining. I would also say food portions were larger than most Mexican resorts we have stayed at and I felt guilty that we could never eat all that was provided. They did a great job getting people involved in activities and the evening entertainment was pretty good. One nice thing was the Mikes coffee shop which did premium coffees and sandwichs. Beach is not the best, as it got hammered by the last hurricane and never came back to what it once was. They had hobie cats, windsurfers and kayaks all free of charge. One complaint that I heard from a lot of people, was that there were not nearly enough lounge chairs. You had to get up and place a towel before 7am to reserve one. My wife and I are early risers so not a problem for us but we also sat in the chairs shortly afterwards. It was disappointing to see so many people reserve chairs and then go back to bed and not show up until noon. I suggested to several guest to go ahead take reserved chairs as I had been there several hours and never saw anyone in them. I recommended the resort restrict the reserving of chairs for an unreasonable length of time. Many other resorts forbid this-if you ain't sitting in it, it's fair game. Had ok time but with so many other resorts in the area, I would not hurry back to this one.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff and Great Location\u201d", "Author": "NYChristine1", "ReviewID": "UR94629857", "Content": "I wish my own staff was as high-performing and motivated as everyone we met at Ocean Maya...and great eye candy, too!

The hotel was not a disappointment in any regard. The gardens really are beautiful, well maintained....I enjoyed the lay out of the grounds, meandering pathways (never crowded) to the lobby and beach. The buffet offered so many different choices that I can't imagine anyone not finding something to suit their tastes.....you can choose the 'americanized' choices or feast on grilled fish (prawns/whitefish) steak to order. Good selection for fruits, vegetables, salad....cheeses, smoked salmon, proscuitto.....keep in mind, that there are those guests who only want to eat hamburgers and those that insist that their food be 'drizzled' artfully with exotic garnishes......you truly can have both. Reservations are not required for the 3 al a carte restaurants....you just need to plan on not being seated straight away at peak times. El Charro (beachfront) is open during the day for snacks and quick lunches....I would recommend the stroll up to the buffet for a more varied selection. Dolce Vita (Italian al a carte) is nice but don't go there hungry. El Charro is open evenings with a more traditional Mexican menu. Pay attention to the handout they give you when you check in.....it describes the evening dining options. Mexican night at the buffet (El Charro is not open)....Italian night at the buffet (Dolce Vita is not open)....same for Japanese. I love to swim and the ocean was lovely....the beach is small but you can walk for miles south and enjoy long stretches if you want. Evening strolls on the boardwalk and beach were absolutely gorgeous (full moon).....mostly deserted....Pools were clean and overlook the ocean, aquafit at noon is fun and lots of people join in. My ONLY complaint is that there is an early morning rush to 'reserve' beach loungers.....if you want a lounger, you must get down to the beach EARLY to mark your spot......Prime spots are GONE by 7am.....I am serious!! This is contrary to what I think guests should have to do.....the hotel simply needs to buy MORE beach chairs. Every guest should have the opportunity to relax comfortably. Our room was exactly as shown in the photos. Hot water at all times...attentive housekeeping (please show respect by leaving a gratuity) for the maid. In fact, the staff were all very deserving of a small token on a daily basis....yet, we seldom saw anyone tip the staff. We saw older couples, young families, gorgeous young men and women....a bit of variety. The entertainment staff was fun but if you like to party and have lots of nightlife, this might not be your first choice.

Breakfast eggs cold maybe luke warm, sausage cold - fresh pasteries & desserts - wow I didn't know there were 1000 ways to make jello. plus most of the cake type deserts tasted the same - which was bland. What I thought was flan, tasted like the everything else. Lunch / dinner not any better - we waited in line 1 1/2 hrs to get into the Japanese place - (5 of us total) they have 4 tables that hold 8 people for the \"cook show\" however only 1 table of 8 is allowed for the white wrist band persons, the time we were in the restaurant, I don't think all of the tables were filled up at any one time - just a shame to advertise something or wait for something only to be disapointed (again) Oh, and everything I tasted was cold, no kidding, and this was food we ordered off the 'menu' . Of course the weather didn't help lift our spirits as it was rainy, windy and chilly - better food and drinks probably would have eleivated some of the weather disappointment - but that didn't happen. I even brought booze from home and was going to the bar just for coke, and poured in my own --which I would have brought more of my own. There was an incedent one nite - (not going into details) and we asked for a different room - the following day (10 am) - so, @ 3 pm we got to move to the new room - and it was horrible, really - the musty smell was the worse, the patio had a little ant festival going on - so we couldn't keep the door open and air out the room, and to top it off one bed had wet linens through to the matteress under the 'top sheet'! how disturbing....... They had all day to find us a room - and this is what was given to us - we asked for housekeeping to come to the room, but after 1-2 hrs no one never came - so, we went to the lobby looking for someone in charge - so then again, later that evening - we were moved to a different room, and go figure - it was a room right up the stairs from where we had been to begin with -- omg -- hauling your luggage midway into a vacation - not enjoyable but to move from one villa to the next AND then back again! OMG. I do want to mention that they did 'comp' us each a 30 min. message, thanks to our tour guy who \"speaking in spanish to the supervisor on duty\" got us the massage, and it was nice (my 1st one ever),Though without him, a crappy bottle of champagne was suppose to aide in our grief, frustration, anxiety etc. I am only stating what we experienced -- and this is getting quite lenghty, but we were not the only ones who shared our experiences, as we got chummy with other vacationers who felt the same way about the food, bars and the resort grounds (which are beautiful) --The bars are understaffed - especially the pool bar - the 2 days it was nice enough to get into the pool there was 1 guy, yep 1 guy handling the pool bar part and the regular bar, plus making the drinks for the 2 waitresses they had getting drinks around the rest of the pool area and beach - yeap 1 guy - unbelievable (sp?) I can honestly say the only nite of 7 that i felt a little tipsy was our first nite - and the few beers we had on the bus before we were dropped off.. helped. we did like the Coffee Shop - that nite. On our last nite (Monday) I had 4, 'suprise me' drinks - told the bartender to make what ever he wanted these were in the blender, I can say they had fruity flavor, but no effect of alcohol - the drinks even started to separate before I could drink them that's pretty sad. I think this is my 1st vacation in over 10 years of travel to 3 different parts of Mexico, 2 different islands, and a cruise, that I never had a hangover at least one day -- rain or shine - I mean isn't that the reason you go all inclusive, eat drink be merry anytime you want? So, hope this is helpful to those who read reports - before they book their vacations. Be prepared for 2nd rate service if you're not wearing the black bands.

The biggest advantage that we could see from it was that we were able to book our a-la-cartes where I believe the white bands had to go on standby, and ended up with the 9pm dinner bookings. The room was nicely laid out, the fridge was filled daily with water, beer etc, and the one night we called for snacks to be brought to the room, they were very good, and included another good selection of drinks. The beds were a little on the hard side, and the A/C was a bit temperamental at first, until we figured out that it must have frozen up from continual use. We left it off for an hour, and it worked great for the rest of the week. One of the things I was most pleased about was that they did not charge for the safe lock. Seems like most hotels nickle and dime you for something like that. I went to the front lobby with cash on hand, and the fellow just gave me one. He didn't even ask for my room number. I am picky on food, and was very pleased with everything that was presented. I put on 5 pounds over the week. The Christmas dinner they put on was quite nice, and the night before they had local children in to sing carols and gave us champagne in the main lobby. The Japanese restaurant was the highlight of the dining there. I would not hesitate to pay for the same thing here. There were a family of racoons which would show up on the grounds each night. They were very entertaining and would eat out of your hand. My daughter went for a one hour spa treatment and loved it. She has had some of these back in Canada, and felt this was just about the best one she has had, and well worth the money. A few negatives that I can give, and I feel guilty for doing so because overall we loved the Ocean Maya: 1- Although the beach was great, once you went into the water, not so much. There were a lot of accumulations of debris and silt under the water. I guess we wandered into one of them and I got stung a couple of times on the legs by something. 2- The shuttle bus to town was kind of a token thing only. It was too hard to get onto, with only room for 10 couples a day. It would be a big improvement to have this running for most of the day, rather than just once. Otherwise, it would run you about $14 each way to go to town and back by taxi 3- The entertainment often consisted of Karaoke. Unfortunately, they only had the very large screen on the stage, and only one microphone. As a result, the person performing would have to turn their backs to the audience, and if there were more than one person trying to sing the song, you would only hear the one. A smaller screen set up between the person singing and the audience, along with multiple mikes, would go a long way to making this better. Half the fun of Karaoke is seeing the earnest faces on some of the lessor singers. I would not hesitate to go back to Ocean Maya, and would say that it was one of the best trips South that I have been on yet.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "Cherrypits", "ReviewID": "UR92569332", "Content": "We stayed at this resort Dec 17,10 to Dec 24,10. Overall I would say it was a great hotel for what we paid ...$890 pp. from Toronto. We knew booking this resort that the ocean area wasn't the best but we were pleasantly surprised when we found the lagoon (10 minute walk away) and the distant we could walk the beach going the other way. The food was fine...no sickness and we alway found something to eat that was enjoyable...my girls are pretty picky eaters. The japanese a la carte was our favorite...the appetizers were delicious and the deep fried ice cream was good...although the main dishes were made with tons of soya sauce..very salty, so next visit we all made sure to order plain rice with our meal. We never were able to get reservations even though we had black bracelets but never had a problem walking up and being seated within a few minutes. We had one of the best rooms on the resort...closest to the ocean and woke up every morning to a beautiful sunrise. Rooms were always clean and mini bar stocked. The pool was very cold and never went in it much until the end of the week. It is not heated so it never gets warm enough with the cool nights. Only went to one night of entertainment. It was Grease night. It was basically lound music with the entertainment group dancing and mouthing the words, although the girls in the group didn't know all the words in the songs so they were totally off.....All the employees were very friendly and could never walk by one wtihout a Hola... I would recommend this resort as long as you get it for a good price and aren't looking for a 5 star resort. Edventure tours: We booked this tour group before our trip. Had a great time.

There were a lot of people however the line moved quickly. We had payed for the Deluxe package and assumed that it included the Black Bracelets that allowed access to international alcohol, along with other special treatments. We were wrong. It was an additional 210 US per person in order to receive something we were told by the travel agency that we had paid for. We ended up having to pay for it and once it was all sorted out we had to wait another 2 hours for our room to be ready. Rooms: We have a family of 5 and we always take 2 rooms and so we were given the top and bottom floor of one of the Villas. We were located very far away from the lobby in Villa 35 but very close to the pool. We were lucky as there were no bad odours around the building as we heard some other people had many problems with their rooms smelling. The maids did an amazing job keeping the rooms spotless and we never had any issues with anything taken or \"misplaced\", the fridge was always kept in stock and we always had fresh towels. Pool and Beach: The beach was totally not what we expected, most of it is shielded off by a glass wall but a lot of seaweed in areas where you could go swimming due to the massive amounts of wind everyday. The sand however was incredible and were the two pools. Only problem was that beach chairs were hard to find both by the pools and on the beach if you came a little later, little later being 11:30. Another thing was the sports were not that organized as at many other resorts. My two older daughters and husband are sports fanatics and were disappointed when they almost had to organize water polo or volleyball. Except on one or two days when the staff really seemed to get into it. **** There is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL lagoon 10min walk on the beach to the left (if standing on the beach looking to the ocean) with blue-green, crystal clear warm water, one of our girls found it and I recommend walking to it! Food: The food was good for Mexico, we were there on New Years and there was lobster and a large assortment of Seafood that wasn't that bad, as for the other nights you had to arrive early the main buffet opens at 6:30 so 7:30 would already be pushing it as food got scarce. One of the days we had gone to town and arrived 30min before the snack bar was closing for lunch and at that time already there was nothing to eat. The Japanese Restaurant was good, and we did not have a chance to eat at the Italian, but the buffet always had something different which was good as I can't stand when the food is repetitive. Bar: The bar tenders were all very friendly, but it seemed like the hotel is short on them. The bar by the pool was always packed and generally one bartender had to manage. Without the black bracelets you can only be served National Alcohol and even with the black bracelets my husband was told on one of the nights that they had run out of gin and it was only around 11pm. I was however impressed with the fact that the bartenders did not treat my children different just because my 8 year old wouldn't tip. Wonderful service in regards to that. Overall Service: Every single person that worked at the hotel would say Hola whenever you passed and were very friendly but not creepy to the point where my oldest daughter didn't feel safe. The waiters seemed a little short staffed but always worked very hard. The front desk was also very helpful in regards to tennis and the pool tables. Evenings&Entertainment: The nightly shows weren't the greatest but they were entertaining. 3 of the nights they had dancers that weren't from the hotel come and preform and they were very good. One of the best parts of the evening would have to be the Sax player who plays in the lobby and does as incredible job. We stayed a week and it must have been 2 or 3 times that the hotel allowed very expensive vendors to set up, once was nice then the next time was pushing it a little. Overall we really enjoyed our stay mainly because of all the people that we met, it was a very calm and quiet resort and it never felt like there was a lot of people except when trying to find chairs but a fantastic stay even though we had some problems here and there!

We were never really given an explanation but were told we would be moved to Ocean Maya Royale with complimentary upgrades that included lots of bells and whistles. We did a little research and discovered that the Ocean Maya was clearly a downgrade from 4 star to 3 star and was a much smaller resort. At this point we had no choice but to go. The grounds of the property were beautiful. Very nicely landscaped and maintained, nice looking pool but that's about the end of the plusses. The beach is one tiny section, the rest of the \"beach\" is a boardwalk with a glass barrier. The beautiful pool was never used because they don't heat the pool or the hot tub. It was FREEZING! The food was terrible! I was sick for three days. The buffet was like a cafeteria. Trays of food set out that were barely warm. No attempt to display in an appetizing manner. By the end of the trip, the only thing I could eat was toast. The ala carte restaurants weren't much better. The Italian restaurant was gross. The mexican was disappointing. The Japanese steakhouse was the best of the bunch and was actually OK. I'm not a huge drinker, but I felt like there was absolutely no alcohol in the drinks and the all the brands were off brands. My upgrade was supposed to include upgraded alcohol, but that never happned. By the way, they also promised a lobster dinner as part of the upgrade that no one on the resort knew anything about and never happened. I never got a hot shower. We called every day to have it fixed and they came out and ran the hot water on the sink. That was the extent of the fixing. Let me repeat, for thousands of dollars I NEVER GOT A HOT SHOWER!!! When we were bumped from the original property, we were told we would be given vouchers for free nights on a future trip. We went to the front desk the first day we arrived to claim the vouchers and were given a runaround. We then visited every day for the rest of the trip and every time there was a story about why the vouchers weren't ready. \"It's Sunday\", \"it's a holiday\", \"the manager is not here\", \"the manager is at lunch\", \"your travel agent will give them to you\", \"the reservation desk is closed\", etc. etc. etc. The exchange ended five days later after pounding fists on the counter and saying I wouldn't leave until they gave me the vouchers.

We had a really great time. While there we had a few days when we needed a sweater on at night but overall the weather was great; especially when we checked back to see what it was like in Canada. So a few things to know and to watch for: - If you do not have travel arrangements from Cancun Airport get set up with Trafic Tours through the resort. Their cost is $18 per person return. It is about 45 to 50 minutes from the airport to the resort. - Although there are four restaurants they are not open all of the time. Know when they are open and make reservations for the a la carte. You don\u2019t have to but it does save a wait. - If you want to go to Playa Del Carmen by the free shuttle then book your spot early. To do this, get to the lobby around 7:00 am and wait at the Trafic Tours table. If you want to go by taxi then it will cost you $14. - Know the extras that are at the resort. There are non-motorized and motorized water sports. Not all resorts have access to these. - We only had only had one day to take my daughter and grand-daughter on an outing so tried to do the \u201cSwim With the Dolphins\u201d and Xcaret. A big mistake on our part. Do \u201cSwim With the Dolphins\u201d one day and Xcaret another. If you have one day then be prepared not to be able to do everything at Xcaret. - Tennis. There is no place to sign up. If you are a fair player or just want to hit a ball around then take a racquet to breakfast. People will soon ask you if you want to play. If you know how to hit a ball well but have no one to play with then ask for Miguel at the sports desk at the pool. He used to play college tennis. He is in management but seems to find the time to still hit a ball around. - Beach \u2013 There are a couple of small beaches at each end of the property. These are separated by a built up boardwalk that has a glass partition on the ocean side. The whole area behind the beaches and boardwalk is made up of chaise lounges and thatched roof cabanas. Great for tanning or getting the fresh air in the shade. - Entertainment \u2013 During the day, there is always something happening around the pool area. In the evening there are shows. These are really well done considering the size of the resort. If you are looking at something along a Vegas/Broadway type show then you are at the wrong place. Karaoke is the usual hit and miss\u2026some people are great while others could have helped everyone by staying at the bar. - The saxophonist plays at breakfast and other meals plus in the lobby during the evening. A really nice touch. - The grounds are mature and well kept. Not being used to the tropics, we all were really taken with variety of plants and loved the palms. - Wild life \u2026.. sort of. At night you could see some raccoons and peccaries wandering around. On the path that runs along the south of the property there is a relative large population of coati. They seem to like fruit and are relatively tame. I wouldn\u2019t trust them though to eat out of your hand. - We liked the idea of the small buildings amongst the gardens. Each had 4 suites up and 4 down. This is opposed to some resorts that have 5 story buildings with who knows how many suites. Each to his own. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed out stay and would certainly go back. We tipped but at the end of our stay but found the staff very helpful and certainly would go out of their way to assist.

I swear they must have cleaned the bathrooms by the pool every hour! We always had plenty of towels in our room, and the cleaning staff would always leave a towel animal on the bed- a big hit!

We arrived around 1 pm and check in was fast and easy. Our room wasn\u2019t ready but they gave us our bands and off to lunch we went. After lunch we walked around the property a bit then went back to the front desk and got our room. They put us \u00bd way back in the complex and claimed it was an ocean view room. The only view we had was that of a palm tree. No worries as we don\u2019t spend that much time in our room anyway. After a couple hours and a little further thought we decided to go down and ask for an upgrade as I don\u2019t work all year to look at a palm tree. Be careful as they tried to upgrade us to the black band at $25 a night per person and leave us in the same room. But for $30 a night per person we got a beautiful ocean front room and it was worth it for me as I like getting up early for the pre sunrise and sunrise show. The black band thing isn\u2019t really all that. They say premium booze but all you really have to do is ask. It gives you beds on the beach but we never used them and they say no reservations needed at the restaurants which was nice. We just got the upgrade for the ocean front thing as we like listening to the ocean in the morning and evening. From the time we arrived till the time we left we felt like family. Always a hello and how are you from all the staff including the pool guys and gardeners. That\u2019s why I like a smaller hotel they always know you by name. Food was pretty darn good at the restaurants. The Oriental was the best then Mexican then Italian. I didn\u2019t care much for the Italian but my girlfriend liked it. To each his own. The breakfast buffet was very good as with all the AI\u2019s I have stayed at with plenty to choose from. My only complaint was the afternoon lunch buffet. It got a little old after a few days as they served up the same thing every day but still plenty to choose from. We had a great time with the entertainment staff. Always something going on if you wanted to get involved. If not they would leave you alone and not be pushy about it. Drinks are flowing freely around the pool and on the beach with Edgar always there to serve you. As others have said this is not a real party Hotel but still lots of fun and a great place to relax and unwind. One of my favorite things to do was sit in the social area by the lobby at night with the warm breeze blowing, having a few drinks and listening to the sax player. He was good very good and so relaxing. OK I\u2019m rambling on. Would I go back? Would I send a friend? Yes and yes! If the price was right. We got one heck of a deal and I really wouldn\u2019t pay more than I did for the place and only if I was guaranteed the room I had or the one next door. The only deal breaker would be as others have said is the ocean. It\u2019s not that crystal clear blue water you would expect in Cancun or the Playa area. Any questions feel free to shoot me an email at r976tuna@aol.com and I will be happy to answer. Hint \u2013 If you are going to do a day trip try to line it up on the days the dinner buffet is open. Get a schedule when you check in. We made the mistake of doing our day trip when only the restaurants were open and by the time we got back they were ready to close. It would have been nice to hop in the buffet and grab something after a long day.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat smaller resort makes ya feel right at Home.\u201d", "Author": "BigDivet", "ReviewID": "UR89089693", "Content": ": ) Just got back from a wonderful trip to Ocean Maya Dec./2010 From reception to checkout the service was top self.

The Beach was very nice! Yes there is a long board walk with a glass wall protecting you from the waves and reducing beach eroision but the whole time i was there we saw workers working hard removing rubble twigs ect to provide a nice clean beach area that i found no better are worse for as far as the my eye could see, And we hade the only pier dock to walkout on the ocean in the area.

We were pleasantly surprised of the excellent food quality, the nice personal and the lovely spaces and modern rooms. The garden between the houses is beautiful and full of iguanas and exotic plants. We especially like the Italian food restaurant at the beach which is almost empty for lunch and crowded for dinner. It was a bit of a pain to get a place at the \"Tepanyaki\" in the Japanese restaurant, but if you get there at 6:30pm they write you on a list and you will get a table at 8:00pm. The pools were nice and clean, the cocktails all included. Corona beer ok, mexican wine drinkable but not especially good, excellent italian coffee in the afternoon at the coffee house. The \"a la carte\" speciality restaurants (mexican, italian, japanese) are only open for dinner 4 times per week, the other days dinner is served as buffet in the main Hacienda restaurant (still delicious and big choice). The ground of the ressort is huge and you have to walk a bit to get from one end to the other. If it rains you are more likely to get wet during your walks to the main building (although they provide free umbrellas). The shuttle to Playa de Carmen is a fraud: Only 10 seats per day and you need to be at the desk at 8am to book for the next day at noon. Still it is highly recommended to go to Playa de Carmen as the beach there is much nicer (clean, emerald water, no stones) than the hotel beach. Still the hotel beach is nice and ok, rather walk to the right side and go into the water at the neighbouring \"Secrets Capri Suites\". The sand is white and fine, just the water is not as esmerald as in Cancun or Playa de Carmen. Still the waves are not too high (not as in Cancun) so you can have a relaxed swim. Tipp: If you are in Playa de Carmen book your tour to Chichen Itza there - you pay only 45$ (if you negotiate a little) per person and not for 99$ in the hotel. Also car rental at the hotel is much more expensive than elsewhere. Tipp: A trip with the \"Colectivo\" taxis to Cancun City (not really worth it) costs 30 mexican pesos, a ride to Playa de Carmen 15 pesos. Be prepared that you have to walk 15min from the hotel to the main street to catch a taxi. - Wi-Fi is only in the lobby, no signal in the rooms. - Printing out (tickets) costs $2 per page. - Dinner only until 22pm - Only 1 sort of beer We can only recommend this ressort because of it's high standard, nice amenities, great food, friendly people. If you want to have nightlife, better go to Cancun or Playa de Carmen, there is nice evening entertainment and dancing in the hotel. The beach to the right of the hotel (just a few meters of walk) is ok, but the reviews are true that say that the hotel itself doesn't have a nice beach.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot for Couples, great for family\u201d", "Author": "Bubblescope", "ReviewID": "UR87823351", "Content": "The fact that we were picked up from the airport was great.

There is lots of great evening entertainment but I think I would have liked to be closer to the town. Also if you go into the town there are cheaper deals in terms of tour operators who also come to pick you up from your hotel. We found our tour that we booked through the tour operator to be at least $50 cheaper in town. Also i would rent a car in town too. The tour operator said the roads are dangerous but it was totally easy we drove to Coba ourselves and to Tulum. 2 days before we were about to leave we got an upgrade to a great hotel called Grand Maya which actually made our trip.

We had a wonderful stay. We arrived in the late afternoon and were welcomed by very friendly staff. We were brought glasses of punch to enjoy while we waited to be checked in. The lobby was so beautiful and clean. It opened onto a patio with a lovely pond and fountains. We were escorted to our room, and the person who helped us with our bags took us through and showed us where everything was, and how it worked. We tried to learn a few words and phrases to help us communicate with all the employees,and they all took the time to help explain what we wanted to say in Mexican. I don't know if my husband frustrated them, but you would never have known. They would smile, laugh and then tell him how to say what ever it was he was wanting to learn. Where ever you went at the resort, you were always greeted with a smile and a Hola, You were never walked passed with out being acknowledged. Quite a nice change from everyday life. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, and so clean. There was a fridge stocked with water, sodas and local beer. The whole resort was clean. You always saw someone cleaning something throughout the day. The food was amazing. You had a buffet every morning for breakfast. There were so many choices, there was no way you could get bored with the food. They would fry you eggs any way you wanted, or choose you toppings, and they'll make you an omelet. Almost anything you could want was available. Lunch was either a la carte, or a buffet to choose from. They would even do cheese burgers and hotdogs for you at the buffet. Dinner alternated between a la carte one night and then a buffet the next. There were 3 restaurants to choose from. There was Italian, Mexican and Japanese. You can make reservation ahead of time if there is a certain time you wanted to eat, or they would fit you in when they could if you showed up that day. We were able to book a seat in the Japanese restaurant around the grill, where they cook your meal in front of you. This was a great show, and delicious food. You needed the reservations for this meal, but not just to eat in the Japanese restaurant. The entertainment staff always had something to keep you busy. They organized pool volleyball and beach volleyball, water polo, poker at the pool deck, kids programs and so many other things during the day. Every evening they had a different event. They even did a version of Grease. It was great. They came around throughout the day and let you know what was planned for each evening. Plenty of lounge chairs on the beach and around the pool. Hammocks and beds on the beach were also available. You could even pay and have a massage on the beach through the spa. The beach was nice, but not spectacular. The hurricanes have washed away a lot of the sand, but the pool was right next to the beach, so you could swim in the pool, and look at the ocean at the same time. We did swim it the ocean, and it was nice, but it is just a 200 peso taxi ride to Playa del Carmen, where the beach is really clear. We could not find anything worth complaining about, and will definitely be returning to this resort on our next trip.

The other behind the scenes staff are also very attentive and always had a \"hola\" when they see you. Edgar on the beach was the best- keeping all the drinks straight and often. I would suggest VIP for the use of the cabanas and premium drinks. Coffee bar had amazing lattes and cappacinos. Japanese restaurant was great both in seating area and cooking in front of you area. The chefs were funny - it was a show. It was slow season so the buffet was every second night and a la carte every other. That was ok with us. They are renovating but we didn't hear a thing.

We traveled with myself, husband, 1 year old and nanny in one room. When arriving our rooms were not ready but they locked up our luggage and we ate, explored and swam. When our rooms were ready we were pleasantly surprised. We requested first floor and next to our friends who were with us. We had building 9 right on the beach facing the ocean. We also had adjoining rooms with the other couple which worked out great because we were sharing a nanny. The room was completely renovated to a modern flair. It was small but a ton of storage. We had 3 adults and a 1 year old in it and had plenty of room. We had 1 king size bed, 1 couch, 1 chair a desk, table, 2 night stands, a fantastic closet. We had inside a full size jogging stroller and a pack and play. We requested a crib and all they have is pack and plays but who cares I did not have to haul it. It was clean and safe. The only thing that was difficult was the marble tiled showers with a 1 year old. Bring either a blow up tub or a non slip mat. The beds are hard but we did not go on vacation to sleep all day. The room was clean and we had really no issues. The first 12 hours we were there the manager called to see if we needed anything. If we did we just called and we got it. The safe is fine it has a key lock and we had no issues. In fact the only thing we had in it was money and our passports. My credit cards were out in the room all week in my purse and no one bothered them. I felt very safe. The staff is amazing and friendly. The food was great. A good selection. If you could not find something you liked I'm not sure you would like anything anywhere. I had no problem feeding our 1 year old daughter. We went to all the specialty restaurants and they were good. If you did not like it order something else. The drink staff was always great. No problems ever waiting. Shaday up front in the lobby was always on top of it. The resort was really empty. We barely ever saw a hundred people. It was quiet and peaceful. The pools and ground were very clean and beautiful. Mosquitoes are in an abundance so bring bug spray. It is Mexico. I though the nightly entertainment was not as great as other resorts but it was still good. Maybe will be better as they get busier. The resort was great for a 1 year old. Plenty of space for her to run around. The staff loved interacting with her. The beach does have a glass wall but you can walk to the other sides of it if you do not want an obstructed view. It was a bonus for us because it kept our daughter away from the water. We swam in the ocean it was warm and clean. My only complaint was our Apple Vacations rep sucked. He was only on the resort for 5 minutes of our 5 day stay. This resort was completely renovated and they are still working on some of it. For the value you could not ask for anything more. We payed about $700pp including airfare from Chicago. I would definitely recommend this place for the value and an enjoyable time. It is only a 20 minute cab ride to downtown Playa Del Carmen.

We stayed at Ocean Maya from July 31 through August 10. The grounds of Ocean Maya are very nice. However, the rooms need serious updating and cleaning. We were initially housed in the \"B\" building. This area is horrible. It's basically a hotel and is FAR away from the pool and \"beach\". After we complained that our AC wasn't working and the room smelled of sewage, we were moved to Building 19. The room was the same and was a little closer. The room we were in was small and was a surprise to us, as it was different than what was advertised when we booked the vacation. The showers are very slippery and the toilets were constantly overflowing. When we complained of this they informed us that they were having problems with plumbing. The pool area is nice, but the pool side bar was NEVER open and we were told it was because of no available staffing. The beach area of this resport is non-existent as it has been replaced with a deck and seating. You actually have to walk a bit to get to a stretch of beach. When you get there you will find that the stretch of beach is not what the Riviera Maya is known for. The food is ok. Selection is not to great and the family and I were sick most of the time we were there. Also, the times the restaurants are open is very restrictive. There are several hours where this is no food available. They will direct you to the coffee shop where you can get sweet bread or small sandwiches. It may be that we were used to having food available 24/7...but this place really restricts you. The drinks were ok as well.

Very powerful air conditioning, very clean place, comfortable king bed. We didn\u2019t upgraded the room for 30US$/day/person. Our room was really fine. The negative points for the room are that the TV didn\u2019t work for the whole trip and there is no iron and iron table for your clothes. We ate at the Italian Restaurant 3 times for diner and that was the best restaurant. The Japanese Restaurant with the \u2018\u2019Cooking show\u2019\u2019 was fine. The Mexican was ok but really hot inside. In general, the buffet was good: not a lot of choice but everything taste good. So they invest more in quality than in quantity. In the morning you can do your own Mimosa (orange juice with champagne) at the buffet. Don\u2019t forget to try the Caf\u00e9 bar in the lobby where you can drink any kind of real good espresso coffee. The service at this hotel was really good, particularly in the \u00e0 la carte restaurants. I was really surprised that the service was as good in the buffet as in the \u00e0 la carte restaurant. At no time we complained for the service. At the bar, the best service is at the lobby. They know how to make real good drinks. You can drink glass of champagne as you wish! Bar at the pool was \u2018\u2019ok\u2019\u2019 because the drinks were so so with almost no alcohol. The beach is probably the worst negative point for this hotel. I kept my sandals to go in the sea because you walk on rocks and algae underwater. The water is always full of sand in suspension so you can\u2019t go in the front of the hotel for scuba. There is nothing to see underwater. Activities/shows at night are more for children than for adults. Only on Wednesday there was a small party at the swimming pool with a music band, but that\u2019s it. If you want to do the fiesta every night, I don\u2019t recommend this hotel. I recommend trying some outdoor activities. We did the Coba temple visit and the visit of a real Maya family (in there house) (110US$/person). We went at the X-Caret zoo/park for 130US$/person (there is a show at 8pm in the park and it was amazing). Before entering the park, be cautious: they try to take your Sun-cream because they say there are poisonous substances for the environment in it and then they try to sell you their own \u2018\u2019organic cream\u2019\u2019. I brought 2 cream packs and gave only one at the entry and kept the other one in my bag. They give it back to you when you exit the park. Finally, we swam with the whale-sharks (fish are 8 to 15 meters long!) in the ocean for 200US$/person. These fish are so big! And there are in this region only for 1 month before they continue there way so we decided to go even if it is expensive. This hotel is more for family and couples.

First off, the group I traveled with (my boyfriend and some friends) were expecting very little from this place. Between the (mostly) harsh reviews and the very low rate we got we were practically expecting holes in the walls. I am happy to report we were very pleasantly surprised! From the moment we walked into the hotel we were greeted with drinks and welcomed. The only problem was that our room was not yet ready and we were forced to walk around and wait for it to be ready. We had to put our luggage in a storage closet and we wanted to change out of our flight clothes, but it seemed like more trouble than it was worth to dig out shorts/a swimsuit to change in the public lobby bathroom. Things may have started poorly, but after an hour or so our rooms were ready and we entered our rooms. The villas were very cute and gave the hotel a home-y feel. Our room had just one king size bed, and though the mattress was very hard, like some reviews say, it did not bother us in the slightest. After all, we weren't there to sleep! Granted, we are young and without any back problems, but that was our take on the mattress situation. The room was immaculate aside from a few ants right near the window but it was not close to the bed at all so this was not too bothersome. It should be known that I can be quite picky about cleanliness, and this room lived entirely up to my standards. The beach and pool area were great. We had black VIP bracelets so we were allowed in the nice roped-off section, which I must say was incredible. It did seem like there were pool games with a microphone going on all day which was a little annoying when walking by that area, but nothing not tolerable and I am sure fun for those participating. Food was overall very good. Fresh fruit, omelettes every morning...overall good variety. Fresh mojitos just waiting out one night! We tried all of the restaurants. Japanese and Italian were great, Mexican was not so great. Sometimes we were stuck with a late reservation but we had a party of 10 so that is to be expected. There was a great open air restaurant by the pool/beach, great for grabbing lunch without having to walk far. As far as drinks go, they were made fairly weak but if you slipped the bartender a dollar or two they seemed to throw a little extra alcohol in. On that note, don't bother converting money. US dollars were perfectly acceptable and even encouraged. It sometimes seemed like you were being hounded for tips, but these people are just trying to make a living and it did not take away from the quality of my vacation at all. One thing I had a problem with though was that I developed an ear infection about 4 days into the vacation and the doctor only came by on certain days. I needed some antibiotics, which I did not realize were over the counter in Mexico. But I made an appointment and when I arrived was told it would cost $150. This seemed ridiculous and I stuck it out until I got home. Despite a few small problems there was nothing I could think to change about the Ocean Maya. I was very impressed with the rooms, the beach, the food, the drinks, the grounds (people constantly landscaping). I would tell anyone to give this place a shot.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot all true!\u201d", "Author": "eastwood50", "ReviewID": "UR73517542", "Content": "My family and extended family arrived on Saturday,07/24 for a seven night stay.

The beds only have sheets and no blankets which once requested from the front desk took 15 hours to deliver. The shower leaks onto the floor which will take about three towels a day to clean up with a family of four.

If you want decent bar service use the bar at the front near reception. The bar next to the pool takes way too long and if you are not Spanish the wait is longer. You may want to know that this resort allows locals to utilize the resort which includes the bars, buffets and pools on all seven days of the week from 09:00 to 18:00 for a price of $42.00 a day. The majority of the people there during the day is local folk which is not a big deal but they do receive better service being locals and you will be looked over unless you stand your ground.

The room was very modern and spacious, the AC was very nice and cold, and the bathroom was pleasant. The beds, however, were very uncomfortable, but due to the high level of activity during the day and free booze, that issue worked itself out. The restaurants had great service but food quality was below average-slightly above average, definitely not excellent at all. The best we had was the Japanese grill portion of the Oriental restaurant (so named). It was plentiful and delicious, but took some time. Second-best was the Italian restaurant, Dolce Vita, but mainly for service and atmosphere (beachside with cool wind blowing at night). The food quality was average. The buffet had a wide array of choices but all the food was below average-average at best. The bars/cafes were great for service and beverages, but you'll be disappointed if you're a beer drinker like I am because all they have is Corona. I eventually switched to rum and cokes. The poolside bar is convenient but can get dirty, particularly the swim-up part. The coffeehouse was very nice and clean, with free baked goods. The front lobby had many sitting areas and was quite breathtaking aesthetically. The beach was nice to look at, and they had some sitting areas which were awesome. It was very nice at sunset. Also the iguanas were charming throughout the property. OK, for the negative parts - the most negative issues we had was dealing with management. We requested a king bed because it was our first wedding anniversary, but we received two narrow doubles. I went back to the front desk and even tipped the attendant a $20, which she took, but all she offered was to move the doubles together, which never happened. I never pressed the issue and we just took it as a loss, mainly because the AC worked so well. The first night, all the lights in our room went out about 7:00 pm. I suspected it was a blown fuse so I alerted the front desk people face to face about it at that time. They said they'd take care of it, but we returned at 10:30 pm and it still hadn't been corrected. I reminded them gain and they said they'd already fixed it. I told them to come back. I went back to the room on their direction to meet the worker and he never showed up, so I called and they didn't seem to have a clue what I was talking about. Annoyed, I told them we'd need another room if they weren't going to fix the problem. Well, the guy finally showed up and the problem was indeed A BLOWN FUSE! Which was fixed in 5 mins. The other negative is the amount of guests that smoked. I'd say at least 75% of the adults were smokers. To deal with this I think the management needs to sector off some designated smoking areas. Smoke too often wafted about the poolside and lobby. Some people even were smoking in the pool! I jested that they would probably even smoke underwater if they could. If you're a nonsmoker you may find this place a bit acrid at time.

We ended up getting a room in the older \"hotel style\" part of the resort, it was on the ground floor right on the corner, facing the rear of the building that the buffet is in. It was a very loud busy area, and the sewage smell that alot of people are talking about on here was very strong near and inside our room. Needless to say I went to the front desk and requested to move rooms, I was told that the hotel was full for the weekend, but I could move sunday afternoon. So my advice is to request a villa during the check in process, they are much nicer, cleaner, and quieter. We ended up moving Sunday afternoon and the last 5 nights of our stay was really good. Our maid left a swan made of towels on our bed which I thought was a nice touch. Drinks were good, I would agree that the bars were understaffed, but when we made a trip to the bar we usually loaded up with 2 drinks each,so no real problem there. There was a waitress on the beach who would bring us a drink everytime she made her rounds which was great. The Italian, and Japaneese restaurants were very good, the service at both was great! The mexican restaurant was okay, the food was better than the service. Buffet was also okay, nothing special, but we always found something to eat. The snackbar by the pool didnt really have very much selection, but again we didnt really have a problem. The cheese burgers and fries were good, chips and salsa, and cheesey nachos were readily available to snack on while drinking on the beach. The beach was pretty good, the water was pretty cloudy for the first few days, but cleared out after a thunderstorm, and was beautiful and blue for the end of our trip. Some seaweed did wash up on the beach but they did a pretty good job cleaning it up. My ratings above would have been higher, if we didnt have to spend the first couple nights in our original room.

We were warned about on-going construction and really....there were the quietest workmen I've ever come across in my life (no music or yelling or power tools). I'm not sure about this upgrade for better drinks, I didn't ask about it.

Note: They don't give you the return ticket at the airport so you have to wait around in the lobby the following day at 3pm for the Best Day rep. However we found out the Best Day rep is in the lobby every day from 2pm-5pm so you can work this around your sightseeing schedule. The front desk will not hold the packet for you. Room: We didn't upgrade rooms(black wrist bands?) so the one we got was a normal queen size bed. The bed was a little uncomfortable but that's the only complaint I had. We got a room right by the beach so it was an easy walk whenever we wanted to go lay out. Bathrooms were nice. Drinks: I read through other reviews before we started our trip and agree with everyone else that the drinks are weak. However, we soon discovered that Corona and wine are on tap so we just had that the whole trip. Food: There are 3 restaurants and a Buffet. There is a schedule that you get when you check in on which 3 are open for dinner. All were great but it was strange to be eating Italian and Japanese when you're in Mexico. We preferred the Mexican restaurant and went twice cause it was so good! The staff is also extremely friendly! Activities: I recommend talking to Angel at the activity desk! My sister and I wanted to go snorkeling with sea turtles and he set us up on the BEST adventure for around $80 a person. We booked with Your Underwater World and were picked up by our guide Vincenzo.

The VIP beach area with the Bali Beds was very nice, however we were only able to utilize them early in the morning- the glass partitions they have instead of railings block the breeze coming off the ocean, and by 10 or 11 it was simply too hot to stay there. They also advertised \"beach service\" for the VIP area, which was untrue;yet the other beach area where anybody can go sometimes had a waitress or bartender come by and bring you a drink. Odd, but hey, whatever. Oceanview was nice, we stayed in #1206 which was perfect-close to pool bar and steps from the ocean.

We absolutely LOVED the Italian restaurant, both the food and the ambiance was out this world the 2 nights we ate there. The Japanese was above average also. Didn't try the Mexican, and honestly, if we could have we would have eaten @ the Italian restaurant every night! Only having lunch available at one place got real old, real fast- so basically we would try to wait as late in the afternoon as possible to eat, so we would be tipsy enough not to care. The service @ the pool bar was wonderful!!! We would tip $5 in the morning, and then another buck or 2 every few hours, and were treated like old friends.

The shuttle bus sucks. We consulted the front desk about the shuttle bus and they told us to ask a big guy dealing with trip packages. He told us to book one day in advance. We asked if we could take the bus from Carmen without taking it from the hotel. He told us it was impossible because the bus was always full. We booked one day in advance and the big guy told us it was already full but we might come at noon to see if there were seats available. We came half a hour before noon and found there were epmty seats on the shuttle bus. Security told us someone already booked the bus for going back! We said one way no problem. But they said our name were not on the list so even one way was impossible. They said it was their policy and the bus drove away with at least two empty seats! We asked explanation from the hotel. The front desk assitant asked her supervisor and told us they could do nothing. We requested to see the general manager they said impossible and brought us a complaint form. If we wanted to complain the shuttle bus we need to fill the form in front of them and hand the form over immediately. It was really ridculous! For the shuttle bus we knew there was something wrong with the big guy dealing with packages. That guy really sucks! liar, and really not a good person. It seemed the bed bug following us back home. We use lots of medcine, disinfectant detergent to cure.

The beach does leave something to be desired (we're from Nova Scotia and have beautiful beaches here so we weren't disappointed but some may be as they beach wasn't as nice as we'd hoped).

I wasn't nervous because I knew we would have fun no matter where we were going, plus we couldn't beat the price; the all-inclusive per person price was cheaper than a direct flight from O'Hare to Vegas during that same time period, so it was a no brainer. We all upgraded to the deluxe room (black wristband) directly with the travel agent ($15 per person, per day--cheaper than the other reviews that indicated it was $25-$30 additional when they upgraded at the hotel). In my opinion, the extra money was definitely worth it. Our room was recently renovated and we had an ocean view, mini-fridge was stocked with bottled water, beer and assorted sodas, room safe was free of charge; the liquor selection was much better (Grey Goose, Don Julio, Gran Marnier, Crown Royal, Baileys, etc.), otherwise it was the \"house\" alcohol. Hard to tell if we got preferred treatment or not.....however, the night we ate at the Japanese restaurant there were (3) full tables and only (1) chef; our table was first. Not sure if it was wristband related or not. Food was average; we ate at the Italian \"restaurant\" and the service was slow. Obviously we are on vacation and not in a rush, so it wasn't a huge problem. Be sure to order a number of appetizers/salads, even entrees--portions are on the smaller side. The breakfast buffet and lunch buffet by the pool was average also; appealed to the masses. Some tasty options, some not so tasty and bland. The coffee shop in the lobby was a nice treat; espresso and cappucinos were delicious. Staff was friendly and hardworking. We did not attend any of the shows although the staff approached us frequently to remind us. There were vendors set up in the courtyard nightly; not pushy at all. Last year we vacationed at the Dreams Resort, Punta Cana and the vendors were out of control pushy; we wanted to order room service just to avoid walking thru the courtyard. Pools were nice and refreshing; swim up bar could use some touching up, but the bartenders were accommodating. The free WiFi in the hotel lobby was very nice; the fitness center is small, but nice. The only excursion we took was a cab into the downtown area (5th Ave), Playa del Carmen. Very nice, but very commercialized. The street is blocked off and there are stores on both sides--Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's, etc. My family and I had a wonderful time and that's all that matters.

As we arrived and began the drive down the long drive I just knew this place was going to be a pleasant surprise. The grounds next to the drive were immaculate and very lush! As we pulled up we were greeted by the bellhop who took care of the bags and were given a strawberry daiquiri as we stepped out of our transfer (we did the private transfer with USA transfers, definitely recommend them!) We arrived at around 2:00 pm and had no trouble with check in ...very fast! We decided to do the VIP upgrade and it was well worth it. They upgrade your room and you have access to the VIP beach area that is roped off and also had beds. Vip also gets you premium alcohol versus bar rail and first choice on restaurant reservations. We never had trouble getting into the restaurant of our choice. The bellhop brought our bags to our room and with the VIP we were upgraded to a 2nd floor ocean front room. The view was AMAZING and that to us made the upgrade worth every penny. Nothing like sitting on your balcony and watching the sunrise with a cup of coffee! The maid service was also very good...we recieved a towel art most of the days we were there. I know others have said they do not do this here but maybe it is only the VIP rooms that they do this for. The restaurants were very good. Our first night we decided to try the Japenese and we did the teppanyaki show. This was very entertaining and the food was delicious! They do this fire show and at the end they let me up to the grill to try the flipping and fire for myself. We met another fabulous couple from Maine that we ended up spending time with throughout our stay. Watch out for the saki it is potent but the saki bombs are alot of fun! Our next night we tried the Italian, the atmosphere is beautiful. It is set right on the beach and the breeze from the ocean billows through and they have long white curtians that blow around. It is a very romantic enviroment, you feel like you should have a large bill when you leave. We never did get around to the Mexican restaurant but did do both the Italian and the Japanese again during our stay. The snack shop by the pool had great snack food and they are open until 4am! We would do this during the day while down at the pool. They also have a beer and wine bar here so if the swimup is packed this one is hidden away and never busy. The pools are very nice and clean. The swimup bar is a blast and the bartenders were alot of fun! We never had any trouble getting a chair unless you want one of the beds in the VIP area, then you need to get up before 5am to get one!

Check-in was a breeze. No \"special offer\" deals, no \"presentation\" tomorrow at 8:00am, no \"tour packages\". What a relief from past check-in experiences. However, we were directed to a seating area for the \"supervisor\" to \"tell us about the hotel\". Oh boy, here we go again. But after a ten-minute wait my wife simply went to the desk and asked for the room key. Pleasantly, the desk clerk politely gave us the key with directions on how to get to the room. The very best buildings at Ocean Maya are numbers 9, 12, and 36. These all have first class views of the ocean and the property, with #12 being best of the best. Numbers 10 and 33 are also very good. There are many others around those numbers that are also good, but get a second level for those so you can look over the pool or other structures to view the ocean. We were lucky this time and got room 902 which faces the ocean on the ground floor. At the time of our visit, several \"Internal\" buildings (say those numbered in the 20's) were undergoing renovation, but we hardly ever heard construction noise. I suppose those immediately adjacent to construction could have had some noise, but the crews were very considerate of start-stop times. There was no internet connection in the rooms but free Wi-Fi was available in the lobby. Lots of places to plug in for power and lots of places to sit with your laptop. There were also two hotel computers you could use for a very pricey $10/30 minutes, so obviously your laptop/free Wi-Fi is the way to go. As others have mentioned, the grounds are very nicely maintained, so if you don't have a beach front building, at least you will likely have a nice garden view, not overwhelming, just right. Many flowers, beautiful shrubs, cleanly kept. There are small stands of \"jungle areas\" interspersed on the property. A nice resort, not glitzy, but a solid 4-star. Our room was very nicely appointed, clean, well-maintained, and pleasant. Lucia, the designated housekeeper, came in every day and staightened up the room, swept the floors, cleaned the bathrooms and showers, organized, etc. A full routine every day, no extra charge. As mentioned above, the room is right on the beach, ground level, a 50-foot walk to the beach chaises and palapas. It had a king bed with a very firm mattress, but not uncomfortable. A roll-away sofa was also provided and could have accommodated two more people but there was no separation for privacy. The room was equipped with a free use refrigerator and a $2/day small safe for personal valuables. Bottled water was provided--we drank a couple and were not charged for it. We went the European Plan (EP) route whereas almost everyone else was on the all-inclusive plan. Our identifiers were yellow wrist bands. The concierge told us we were one of only four couples on the EP. The people on the all-inclusive plan wore white wrist bands. About 30% of the people were on the \"premier(?)\" plan--black wrist bands\" which, for a substantial fee, entitled them to privileges such as reserved areas on the beach, restaurant reservation priority, etc. That may or may not be worth it if you are all inclusive, but it is definitely NOT worth if if you are EP. Why pay for reservation priority if you don't plan on eating all your meals at the hotel anyway? Besides, we had NO trouble finding good chaise lounges with a palapa shade on the beach. There were even more spaces available around the pools. On the occasions we went to a hotel restaurant for a buffet, we were charged only half the time, even though we went out of your way to show the wait staff our yellow wrist bands. REALLY. But for the OTHER half the time, the meal on non-all-inclusive was very pricey. Flat rate buffet was 200 pesos ($17USD) for OK food or even a cheeesburger. So if you are on the EP, buy your snacks at the local Mega supermarket, eat most meals in town, and very few at the hotel. We were a little disappointed by the fact that there was no real \"snack bar\" for mid-day meals. Everything was buffet for daytime meals. The buffet had very good selections but we just wanted a plate of nachos or something simple. There were three restaurants from which you could order from a menu for evening meals. We made the gigantic mistake of getting free tickets to Xcaret, and other trinkets, by \"just attending\" a 90 minute \"presentation\" at the Grand Mayan/Mayan Palace. When will we learn? The 90 minutes turned into 4.5 hours with FIVE different representatives hammering us with all the benefits for ownership at the Grand Mayan. An intrusive, high-pressure, disgusting pitch. Contrast that with Ocean Maya. No pressure whatsoever. When we spoke to the concierge the second day, he noted we had not met the supervisor. Then he said, he could set up a special presentation for us, but \"THERE IS NO OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER!!\" We said , \"No\" and he said, because we were on the EP he would be happy to make recommendations for restaurants, or provide other assistance. What a contrast, and thank you Ocean Maya and concierge Jaime. The weather throughout the week was very good. There were some short afternoon showers, one downpour, but everything cleared up soon enough and out came the sun. As always, it is very humid but this is on the Caribbean after all. The beach itself was a 7-8 on a ten scale. Not as wide or glistening as Cancun or Playa del Carment directly, but still pretty nice. Clean and well maintained every day. Lots of chaise lounges, palapas, nice poolside amenities. Like most places, service was a little slow on the beach (I think the black wrist strap folks get something here) so better order two at a time. Sometimes the staff just came out with a whole tray full of drinks and just handed them out to whomever, EP or not!! Drinks were weak as usual unless you ordered a double. We paid for drinks about 1/2 of the time even on the EP and even though we specifically showed our yellow bands. The ocean swimming area is in front of a boardwalk that has a plexiglass wall. In this area was sand on the ocean bottom for about the first fifty feet into the water and then it got pretty clay-ey on the bottom. No big deal but a surprise to us for the Caribbean. Oddly, the adjacent area, which was reserved for the jet-skis, para-sailers, etc. had a much better, sandier bottom for a much longer distance. As a result, most people swam in the area where the jet skis were and few swam in the other area. When the deep sea fishing boats came in, however, people were scooted away. All in all a good-enough swim beach, poor snorkeling, and a nice sunning beach. But if you didn't like the beach, there was always the pools, which were nice. Take your pick. Staff was exceedingly helpful. We didn't meet a single staff member that even showed they were having a bad day. Everyone greeted us cordially, and were truly helpful. We would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "BosHappy_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR62778870", "Content": "I decided to comment on things that are important to me so don\u2019t judge me for these trivial details.

We got an unreal package deal on Travelocity. 2 adults, 2 children (8 and 13) room total about $2000 including flight(connect via Philly). Having booked this, my expectations were very very low so I was surprised beyond my expectations having to learn that not only this is a great place, we also got deluxe rooms and black bracelets as room description on my Travelocity stated (deluxe). Black bracelets may not mean much in terms of restaurant reservation, separate beach area and nicer rooms but they mean a hell of a lot when it comes to drinks. You can not even compare national drinks and premium drink and especially how they make you feel the next day. This one big reason I would suggest people get black bracelets. Their premium brands are nice stuff not some cheap crap, however they do make you sign some form every time you order premium drink which was kind of annoying. Premium drinks they have are Don Julio tequila, Grey Goose vodka, Bombay Sapphire gin, Bacardi rum, Courvoisier v.s.o.p. cognac, Johnny Walker black, baileys etc.. all the good stuff. Anyway, some tips: Snorkeling from resort: $35/per adult, $20 per child under 12, - not a bad deal, do it, only 2 minutes from shore. Scuba=$105 includes lesson, $75 for certified divers, also 2 minutes from shore. JetSki $65 for 30minutes. Food: I have learned that 5star, 4 start 2 start, 3 start resorts on All inclusive are absolutely the same. All are eatable but plain and can not be called great. Good at best. However, breakfasts are great if you are looking to pig out(what else to do :-), omelets, eggs, waffles, beacon, hash browns, mimosas, the best. I would eat breakfast all day. Italian restaurant is OK(not fish soup) everything else good, Japanese was good at the tables not the hibachi bar. While entertaining to watch, hibachi food was uneatable. Do not go to Mexican restaurant, absolutely horrendous. Stick to buffet or Italian or Japanese. Pool beach bar had basics, burgers, hot dogs, sometimes tacos and on the pool deck barbecue, ribs chicken, good stuff. Night shows, so so, entertaining but we have seen much better in other resorts in the area(not too bad). Coffee bar in lobby was nice, good coffee. The beach is an issue if you like swimming in the ocean. Access to it is from the left or the right and the water is dirty and murky also the bottom is a bit slimy not nice sand so beach water is not great but pools are right behind and are great. If you walk about 1mile to the left of the resort, you will hit a river which goes to the ocean. It is full of fish and you can take bread from cafeteria and feed the fish while snorkeling, good visibility too. Bring highest sun screen you can get. Because the money we didn\u2019t spend on the hotel we usually spend, we ended up doing many activities (scuba, snorkel, park(we want to EXPLORE), very cool. Zip lines, drop to water, cave river swim stalactites everywhere, etc\u2026. It\u2019s only 10-15 minutes away so dont let the taxi and private bus drivers tell you its 45 minutes and charge you that much($40 each way). Well, that\u2019s it, nice and relaxing. We booked Brant\u2019s entertainment plus for private van transport from airport $135 for 8 people, great service, great van, on time to and from, very professional. If you have large party get them, as other vans stop in all the hotels and cost you almost the same per person. All reviews I read are 100% true.

Traditionally, a moderate resort, they have re-done many rooms and added a \"Maya Deluxe\" designation which comes with a black wristband and several good to excellent perks. A three-star visitor can get a white wristband, a good beach, plenty to eat and drink in a physically beautiful resort, serviced by a friendly, hard working staff. The four star vacationer can get a black wristband, a gorgeous new room, premium drinks, priority service and a Balinese beach bed with a fantastic beach butler in a private section of the resort. Rather than lose one client in the search for new ones, Ocean Maya competes with itself for both levels of business. This may prove to be a clever business model that pays big rewards. At either price point, guests receive a wonderful, all-inclusive vacation for considerably less than other venues with similar services. The resort is comprised of two- floor Villas, each with eight rooms. This is not a resort for those with mobility issues as the meandering pathways wind through beautiful gardens and are quite spread out. The Maya Deluxe rooms have a minimalist-Zen feel, with smoked glass doors between vanity and bathroom and enormous tiled showers with plenty of hot water. There is a sitting area, a flat-screened television, stocked mini -fridge and very firm bed. Each room has sliders to a patio or terrace with tropical or aquatic views. Maid service is quite good. The biggest issue we had was forgotten coffee on one occasion. A safe is provided for Maya Deluxe and is $2.00 per day for others. There was a new iron and ironing board in the room along with plenty of good quality toiletries. We found the food in the Italian, Asian and Buffet restaurants to be very good. We went to La Dolce Vita twice and enjoyed the show cooking in the Asian restaurant. El Charro was good for lunch or a late night snack. Early risers could get coffee there without walking to the lobby. The buffet had good variety each day for each meal. This is important for an all-inclusive, because the buffet is the \"fall-back\" place when specialties don't appeal to all guests. The pools were large, clean and beautiful. The swim-up bar was always busy and the lobby bar was hopping at night. Mike's Coffee was great. Specialty coffees and fresh desserts were provided daily. This is located in a back corner of the lobby and was a great place to grab a cup or a frozen cafe chocolata. The beach has been an issue, but the real issue is the access to the ocean. The regular and \"private\" beach areas are nice. There are plenty of lounges, palapas and beach beds. Service is prompt. The left and right sides of the boardwalk and glass wall are the access areas to the water. We watched the water go from cloudy with seaweed to crystal clear in a few short hours. You are at the mercy of nature here, with sea and weather giving and taking away. The southern most entry area is usually the best bet. The entertainment team, like the rest of the staff, is hard-working and does everthing it can to keep people happy. Nightly shows are fun. Do not expect Vegas or Broadway. Ocean Maya is a good resort with tremendous value. You can go low-ball or mid-ball and get exactly what you paid for and sometimes, a little bit more. If you go with a good attitude and expectations, you will sometimes get much more than you paid for or what you expected.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place for the Price!\u201d", "Author": "Wisc0Girl", "ReviewID": "UR61629481", "Content": "We arrived March 25 and stayed for ten days.

I would defiantly recommend going to Fifth Avenue in Playa is you get the chance! The food was pretty good. The buffet had different food every night and the family favorite was the fresh pasta bar! The Italian and Japanese restaurants were really good! I would recommend going to the Japanese two nights, once or the grill and once for the sit down. The entertainment staff was awesome! They had activities going on during the day and then did the entertainment at night. The hotel also has a shuttle that goes to Coco Bongo certain nights of the week.

We arrived at 3:00 P.M. and had no problem at all checking in, it was quick and efficient. We asked for a second floor room with a king-size bed and that was not a problem at all, we were also greeted with a welcome drink, which after traveling all day was a nice treat. The bellboy helped us to our room and along the way pointed out were all the restaurants were located. Let me say YES there was a smell of sewer at this resort. The room we got was fine and perfect for us. We opted not to upgrade and get the black bracelets, and after speaking with a few people of the perks from this bracelet the only thing which would have been nice was to be able to make dinner reservations in the sit down restaurants....We did eat at the Italian, Mexican and Japanese restaurants and only had a slight wait at each of these restaurants. The Italian and Mexican were good, honestly, I was disappointed with the Japanese, but since we did not have the \u201cblack\u201d bracelets we were not seated at the \u201cHibachi Table\u201d were the chef cooks in front of you, we were seated in the main section and ordered off of the menu. The breakfast buffet was very good and had everything you could want for breakfast, including mimosas and bloodymarys. At lunch you had the option of eating at the buffet, which we only did one day and that was also good, or eating at the snack restaurant near the beach/pool, which in the evening is the Mexican restaurant. They offered snack type foods for example hamburgers, hot dogs, French fries, chips, salsa, salad, wings and enough things for us to nibble on for lunch. Drinks at this resort were fine, and we never had a problem being served. We were served by \u201cBetty\u201d on the beach and she did a great job delivering drinks to us all throughout the day. Entertainment at night was put on by the Activity Team and they did an OK job, on Monday night they have a \u201cbeach party\u201d and that was actually very nice, so do try to attend that. Service here was wonderful, everyone was very nice and helpful....Remember a tip does go a long way, and honestly I witnessed alot of people who did not tip, which really was a shame, since everyone there always had a smile and were eager to get you anything you needed. As noted is previous reviews the grounds at this resort were absolutely beautiful and well maintained... The beach was also nice, but if you are looking for crystal clear water DO NOT choose this resort. Everyone spoke of a glass retaining wall and that was also fine and did not take away for the beach at all. Beach chairs were always available, but the resort did fill up on Friday to Sunday with local people on holiday. Pools were large and clean. Towels at the \u201ctowel hut\u201d were always available. They only have one free shuttle to Playa del Carmen and it was 12:00 until 5:00, honestly, it is just too hot there during the day, so we opted to take a cab into town one night and the cost was $14.00 and about a 15 minute ride. Previous reviews said there AC did not work, ours was fine, except for one day it leaked very badly into our room, word of warning DO NOT place your suitcase under the wall mounted AC, if ours was there everything it is would have been wet. We told the front desk and someone promptly came to fix it. In closing you do get what you pay for, so if you are expecting a 5 star resort and want to be totally pampered with high-end things, do not book this resort.

We've learned to take reviews with a grain of salt. But after having been there, we now understand the bad and \"so-so\" reviews. Best Parts: Room: Nice and clean, no problems with bugs or sewer smell. Made service was good, especially when you give them a few dollars here and there. We had upgraded to the \"Ocean View\" rooms and were happy we did. Try to get an upstairs room if possible. Hotel Grounds: Beautiful. Everything was meticulously maintained (grass, plants, trees, water features, etc.). Staff: Very friendly, spoke enough english to not have any issues. (we try and speak spanish, which they appreciate). Wait staff at main buffet seem to be a little understaffed. We sometimes had to wait for drinks or coffee at the buffet, but it's easy enough to go and get your own and bring it back to your table. If you want to be waited on hand & foot (not us) this isn't the place for you. Entertainment staff were very friendly & enthusiastic, although the shows were a little too \"cheesy\" for us, but some people loved them. Specialty Restaurants: We really enjoyed the Japanese & Italian specialty restaurants. Mexican restaurant was a little disappointing. My husband had a chile relleno that was literally COLD. My daughter had chicken fajitas that were just \"okay\". I had enchiladas that were okay, but have had better here in Colorado. If you're going during a busy time, be sure to make your reservations in advance. (this is sort of a drawback). But...these specialty restaurants were much better than the buffet. More on that below. The Worst Parts: Main Buffet & Beach Bar / Grill: Food at both the main buffet and the beach restaurant (doubles as mexican place at night) was pretty mediocre. The buffet basically had the same thing every night with very slight variations. We realized pretty quickly we should try and take advantage of the other \"specialty\" restaurants instead. The beach grill was also pretty bad. No mexican food during the day whatsoever. Just hamburgers & hotdogs, chips, salsa, fries, salads. No fresh fish, (I love fish tacos). We ended up going to the main buffet for lunches (a little inconvenient if you're planning on staying at the beach/pool all day). At least at the buffet I could make my own fish or chicken tacos with freshly grilled items. We LOVE real, authentic mexican food and it was pretty hard to find here. Even the \"Mexican Fiesta\" night at the buffet was so-so. Overall, the pico de gallo and chips were pretty good, but guacamole was pretty bad. The Guac didn't taste fresh at all - it was like it came from one of those plastic pouches you find in the produce section when you can't find good ripe avocados. Very disappointing. Bars: Drinks are small and watered down. Seems typical of an all-inclusive place. Even when you ask for something straight up on the rocks (vodka, tequila, etc.) it is NOT the real thing. My daughter's \"virgin\" margaritas were better tasting than the real thing. That's sad! Beach: This was one of the most disappointing aspects. We are beach people, and like to be right at the beach, with easy access to the ocean. The photos don't show you the big \"wall\" directly in front of the main beach - probably put in place due to all the beach errosion from hurricanes recently. It's like a barricade of sand bags that runs parallel to the ocean, and they've built a boardwalk on top - so people walking down the beach can get across it, and they have plexiglass railings (so you can see the ocean). Behind \"the wall\" there's a ton of beach chairs, palapas, on a big sandy area for sunbathing, with easy access to pools. If you're more of a pool person, you'd probably be very happy with the setup. As you're facing the ocean, to the right of the \"wall\" there is a small beach area with chairs & palapas and easy access to ocean, which is were we spent most days. (Except...that's where they have the sailboats & wave runners going in & out). Fortunately, there wasn't a ton of boat activity, but might be annoying to some people. To the left of the wall is another small beach area, but just a little ways from that is the pier and a big jetty type thing and the water is a bit murky over there. Water / Ocean: Water in general was not really clear -- looked pretty from a distance, but if you want to snorkel, this isn't the place for you. If you went swimming in the ocean the bottom is only sandy for a little ways, then gets a little muddy / slimy. Location: You're still pretty far from Playa Del Carmen, so if you want to go into town, you have to make a reservation for the free shuttle service (leaves hotel at 12 and returns at 5). We couldn't get a reservation one day, so we hired a taxi and spend about $15 each way. For $800 USD per person (including air, 8 nights & all food / drinks) this was a great trip for me and my family. But...we won't be going back. I'd rather pay a little more and have better ocean/beach, food & drinks.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nova Scotia", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation\u201d", "Author": "MeemahNovaScotia", "ReviewID": "UR60318258", "Content": "This was our first trip to Mexico and it will not be our last.

This year we wanted to go back to Mexico, and of course, prices are even at the time of spring break still far the best comparing to other Caribbean countries. We chose this hotel because of the price w/combination of good reviews. And I am glad we did it. This hotel is smaller resort comparing to large XCaret Flamingo types. This worked out well, since the pools were less crowded and we did not have to fight for the spot on the beach or by the pool. Rooms are spacious and clean every day - even your sheets. Of course, you might experience some toilet problems, broken TV, no heat water - if you report it, a service team will try to take care of it immediately. However, if the problem is big, then you might end -up not having hot water for few days. On the other side, this can happen at Hilton's as well. Ask for another room and I am sure they would be happy to help you with this. Food: Great Mexican food, high standard of buffet style, great selection - all at La Hacienda . As somebody pointed out, dinning at other teo restaurant is for guests w/white bracelet a huge problem. By now I don't understand why this resort is not using booking system for all guests. Can you imaging waiting for the table 45 minutes w/half-sleeping child? We gave up. After all, we went to Mexico to try Mexican food, right? Black wristband: I am glad I did not buy it for extra charge of $35/person/day. Save your money, there is really nothing extra. Extra drinks? Well, we don't drink alcohol anyway. Because of special beach area? Do not be jealous, they had just extra 15x7 meters of beach area, which was framed by the glass fence. Many guests w/children stayed at the pool area w/us, anyway. Services: People working in this resort are very nice, helpful, and hardworking. But this is standard for Mexican vacation at least per our experience, which we are thankful for. But back to vacation at Ocean Maya by H10. Hotel seems to be more family, middle age & older couple oriented. They offer kids club and night entertainment for adults and kids ( if they are still awake at 8.00 pm). Overall, we liked our stay at the hotel. Low key, smaller resort w/beautiful landscaping, few iguanas and other people-adapted wild animals, beach was nice, pool as well. Food was great, clean room, everything was accessible. Please make decision based on what you are really looking for on your vacation. If it is peaceful area w/nice beach, not crowded, great food, smiley and helpful people (Jonathan, Zayda, Manuel, Captain Marco, Jorge - thank you for getting us chair when my child fell asleep, great gesture!, etc...) and the price is just fantastic.

Last year we stayed at the Ocean Turquesa and knew not to believe the things that people knit pick about in their reviews. So here is the \"Real Deal\"..The grounds at the Ocean Maya are absolutely Beautiful, very well kept up and it shows. As you may or may not be aware, some of these resorts have been built on swamps so sometimes if it is really humid you will get an odour-but this is normal!! The architecture is very nice. Each villa contain 8 rooms and there are 35 villas on the resort. The first night we arrived we had previously requested an above ground room however none were available upon check in. So for the first night we stayed on the ground level. This particular room was not one of the recently upgraded but was still very nice. Just to make sure that you know exactly what you are getting when you book you should ask your travel agent or the hotel itself. We paid $897.00 pp + taxes for 7 days. All of your meals are included of course, most alcoholic drinks, and towels for the beach. This is for the people who booked and are issued the \"White Bracelets\". There is NO safe, NO mini bar, NO service on the beach, and NO international drinks. And forget about getting into the restaurants WITHOUT a reservation, if you want to get in reserve in advance. We upgraded on the 2nd day to the \"Maya Deluxe\" rooms which cost us about $25.00 extra pp per night. They are newly upgraded and have new fixtures and furniture and were above ground. Once we upgraded we had all of the extras that I listed above that we did not have before. However, at the Ocean Turquesa that we stayed at last year all of those \"extras\" came with a basic booking. And these are sister resorts! There is also a roped off private area at the beach that only people who upgrade with the maya deluxe \"black bracelets\" can get use of. They have beds with canopies there too..You know you will have to get up around 6am or so to put out your towels, sunscreen and maybe a book to let people know you have it reserved. OKAY the BEACH. Yes people there is a section of the beach that has a retaining wall to keep the beach from further eroding. It does NOT look horrible!! They have clear glass walls in that section so you still have full view of the ocean. The rest of the beach is beautiful, there is LOTS of beach that is NOT behind the retaining wall and lots of ocean to walk into and go for a swim...People on previous reviews made such a BIG DEAL about the small portion of the beach that has a retaining wall but \"Boy are they picky\"!! Now the Food- Okay, after staying at a much larger resort last year where the VARIETY of food was abundant, it was a little different for us this year. This is a much smaller resort so there is NOT as much variety however, the FOOD WAS STILL GOOD. My stomach can sometimes be delicate so if I didn't happen to like what was cooked for a certain meal, there was lots of fruits, breads, deli, cereals, etc.. for me to choose from. The SERVICE- If you upgrade and happen to get service at the private beach area, PLEASE ask for \"Edgar\". He was one of the highlights of our stay at this resort. He speaks very good english and has worked in the resort business for a while so feel free to ask him anything about the resort or surrounding areas. Somedays the service for refilling the mini bar ran very late so hope your not too thirsty..lol...The ENTERTAINMENT-you have to realize that this is a smaller resort. There is entertainment EVERY night and they can NEVER get enough people to participate so bring your energy and your dancing shoes because they try really hard! Each night is a different theme and they really try to bring the energy. Swimming pools are very nice and of course the swim up bar was awesome! Remember they are NOT outdoor heated pools so they do not allow swimming at night! But they are a great temperature to cool off during the day! It is NICE to go for a walk on the beach to look at other resorts, however if you are standing up looking out into the ocean-go for a walk on the beach to your right...If you turn left the beaches along the resorts on that side are not very nice at all..Actually some resorts have an embankment to go over before they can even gain access to the ocean. All in all it was a pretty good trip. Obviously some people are more picky than others. We are only going by what we experienced two years in a row visiting the mayan riviera. We would definatley return to the cancun-mayan riviera area but probably NOT at the same resort again...", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cThis place is beautiful\u201d", "Author": "timest", "ReviewID": "UR59946667", "Content": "The Ocean Maya is very nice for the price.

Yes the beds are very hard but if you go on your holiday to sleep then you should stay home. Lots of hot water everytime we showered. We did not upgrade to the ocean front rooms so I cannot comment on them as they were an additional 30.00 per person per nite and we felt that this was not worth it for us, yes you do get a black wrist band that gives you a special location on the beach and so called premium liquor but it is not necessary unless you cannot drink anything else. All the drinks were very good and the beer was nice and cold. All in all a very solid 4* for this resort.

However, I had an amazing time and it seemed like everyone else there did too. It wasn't perfect, but overall I thought it was a great resort well worth visiting. Here goes... Bracelets: -The upgrade vs. non-upgrade -- we had the black bracelet which means the upgrade. As people have said on here, its 25 per person a night, and I think it was worth it but not necessary. It gives you access to premium drinks, dinner reservations, a remodeled room, access to a different canopy beds on the beach (which were great), and a stocked minibar. I didn't see one of the non-upgraded rooms so they may be fine; our rooms were great though. Rooms: they were gorgeous and modern, big shower, never had a problem with AC or hot water, balcony, mini fridge, flat screen tv...etc. Only complaint here were the beds, but like others have said, not that big of a deal - I slept fine for 5 nights. Again, not sure what the other rooms were like but ours was awesome. Grounds: beautiful! I also loved that there were little villas instead of just a big resort - very spacious and beautiful. Lobby was also amazing, we loved to hang out there before dinner playing cards, etc. Pools and beach were great too - yes there is a short wall but other than that there is clear access to the beach. Food: We never had a problem with the food. We were only there for 5 nights, and I suppose if we had stayed longer the buffet could have gotten repetitive but we ate at all the different restaurants and they were pretty good. Mexican one was alright - nothing special. If you do get the upgrade - piece of advice - when you get there make your reservations at whatever restaurants you want to try for the next few nights. That way you can pretty much choose your time. If you do it the day of sometimes you're stuck making them later (if thats what you want then no biggie, but we tended to want to eat earlier). If you don't have the upgrade, although other reviews said they only had to wait a few minutes, when we were there, we heard the host telling those w/o reservations it would be at least an hour and a half wait. I guess it just depends - but if thats a priority for you id definitely recommend the bracelet. Staff: amazing!!!! they are so friendly and go out of their way to help you out. The staff and the grounds were most impressing aspects of the resort. We saw the Grease show as well - they do try really hard, but this is not the place for great entertainment. They do announce \"bar crawls \"etc they have going on in either playa del carmen or cancun. We ended up just going by ourselves to playa one night and cancun another which was a good time. Also, if you know you want to go into Playa one day make your reservation early!! We tried to book on Tuesday morning for Weds. or Thurs. and they were already full. We ended up just taking a cab is only about 14 dollars to Playa and then you can come and go as you please. We didn't do any excursions through the resort so I'm not sure how those are - we were content just staying at the resort during the day. Overall, it was a great time and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a more relaxing trip.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "germany", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel and staff\u201d", "Author": "frieda", "ReviewID": "UR59585749", "Content": "My girlfriend and I spent 5 relaxing and entertaining nights at Ocean and had an excellent time!

(Been to Cuba, D.R. and Jamaica) It is very different as a whole as compared to Caribbean countries. I enjoyed it immensely. The check in process was quite easy. Very beautiful lobby, sort of lukewarm reception. We were not told about the deposits required to use the safe nor were we given towel cards. Our rooms weren't ready upon arrival so we had to wait about 3 hours until we were able to get into our rooms. That was tough but we'd experienced that before at other resorts. The room was okay. The beds were extremely hard. The tile floors were in rough shape, looking dirty but they were just badly scratched. The walk-in tile shower was nice. Otherwise, nothing extraordinary. I dont spend much time in my room whilst at a resort, so it served its purpose. Regardless of the bad bed, I slept really well! The beach was nice. Not enough chairs by the pool though. I love, love, loved the bartenders at all the bars (Edgar, a \"Trip Advisor\" favorite, Fernando, Filiberto at the pool bar and the young cutie pies who worked the evenings at the lobby, forgot their names). They were all very nice and muy rapido considering how busy they were! Hard workers they are. The drinks were great! All the frozen blender drinks were fantastic. Try the \"ACC\" (Amaretto, Cherry and Coconut) or Miami Vice. My favourites. The food was great. Breakfast was great, fresh fruit, omelettes freshly made, etc. We ate at all three \"specialty\" restaurants. The Japanese was my favourite, the Italian was good, and I actually liked the Mexican restaurant (as opposed to many other reviewers). I found the buffet really good as well. Fresh fish, fresh fruit, many choices. The entertainment staff was great! I thought their shows were awesome. And a few of them are really easy on the eyes....(Victor and Jesse...hoLA!). I really loved Isabel (I think that's her name). She smiled all the time and seemed to really enjoy her job. Some of them looked a bit tired or annoyed with the tourists which for some reason made me feel bad or annoying. Their \"Grease\" show was so cute! Good job guys! The nightlife wasn't so great. It really died out as soon as the evening show was done. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking to party hard at the hotel only. Get there early or you wont have a chair! My only big complaint was the white bracelet/black bracelet. Being a lowly white bracelet bearer, I really felt lower class as compared to the black bracelets. I think this should be eliminated entirely. If some people wish to pay more for their room, that's fine - but I don't think we should be separated in classes for treatment : lower class (white bracelet) higher class (black bracelet) super higher class (timeshare holder).

We booked a couple months early and went to this resort because it was the only one that could accomodate our particular travel dates. After booking it, we read the reviews and we were quite nervous about all the bad reviews. There were a few things I was unhappy about in comparison to other like-resorts we have traveled to before. Although I am giving you the negatives, they didn't affect us as far as having a good time. Many of the staff do not speak English so they were difficult to talk to. Also, about 10% of them just seemed rude while another 40% of them were just neutral - not rude but not as friendly as I have grown to expect from the other all-inclusives we have been to. 50% of them were friendly and helpful. Also, even though they have 3 restaurants and you don't have to make reservations (and cannot unless you upgrade), they don't make it easy to get into the restaurants. They all open at 6:30 - if you want to go, you need to be there by 6:00 at the latest (recommend 5:45) because they reserve many of the tables for those who upgraded and they reserve them for the entire evening. It's as if they really don't want you to go to the restaurants - and the service is slow - very slow. However, the Italian and the Japanese restaurants were excellent - Jorge, our waiter, in the Italian restaurant, was very friendly and was very kind to my daughter (21)who was practicing her Spanish with him. The Mexican restaurant was okay - I expected more from it since, after all, we were in Mexico. Another area of concern was how hard the beds were - yes they were the firmest mattresses I have ever experienced - however, don't know if there is something wrong with us or not, but we all found them really, really comfortable to sleep on - even our 21, 24 and 25 yr olds agreed. Next concern - the beach - there really is a sea wall - but it didn't affect the view of the ocean from the hotel or pool at all. If you wanted to be on the beach closer to the ocean, it was just steps away. We enjoyed having the pool area right next to the beach. The view from here was nice. We loved lounging around the pool and found the grounds to be beautiful. This is a smaller resort than we usually go to and we enjoyed the serenity of it. The layout of the rooms is very nice. The entertainment staff was just ok - they kept things going - sand volleyball, water polo, dance lessons, etc. The kids participated in many of the activities. The shows at night were really bad- they gave it their all but they just didn't measure up to what we've seen at other places. Sophie, the conceirge (spelling may be wrong!), gave us great info on places to go - however, she hadn't been outside the lobby in the resort so she couldn't give directions to any of the places within the resort which I found odd. We told her we were interested in zip lining and she recommended Xplore which was the most incredible place to go - 11 zip lines, rafting and swimming through caves, and a jeep tour plus lunch included. All of this for $129 per person including transportation from hotel! All in all, it was a fun time - would we go back to this particular resort? Maybe - we'd check around the area first to see what was available before deciding - Since there is no maybe as far as recommending, I would say yes only because I wouldn't not go if others were interested in this resort.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Resort and Staff...

I got my wish! To start with, I had booked this vacation in December then broke my foot in February and decided to keep the reservation. Check-in \u2013 We arrived around 9:30. When we got there we had requested a handicap room, but my agent forgot to cancel the prior request for an ocean view (2nd floor). They were going to switch it, but we thought we should try the room and see first. They had upgraded us as a thank-you for not cancelling the trip I guess so the room was great and we heard the ocean and unpacked immediately. Room \u2013 Our room was fabulous, great view and spacious. Villa 3707. The rooms with a sofa have pullout beds inside (some people didn\u2019t know that). If you want to know the weather or time (hard to find clocks since the idea is that time doesn\u2019t matter) checkout Channel 21. It had great tunes, mostly 80\u2019s, that didn\u2019t have repeats that we heard for about 3 days, but we only listened in the morning and just before dinner. Our room was very clean. This room was also close to 2 of the restaurants and the pool and beach. If you book early enough, definitely book a villa and not a room in the hotel. We didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in our room, but we liked it when we were there. There are 2 things that weren\u2019t perfect. One was the outside wall of the patio had some peeling paint, they are repainting and hadn\u2019t made it to the last one yet. The beds were not great, not horrible, but def not like being at home. Beach - The beach was cleaner than I had pictured from the reviews, there is plenty of room and chairs to use. The upgrade got us a members only area which had a walkway, it was beautiful. Pool - There are 2 plus a kiddy pool. They were beautiful and never too packed since the beach was right there and people would use the day for daytrips a lot too. Entertainment- The shows were good and humorous too. This isn\u2019t Vegas; these people perform different shows every night so I was impressed with the quality. The shows are mostly family friendly and a lot of times get the audience highly involved. The disco is what you make it, if you have a good crowd with you, it can be fun, otherwise I would recommend the nightlife in town. During the day there was always something going on by the pool for kids and/or adults. There is also a kids club from 9-5 so that parents can have some free time. Shuttle: There is a free shuttle into Playa from 12-5 every day, be sure to book the day before. Cleanliness \u2013 We found the rooms and the entire resort to be very clean, there was always someone cleaning and the bathrooms were great. The grounds also need to be mentioned, they were beautiful and immaculate. The pictures (which I had thought may have been adjusted for colour) do not do this resort justice. Staff- Amazing!!!! They were accommodating, friendly, funny and always ready to help. I wouldn\u2019t use the swim-up bar, much quicker to get out of the pool and grab your drink then pop back in. The service is as fast as it can be, but remember that you are there to relax and the mood there is also relaxing. We never had a problem with waiting a few minutes, but we also brought oversized travel mugs. Restaurants- You can only make dinner reservations if you upgrade to the black bracelets, but even without reservations people were almost always seated immediately or within 15 minutes. The morning buffet was always good in our opinion, there was an omelette station which was great. I would recommend grabbing the soda glasses near the soda machines for your juice though. Behind the bar in the main lobby there is a coffee bar which had the yummiest hot chocolate and treats were also available. The lunch buffet was also great and mixed up food choices. The snack bar near the pool had typical stuff, it was okay. At night: The Italian had a romantic atmosphere (which was lost on us), but the food was amazing, a lot of choices for food here. Japanese: We ate at the grill where the food was cooked in front of you, twice! I would recommend that seating arrangements. Mexican: It was just okay, only ate there once. Buffet: Good again \uf04a Drinks: Very good and yummy, at all locations. Some people on here had complained that there wasn\u2019t enough alcohol in the drinks, but as my friend pointed out, you shouldn\u2019t taste the alcohol in a good drink. And we watched them pour, they are not weak! Money: We did not exchange for pesos, only used American. And $1 tip goes a long way in a country where minimum wage is $4 a day. Overall we loved this place. We were treated like royalty and respectfully, always had service with a smile. North Americans could take some customer service lessons from these staff members! A fabulous place for a great price. I think the fact that we were given the upgrade made our stay better, but hung out with people who didn\u2019t upgrade and loved it still. I would recommend this to people in their 30\u2019s and up, friends, couples and families. If you are looking to party it up, look elsewhere. I also think that if you are a timeshare member, this may not meet your expectations. I do not typically go to the same place twice, but I would consider this again if the price was right and would definitely look into their sister resorts.

It was known as the H10 Hacienda at that time. Went as a group of 4 friends in our early 20s. The beach had very soft white sand - if you dove for the volleyball, it wouldn't scrap your knees at all. The food was good. I wouldn't say great but somewhere in between good and great. The Japanese a la cart was fairly iffy - I wouldn't recommend the trouble of making a reservation for that place. Service was good. At that time, they had a promotion with their sister hotel right on cancun strip. The ONLY CATCH was that we had to check out of H10 Hacidenda/Ocean Maya at 10 and take the free 1hr shuttle to Cancun only to wait around for a few hours before we could check in there. Then the same goes when we got back to Playa - and we got different rooms when we got back. We weren't bugged about the time shares, probably because we all looked freshly 18. We talked to some other Canadians (there seemed to be plenty of us!) who had families and what not, and they shared their stories of harassment. Service was good. Other than the \"Do not disturb\" signs they have barely stay on the door handles. Our first room didn't even have one so the first morning, we had EVERYONE knocking on the door. The maid a few times, even the electrical guys who ended up fixing the light bulb has we slept off a hangover. And even the cable guy! It seemed like their whole posse was out to get us out of bed! You could imagine, that was incredibly annoying. Next time I'm going somewhere, I think I may make my own do not disturb sign that I know will stay on to save me from the too-crazy-night-before 'headache' The disco was kinda cheesy as there would only be a few ppl down there. The nightly shows they put on weren't spectacular but it was entertainment. Personally, I wouldn't go back as I would want to check out other resorts. I didn't know about this site at the time, which I find a lot of great tips in the reviews. I would recommend it for a young family. It's very quiet (esp compared to Cancun). You know your children would be safe. The staff is great with all ages. For the spring breakers, I wouldn't recommend this place. For the relaxed couple who likes to party it up every blue moon, I think this is a great place. It's only a 10(?)min cab ride into Playa de Carmen.

Food- There are 4 restaurant choices for dinner Japanese- Tapanki (table side) was alot of fun, and the food was great Italian- The best food on the resort was definitely found here. Mexican- No, don't bother! No one we spoke with liked the food at the Mexican place, which seems strange being in Mexico and all. Buffett- Was a buffet, just like you would except, good but not great Service at all the restaurants was terrific! You can also eat at the restaurants as many times as you please, we did Japanese 3 times :) If you are a wine drinker, especially red wine, buy some and bring it with you. The wine is awful, and I'm not even a bit fussy. I can hardly tell the difference between $10-$100 wine, but this red wine, is thick, and served cold, and kind of fizzy? Very strange. Entertainment- This is not the resort for spring break partying (thank god!). There is a nightly show, and since it's a smaller resort most of them are put on by the very hard working entertainment staff. If you do want to go partying, each night the hotel offers a trip to a local bar, coco bongos, or bars in Cancun. Everyday by the pool the entertainment staff are rounding up people to play volleyball, do some yoga, play water polo, etc. My advice is GET INVOLVED! It was so much fun, and they work so hard to make up things to keep everyone happy. Look out for Victor (ladies you wont miss him), and Daniel. Activities - Outside of the resort we went parasailing, which was a great time. We also went to Xel-ha, which was a great day, snorkelling, walking, swimming, etc. We also went into Playa del Carmen for the day, shopping and sight seeing.

We made our reservations at the Ocean Coral & Turquesa in Puerto Morales. Upon arriving at our resort, we were told it was overbooked and were being moved to the Ocean Maya. We tried not to be too critical of the Ocean Maya, but since it wasn't what we were expecting we couldn't really help ourselves. There were a lot of great things about this resort. The grounds were gorgeous and there was always people working on the upkeep of the grounds. The pools and beach were very nice. Laying at the pool you were looking out over the beach, which we both enjoyed. The staff was mostly friendly. The bartenders and lobby staff were all very friendly. Since we were bumped to this resort, we were upgraded to the black bracelet (aka \"privileged club\"). The black bracelet allowed us to make reservations at the ala carte restaurants. We were told the white bracelets couldn't make reservations, but could show up. We ate at the Italian and Japanese restaurants. We did not make reservations at the Italian and were seated right away. The food there was probably a 2 out of 5 - definitely nothing fancy. We made reservations at the Japanese and sat at the table where they cook in front of you. It was by far the best food at the resort and it was entertaining. Also, with the black bracelet we were able to lounge in the private section on the beach. The sunbeds were great, but were in high demand. You had to put your towels on them by about 6:30 am in order to get one. It was worth it though. Also in the private section we were served by Edgar, who was great! He brought drinks, snacks, and you could put in your dinner reservations through him. The upgrade was nice, but I don't think we would pay for it. Other good things about the resort: the coffee shop was nice, the Mexican restaurant has snacks during the day and it's great while lounging at the pool/beach (they have Styrofoam plates so you can take it out with you), Wi-Fi in the lobby was nice. Some of our complaints: the food, the entertainment, the promptness (or lack thereof) of the staff, no one could make change, availability of king size bed rooms. The food - other than the Japanese restaurant the food was not great. The breakfast buffet was the same almost every morning with not a lot of choices and the dinner buffet was less than enjoyable. I found myself most happy with the snack bar - hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, french fries, nachos, etc. The entertainment - we don't usually partake in any of the \"activities\" that are offered and the crew seemed to always be trying to get people involved, so that seemed great. However, the night entertainment was late - 9:30ish at night. We found ourselves trying not to fall asleep in the lobby waiting for the show. The staff was not very quick with requests. Our toilet hardly flushed and plugged twice. Both times it took at least 5 hours to have someone come to fix it. Also, there were only one or two bartenders at the bars and the wait at the pool bar during the day was ridiculously long. We always like to tip the staff, but no one could make change for us! Make sure you take lots of small bills because even the lobby and stores wouldn't break big bills. We were put up in a room with two double beds which wasn't ideal for my husband and I. We requested a change, but weren't able to change until the next day and we decided not to bother because everything else about our room was fine. Not surprising, but so you're prepared the prices in the hotel store are outrageous. We wanted to carry-on our luggage so decided we would buy sunscreen at the resort. We knew it would be overpriced, so we can't really complain but it was around $23 USD for a bottle of sunscreen. Overall, we went on a vacation to relax in the sun and that's exactly what we did.

I'm very glad we didn't this place is great! Very laid back and relaxing. The staff is wonderful and work very to do everything they can for you so please tip them, I assure you if you do your stay will be that much more pleasant. Some of the rooms are outdated and I must admit if I did have to complain about anything it would be the beds, they are very hard, but I did't come to Mexico to lay in the room all day so it was fine! The food is pretty much the same as any all inclusive you go to, mostly good but by the end of your trip you start to get a little bored with it. I must say that the Mexican resturaunt was our favorite, the Tala fish and Chicken fajitas were very good. Most other reviews were correct about the grounds they are beautiful and very clean and very well maintained. The beach was wonderful as well,you may see some nasty pictures of dark water and sand bags but those are one the far north side of the beach by the pier so you don't even notice it. The swimming area is great and there are tons of fish right there. One morning on my walk I saw a sting ray right out in front of the wall. All in all for what we paid ($710pp with air for 9 nights) I really can't complain and I would return.

Keep in mind that I have went on many vacations. (ex: Mazatlan, Ixtapa, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Cancun, ect.) The rooms were very dirty. Many parts of the room had visible mold problems. The beds were comparable to sleeping on box springs. Shower knobs did not work on any setting other than cold. Found many corners of the room where there were, what looked like pubic hairs laying on the floor. The sent of stale beer and smoke filled the room. This place has the worst food I have ever seen. It is almost like they recycle their buffet style food throughout the different restaurants they have on this property. For example, on night they had \"Mexican Night\", they were serving tortillas with a slice of single sized cheese inside of it. That was it. That is not Mexican food. More like on food stamps and welfare food. The kind of crap you would eat at 2am when your drunk and their is no food in the fridge. Next comes the drinks. They do not serve any type of good liquor, unless you pay extra. The quality of the liquor they do serve is comparable to the very cheapest you could possibly find in a liquor store. I dare you to try to take a shot of this tequila. It tastes like burnt hair. It is almost as if they water the stuff down. To top it off the nightlife. Get ready to spend your entire trip in the hotel lobby. Because that is all there is to do. I spent my trip sitting on my computer in the lobby looking for other trips for next year.

We had just stayed at another resort for a week (Flamenco Occidental Xcaret) and had booked our last week at the Ocean Maya. Check in took quite awhile as there was only one girl working by herself and was also in training. We are exceptionally understanding people, yet we also have our limits of 'ok, enough is enough'. Our first room had a king bed, not adequate for my friend and I. We accepted our next room as it seemed ok. But wow... the mattresses at this resort compared to the Xcaret were not good lol.. If you just rolled over you could hear the springs popping and your bed would move as well. I went to use the phone and i noticed something moving.. i picked up the phone and there was ants literally everwhere. I moved the lamp and underneath it was like a nest. They were crawling everywhere, up and down the nightstand, the floor, it was gross. We had called twice and NO ONE came and did nothing over 2 days. The final night I was talking to my friend and she saw an aunt on my forehead then crawl into my hair. Well did I get any sleep? NO, i could feel it crawling around.... Not good lol. So the next day I had to get our airline charter representative to do something. They moved us but said we never called or complained before. Our next room was ok, same mattresses and only aunts in the bathroom. At this point we just cut our losses. The food though was excellent. The italian restaurant was by far the best food I've had a resort in awhile. The japanese restaurant had the guy cook and through his spatulas aroun which was fun: food reasonable. The grounds immaculate and beautiful. The spa very average. Hardly any nail colours to choose from and my girlfriend still had dirt under some of her nails after her manicure. However the facial was outstanding! The coffee shop is a nice change, the drinks were very good but the main bar shuts down at 11. They keep a small tiny bar open with only vodka, rum and something else available thats it. The shows and entertainment very entry level and some shows almost embarassing to sit and watch. Music stopping, actors forgeting the moves... just not good. The free wifi in the lobby is great, wish more resorts had this. Upgrade to the black bands if you can.

I was very skeptical after reading reviews of the resort prior to travel. I am pleased to report that we experienced none of the issues I had read about. Check in and check out were both quick and easy. It was my 50th birthday and we were upgraded to the black wristbands and stayed in a villa near the restaurant La Hacienda and enjoyed an ocean view. All of the staff members were friendly and were eager to assist. They work so hard that it makes you feel almost guilty to be having such a good time. This is my third trip to the Cancun area. Both of the previous trips we stayed at hotels that were ranked higher on Trip Advisor. This hotel had the best food and drinks- by far!!! Even without the upgrade to premium liquor, the drinks were awesome! If I had one complaint at all, it would be that bacon was served at breakfast only two times while we were there. With the upgrade, you can make reservations in the restaurants, enjoy the private beach area with the awesome Edgar waiting on you... Pina Colada's made with fresh pineapple were to die for and I don't even like Pina Coladas or pineapple!!! Our villa had been updated and even though we didn't have a remote for the TV, I didn't care because we didn't go there to watch TV anyway! The Japanese and Italian restaurants are very good. The buffet is also nice. They did a special buffet for Valentine's Day that was excellent! The resort is between Cancun and Playa. A free shuttle is offered that leaves at noon and returns at 6PM and you must book a day prior or take a taxi. The ocean surf is gentle here and the color is not as bright as in some places and somewhat cloudy at times. The beach is well groomed also. I would have been perfectly happy staying at the resort without leaving even though we did take a couple of day trips. If you want to party and go out clubbing, this is not the place for you! (The night shows here could use a little help). If you want a relaxing vacation with BEAUTIFUL grounds that are kept clean and well manicured, then this is a MUST!!!

To me, this was wellworth the extra money as the initial cost was low to begin with. We had margartas made with \"Don Julio\" tequila I was initially worried regarding the beach and bad reviews of the resort. The landscaping throughout the resort is absolutely stunning. I loved the villas. The beach area was beautiful with the seawall to prevent beach erosion. There was plenty of access to the water which was for the most part, clear aqua blue. Walking up and down the beach in each direction was interesting. North of the resort was several rivers that met the sea. The food was the usual buffet style and was adequate. The specialty restrauants were ok with the exception of the mexican restraunt which was not good. I especially loved the coffee shop where I could get a latte after 9am in the morning. We went on a snorkelling exursion by Maya Adeventures with a guide named Nacho and had an especially excellent time. The service at the resort was adequate with some glitches but all in all I felt the employees were hardworking and pleasant. i did feel that the resort needed to hire more front desk people, waiters/waitresses for the buffet and the bars. We also used the free shuttle into Playa del Carmen for an afternoon of shopping. My husband and sisterinlaw used the dive shop for a two hour snorkel exursion that cost 35 dollars which he said was well worth the cost.

The pool is about an 8 out of 10 but is very clean and has a nice swim up bar. The only complaint I have is the food. The Japanese resturant is the best. I highly recomend watching your food being made, you have a choice of menu or watching, take watching.

If you want a great swimming beach don't go here, or anywhere to the north for two reaorts or south for 2 miles. I walked each way and this section just doesn't have great oceanfront. Most had been reclaimed from mangrove swamps. The pools were great though. Smelled sewage for a second or two 4-5 times.

Being reasonable and nice people we readily gave her the $20, not wanting her of course to get into any trouble or have it taken out of her paycheck. Then, we were told the massages were still on our bill and they had no indication they were ever canceled! The girl who worked the desk when we canceled was not in, but they did not bother to call her to check this out. Apparently, we were supposed to get some kind of paper from her confirming that we canceled which we never got because we canceled on the phone! My husband, who is always so courteous to everyone, had finally had it with them. He told them he was only paying for the massages because he had to get to the airport and would dispute the charges with our credit card company. He let them know that we've stayed at three-star hotels that treated guests better than they did. I think they were recently bought by some company, but whoever is managing affairs there is woefully inadequate.

We got to our room # 2007(very back of property not close to anything) only to find the most run down dirty stinky room. There was mold on and in everything including the bed sheets were covered in surface mold. After going back to lobby and waiting in line (which you do a lot of at this resort) and battling the \"games nite\" noise we were told that there was no more rooms available and they would send someone to change the sheets. Needless to say by midnite when they finally got to our room,...I was in tears. There was no blanket on the bed (which took another 45mins wait before we went to lobby to get it ourselves) no clock, no coffee maker, and the fridge did not work,...oh yeah no hot water either (even after running it for 10 min). The next morning when we took our pictures of the room down to our Noli rep (after waiting in line again) she took us over to the front reception (and waited in a line this time as there were several other people there with concerns as well) only to be told that the only way we could switch rooms was to pay the extra $700.00 and up grade to a black bracelet (which does not mean jack crap at this resort) which we did out of sheer panic at this point. Long story short,..after 2 more moves to 2 more rooms because of electrical and leeking problems (don't forget these are the \"VIP\" rooms) (to which they had no other rooms available last night) we finally got to a nicer room # 1202 and most everything worked for most of our stay except,...it was loaded with bugs. By the time we finally switched resorts Jan21 we were both covered in no less than 30 bites each. I came to find out that there were other people in the same quality of room (VIP) that we were in and that it was the first room they were given (no up grade no black bracelet no extra cost). Our total cost for our flight and hotel at Ocean Maya was $4372.00. for 2 weeks minus our last three days at Ocean Coral & Turquesa (which was much nicer) This is the most expensive resort we have ever stayed at by this time. The food became very boring and repeditive. The evening shows were very poor quality. The were under staffed in most areas. there is only two bars on the whole resort (one of which closes at 6;30 pm) and it is generally hard to get a drink (even with a black bracelet). I've been given three addresses and e-mail addresses and none of them are correct so forget about trying to write anyone with your concerns. If this is your first time going to Mexico or if you go for almost free then you can't expect much and that is exactly what you will receive.

They do a great job meeting you at the airport, getting you on the bus, and meeting your every need at the resort. Upon arrival at Ocean Maya, which was about 6:00 in the evening, we walked up to the front desk and I mentioned that all I really want is a second floor room with an ocean view. No demanding! When we walked into room 3306 and saw the ocean view, which also overlooked the pool, we knew immediately we were at a nice resort. The room must have been recently remodeled as it was just beautiful. Now I'll admit, the food wasn't what you might get at other \"more expensive\" resorts, and the selection was limited, but hey, you get what you pay for. We ate a different meal every evening and truely enjoyed every bit of it. As for a smell anywhere, we never noticed a thing. The grounds were beautiful and the help just wonderful. Our only real complaint is that their entertainment was pretty poor. But you know what.....we went for the sand, sun, and water. And there was plenty of all three. So I guess the bottom line is, if you want more than what you got at Ocean Maya, sure you can get it.....and you'll pay for it.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoughton, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cNice - could have been better\u201d", "Author": "WIDaisy", "ReviewID": "UR54849308", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 night stay.

We put wet towels over the drain and aired out the room, which helped. Our phone \"hummed\" all the time, so we unplugged it. We plugged it back in for our wake up departure call, which we never received. Luckily, we set the cell phone alarm for a backup. Had trouble getting washcloths and shower mats left when they tidied the room. Our requests always got a \"in 10 minutes\", but never received any. The beach area was quite nice for taking long walks. Sure there is a fence (that you can see thru) in front of the property, but that was no big deal. There is a nice walkway by the fence that leads you back down to the beach. You can walk quite a distance in either direction along the ocean. Pool area was very nice and clean. The snack area by the pool could use some more help. The one guy working cleaning off tables and running to get drinks for people was working his butt off by himself. Note: People, help yourself to drinks! Also, this property was very poplular with French Canadians. Sorry, but many were rude. Watch out for that cutting in line at the bar or the omlette station!! The staff were very pleasant and polite. Overall, for the great price we got thru Apple Vacations, it was a good value for us and we had a nice time.

The bonus was that we did get to stay at the Blue Bay next door and were able to eat & drink free at both locations. However, walking on the beach & up to the central resorts wasn't worth it, especially with inclement weather, so we didn't really get to experience the Ocean Maya. We liked the atmosphere there a lot better, as it seemed more sophisticated and intimate. However, we'll never really know, since we got booted the moment we arrived. The whole process took more than an hour, between showing up, them scurrying around doing some totally disorganized paperwork, and then having to wait in line at the other hotel. Considering that we booked directly through their website and had no communication whatsoever about the problem prior to our arrival, I am still puzzled as to how this could happen. I'm frankly quite disappointed, as we had picked this hotel specifically because we liked the look and feel of it. After this experience, I will probably never book with the H10 chains again.

We asked for an upgrade to an oceanview room in buildings 10-12 and was told all rooms were booked. We chose this hotel for the price they offered in January. The weather was cool and rainy for two days but that is out of our control. We did have 3 nice days. Nobody was in the pool except for a few hardy souls. Room - Nicely decorated but mattress seemed older and very hard. On arrival we had no phone, air conditioning worked off and on, no beer or pop in fridge and needed extra pillows. We did get everything we asked for by day 3 but we should of went straight to the customer relations desk instead of writing notes to maid, calling the front desk or reporting these problems to the Ocean vip desk which we found out were time share reps. Be aware if you are invited to the VIP breakfast to be shown the upgraded amenities as it is a time share sales pitch. Food - We ate at the buffet and the 3 specialty restaurants. Food was very good except for the Mexican rest. We enjoyed the Japanese and Italian rest and the food was excellent. We tipped at every meal and staff got to know us and waiting to take our drink order before we even sat down. With our upgrade we got premium liquor which we drank Gray Goose, Kahula, Crown Royal, Baileys and Don Julio tequila. Corona was on tap and always cold. Also with the upgrade you can make reservations at the specialty restaurants and without it is first come first serve. Beach - We loved the premium section and the bali beds, Edgar our waiter was wonderful and gave us great service. The upgrade was worth it just for this perk. You can walk the beach 20 minutes north and hit a logoon at Tres Rios. South we walked 45 minutes and could of walked farther if we didn't run out of gas. Small beach to the south and north of the sea wall. We stayed at the Catalonia Royal Tulum last year which has the best beach in the area except for Maroma Beach. So we knew ahead of time about the beach and sea wall. We were content as we did not swim in the ocean due to the weather. Overall our twenty year olds loved it as they partied till the wee hours as there were lots of people their age. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace at night listening to the live music. We did not see any shows. But the entertainment staff were very hard working and tried to get all guests involved in the activities during the day and night. In the past we have upgraded to the vip service at the bahia and princess chains and we feel the Ocean Maya still has a ways to go to compete with them for example no room service,separate vip lounge, free internet service, turn down service with fresh towels ect. Also this is the first hotel we have stayed at they we did not get a towel sculpture left on the bed. Also one day the top sheet was removed from our bed but replaced the next day. Also our safe lock kept getting stuck and there was no mp3 player, slippers or umbrella as described on the website. I would think a supervisor would spot check these rooms. Our sons room had no phone service the entire week which was inconvenient. We were told the hotel is in the process of upgrading their phone service and service is sporadic. I feel if these rooms were not ready they should not of booked guests into them. We did get a spa credit for our inconveniences. We took a cab into Playa Del Carmen to shop and eat at El Foggins which was very good and inexpensive, we had 4 beers and dinner, two had tacos and two had carne asada and our bill was $26.00 The staff at the Ocean Maya were friendly, hard working and grounds were clean and beautiful.

Personally, our air conditioner was extremely loud and our mattress was not comfortable for a nice night of sleep. The bathroom we updated with a shower only while the towels were a bit scratchy. Overall we felt that is was a safe environment and would rate it an above average stay. The main dining room is more like a cafeteria with average/good food while you need to make reservations for the other all inclusive restaurants at night. During the day they have a great pool bar and water lounge area but we were swarmed by bees who love the sugar on the margarita glasses. We noticed a large beehive in the tree next to the pool bar, we hope it is gone (beware)!

As always, avoided all the time share by walking rapidly and looking down, didnt have any problem with them. Check in was relatively quick at the resort. We were sold the trip under the impression that we would have an oceanview room with a bathtub and a minibar. For anyone that enjoys their baths it's important to know that this hotel either offers a tub or an oceanview, why you have to choose I don't know. Anyway, we of course gave up the bath tub and took the shower in order to have the oceanview room because our teenage daughter was with us on her first trip to Mexico and we wanted her to enjoy the view. I will just go ahead and get it out of the way--THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE AND UNACCEPTABLE, BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE READ ABOUT THIS!!! I am an easy person to please when it comes to meals! I suggest you frequent the kiosk by the pool and just have the hamburgers/snacks etc as your meals. The buffet is horrific!-- The grounds of this resort are the most beautiful I have seen so far, especially for those who enjoy taking photos. We really enjoyed the activities that went on at the pool. Always something going on-water aerobics, fashion show, dance lessons, spanish lessons , stretch on the beach, and for the record all of these activities are ran by cute young energetic men =) Housekeeping was spectacular!!! There is always a cute little critter made from the towels left on your bed each day and room is nice and tidy. They DO NOT leave water and drinks each day like most resorts do in your mini fridge. They show it as a mini bar in the sales ad, that is misleading in my opinion. I had read bad reviews on the beach, however, I found it to be beautiful and so did my family. We did the Captain Hook cruise again out of Cancun and it was awesome as always. You enjoy great entertainment on the ship as well as a steak and lobster dinner. You meet up with another ship and have a cute little pirate fight then head back. Really neat. Fun for all ages. Lasts about 2 1/2 hrs. Well worth the $. We went for a massage down by the ocean in Playa Del Carmen, 15.00 for 30 minutes I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS!! You will need it especially if you stay at this resort because the beds are just as the reviews say HARD AS CEMENT!!! We asked for foam in advance before we left the states and we asked when we arrived, they told us they would bring it but never did. --- Shopping in Cancun is a must as well. Stop in at Senor Frogs, its a fun place to eat and socialize. We were told the Co Co Bongo was an awesome place to visit but we ran out of time. There are just so many different things to do. We have a 14 yr old daughter and she had the time of her life. Staff is kind, and helpful. Resort is clean, airconditioning was good, our stay was peaceful. Over all, we had a good time. If you are big on dining, I would not choose this resort. We have stayed at the other H10 Ocean Turquesa and their buffet was outstanding, so I was really confused by this.

We were told by our travel agent that the water was as blue as the turquoise ring I wore...It was impossible to see the turqoise because of all the black \"slop\" in the water and on the beach. Walking in the water required extreme care to avoid the many rocks that covered the sand. Part 3: Bingo on the beach. We found 2 lounge chairs on the beach not far from the pool to relax and read. Shortly thereafter, I heard \"B 2.\" Then \"O 52.\" A very loud voice was indeed calling out bingo numbers. I can go to any rundown downtown in North America to the local bingo hall if I want to. But I definitely did not want to do this on my vacation to Mexico. Following the bingo game, the loud, booming club music began. It was really getting hard to concentrate on my relaxation...We had to ask to have the volume turned down but it was still there. Part 4: The dining room. A large cafeteria style room closed in. I have been in many other places in the Carribean and Central America. One of the attractions is the open air restaurants--it is something we in Canada can only enjoy for a few short months. I look forward to sitting in outdoor style restaurants on a trip to a tropical country so this was a great disappointment. Part 5: The illness. We both became extremely ill on the second day in. We had avoided all water other than bottled water, leading us to believe it was the food or the water which was used in the food preparation, coffee/tea making process was contaminated or not properly treated. My partner was so ill we had to see a doctor for medication for the cramps which did not settle for one week and he did not feel well until the end of the second week. We actually left Ocean Maya on the second day when we were starting to feel ill and went to Tulum. There we stayed in a lovely Cabana which I would recommend to anyone. While I realize that illness we sufferd is a common problem to travellers, expecially in Mexico, it was really the last straw to a huge disappointment in the resort.

They gave their cheap staple menu items that are free ..ie pasta and tacos. But if you want steak or some other expensive item you pay. A steak was $30 ! (4) they have three actual restaurants by name. Funny thing is they are all the same restaurant. They just call it a different name in alternateing nights depending on the theme. Japanese, Italian and Mexican. (5) they lied to me upon arrival. The snack bar is supposed to be open all night. Warning.. If you go into town and think to yourself .. I think I'll save some money and wait till I get back to eat , eat in town cause the snack bar will be closed by 10 or 11 pm. That really got me mad.

The hotel provides absolutely no help in this dept. They will only call you a cab .. That's it. ! No vans or buses into town. 14 bucks each way in a dangerous cab driven by a local.

Our first impression was that the Lobby and grounds were very beautiful and clean. So far so good. Check-in was fairly quick - about 15 minutes. We were given a ground level room in building 18, located mid-way between the lobby and beach. The room was fairly large, with a king bed, sitting area, table and chairs and mini-fridge. Both the TV and AC worked well. The first problem we encountered was that the patio door simply would not lock. This required a trip back to the front Lobby to request a room change. The receptionist stated that \"no rooms were available for that day please come back tomorrow\" and that \"we shouldn't worry about leaving the room unlocked as there are plenty of security\" - simply unacceptable response! Would a wise person leave their belongings unattended in an unlocked room in a strange place? After about 45 minutes and some stern insisting on my end someone was finally sent to fix the door (My husband had already repaired the lock himself in the meantime). I still find it difficult to believe that an alternate room was unavailable when the resort was only at about 25% capacity. Also, of note, at no time did we see security other than in the front lobby and at the hotel's entrance. Finally, off to the beach... We were very pleased by both the pool and beach areas. There had been many reviews complaining about the state of the beach so this was initally a point of unnecessary concern. The retaining wall is simply a much nicer solution to the beach erosion problem than the adjacent properties unsightly sand- bag solution. To the left is an area of beach the we found to be quite with plently of chairs, umbrellas and hammocks to relax in. To the right, the water access was a bit nicer with ample chairs and water sports. We have traveled to several islands and this was some of the nicest white sand we have experienced. The water was clean, clear, warm and blue and we saw many little fish enjoying it along with us. The pools were large, uncrowded alternatives to the beach. While we were happy to have a large pool to ourselves, it was a bit disappointing that the spa loungers and whirlpool were not turned on. Sadly, the pool bar was also closed for remodeling. The hotel was also in the process of remodeling the ocean view rooms (which was previously undisclosed) so there was a bit of construction noise to contend with. We made the best of what was available and were able to relax and enjoy the open ammenities. A positive about being at the resort during the slow period was that reservations were not needed for meals. We never had to wait for food or drinks. The food and drinks were just fine with a nice variety of choices. House beer is Corona. Japanese resturant was our personal favorite, but the Mexican and Italian were also very nice. We highly recommend the Mayan coffee (think of it as very tasty dinner entertainment). A few negatives about staying at this resort were that there was construction, would be services/ammenities such as the coffee bar, whirlpool, pool bar and main attraction fountain/waterfall were all closed or turned off. The resturants were open on alternating schedual. This information was not disclosed prior to our arrival. A huge negative was that we, along with six others, were standed after our \"free\" trip into Playa del Carmen and the hotel made no attempt to rectify the oversight and reimburse us for the return cab fare when the driver failed to pick us up. A tip and a warning - A trip into Playa del Carmen is a must-do, but prepare to find your own way back! For the most part, the staff we encountered were fairly hard working and friendly. We believe in rewarding folks for a job well done and were happy to leave small tips for the waiters and cleaning staff. The entertainment staff was pleasant and not pushy. We did enjoy the show that we attended. We think that some of the reception staff might benefit from some customer service training. The Olympus Tours rep was MIA our whole trip. No tip for them! In summary, despite a few negatives, we did manage to have a good, relaxing vacation. There are some small issues that the resort needs to correct, but otherwise this is a solid 3-star resort.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Traverse City, MI", "Title": "\u201cSupreme Pampering on a Budget!\u201d", "Author": "InTheHeart", "ReviewID": "UR46645139", "Content": "We stayed at the Ocean Maya for nine nights and not once did we lack for anything!

My advise to people - When you are looking through reviews, ignore reviews that are negative which include remarks like \" boring\", \"bad drinks\", \"not enough choice of food\", \"bad service\"...and so on. Those are people who are spoiled, in my opinion. If you are a person who can appriciate other people's efforts and you keep an open mind, you should not ever have a problem with these things, when at the resrot anyways. These people work so hard and for such little money!! But, in regards to the Ocean Maya hotel, the above were never an issue. Everything was GREAT! The food, the rooms, the pool, the service. Everybody is so friendly there. We loved the set up of the resort. It is beautiful with lots of plants and flowers. The beach is nice. However, the water was not very clear blue water that I like. But I'n not sure if it was because of the season or the location. We spent half the time in the ocean and half in the pool. The swim up bar is great. We also went to another resort in May 09 and that beach had clear water, but that resort was located closer to Playa down town then the Ocean Maya resort. Ok, back to Ocean Maya! Just try it, it's so worth it. But this resort is not for party people or crazy people. This is more for families and couples who want to relax and spend time together. However, there were planty of chances to sign up for Disco and other Party outings through the resort.

To be honest, after we booked our trip, I read many reviews and actually tried to change hotels from the many negative reviews out there, but it was too late, so I was a bit nervous about staying there. Overall, the bad reviews are overly harsh and I think some people are just too hard to please. Come on! we got a week all inclusive for under $800 plus tax! This isn't a five star, and it isn't priced as one either. Although we enjoyed our stay, there were some very annoying problems that made the stay less than perfect. The check in was reasonable, requested ocean view room(s), ( we booked two rooms ) but many were being renovated, so no dice. We did get two main floor rooms beside each other that were very clean and roomy. THE PROBLEMS: 1) Tv broken in room first night - fixed fairly quickly - ok 2) Toilet plugged first night - fixed fairly quickly - ok 3) Three people staying in room, but room service left only two towels next day - no big deal, after mentioning it to the front desk, they left 3 every other morning - ok 4) Woke up to no electricity one morning! nothing... now I've read this happening in the reviews before arriving, so I wonder why it still happens?... - took a few hours to get it back on - not cool, but ok 5) Toilet plugged again ( by the way, without anything in it! ) - again, fixed fairly quickly - yeesh but ok **BIG problem** 6) We had an all inclusive tour booked to Isla Mujeres one day. We needed a cab out front waiting for us by no later than 8:00am, so at approx 7:00am I asked the front desk to call us a cab for the time requested, after waiting past 8:00am without a cab showing up, the front desk guy \"forgot to call\" oops... we didn't get a cab until approx 8:35am and was late for our tour ( missed it ) we got the tour for free, but missed it because of the late cab. The staff seemed to think because it was free, we didn't actually lose anything, except the fact that we paid for the cab to get to the location late, and the fact that we went the next day, but had to pay for everything ( we lost the all inclusive ) so we had to pay for the trip to the ferry, the cost of the ferry and food for the day... it cost us... we tried to get compensation from the hotel but without success.. - NOT GOOD! ** BIG problem!!** 7) Phone not working on one room. A guy came by and had to pull out the night table and pull out some wiring to fix. He made a few \"test calls to his cell\". Here is where it gets ugly... we made two short calls to a local number to a friend. We found out that they ( Ocean Maya ) had a charge to our room of $140 US dollars!!! for two local calls! I personally made two calls to Canada and they only charge a 10 peso connection fee, so my calls to Canada only cost 20 pesos total, but the local calls were $140 US!! that included the couple of short \"test calls\". We argued this charge and they eventually reduced it by 50% ( we mentioned the cab foul up ) 8) There was construction going on ( jackhammers, hammering etc ) on the ocean view rooms, so you heard work going on, but I do understand that it has to be done sometime and we were there at their lowest season, so it made sense that they did it this time of year, although, information about construction going on should be made available to the travel agents so customers can make a decision whether they want to stay there... 9) Out of the blue, the sound on our tv was gone ( tv in second room )... muted... picture only... because we didn't want a staff member to have to come to the room yet again, we just left it... after an hour or so, the volume suddenly came on by itself! funny thing, this made me thing that some of these issues were the result of sabotage! hmmm, could these things be happening so a guy has to come by, do a quick fix and get a tip? hmmm funny thought... 10) Because it was the \"low season\" they alternated between the buffet one night, then the a la carte restaurants. So reservations weren't necessary for the al la carte... problem is, at dinner time, everyone showed up at the same time at the a la carte restaurants! so on a few occasions, we had to wait for a table... It would have been easier to just have the buffet open as it is the largest room with the most tables that could accommodate everyone at the resort... About the resort: THE GROUNDS: In one word \"beautiful\". The grounds are meticulously kept and are lush with thick green grass, palm trees and plants/flowers. FOOD: The food was great! The buffet was very good ( don't know why so many people rate the food awful!? We ate at the buffet, it was very good! we ate at the Italian restaurant - very good! had the lasagna ( kind of small portion, but very good! ) ate at the Mexican- very good! again, served small portions, after eating the small portions, we asked the waiter to please get us something else to eat ( long days of activities makes for big appetites! ) The waiter was great, and brought us two huge plates filled with tortillas and all the fixins big enough for an army! that did the job! BARS: The drinks were watered down somewhat, but overall, good. BEACH: This is one area where we were a bit nervous after reading the negative reviews. It is true, there is a wall running approx 70% the width of the waterfront, but there are two areas to the left and right that you can get access to the water and they were very nice, so we were quite happy with the beach! that was one area where we were pleasantly surprised! POOLS: Two pools, both great! very clean and warm! In closing: It's really too bad that we had these issues to deal with, because the place is very nice, and this could have been a perfect trip! We loved the surroundings, the many lizards, Iguanas, crabs and wildlife around the resort. The more serious issues we had to deal with really should make us livid! but the place is sooo nice, its hard to dwell on it... The management has to get their act together as far as those annoying problems... I've read on many reviews the same exact issues, so you'd think they'd get it right! We still managed to enjoy our stay at Ocean Maya considering the problems encountered. Important to mention... DO NOT MAKE LOCAL CALLS from your room! IF you do, bring a briefcase full of cash! The help staff WORK THEIR BUTTS OFF! Many times we recognized the staff sweating like crazy, running around serving everyone with most of them smiling and being very polite, stopping to say \"Hola\" etc... bring some tip money, these guys work hard, and it doesn't hurt to tip for exceptional service when you get it... When out and about, be prepared to tip for just about everything! it seems that at every turn, someone is requesting a tip... I will say, most of the people we encountered, from tour guides, bus drivers, tour guide assistants etc, were very friendly, many with great sense of humor, funny, making everyone laugh, musicians on the ferries etc... I know these people work very hard and rely on tips to supplement their income, so I had no problem tipping. make sure to have a roll of 20, 30 and 50 peso bills for tips...I was pleased to encounter so many nice, friendly people on this trip!

The hotel has worked hard to preserve the beach area and the beachbed cabanas and sunning area are excelent. We never had trouble finding a shady place near the pool. beach access and bar. The views are spectacular. As to the locals, they are there- mainly on the weekend- fun to talk to and though they tend to party with each other, they welcome anyone who speaks to them and seem interested in making friends. They were not rude or obnoxious at least no more than the overly drunken American or European. Check in- Five star. Luis was smiling and prepared. Drink offered and room was ready in ten minutes as promised. Victor, the concierge, was helpful and social- smiling and checking on us twice during the week. He said ours was his favorite room and although that might be the standard line, our room might have been his favorite. He arranged a late reservation at the show cooking table on the day we arrived. Room- Four and a half star. The only thing keeping it from five was that the refrig did not keep things too cold and the tv didn't operate with the remote. The room was newly redone in Zen decor with a king bed, great three head shower, flat screen tv and suoer lighting effects. We were in room 1007 with a nice balcony and a superior view of the sea and pool- close to the bar and towel exchange with direct access. Towel art daily and a bottle of sparkiling wine plua a candy/gift basket in room when we arrived. Room was always serviced by noon. Grounds- Immaculate. Only a faint sewage smell in one spot on two days. Ozone smell during storm. Flowers, iguanas and people cleaning all day all over reort. Happy and friendly. Spa- had a pedicure- nice but not spectacular- a bit pricey. Pools- not overly crowded except near the bar on the weekend. Slightly refreshing, but it was HOT! Activities focused here. Not bad. Music was a bitr redundant though. Bars- Pool bar had weaker drinks. Lobby bar had great drinks and service. Premium brands no extra cost. Table service there too. Did not go to disco. Food- Buffett was adequate with a lot of options. Omelets, grilled fish and meat. Pasta good, bread good some days, tough others. Guacamole and salsas/ chips available all the time. Coffee/ drink service spotty here. No air conditioning. Italian- good service, fair food- many items surcharged. Dessert not impressive. Mexican- fari service, below average food. Buffet was better. No Mayan coffee. No AC. Japanese- Our favorite. Show cooking excellent. Food very good. Dessert not impressed, Mike's- good iced cappuchinas and mochas (get a shot of Kahula from the bartender at lobby bar next door to make good great. Animation- They work hard and are not bad. Not Broadway or Las Vegas, but not bad. Evening music and dancing in the square outside the lobby bar until 2 a.m. on a few nights. Parking is about a block which is pretty far in the heat. They have closer available but not sure hwo it is for- we weren't allowed to park there. Overall the value was tremendous. We would return if we found a great deal even though the pre visit communication took some doing to establish.

In an attempt to save money at the busy holiday season, I booked a 4-square apple deal with Apple Vacations. For a reduced rate, Apple picks the hotel; you are guaranteed a hotel with at least that rating. (However, it important to know that hotels are rated DIFFERENTLY by different travel providers). The H10 Ocean Maya was NOT what I would have expected of a 4 Apple hotel; more like a 3...tops. Upon arrival to the resort, my boyfriend and I were ignored at reception. The ladies behind the counter saw us (with our baggage) and proceeded to assist guests who had arrived after we had. Not a very good first impression. Further attempts for customer service were less that stellar as well. Management/customer service seemed more concerned with the promotion of one of their new resorst nearby; we seriously considered switching (no additional cost) but was concerned that that resort would be even more poorly run than this, as most new places work out the kinks. Additionally, we had to pay for a lock in order to utilize the safe that is in the room. I have a had time rationalizing this policy, as it is my opinion that I should not have to pay for a service to protect my belongings from their employees. I have stayed at hotels in which the lock is built into the safe itself or you use a card. As I 've stated, we stayed during Easter Break...along with 200 or so Spanish students on Spring Break. They were loud, rude and obnoxious. The waitstaff and cleaning staff were constantly cleaning up after them. I'm sure they received a reduced rate to draw in business. The waitstaff, cleaning staff and other service workers were EXCEPTIONAL. I felt very badly for them; I'm sure they do not get paid very well in comparison to their managements counterparts.

The staff at Ocean Maya were absolutely terrific! Friendly, accomodating, always smiling. The ground are incredibly beautiful! The check-in did take some time . . . but who cares! When in Mexico . . . you're on Mexican time! They tagged and stored our luggage and sent us off for a wonderful lunch. By the time we had had lunch and a stroll around the beautiful grounds, our room was ready. (Relax! You're on vacation!) Our daughter was injured just before our vacation so she spent the week on crutches. Our room was on the upper floor, but by the next morning they had arranged to move us to a ground floor room. We didn't think to make restaurant reservations the day we arrived so were only able to get reservations to the Mexican and the Japanese restaurants, but the Italian was completely booked. Have the coffee at the Mexican restaurant after dinner! That's a show in itself! The only thing I regret about the trip was not staying at the resort more! We immediately booked excursions to Koba, Xel-Ha, XCaret and Playa del Carmen, and while thoses were great, we all could have used more relaxation time at the resort. Bring a thermal travel mug ---- it'll keep the Miami Vices cold longer! There was always something fun and entertaining going on, both day and night (one day staff did a \"Village-people\" number, ending with a strip down to bathing suits to get folks into the pool for water aerobics! very fun!), and the days we spent at the resort were at least as good (or better) than our excursion days! Our 10 year old could have spent all day-every day at the pools, and the staff were so kind and encouraging, welcoming him into water games. He just beamed to be included and was thrilled when they'd stop at our table at dinner, calling him \"Bud\" and asking if he'd be playing the next day! So kind and friendly to all! (We did enjoyed our excursions off the resort, but getting there always took so long because the bus stops at half a dozen resorts to pick up people, so you end up spending a couple of hours/day on the bus.) Our last day there was our daughter's 15th birthday, and she and I went to the spa for messages! Ohhhhhhhh! Incredible! Our stay at Ocean Maya far exceeded our expectations!

We are big believers in a holiday is what you make it. We went down with our three children 14, 10 and 9. Alex and Adrienne in the kids club are amazing. The two youngest spent every day enjoying the program they provided. The kids club (show at 8:15) was alot of fun also. We attended three of the main shows and they were good. These workers work long hours so cut them alittle slack. You may have to wait a couple of minutes for a drink but your on vacation, relax and enjoy the warmth and scenery. The grounds are very well kept. We travel twice a year all over the Carribean and these grounds were one of the best. The beach was great. We swam right at the retaining wall area every day. Some of the pictures show the water coming right up to the wall. When we were there we could lift the rope, jump down the 2-3 feet and walk on the beach or straight into the ocean. Tips: 1. If you are travelling with over 4 people, book your dinners as soon as you get there the tables are alittle more difficult to get. 2. The dress code wasnt as fancy as some places we have been to so long pants and a nice top is common. 3. The ala cartes are a must #1 is Japanese (the show is great), #2 is Italian (the restaurant is right on the water, beautiful) #3 Mexican (the staff are amazing, the beef was great) 4. The beach alacarte has amazing hamburgers, the best we have had my whole family loved them. 5. The beach can get a bit windy in Mexico so watch your sunscreen. Our family doesnt typically burn but we do in Mexico. Overall, the whole family loved the hotel, staff, grounds, beach, food etc. There were people of all ages, cultures, languages.

Geez, there is up to 700 or more people using the restrooms and showers every day, ANY place with a septic system would smell after a while! Maybe they just need their tanks pumped out. I have a septic tank at my country home, it gets full, it smells, get over it. The wildlife is something else here, iguanas galore! Lots of great pics to be taken with them ( look for the little cactus garden behind the towel shack, we found it the last day and were amazed at all the 'big guys' sunning themselves there!) The entertainment crew were a great bunch. I've never did much with a crew before, leaning more towards sunning than activities. But these guys, they were so polite and fun, we did all kinds of things with them! Spanish lessons, hancraft jewelery making, etc....

Coffee is weak so stick to lattes. The bartender opens at 0900 and he makes a latte better than any starbucks. 2. Beds are hard so be prepared. Ask for extra pillows first thing. 3. In the Mexican restaurant order Mexican food, In the Italian restaurant order Italian food and you wont be disappointed. 4. Try the Mojitos they rock. 5. No need to bring towels they have lots. 6. Although there is no expectation to tip it would be a a good idea to bring along some US one dollar bills. Again these folks work hard and they deserve anything extra. 7.

It was worth every penny!!! The food was delicious! The staff was very friendly, the nightly entertainment was very professional. We spent most of our time laying around the pool because the beach was not all that great. But that wasnt a big deal for us becuase we travelled quite a bit to other beaches. The pools like many I have seen in Mexico were not heated. It was very refreshing after laying out. Being there for two weeks we got to know many of the staff which are very friendly, especially if you take part in activities around the pool. My fiance spent much time around the bar where he got to know the bartenders that were extremly fun, friendly and spoke very good english. I also recommend to sit around the bar if you are looking to meet people. The food was very good. Breakfast I always had an omeltte that was never dissapointing, and fresh fruit. Lunch was a very large variety of pastas, sandwiches, salads and many mexican dishes. If you were around the pool or sitting on the beach you had a choice of the pool bar that had hamburgers and hot dogs, or snacks of your choice. Dinner was always our favorite. Dont miss out on Japanese night where you have a choice of fresh made sushi that made my fiance wait around for a second helping. The a la carte restaurants were also very good. The Japanase restaurant was more than we expected, you have a choice of different dinners and I recommend the one where you sit around the grill. That was very exciting and delicious!!! The only negative thing I can think about off the top of my head is the rooms need to be updated. Especially with some new matresses. But this seems to be a regular complaint at many Mexican resorts. However they were pretty bad. I tossed and turned basically everynight and couldnt wait to get home to my bed where I felt like a princess. We made sure we came up to the lobby everynight for the entertainment which was different everynight. The shows were very professional and you can tell the entertainment staff works very hard to learn all the dances. The trip to Playa del Carmen was about 10-15 minutes. Make sure you book the shuttle a couple days in advance so you can get the times you want. Or if you prefer its a $14 US cab ride. Which also helped us a couple of times where other couples would be going the same time so we shared a cab.

They had a beach area where they have the huts and lounge chairs, but there is no swimming to the beach unless you want to jump off the dock (which we would not recommend). One thing I would give this resort is that their grounds are very well kept, beautiful flowers could be seen and the grass is very green.

We went with our 2 young children during March break & loved it. Alot of negative things we read in the reviews before we left I did not experience. I've been to Dominican & Jamaica staying at 5 stars so I think I had pretty high expectiations going in & was pleasantly surprised. THE GREAT: The service & entertainment staff were beyond anything I expected. My kids & our friends had a blast. There was always something for us to do on the resort with the kids (kids club, mini disco for kids, & dance shows at night. The pools were awesome: always chairs (not a big resort - good), shallow & deep, and clean. Next to the pools a beach, which the kids loved playing in the sand & there were always free chairs & huts. The beach did not extend to ocean - which we did not mind because our kids always want to swim in pools. There are resorts on either side less than 50 ft where you can enter water to swim if so desired. The food was very good for an all inclusive - I love food so I'm hard to please. There was always choice & fairly decent tasting. The Japenese all la carte was great. There was always coffees at the lobby bar - top notch really. Definetly the most beautiful reasort grounds wise I had ever been to. Great spa - it had alot of services & great staff. NOT SO GREAT Beds were hard & a bit small. Rooms were very basic & water had a funny smell at times.

The hotel offers a free shuttle to downtown, but you have to sign up for it asap if you want to utilize it. Otherwise, a cab is about $14 USD each way (at least that is what I was told). So, if you want to be near downtown I would recommend staying at one of the hotels in the Playacar area. Depending on where you are, you can walk to downtown Playa Del Carmen or Plaza Playacar. I will start with the positives. The hotel grounds are very pretty and clean. The employees are very nice and work very hard to keep the hotel clean. The rooms were also pretty clean and the pool was nice. The food was also pretty good. I would definitely recommend eating at the Japanese and the Italian restaurants. The Mexican restaurant was not good, which is ironic. You have to make reservations for all of these and I would also do that asap. The buffet was good too. I personally, enjoyed the pasta station. As far as the negatives go, we had some issues with our room. We had to switch rooms because all we got was one King bed and I was with my dad so that wasn't going to work. So we had to go back to the front desk. Which meant, we had to pay two different bell boys a tip to move our luggage. Then our second room had some issues. The air conditioning did not work. After 2 calls and 2 visits from the repair man they fixed it. Our t.v. didn't work and the sliding glass doors didn't open. Then, we came back to the room one day and there was a repair man in the shower fixing something. I still don't know what that was about? We also had very noisy neighbors slamming and beating on their door at all hours, but that was just bad luck I guess. Also, if you are a beach/ocean lover as I am you will be disappointed. The beaches all over this area are severely eroded due to past hurricanes and this hotel is no exception. My dad and I like to walk the beach and its in pretty bad condition. This hotel doesn't really have a beach, but you can walk in either direction of the hotel for more beach. Although, one side is full of rocks and seaweed and the other side is full of just seaweed. Unfortunately, as hard as they work to keep it clean, its fighting an uphill battle. I have been to Mexico 10 times and specifically Playa Del Carmen 3 times.

There are signs that this resort had better glory days but not anymore. This resort features the worst piece of beach on the entire stretch of the beach and unswimable. We had to go for a 10 minute walk each day to reach a swimable beach area. The pool bar was swamped with guests and only one poor bartender that was sweating it but could not keep up. I suspect they are trying to save on alcohol. After all there were 4 people entertaining about 12 people at the pool area, yet 1 bartender to serve 12 to 15 people lined up around the bar area waiting to get a drink. Also at the lobby bar's many drinks which are available at other 4 and 5 star resorts in Maya Reviera as inclusive, here you will be asked to pay extra. e.g. Baileys Irish Cream is a premium drink and will cost you.

We arrived on March 6th and left on March 13th. ...just a few tips, this is not by all means a 5 star resort it is more a 3.5-4 star so don't go expecting a 5 star resort. We were also a little skeptical before going here after reading the reviews, but you need to go there and make your own opinion. As our travel agent put it, most people only write reviews on here because they had a bad experience. Well we wanted to make it our mission to come on here and let you know how our trip was, because it was not bad and felt it was well worth the money. Airport: The airport was a little bit hectic, you get off the plane and go through customs and then you have all these people coming up to you and asking to take your bags, and time shares, just walk right by them to the person holding up the sign to your travel agency, and they will direct you to the bus. The bus ride was good, they offered us beer 2 for 6 bucks, and we got to see a couple other resorts on the way to ours. Check-In, we had a really good check in, about 20 people check in. When we arrived it was about 10:15pm, and the buffet closes at 10:30, the lady quickly gave us our bracelts and told us to go eat before it closed and that we could check in after. We chose not to eat as we just wanted to get to our room after a long day. We had a very fast checkin and a worker took our luggage and showed us to our room, which we wouldn't have found because it was dark and the places are not marked well. Rooms: the rooms are just that, the beds are hard, the room to me is just a place to sleep you dont spend much time in here anyways.. the shower and toilet were all in the same room. We had no remote controller so had to go down to the front desk and ask for one. It was advised to ask for one when checking in;which we did and she said it would be in our room. Well it wasn't but we were able to get one right away. The air did not need a controller. It is true one night we had a shower and it smelt like rotten eggs, but it goes away, there is a mini-fridge in the room that they put 4 water bottles in everyday. There is only 3 pillows on the bed, so you might want to bring your own or ask for more. There is a safe but we went and asked for a key and were told they didnt have anymore, she put me on a list but we never ended up going back from one. we kept our suitcases looked and nothing was stolen. it is $2/day for the safe key. Food: the buffet was just that, the food is ok but its a smaller buffet so there isn't a lot of choices. Breakfast is good, they fry the bacon everymorning in front of you and you can have eggs and omlettes and panckaes and french toast. a La cartes\" We booked this the first thing in the morning we got there for all of them in order to get seats. We never got into the Italian we were told it was booked until the day after we left. The Mexican is ok, we did go twice but we got the same thing both times, the nachos and the fagitas...they were pretty good..ask for a mayan coffee and have your camera ready...the set the alcohol on fire and do a little show. the Japanese restaurant was amazing, we had both the menu and the one where they cook infront of you, the food on the menu is quite salty but it was good none the less. the snack bar by the pool is good food, i had a cheeseburger everyday, and my husband loved the jalapeno poppers...The mozerella sticks were to die for, always good eats for an afternoon snack! Drinks were good - we dranks lots of margaritas, chocolate monkeys and miami vice! shout out to jose at the pool bar, he makes the best drinks! the rainbow shots are also very good! The bar in the lobby is supposed to close at 11pm but they are usually there later than that, after this you have to get your drinks down in the disco. There is pop machines in the a la cartes and there is also distilled water machines for you to always get water. Beach - well there is sand but there is no beach, bit of a disappointment but we knew this before we went. The retaining wall is there, and there is a pier you can walk out on. We did do the snorkelling through the resort, it was 35 each for an hour of snorkelling and they take you out about 10 mins from the resort to a coral reef. that was well worth the money! Pools - were awesome, newer, the pool bar they didnt always come to you down there, it was faster to get out and get your drinks at the bar and then get back in the pool. Entertainment, was in my opinion amazing..we got to know the entertainment staff really well, which was good because we got more out of our money, you can say NO to them but its worth it to say yes, they have activities from 9am-11at night. from walking beach tours to water arobics to beach and pool volleyball, drinking games, darts, spanish lessons, bingo, etc, etc..the shows are out of this world....we were fortunate to get to see grease...this was by far the best show...yes they are lip syncing but they did a good job of portraying the story..after the shows they continue the entertainment just outside the theatre with live music and dancing, and then the party continues in the disco. Smell: YES there is a smell, there is one spot on the way to the pool that does smell like a sewage plant and there is a smell walking by the disco sometimes..and by far the worst is the disco...if you have a bad stomach i highly suggest you dont go there...we did go the one night, and its true if you drink a lot of breathe through your mouth its better..one morning i walked through there though and gagged...a little tidbit, we were with nolitours and they do your orientation down in the basement, so beware of the smell it is pretty bad.. as for the rest of our trip, we went to playa del carmen one day to do some shopping, and we went to the tulum ruins one morning, we found another couple and took a cab to the ruins, it was 100 roundtrip and he waited for us, tulum is gorgeous....all in all we had an amazing time, we met some great people, and the entertainment staff really made sure we had a great time..missing it already...say hi if you go!", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGood all inclusive for the price!\u201d", "Author": "BCBeachBum", "ReviewID": "UR26356179", "Content": "We spent 7 days @ the Ocean Maya and we were happy there.

VIP also was supposed to get you better drinks and the ability to book ala cartes in advance, but they did not have better drinks (only Corona, on tap) and everyone seemed to be able to book dinner reservations in advance. So save your Pesos!! True there was a spot on the main walkway that smelled bad, but no biggie. The hall to the disco also smelled bad.

Went to Coco Bongo in Playa with some of the entertainment crew and had a blast, VIP treatment there, with shuttle to and from the hotel ($60 usd, drinks included). Also did Xcarat tour through Nolitours, the best part was for sure the cenote snorkleling. Could take or leave the rest of it.

This is not a 4 or 5 star, I'd give it 3 stars. Similar to a Days Inn or Comfort Inn. The resort pictures on their website are old because the beach is nothing like they advertise. There's a terrible sewer odor around the grounds, in the basement level near disco and even while taking a shower. Some guests vomited in the hall to the disco because it was so bad. (and no it wasn't due to alcohol). Shower went scalding hot to ice cold. The toilet ran over on our bathroom floor and we had to beg to get towels and water daily. We asked to move but were told no unless we paid $100 more. If you tip you will get adequate service; if you don't tip then you're ignored. They never came to look at our toilet the entire 8 days we were there, so we were scared to flush! Unless you have money in your hand, the staff pretends they can't understand you. Don't let your kids walk around alone, as some staff members are creepy! Pools are good but entertainment staff consists of a guy yelling in a bullhorn to try to get you up and playing games. The hurricanes took the beach away, and the water in front of Ocean Maya is rocky and murky.

We stayed one week at the Ocean Maya Hotel. This is our first stay at an all inclusive resort and our first trip to Mexico. DAY 1: After a four hour flight from Winnipeg and two hours in the Cancun Airport, we finally were on our way to the hotel. The shuttle to the hotel was roomy and comfortable with drinks (you have to pay for) served to the guests. We arrived at ~8pm and were tired. It took some time to check in as there was only one attendant (at first for 15 minutes). Once we settled in we decided to get some food. We went to the Italian Restaurant to see if we could get in or make a reserevation later that night (you actually have to book the a la carte restaurants at a small desk in the main lobby). Surprisingly the Italian restaurant took us in and made us a great meal. Issues / Concerns from other Trip Advisor Reviews: There is no sewer / sewage smell in the main lobby, it is however present in the basement and some few areas around the hotel. None of our small personal items were stolen but we did use the safe for the important things. Our maid never stole from us and always kept the room clean. There was no bathtub in our room, instead there was a large shower. Fresh bottled water (1 per person) was brought to our room daily at no extra charge. There was also purified water in the ice and by the bar. The beds are stiff. My girlfriend and I prefer that type of bed though, so it wasn't an issue to us. FOOD / DRINKS: To clarify from other reviews and websites there are 4 restaurants at the Ocean Maya. One buffet restaurant (with different themes for dinner) and three a la carte restaurants (Japanese, Mexican and Italian). The buffet was ok, the food wasn't great but the food never ran out and there never was a shortage of any item. The Japanese restaurant wasn't great, everything on the traditional menu was very salty. The person booking us for the Japanese restaurant neglicted to tell us about the \"show\" and the sushi menus for the Japanese restaurant so we missed most of their menu. The Mexican and Italian restuarants both have great food and yes some of their items you do have to pay for (anywhere from $25-42 USD for Steaks / Seafood / Surf & Turf). The drinks were always great. The only complaint I have is that there was no variety. There was one type of Margarita, Daquiri, and etc. I was expecting maybe 2-3 different types of margarita and etc, but didn't find any. Also, they do make Ceasars but they are not on the menu. Some of their drinks like their food, you do have to pay for. After dinner drinks, brandies, scotch and etc you do have to pay for. Also, for all the dinners I had at the Ocean Maya, there never was a wine list. There only seemed to be the house wine, which seemed unlikely considering there is a large wine rack room with a large selection inside the buffet restaurant. ROOMS: The rooms were very comfortable and were perfect for our holiday. Almost all the rooms (with exception to the rooms in \"Building B\"). Were located in two storey \"villas.\" There were approximately 7-8 rooms per villa which resulted in a very quiet stay. There are either patios or balconys with each villa room and we were fortunate enough to get a room with a balcony. The balconies all have small gardens so I recommend getting a balcony room. There was leak at the base of our toilet and the shower door didn't close all the way. We complained on the second day about the leaking toilet but it was never resolved. The televisions were small and ours had to be turned on manually. ENTERTAINMENT / SHOPPING: The nightly entertainment did vary from bingo, drinking contests, auctions with fun money, and etc. The night shows were basically dancers lip syncing to hit music and show tunes which I didn't find to be entertaining. There were about 4 shops there at the resort, one general store, a mexican souviner store, a photoshop / internet store (you can take photos with exotic animals and purchase photos here), and a silver store. On the map of the Ocean Maya a \"shops\" area is described in Building B. We only found more rooms when we went to Building B. By the way, if you can, bring your laptop! Otherwise there is no free internet or free computer at the hotel. You either have to pay $10 USD for a half hour of internet use at the hotel or $5 at the photoshop store for an hour of use. POOLS / BEACH: There is approximately 150 feet of beach where you can enter the water but the water is murky and looks uninviting. There are 3 pools I could see. One small kiddie pool, a large general activities pool and an \"adult\" pool with swim up bar. Kids were in the adult pool so they are kind of loose on the rules. There is only one spot in the general pool that is more than 5 feet deep, so going on a diving board or anything such as that is impossible at the Ocean Maya. There was also no jaccuzi area, just an area in the adult pool with jets. There were plenty of chairs, hammocks and beach ground available for the guests and were all well kept. STAFF: All staff members were very friendly, polite and accomodating. Most of them are multi-lingual, speaking Spanish French and English. INSECTS / ANIMALS: Iguanas were either sunning themselves or walking around during the daytime. Some small racoons were walking around at night (we saw them on the first day only). Small lizards also crawled near the exterior light fixtures at night. No mosquitos at this resort but fruit flies were around the buffet soda machines and I found one in one of my Margaritas. SHUTTLES / ACTIVITIES: Be sure to book your reservation for a shuttle to Playa Del Carmen or Cancun well in advance (Maybe on the first day). Otherwise you may have to wait a few days before you can get an early shuttle. Shuttles to Playa start at Noon and theres only one shuttle per day to Cancun. Some shuttles returning to Playa cost $3USD per person. There were also stations to buy or book a trip to the various site seeing tours or parks around Mexico. GENERAL REVIEW: We had a great time here, whether it was swimming at the pool or eating at the many restaurants. Some small issues didn't make the trip perfect but it was still very relaxing at the Ocean Maya. I'd recommend this trip to anyone attending - including young couples. I think if we were to return to the region, we'd try a new hotel but only for the sake of trying something new.", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the money\u201d", "Author": "SLDCalgary", "ReviewID": "UR25249507", "Content": "Nice clean facility offered good food, drinks and overall friendly service.

Be sure to book early if you want to eat at the restaurants, they were mostly booked when we got there and we booked right away. We were with Nolitours and had no problems with them, they were really helpful and we booked 2 excursions. We did the Sea Passions catamaran tour which included snorkelling and lunch on the Isla mujeres and we had an hour of free time on the island as well. We chose to rent scooters and go around the island, very fun...if your not the best driver though try the golf carts instead. Also did the Coba Mayan Adventure which was different than I had expected but worth it! As for the hotel rooms they were clean and ours was in good shape. Only problems would be that they didn't have any TV remotes left when we got there and no Air conditioner remotes, so we froze for the first few nights of our stay.

Myself, my husband and our children, 13 & 11, stayed here from Feb. 9 - 16th. The week we were there the weather was absolutely perfect which always helps make our vacation great. We certainly did not go expecting what we have gotten from 5* resorts in the past and we were not at all disappointed. The grounds are beautiful, the staff are very friendly and helpful, and the food at the buffets and the a la cartes was really good, always something for everyone. Do be warned though that there is only water in the mini fridges in the room, I was sure that I read there was beer and pop. We bring our big insulated cups when we go away so we just had to take a quick walk to the bar to get a refill at night. We also bought a couple six packs of beer in Playa Del Carmen to keep in our fridge for after the bar was closed, not a big deal. The resort is a great size and it is very easy and quick to get around to everything. I will admit that the beach in front of the resort was a bit of a disappointment, but it did not keep our kids from playing around in the waves. The hurricane has eroded a lot of the beaches around there. You can walk a long way down the beach and play in the water along the way. If you are a real beach person, then I would suggest taking the free shuttle from the hotel to Playa Del Carmen and hanging out at the beach there, it is stunning. Playa itself was beautiful with tonnes of great shops (high and low end) and lots of really cute restaurants. So all in all it was a great bang for our buck and personally we had no complaints.

Needless to say the bad reviews were blown way out of proportion. Yes the ocean does have a retaining wall so you cant walk directly into the ocean and this is the only real downfall we found to the resort but the resort itself makes up for this-and if you really want to go into the ocean just walk down the beach either way(to the right is the better way) and play in the water there.Our only other complaint about the resort was the bar tenders arent always the fastest so we brought bigger cups with covers to the beach/pool area and had a waitress bring drinks to us in the lobby bar-get two drinks at a time if you need.No big deal. The size of the resort is nice-you can get from the beach/pool area to your room in a few minutes and its on the way to the buffet/lobby bar area, which is only a few more minutes.The grounds are beatuiful,the rooms are a little dated but cute and everything worked and they were clean.The beach and pool area were very pretty and very clean and close to each other which was nice.The food at the buffet andthe evening ala carte restaraunts were good(the Japanese restaurant food was GREAT!! We did both the short table and show meal. I recommend going to the Japanese twice and skip the Mexican alacarte restaurant-food there was ok but nothing to brag about).We didnt get in to the Italian-it was full. Be sure to sign up for the alacarte restaraunts right away as they fill up fast.The activity leaders are a hoot(fun and friendly-especially the guys Rikki and Jaime)and there are plenty of things to participate in from 11 am until around 3,if your willing to try them-water volleyball, beach volleyball, dance lessons, water aerobics,stretching on the beach,contests by the pool, contests on the beach,ceremic painting, etc.Most of the evening shows were good and the dance party folloing is fun to participate in.After reading the reviews about the disco we almost didnt go check it out but decided to on our last night after the lobby bar closed-I wish we would have done it sooner. Yes there are a lot of steps down to it and it was a little musty (not sewer) smelling-could probably use a few dehumidifiers-but it is beautiful and the activity leaders make it a lot of fun which makes up for the musty smell and after a while yu dont even notice it. Overall we were very satisfied with the resort and would definately refer it to anyone.(Check out the pictures)The resort was beautiful, the price was great and the atmosphere was pleasent-what more could you ask for?!And remember-its Mexico- and your vacation is as little or as much fun as you make it!!Enjoy!!", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "shropshire", "Title": "\u201cNightmare Holiday\u201d", "Author": "Jessica-louise", "ReviewID": "UR24620754", "Content": "My husband and myself spent two awful weeks in this hotel.

The hotel bar served drinks after 10.30pm in plastic cups and to top it all the bar closed at 11pm. The entertainment was dire, with bingo and beer drinking competitions not only round the pool but in the loung at night. Shows were mimed and costumes were poor to say the least. We were without water for 24 hours, in that heat with no flushing toilets or showers you can imagine what it was like. It's a good job we don't play tennis because the courts were unusable.

We knew we would have to base our review on our own experiences. We arrived late on Feb 1. The hotel had our reservations already to go when we arrived. We had 2 rooms booked side by side. We have a 22 yr old son and 14 yr old daughter. So the girls took one room and the guys took the other. The first morning we met with our Transat respresentative in the lobby. She was very good about explaining everything about the resort and the side trips that were available. The first 2 days we just hung around the resort and pools to get use the place. A big thanks to the entertainment staff (Ricki, Jami, Jerry and Susanna for the dance lessons and Spanish lesson.) They worked very hard around the 2 pools and beach getting everyone involved in all of the activites and then performed everynight in the theatre and lobby. The weather was in the mid 70's, sunny in the morning and then partly cloudy in the afternoon. The wind blew everyday so did not go into the ocean as the waves were crashing in everyday. The rooms were cleaned everyday and fresh towels layed out. The food was good in the main buffet restaurant for breakfast and suppers.

From Winnipeg, we paid $1000 per person taxes included. Prior to leaving, I read every review that was available of this place. I was quite worried given the negative reviews. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, but the stay was not without a few problems (as I will mention throughout this review). Food: Very good. The buffet was smaller than we were used to, but there was always something to eat. The coconut ice cream (looks just like vanilla) was to die for! The Italian a-la-carte was fantastic! We got one reservation and then wanted to return. When we were told it was full, we went directly to the restaurant and \"tipped\" the host and were let in immediately. The food that was included (some you had to pay for) was plentiful and delicious. The Japanese restaurant was also very good. We didn't go to the Mexican restaurant, so no comment on that one. Cleanliness: Very clean. Some cigarette butts on the beach, but that was about it. The grounds are spectacular. I ended up tipping one of the grounds workers and he was very grateful given that they are not often tipped. Rooms: Beds are VERY hard. I had known this in advance, so I brought along a foam pad to leave there. This helped immensely. (Tip: put it in a new garbage bag and suck out all the air with a vaccum - then seal it with a twist tie. This saves a huge amount of space in your suitcase). I would not have been able to sleep without the foam pad. The bathroom is OK. The shower and toilet are separate from the sink area. We had some leaking issues from the shower into the sink area. Also, we had some sewer smell issues. It appears that this is mostly a problem just after you've used the water. Likely an issue with Mexican plumbing. We had a maintenance man to our room as the smell was very bad, but he said that he couldn't find anything wrong. So we just lived with it. No point in getting upset. We had a second floor room in one of the haciendas (there is a 3 story building as well with rooms, but try to avoid these as they are apparently quite old and may be a bit moldy). Take a second story room if possible as we had heard that the main floor rooms were very loud from those staying above. The balconeys are nice, but be careful with the railing....it was a bit loose in our room which was only an issue as we travelled with young children. Overall, the rooms were fine, but the lack of maintenance and some chipped tiles and uncomfortable beds hold this resort back from having a better star rating. I know that you don't spend much time in the room, but it does matter if you can't get a good night's rest. General maintenance: Overall OK. Just be careful. There are lots of steps that aren't clearly marked and one could trip and fall if not careful. Also be careful around the bathroom by the pool (next to the restaurant). The flagstones that they used are quite sharp and not even. It is easy to hurt yourself there. Again, just be careful and pay attention to where you are walking. Pools: There are 3 pools. One very small round kids pool, one large main pool and one larger pool where the bar is. Yes, they do use chlorine as I saw them throwing it in every day. Some of the tiles are coming loose, but it wasn't really an issue. The pools are unheated and are clean. Beach: The chairs and palapas are plentiful. The sand is nice and very white. The sea wall is only an issue if you want immediate access to the water. The water was clean if the wind was coming from the north, but was dirty and full of weeds if the wind was from the south. The beach in front of the dive center was not great at all. It was small and had lots of washed up glass pieces. But this isn't a problem if you watch where you are walking. Note that there are washrooms also in the dive center for guests. These washrooms are MUCH nicer than the ones beside the restaurant. If you want to go into the water, there is a nice beach at the resort just north of this one (the Blue Bay Grand Esmeralda). There is a section where it is mostly sand and the water is quite shallow, which works well if you have children with you. There was only one day that the staff were working on the pier that is being rebuilt, so this really wasn't an issue. The beach is quite first thing in the morning. At around 9 or 10 am, the staff starts the louder dance style music that sometimes gets annoying when you are looking for peace and quiet. The activities staff were very pleasant and not pushy. They accepted \"no\" for an answer. Guests: This resort was filled with 90% french people from Quebec. They tended to travel in larger groups and were quite loud and rude (both to other guests and to the staff). Staff told us that they are very demanding and often cause a \"stink\" if their needs are not met. We met many other guests from Canada who all had the same opinion. Enough said on this topic. Shuttle to Playa Del Carmen: Sign up at guest services. There are time slots that are free and time slots that cost $3 US per person. It is not clear why this is, but just be aware that this is the case. Check in: We were first off the bus and first to check in, so it wasn't a problem. It does take a few minutes. From there, we went directly to book our a-la-cartes at guest services and had not problems booking. A safe will cost you $2 US per day, but is worth it. All in all it was a great vacation. We were pleasantly surprised with the service and the layout of the resort itself. It was a real tropical experience.

Housekeeping leaves a note on your door and forbids access to your room. My husband and I were horrified to return to our room, tip taken, room not made up and over $400.00 missing! We immediately brought this to the attention of the management staff and Nolitours. A report was filed with the hotel but they did absolutely nothing about it. They insisted that we go into Playa Del Carmen to file a police report. They even went as far as to say that the housekeeper (male) was interogated, but later was told by head of security that it was a friend of his from the Police. This definitely put a damper on our vacation and needless to say we didn't trust any of the housekeeping from then on in.

My husband decided to walk around the pool area, not paying close attention to his surroundings he wondered onto the deck of the swim up bar. He lost his footing and fell onto the cement about 5 feet down where the bartenders stand. There were no lights, or ropes that would prevent him from taking this journey. The \"security\" guard or otherwise known as the man who stands by the pool sauntered over after a bit and called the front desk we thought as he couldn't speak English. We waited approx 45 mins for anyone to come, and the medic who did come didn't speak English either. After rubbing some \"ointment\" and shaking his head you can imagine our confidence in the Mexican medical industry. They didn't offer to help us to his room, and the calls to the front desk for extra pillows; towels; ice; and a remote control took 4 trips and 4 hours to arrive. The staff would bring one thing at a time as my husband laid in agony. We didn't receive one call from the hotel at any later date to see if everything was o.k. We didn't get asked if our room was on the main level and if stairs would be a problem. The rooms were also not wheelchair accessible. We had to follow up with guest services for crutches, they didn't bother to tell us there was a wheelchair available. When we finally signed one out, it broke, and then they didn't have a replacement one. They said they hurried to fix one as we had plans to travel into town and needed the chair, that delayed our trip by 4 hours. We finally got the chair back and it broke again on our excursion. You know it is one thing having to push a spouse on his holiday in a wheelchair. It is another to push a broke wheelchair. We saw on the last day you could upgrade your room for a cost with mini bar, which would have at least been a nice option as he couldn't travel to the bar even if he wanted to. Overall it didn't result in the relaxing vacation we had desired, and my husband with a broken heel and torn ligaments could have had a better trip but amenities weren't offered to make his stay any more enjoyable.

Keep an eye out for blue crabs at the spot with the sewage smell (yeah it smells, but its not that bad) Entertainment - Not fantastic, but the shows are fun to watch and the staff are great dancers Day Trips - we went on the Sea Passions (awesome for younger people, catamaran takes you to Isla Mujeres - amazingly beautful!); Captain Hook (a fun night, good for kids and young couples); Tulum Extreme (a packed day, it was great if you like zip lines)", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cRead This If You're Considering This Hotel\u201d", "Author": "hhhhhhhhhh222", "ReviewID": "UR23696956", "Content": "OK, lets start with I never listen to these reviews because I feel only the real complainers and hard to please people are the only one's writing. I've been all over Cuba, Dominican, Mexico and Bahamas. I don't have high expectations when I go away, I expect decent food, clean rooms, nice beach. I don't expect to be pampered or have someone wait on me 24/7. I will not tell you to not go to this resort nor will I tell you to go. I will give you the pros and cons and you can decide if this place is for you. CONS- The resort pictures show a beautiful beachfront. NOT. The beachfront was wiped out a few years ago the resort had to put up a retaining wall to prevent this from happening again. Assuming the beachfront is 300 feet wide, approx. 250 feet is a retaining wall with no access to the water, there is an area of 50 feet where you can go into the water. The water is no postcard material, it's not blue, it's not green , it's not turquois, it's Grey. The resort has yet to update the website. The Resort advertises 24 hour bar. NOT. There was no alcohol available after 1 am. Same goes for the 24 hour food. Disco/Nightlife - NONE. The disco is in the basement which is difficult to find, When you do find it, you will be lucky if there are 8 people in it. No onsite scooter or car rental. PROS- The resort itself was Very nice and clean. The landscape was beautiful, the rooms were very clean, the actual beach/sand (not including the ocean) was very nice. The food was above average. We travelled with 13 people including 5 kids and NO ONE got sick, no one threw up or got the runs. Everybody always found something they liked for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I don't eat seafood but there was plenty of it and members of my party said it was all excellent. The ala carte restaurants were very good. My only complaint is the Italian restaurant could have used some decor. The pools are really nice, a little cold but it is January. Showers were good, never ran out of hot water and had good water pressure. Overall, our vacation was OK. We had a good time and no one got sick and that's most important. And for all the people complaining about the sewage smell, get over it, it's a very small area on the walkway for about 20 feet.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNot bad....

(we sat in the plane on the runway for almost 5 hours before we took off, missed our connecting flight, had to wait around in Dallas before we could catch the last flight to Mexico.) Needless to say we were starving the guy at the front desk said that the buffet was still open, so we were excited to get some food. The bellman that helped us to our room said that there was food available tll 2:30am. We came back to the lobby 1/2 hour later to eat and the buffet wasn't open there was a pan of some sort of cheese (looked like Feta, cold ham chunks, and cold peas. Apparently that was the buffet they were speaking of. My fault for not being specific. Our room was ok - the bed was hard as a rock, but clean. The sheets were like sandpaper probably 100 count sheets. We didn't have a remote for the TV or the air conditioner. Our tv wouldn't turn on, so we pulled it away from the wall to see if it was plugged in, it was, so we started to investigate. We found a cable box screwed into the UNDERSIDE of the desk in the room. So when we did finally get a remote control from the front desk we had to lay at the bottom of the bed and aim the remote under the desk. The bathroom was clean, but there were tiny little ant like bugs scurrying around the sink. The pool was good. The bar at the pool was SWARMING with bees. So if any is allergic make sure you come prepared. The drinks were weak and served in small plastic cups. I caught on the next day and we bought little plastic coozie bottles in Downtown Playa. The bartenders will fill it up for you so you don't have to go a million times and it keeps your frozen drinks frozen. I found that it worked well when we got up in the morning we went and put our towels down on our chairs and then went to have breakfast. Only one day did we have a problem finding any chairs. The beach was disappointing. There was a sea wall which kind of ruined the beach thing for me. If you walk down the beach there are some fabulous resorts and spas. It is a great walk. The food was okay. There were a lot of choices, but unfortunately we weren't quite sure of what everything was. It would be nice if everything had been labled. Maybe I would have tried more things. We were relaxing at the pool one day and the guy from the Dive It shop came up to us and told us about a Catamaran / snorkeling / swim with sharks / parasail / open bar / lunch trip for $79 usd. He said that it is Adults only - NO KIDS and we decided to go forth with it. Well, when we were boarding the shuttles we noticed children, so we asked the guy that told us no kids. He said oh there is a different boat that the families and children go on. Well it was a bold face lie, we had at least 10 kids on the boat. I didn't care that they were there, but we were told that they wouldn't be. Just incase that is important to someone else, I thought that I would let you know. Otherwise the trip was great the lunch was great. The currents were super strong, and don't sit in the very front of the catamaran you WILL get soaked!! 5th avenue in downtown Playa is worth the trip. If you take the shuttle from the hotel it is $3, we did that and then took a cab back to the hotel for $14. People will try to screw you. You don't need the jewlery but they NEED the money. Be willing to walk away. They will chase you out of the shop and give you a better price. Also whatch them when they are doing their calculations - they keep \"forgetting\" what the currency exchange rate is. Wear comfortable shoes... it is alot of walking on cobblestone streets. Overall we had a good trip. The grounds were georgous. You get what you pay for. If the beach is important to you.... this isn't the place for you. There is plenty of sand, but not easy water access. Tip your bartenders and you will get better service and stronger drinks. There wasn't on person at the front desk that had any clue what was going on.

To be charitable, it was a three-star hotel with two-star people running it. It seemed to depend on your gender, age and linguistic abilities as to how you were going to be treated. The first of two rooms had a sewer smell inside and out that would not go away. The TV was old (30 years?) and small. It became smaller in the second room, which had a partial view of the pool. The bathroom had no bath, the shower head looked like it could have been salvaged from a condemned building and brought back to work at Ocean Maya. The staff had a few good people and a lot of not so good people. One lady behind the check-in counter said there were, \"...too many Canadians here.\" Although I'm Canadian and it didn't make me feel too good at the time, I actually agree with her. We didn't travel all the way to the Rivierra Maya to be surrounded by our neighbours. The idea of travelling is to meet people of other cultures than your own. If I want to feel at home, I'll stay there, thank you very much. The best of Ocean Maya was the pool area, which was close to the shoreline. The most horrific experience was on the last full day (January 12) I approached the lobby bar with US dollar in hand and requested two Coronas. We both watched as the bartender reached onto a tray of dirty glasses, removed two, rinsed them off under running water and then filled them with beer. I told him that we would not drink beer served in dirty glasses. At that point another bartender appraised the situation, with the first fellow telling him that he washed the glasses in soapy water. That did not happen. We moved to the far side of the lobby and were eventually served. We did not go up to the bar again. As for the food, it was average at best. The Nolitour people used fear mongering to get you to book tours only with them. Time to go home! The only people who should be recommended to Ocean Maya are people that you don't like.

Then we were offered a room with one queen bed. After an hour of begging and negotiation and HEAVY bribing turned out they do have a room for us.

We were traveling several families together and our friends were arriving 2 hours later, so to relive them from this pain we asked the clerk about their reservation and he showed us their room on a map and told use they are OK. Guess what - when they showed up the same show again - there is no room, take a junior room, etc. Bottom line: it is just an extortion, simple and plain. Now, the rooms are CHEAP. As I mentioned we were several families together, all the rooms the same: everything is falling apart, all the lamps are burned and do not work, TV does not work (not that we needed it, but anyways). On the positive side, we did not spend match time in our rooms anyway, the entertainment team is amazing, kids club alone made our vacation - our kid could not wait to go there so we could have time alone, all the games and activities. The night shows are very good too, the dance after is very entertaining. Bartenders are very friendly, they would remember your name and what you like and how you like it. Be advised that all the bars close at 11PM, no alcohol in a room minibar either. Beach and a pool area are very nice. The buffet was pretty good, plenty of seafood.

We stayed 7 nights and paid for an ocean view room, which we were told on arrival was not available. I insisted that I had paid for the upgrade, and they were able to get us a view room immediately. AIRPORT: Walk past all people with ties and kiosks at the airport! These guys are tricky and they are ALL time share sales. your arranged transfers will be outdoors. COST: Our stay cost us $1,150.00, or about $165.00 USD per day, booked through a travel agent (thanks Debby!) - a great value for all inclusive. My 11 yr old daughter stayed/ate free and loved the hotel. TIPPING: Keep in mind that most workers in the travel related industry in Mexico earn between $8 and $20 USD per day for a 10 to 14 hour shift. They appreciate your tips - we took along about $50.00 in $1 bills - it doesn't take much to really help these hard working and friendly employees, and you will see their gratitude in the service you receive. We gave our maid about $10.00 at the first of the week and received some extra attention in our stock of bottled water, cleaning, and towel \"animals\" which our daughter loved. GROUNDS: The landscaping and maintenance is beautiful. There is one area that does have a persistent sewer gas smell on the main walkway from the beach/pool area to the lobby, it is where the sewer treatment unit is, and you only experience it for a few seconds as you walk past - not a big deal to us. We had no mosquito problems on our trip. ROOMS: The rooms are \"bungalow\" style, with eight rooms per building. We enjoyed this because it seemed more intimate and more like we were staying in a house. Our room was clean and comfortable - all marble or natural stone floors, nice balcony with chairs, $2 per day safe fee (not large enough for a laptop), no bathtub but a nice large shower. FOOD: Book reservations for the week as soon as you arrive for the specialty restaurants. The Italian restaurant was booked for the week when we finally got around to making reservations on the third day. The Japanese restaurant is great - kind of like Benihana - try to reserve at the preparation tables. We ate there twice, and one of the two chefs is an amazing showman and lots of fun - the other was just a cook, but the food was great. Mexican restaurant was OK, but not much to choose from. The buffet (no reservation) was very good with a fairly diverse variety to choose from - fresh fruits & juices, vegetables, fish, chicken, beef, pork & deserts. Snack bar near the pool was pretty lame, but it was nice to have food and drink available near the beach. BAR: We aren't big drinkers, but the bartenders were attentive and friendly - my daughter drank countless \"Congas\" & non-alcoholic Pina Coladas. SERVICE: We found the service here excellent - friendly and helpful - the workers were much nicer and friendlier than most of the guests! Small, frequent, tips are much appreciated. BEACH: From what I understand this stretch of beach near Playa del Carmen is man made, so the water quality is always somewhat cloudy. Ocean Maya is adjacent to Blue Bay & Secrets resorts, so these other two also share the same beach, and I would not book any hotel in this immediate area if water quality is your biggest concern. In spite of the water quality, we found the beach area very nice, as most of our water activities were off premises. GIFT: You may get a letter in your room about a \"surprice\" - we didn't fall for it because we were warned that there might be a time share pitch somewhere. We had no sales pressure for any time share stuff at Ocean Maya. ENTERTAINMENT: The hotel puts on a nightly show - song and dance to prerecorded music. Enjoyable, family friendly routines. There are many activities throughout the day for all ages for those who want to spend their day around the hotel. ATTRACTIONS: We went to Xel-Ha park, an all inclusive park near Tulum - very calm water for snorkeling, we saw & swam with baracudas, tropical fish, stingrays, etc. We will probably spend 2 days there next time. Good food and great trails through the jungle, river float, etc. Don't do the swim with dolphins on a one day trip to Xel-Ha, you won't have time to enjoy the other cool parts of this park.. Instead, book it at Delphinus, located near Playa and the Ocean Maya. Book these trips through a travel agency in the hotel lobby for the best deals and inexpensive transfers. We used Lomas Travel - very helpful (thanks Anna & Joanna!). This was our first stay at the Mayan Riviera, and while my family liked this all inclusive hotel, we will probably stay further south near Tulum next time we travel there so we can be closer to Xel-ha park, Mayan ruins, and reportedly beautiful beaches.", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cJeckle and Hyde of a Resort\u201d", "Author": "VillageKitchen", "ReviewID": "UR22916355", "Content": "OK here's the real deal.

I will start out with the good; The resorts grounds are actually very beautiful and well kept. The pool and beach area are also very nice. Some people didn't like the sea wall thing but did not bother us at all. It was nice to take long walks on the beach. Plenty of beach chairs a palapas. The staff was fantastic!!!

Very few americans and I think half of Canada was there. Hey Rick and Linda!!! We had a ball!!! People were very friendly. We did not have any problems with our room, the only thing is that there are not any bath tubs in the rooms so that threw off my wife a little bit, but she adjusted. Our maid was great and would leave us towel animals which was nice. Be sure to leave a little something for them too. Now the bad: Yes check in took a while but we got in after half of Canada arrived so this was understandable. Our room was fine and clean, where others we talked too had the sewer gas smell, no hot water, or low pressure issues that other had. One of the biggest problems for this resort is the sewer smell. There is an area about halfway up the sidewalk to the lobby where there is a constant sewer smell. The smell along with a damp musty smell is also in the Disco. We tried to go but couldn't handle the smell. The food was average at best. Not too much to choose from off the buffet and not much variety at the snack bar. We survived our week but definately did not put on weight that week. Would be go back??? We would have to think long and hard on that one, would have to be a relly cheap deal to get us back.

Yes, the basement has a \"smell\" and the disco is either hot or cold... but if you bring some friends down there, the music is great and you can enjoy yourself pretty quickly. I think your vacation becomes what you make of it and if you remember that you're in a foreign country where things aren't always up to your home standards you can still have an amazing time. For the price, it was entirely worth it... and then some! Now for my thoughts; the Entertainment staff are amazing. A special mention to Jame, George, Alex and Jerry for making us feel extra welcome and special. They spend their entire day making sure that you are comfortable and entertained. And then they spend the evening helping out with the shows and taking groups to the clubs in Playa or Cancun at night. These guys are awesome and tons of fun to be around. The bartenders always have smiles on their faces and if you tip a little, you'll find that your drinks come much quicker and much more potent! The service in the restaurants was excellent; in the buffet the service at dinner was the best. At breakfast you may have to wait a bit for coffee but you can always get up and get it yourself. Overall we had an awesome vacation! It's a small enough resort that you get to know everyone really well and as long as you have a smile on your face, you'll meet a ton of great people!! I have been to the Mayan 5 times in the last 7 years and this was by far the greatest service that I've had. Aside from the cloudy weather it was a blast and the staff was what made the difference. I highly recommend it.

The hotel is very small, but nicely landscaped and clean. This all-inclusive hotel does not come close to others as far as what they offered. Check in - This was horrible. We waited in a line for almost 1 hour to be told we were in the wrong line. They don't have anything marked as far as which line is which. I told them I've been waiting a hour to check in and that I'm not going to go to the back of one of the other lines, so they did hesitantly check us in. They told us the room would not be ready until 3:00 pm. When we came back at 3:00 pm, we had to wait another hour in line. We didn't get to our room until after 4:00 pm. Rooms - Large room with plenty of places to put your clothes. There is a mini refridgerator that they stock daily with water. They also had a safe in the room that you had to pay $2 a day for. All the other hotels I've stayed at would stock the fridge with soda, beer and water and the safe was include. They are cheap that way. The refridgerator only worked at night time when all the lights in the resort would come on. We called them each day to come and fix it, before we figured it out on our own. Nobody ever came to fix it either probably because they knew that it wouldn't come on until the lights did and they couldn't fix it anyway. I don't know if that is how all the rooms are or if it was just ours. Beach - There is no beach. There is a nice area in the sand where there are plenty of palapa's to sit under. We found one everyday with out a problem. There is a wall that is built to protect their property from hurricanes. This wall is about 6 feet tall and runs almost the whole length of the property. There is a small area on each side of the property which you can access the ocean. This is the first trip I have been on and did not go in the ocean. It literally looks like lake Michigan. It's a brown-black color with lots of muck washing in. We walked about 1/2 hour in each direction of the hotel and there was no turquoise water to be seen. We have stayed at hotels both North and South of this hotel and had beautiful blue green waters. For some reason, this big stretch of ocean in this area is brown. Be careful if you do venture into the ocean, we saw broken glass and metal bars \"rebar\" used to support concrete structures in the sand next to the wall. They are rebuilding their pier which was taken out by the last hurricane. All day long they were hammering on the pier and it was a horrible loud sound of metal hitting metal echoing off the resorts buildings. There was no way to relax or try to catch a nap with all the noise. They look like they are almost half done with it, but who knows how long it took them to rebuild what they have done. Food - Very limited selection to choose from. We did not eat at any of the specialty restaurants so I can't give you any feedback on them. The buffet selection was very small and limited compared to other places I've stayed. The snack bar by the pool had hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, nachos, salsa, salad fixings and two other warm dishes such as stew or chicken. It was mostly the same thing every day. The food was good for the most part, but tasted a little different because you're in Mexico. They also put out a small buffet next to the lobby bar at around 11:00 pm with bread, ham, pasta salad and mayo to make a sandwich before going back to your room. The food does get old after a week like everyone else had commented. Neither of us got sick. Bars - There are only 2 bars. The lobby bar and pool bar. Bring your own mug with you. The cups they provide are tiny. They need more bartenders. We had to wait forever to get a drink. The lobby bar is only open until 11:30 pm. There is a disco located under the buffet restaurant in the basement. Check it out, I bet you'll come right back upstairs. I smells horrible down there and is cold and musty. It smells like the toilets overflowed down there. All in all, it was a nice resort, but I would never return after being to 5 other resorts in the Riviera Maya that were way nicer.

It was shoulder season so it wasn't too crowded. The room was spacious and clean, although there was a weird musty smell but apparently its common in the Mayan Riviera. We got used to it pretty quickly. We found that tipping the maid got us a mopped floor each day which took the musty smell down alot, and guaranteed fresh water bottles in the fridge. You have to actually hand the tip to the maid. The pool bar was great, Manuel is the best, he's so sweet and is totally open to helping you with your espanol. The lobby bar is nice too, but we spent most of our time outdoors. Drinks were weak but its cuz Mexican booze is less than 40%, so we would just tip the bartender when we arrived at the bar and tell him mucho fuete por favor todos !! Bad spanish but the drinks were nice and strong after that. The entertainment team was amazing, their energy and talent is out of this world. They encourage everyone to participate in games and dancing, but they let you off the hook if you don't want to. We met a bunch of great people and had a total blast one night at the disco. The DJ is great, he reads the vibe of the crowd and spins accordingly. The food was good overall and lots of variety so, no complaints there. One thing that sucked is that they say they have continental breakfast available before 7am, and the morning we had to be in the lobby for 7am pickup for a tour, there was only a couple bananas so we pretty much starved until the tour lunch. A couple pointers, cigarettes are 20 pesos at the bar but only 1 brand, and 30 pesos in the gift shop but more brands. Tipping is great but if you overtip you come off like a flashy tourist. 50 pesos after a night at the bar is more than enough. Its only $ 5 CDN but consider that a pack of smokes is 20 pesos which costs $ 10 in Canada. If you go into Playa del Carmen, watch out for the tour guide kiosks because they are actually time share vultures in disguise. They will rope you in. We were warned ahead and are pretty savvy folks but we wasted 45 minutes before escaping. Also, the hawkers totally put us off, so much that we didn't even buy anything.

First of all the resort was very clean, well kept, and felt extremely safe. Lots of security and to get in there was gates with gaurds. Everyone spoke great english and was always smiling. We had great luck with the pool tender, Hector who was hillarious and Manuel, Gilberto and Maria I bleive were all top notch bartenders.. they were all great but these ones stuck out. One bartebder was even serving up a little flare. I found a lot of the travellers obnoxious and rude when it came to being served both drinks and food. Maybe I am too nice but many people would shove, push and give dirty looks to cut in front of lines, and then use the \" I don't understand \" line when confronted. It definately turned me off, not of the resort but of people. My one major complaint was the A la carte reservation system. It was impossible to make a reservation because you can oly book one day in advance, and many people didn't bother to show up to their reservations, but failed to cancel. We tried to get into the japenese three times but were told it was too full, while there was more than half the seats empty. we waited one morning for 35 minutes in line to get a reservation, but the line didnt move and we had a tour bus to catch, it should be more simple than it was. The maids did a great job, and witha few dollars tip here and there you get a lot more service, ie towels formed as swans, extra waters etc... Like I said the bartenders were great, and altough it says gratuities included, you have to remember these guys make $5 US per day, so if you tip, obviously your service will be better same goes for anywhere in the world, why would i bend over backwards for somebody for free if somebody beside them will give me $5... it is common sense, service industries bank on tips. the out door sports and activities team was great... we got in with them, so pretty much if we wanted to play a certain game or sport they were all for it. Also compared to other places i have been, these guys would take no for an answer and respect if you just wanted to relax, which is great. the buffet was plentiful, but like any buffet by day 7 it was getting to me. You always had great selection, with lots of beef chicken pork and nachos The burger bar was also good, but only a few things to choose from like hot dogs hamburgers, nachos fries a few salads and a bit of fruit, but it served its purpose.

After going through the time-share gauntlet at the airport (Just say no-thank you!), we found our ride to the hotel and made the trip with no problems. Arriving at our hotel, we had no problems checking in, possibly as we were the only guests checking in at that time... The girl at the front desk was very friendly and helpful.(ask for your safe lock up front if they forget, we always get one, it does not cost much). We arrived around 1pm I believe but our room was ready and were escourted right to our room. The room was very clean, up on the second floor with a nice view of the ocean, not a direct view but you could still see it! There were 4 bottles of water in the frig and they replaced what you used. There were places at the bars by the pool, by the pop machines and in the lobby to get fresh water whenever you needed it. If you want to refill you bottles there you can if you need more. The grounds and gardens are beautiful. The air conditioning and cable tv worked fine, we needed the air as it got quite hot and humid a few days while we were there. We never saw anything but a small mosquito in our room. We were entertained every morning walking to breakfast by a colony of blue crabs that were always out of their holes hanging out in a grove of bushs by our room. We did see a few iguana's, the one in my picture was hanging out by the waterfall up near the lobby. We saw a snake crossing the sidewalk one time up there also, a big black one but he didn't bother us. There was something in the garbage can one evening coming back, looked like a big fat cat or some type of racoon sized critter, made a mess but didn't bother us. There were a lot of mosquito's on a few of the evenings we were there, bring spray. There was always a chair in the shade on the beach, wish they had more shaded area's near the pool, it was just too hot to sit up there in the sun for very long. The beach was always clean and the entertainment crew worked from morning to night, giving you the choice to join games if you were interested and working hard at night to keep you involved and entertained. Alex and the others were always on the beach asking if you wanted to do yoga, play a game etc. , at the pool doing bingo or games, or dancing on the stage in one of their productions. We have been to many of these type of resorts and they all seem to follow some sort of \"All Inclusive Resort Entertainment Guidebook\" for the games and shows with a few variations so we knew what was coming most nights. They did a good job though and some were very talented. They did have good live music a few nights, I always like that. There were not many Americans there when we were there but the place was pretty empty overall. We had no problem getting a drink when we wanted one,(the lobby bar was the best), the food was good, lots of choices. They really tried to make your dinner special, doing special coffees, one night I had a flaming desert prepared in front of me, etc. A few things that could have been improved; - the only place that had airconditioning to eat was the Yokoso, the Japanese place. They could not keep the doors open on the dining area or they would have been polluted with mosqitoes. It would have been nice to have an air-conditioned place to sit and have a drink or eat besides your room. There was a breeze outside the lobby where they did some of the entertainment but you had the mosquitoes to deal with then some nights. The entertainment area where they did the shows was air conditioned anyway. -There were only choices each night of the buffet and one specialty restaurant that night. We were only there for 4 nights so no problem but if you liked something you had to wait for 3 or 4 nights to go again. Would have been nice to have some background music at the specialty restaurants also. Pork chops were tough but we have learned to stick to the chicken or fish most times and they never seem to do steaks and chops right at these type of places. -They did come on the beach to serve drinks one day while we were there but not every day. Not really a problem for us but they should be consistant if they offer something. -We had a problem with Best Day, the rep was never in the lobby to set up our time to leave and we spent to much time waiting around for him to show up. The lobby staff did help us by calling the company to set up our transportation but it was annoying to hear he was supposed to be there and never was. -Other than that, we lucked out with nice weather, a few showers was all, had no real problems and were able to relax and unwind. We did go to Playa Del Carmen one day for a few hours but it was so hot I wish we had stayed on the beach. Probably going in the evening would have been more fun, you just have to find your own transportation them. Our driver took us through some very poor areas on the way there, makes you appreciate what you have. We tipped some, a few dollars to the maid, the bellboy, etc. They did a wonderful job and we appreciated it.

He said we better book some excursion off-site because there would be any air conditioning in the rooms. WHAT?

We stayed for 10 days and whilst the hotel was adequate we were all ready to return home, which is unusual for us. I was disappointed with the amenities considering the star rating and the cost. Whilst it was clean and reasonably well decorated it was not particularly comfortable. For example the 3rd bed was a settee, not a bed settee simply a chair big enough to lie on (but not if you are particularly tall). My daughter 16, son 14 and I ended up sharing a bed (all be it large) for the duration. In addition although we told them a number of times the cleaning staff only ever brought enough towells and toiletries for two. Another issue for me involved the amount of mosquitos in the room when we arrived, it took us most of the week and a lot of money in plug in gadgets to get rid of them. The bathroom was again adequate but by no means comfortable, small, dark and just a shower. My partners room had problems with both the TV and the air conditioning neither of which were fixed satisfactorily. To be fair the food in the main hotel dinning room was very good indeed, plenty of variety, good quality and fresh. In addition the service was excellent. There are some speciality restaurants in the hotel also and I cannot recommend highly enough the Japenese one however the mediterean restaurant on the beach was very poor. The entertainment programme was very Butlin like, and whilst I dont wish to knock the good old British Butlin holiday, I did expect more. Most evenings we had to play cards and were in bed for 10, (you can imagine the 16 year olds were none to happy!). The entertainment teams put on dance shows or musicals where they mimed to the music but once you had seen one you had seen them all. In my opinion it could have been vastly improved even by opening the pool or a beach bar in the evening, then people could take advantage of the beautiful surroundings. One evening the had live music by a traditional Mexican group which was pleasant and provided a variation but that was just once throughout the 10 day stay. The day time activities were a little better and the beach offered windsurfing, scuba driving, Kayaks and jet ski which I thought was a reasonable selection which we took advantage of. In conclusion my advice would be to think carefully about this one, particularly if you have teenage children. Pleasant enough for a quiet relaxing break but wouldnt wish to return. Hope this is useful to fellow travellors.

It was ok, but NOT the 5 star they claim it to be, so please please do not go expecting a 5 star. I read almost every review on here before we left, so I knew what to expect. The reviews said that place was pretty crappy- and it was for the most part- so there was no disappointment. Check In- Slow, inefficient and unfriendly. Just as expected. These people could give a crap less that you want to check in to your room. They actually gave one couple in our party a room that was already occupied and they walked in on another couple in the room. Talk about an unpleasant surprise! It sounds like that happens often though. Rooms- Comparable to a Sleep Inn or a 2- 2.5 star American motel. The beds are rock hard (to be expected) and they do only leave you one towel. TG I was alone. I'm not into sharing towels. The air worked fine and I didn't see any lizards, etc. There was one nasty looking spider I saw one evening, but it disappeared. Probably into my suitcase. Lol. Restaurants- Think free promotional buffet. Everything was fried. The specialty restaurants were so-so. Japanese- get a hibachi table! The food was ok. Mexican- they take food from the main buffet and bring it out to the mexican restaurant. Italian- Don't bother going to this one- Gross! The main buffet had breakfast in the morning which was.... ok I guess. They would put the same food out over and over and combine weird things like yesterday's hot dogs with scrambled eggs. You can ask for fried eggs or omlettes. This will probably be your best bet. Mexican Night- They had Mexican food at the buffet and vendors come in. The vendors are expensive. Playa del Carmen 5th Ave is cheaper. It also costs about $15 in cab fare to get there though, so do the math for what special things you are seeking out. There was a mariachi band with horns and guitars and singers, etc, Plus an old guy that sang \"La Cucaracha\" and dry humped his guitar. Kind of on the weird side. Beach- This was the best part of the resort, by far. There were plenty of chairs and palapas. Watch your towel though. One of the people in my group got their towel stolen and the security guard told him to essentially go and steal someone else's. The water was pretty and the breeze was nice. Yes, there is the broken down decrepid pier, but I tried not to look at it. There were a lot of really red people on the beach, so make sure to bring plenty of sunscreen! I went through 2 aerosol bottles in 5 days. In conclusion, this place was ok. I wouldn't PAY to go back there, but it wasn't terribly awful either.

It's little things; for example there was just one towel issued per day per person- not that anyone is going to get hot water consistently or want to shower more than once a day. The floors are tiled which is great for maintenance, but there was no door mat to shake off the sand so.. - you guessed it, the floors stayed gritty all the time. How about only one very small trash can? Even cheap hotels furnish a trash can for the bath and another for the room? Stationery to write on wasn't to be found and if they had WI_FI for your laptop, well it wasn't advertised. Food...slightly above average.

In the end though, this hotel was far from its 5 star rating, and we were left dissapointed with the resort. On arrival, we checked in only to find that the airport driver left one of the bags in the van. 5 minutes into the holiday, we were one bag short. Great start! After the mini debarcle, and numerous phone calls to chase the driver and to get our bags returned asap, we thought we were heading to our room to get a much needed nap. How wrong we were. After 11 hours in a chartered flight, the last thing we wanted is for one of the reps to give us the old smooth talking business to get us to visit their main resort further down in the riviera maya the following morning. With us having said we were not to go if this was another one of those time share vacation club things, he lied to us and said to us it wasn't when actually it was. So 30 mins into our holiday and it was off to a not very good start. And things wernt to get better. As we ordered a family twin room, we thought we would get the five star treatment that we experienced last year. Instead we were put into B building or what i like to call B-block, as it reminded me very much of prison quarters. My parents room stank of a nasty odour, the amount of ants crawling in the room was unacceptable. And having walked past the haciendas, and seeing families live there, why we got the short end of the starw, I do not know. Anyway a day later we moved to a beach front hacienda, which was much nicer and was what we expected from a good hotel. However a week later my parents had to change room again to the numerous glitches with the AC, with the service men coming at either 10pm or 8am to try and fix it, which was ridiculous. Enough about the rooms, lets go onto the food. The brochure indicated there was a steak house. Well we certainly couldn't find it nor could the rest of the guests. Instead we found a place which gave us food available at the snack bar, and was of undoubtedly poor quality. Hence half way through, we walked out and went straight to the buffet. Halfway through the first week we went to the japanese and that was a disaster. We decided to go for the a-la- carte menu and it turned out to be a disater for us and fellow diners. None of us recieved the soup on the menu we asked for and the main dishes took over an hour to arrive. This was certainly not 5 star treatment let alone 3 star. The snack bar was average/poor with the same old stuff being produced on mass. The buffet was not bad though. However after 2 weeks we got bored of it after having breakfast lunch and dinner there. The waiters however we grumpy and not freindly apart from Juan who was a real gentleman. The other waiters should take note. With me being 20 and my brother 18, we needed stuff to do and to keep us active and entertained. Being a keen gym go-er, the state of the gym was disguisting for a 5 star resort and the tennis courts had numerous pot-holes and bumps, and were certainly not fit for playing. However the entertainment team made the holiday really fun for us, and we got on so well with them that my brother was asked to do the shows. Special mentions for JP, Franco, Alvaro and Sabrina for making the stay much better. They did a sterling job and worked very very long hours to keep the activities going. Even though the same activities came every other day, me and my brother thoroughly enjoyed our time with them and they are great bunch of people and deserve a massive pat on the back. If families were to go with children our age, they did organise trips to cancun and playa del carmen at night which were extremely good and certainly produced a bundle of laughs. During the night mosquitoes are everywhere around the lobby area so be prepared to get bitten, but also be prepared to get very hot, as there was no Ac in the lobby, buffet restaurant nor the theatre. The swimming pools are nice and the beach got better as the stay progressed, so much so that by the end, the sea was the nice turquoise colour we came to expect, and numerous tropical fish were seen swimming round our feet clearly. All in all this resort was a far cry from what we experienced last year. Everything about it was not 5 star and compared to the grand bahia principe, this resort does not compare. However, with all that has been said, the entertainment team were amazing, and they made the trip worthwhile in one sense.

When a place of business continuously changes its name, it puts me in mind of those infamous signs you see at restaurants, \u201cunder new management\u201d.

In any case, once we arrived at H10, we checked in rather quickly. There was no tour of the resort, which would have been nice. The resort itself is very well maintained. The H10 has a beautiful marble lobby, huge columns, lovely artwork\u2026and aloof staff\u2026not so good\u2026it takes forever to get help with the simplest tasks. The grounds are fantastic and wonderfully kept up, looks great especially at night\u2026as long as you don\u2019t mind massive amounts of mosquitoes, you are gonna love it. It is really cool that the lizards and crabs are all about on the grounds. They are harmless and pretty neat to look at. The pool area is very nice, and the snack bar has pretty good food. The pool bar\u2026hmm\u2026the drinks are good, they are not watered down\u2026and many times they comes with a surprise in the form of bee bits. Occasionally a bee would fall into the blender and viola\u2026extra protein in your drink. The lobby bar is s-l-o-w, and it closes at midnight? Midnight? The food at the buffet is \u2018meh\u2019 at best. Other than swimming and drinking there is really nothing else to do. When we where there the disco was closed the entire time, there are no pool tables or anything. The rooms are really nice, very comfortable beds, good AC, nice furniture, big(ish) closet; the safe is extra, as usual. The shows are\u2026resort shows, young attractive people dancing badly in skimpy costumes\u2026it beats t.v. Now for the beach (queue ominous music) it is horrible, it sucks, really bad. The main reason I go to Mexico is the water, which is funny since everyone says, \u201cOh don\u2019t drink the water\u201d which is a total wives tale, you won\u2019t get sick off the drinking water, it just tastes like cr@p. Anyway that lovely beach ocean water is brown and nasty, and disgusting, and their beach is super eroded. They need to sandbag further out so the beach rebuilds itself; but they can\u2019t even rebuild the dock (from what I can tell it has been in disrepair for 2 years now.) The beach was so bad that I followed the advice of someone else on here and went walkabout northward, where I had heard there was a pristine stretch of beach (actually it is an Estuary, meaning a fresh water river meeting the sea) I was super stoked. After walking about 20 minutes I came upon a construction site and right past it, there was the Estuary. It was stunning. There where fish at least 3 feet long, big ones. Deep super cool, super clear water, it was great. So I went back and got everyone in my group and we went back up. Now mind you the walking was a bit rough. I did fall in quicksand (I am not kidding) up to my nether regions. We finally got to the Estuary and everyone freaked that it was sooooo awesome, well worth the walk. We started swimming and after about 15 minutes a guy from the construction site came by and started speaking to us in Spanish (imagine that, Spanish in Mexico of all places) well he spoke no English at all, and some have said I speak broken Spanish, other have said my Spanish is totaled. Anyway, I got that he didn\u2019t want us there and that his boss wanted us to leave. Well I do know that in Mexico, you can\u2019t own the beach area, nor the water, so I said \u2018aqua es libre\u2019 or water is free. And that I didn\u2019t understand him. So we swam some more and then his non-English speaking boss came and said he wanted us to leave. And I said, \u2018el agua est\u00e1 libre, usted no puede hacernos licencia\u2019 only not that grammatically correct\u2026I said again, \u2018the water is free and you can\u2019t make us leave.\u2019 He replied, \u201cs\u00ed pero los malos animales le har\u00e1 muerto\u201d or \u2018yes, but the bad animals will make you dead.\u2019 And then proceeded to take his hands and make teeth with his fingers and bit me on the leg with them\u2026it was weird\u2026like in a bad place weird. Anyway, I said \u2018\u00bfnombre los animales?\u2019 Or name the animals?

H10 falsely advertises this hotel as a 4-star facility, a rating which is completely and utterly misleading! At most, Ocean Maya should be considered 2-stars. Upon arrival, one is immediately struck by a lack of guests, a feeling which may be characterized as finding oneself in an abandoned hotel. And for good reason. First and foremost, there is no beach at this resort. I repeat, no beach. There is a concrete slab with some sand and beach chairs but no stretch of sand or ocean in which to swim in. If one is to travel hours by plane from America or even Europe for a beach experience then please do not bother. The water that is in fact visible is blocked off by sand bags and is filled with seaweed. In fact, it was quite humorous that we were given ocean view rooms because we could not actually see the ocean. With regards to the rooms \u2013 again, there is no way they should be considered 4-stars. We were not provided with enough towels for our guests, there was mold on the shower head, there was no shower mat in the bathroom and someone from our party slipped and fell. Moreover, the sheets were stained. We were a group of 11 people with 4 different rooms to make these observations from and all displayed the above characteristics. Yes, Ocean Maya claims to have recently renovated but to no avail. So having no beach to relax on, one is left to the pool area. However, the pool has no chlorine, which is absolutely unsanitary. If you value your health you would not swim in this pool. The dining experience was furthermore atrocious. The dining room smelled of sulfur to the point were one is left nauseous and with a loss of appetite. It follows that the quality of food was also very, very low. Our group was left hungry because we could not bring ourselves to eat this food. Refrigeration was minimal, leaving dairy products warm and unappetizing. For an all-inclusive, the choice of alcohol was also probably the cheapest one could have selected. The resort is after all in Mexico but they did not even have Jose Cuervo tequila. The tequila they offered was displayed in an unnamed plastic container. Needless to say, the staff was unhelpful and slow, adding to an overall horrible experience. Asking for water bottles was met every time with resistance because were provided with all of 4 water bottles per room per day. Basically, if you are going to pay for an all-inclusive beach experience then you should get what you paid for. False advertising is wrong and Ocean Maya deceives its customers who pay for a beach resort and quality service and receive non of the above.

My first impressions of the hotel were that it looked very clean and very nicely maintained. The hotel was renovated in 2006 and it does look new. The landscaping of the hotel was wonderful all around and the people at the hotel work very hard to keep the hotel clean and beautiful. As soon as we checked in, we were offered refreshing drinks which was nice because it was a really hot day. The hotel is made up of about 30 small buildings which are in between the large lobby building and the beach. Each building has eight rooms, four on each floor. The buildings look very nice and each room had either a balcony or a terrace if you were on the first floor. Beach was great. The sand is yellow and small compared to maybe Varadero or Dominican Republic so it sinks in a little more in certain places in the water. There are no rocks or sea weed, very pleasant to swim in. There is one gigantic rock in the water in the deeper area of the water where you can use it to jump off, very safe and fun. The entertainment team is one of the best I have ever seen from all the hotels that i have been to. They are very energetic, enthusiastic and outgoing. They organize games all day long and there are usually two or three activities that go on at once. They are easy to talk to and very nice. If you like music, it is playing all day by the pool and at the beach. Keeps it fun and entertaining. Never a boring day. The food was good, the main buffet has certain nights where they have a special night like Mexican Night which is great and Tex-Mex as well as Oriental. Lots of food to choose from and you can always find three or four good things to each. The grill is always on and the fish is really good. You have garlic mash potatoes, roasted potatoes, French fries, salads, soups (really good creme soups), deserts. A la carte restaurants were a little weird because you do not make reservations to go, first time in eight years that I experienced that. So instead of booking your dinner time you just go. Sometimes the bad thing is that you might have to wait for a bit if the restaurant is busy. Overall food was solid. The hotel staff is very nice, always say hi and smile. The guy that cleaned our room was very nice and always said a few words. Did a great job taking care of the room. Bartenders were nice, made great Congas (non-alcoholic drink) and Mojitos. Service was really good. Finally if you want to experience so excursions, bring lots of money. It costs a fair amount but it is worth it. Ruins in Tulum, Chichen Itza and so on. You can rent See-Doo's on the beach for about $50 US for 30 min, very fun and Parasailing for $ 55 US per person for about 15 min. This is a once in a lifetime thing if you have not done it before, well worth the money. There is a lot to do, just bring the money. If you want to party in Cancun, its about $ 65 US for transportation there to the club and back, you ticket into the club with open bar bracelet. Well worth it. You just need enough people that night to go in order to fill in the large van of about 8 or 10. Coco Bongo, Bulldogs, Daddy Rock, Daady O and so on.

Shopping in Playa del Carmen was a good time, lots to see.The biggest disapointment of the entire trip was the \"tour\" we paid for. Rudy sold us a tour that would allow us to go parasailing, snorkeling, swimming witha shark, sail over to Cozumel do some shopping and have dinner there. They told us right off the bat it was to windy to go snorkeling, so we sailed over to Cozumel on a small crowded boat. By the time we got there half the people were drunk, we ate and did a bit of shopping, we passed by the \"shark\" that one person \"swam\" with. (Not what we had in mind when they said shark). Then we sailed back much too slowly, as the \"captain\" pushed alcohol on people nobody said a word about parasailing. The next day we went to talk to Rudy about the \"tour\" and he didn't know what to do. We didn't want for this to ruin our trip so we tried to forget it. The rest of our stay was still very good we met lots of people and got to know some of the staff. Our flight home was delayed for twelve hour so we got bused to another resort, and it was a bigger fancier place but it didn't really feel like Mexico it felt more like a large city and more like a hotel setting with lots of noise traveling through the hallways.

This resort exceeded our expectations in every way! Our check - in was easy and without mistakes. We found the room to be perfectly clean, maintained, and comfortable. The \"haciendas\", which house 8 rooms each were very nice,and ours was close to the beach and pool area. We found the walk to the main lobby through the beautiful grounds to be very enjoyable. The buffet for breakfast, particularily, was much nicer than we expected. We made dinner reservations for our group on the first day to each of the other restaurants and we enjoyed them all. Our favorite had to be the Japanese. The entertainment staff are remarkable, hard working and really go out of their way to show you a good time. ( we loved Ana from day one) The bartenders were fabulouse!! Applause to Gilberto and Jose, who learn right away what you drink, and prepare it anyway you wish, and always serve with a smile from sun-up to sun-down . We made friends with Rudy right away, and he helped arrange for us 2 excursions. He is extremely accomodatiing and helpful, as well as the rest of the activities staff. The beach has sustained some damage from the past hurricanes, but for the most part, very easy to walk down and swim in. you can take the watercraft right from the resort beachfront without any trouble. We never had any problems getting beach chairs for our whole group by 10:00 or 11:00 am, and there was always good snacks available all day at the pool area restaurant. We felt completely comfortable and relaxed at the H10. If you want to join in the activities you can, or just hang out on the beach or the pool. If you want a lively night-life, this is not really the resort for that. There were party buses which departed from the hotel lobbly late at night to go into Play del Carmen or Cancun for those who wanted to see the night life.

The hotel check in was fairly quick for us. I did hear some people complaining about the time it took to get their rooms or have them switched due to improper accomodations. We thought all was well until we reached our room only to find one king size bed. My 14 year old son would have no part of that, so we went back to the lobby. Here we go, I thought! In passing I noticed a rep from RCI at a table, and asked him to intervene for me. Since I booked with this company, I felt it was to our advantage to use his services. He explained the room wouldn't do for a family of four(duh)! We were immediately given a room with two double beds. I have to wonder though if we would have not have had more waiting time had he not spoken on our behalf. I don't get why hotels can't assign proper rooms from the get-go! It's not rocket-science, especially when you have computers. The grounds were emaculate, the rooms quite clean and the house-keeping was good. All the waiters and bar tenders were great, especially Jose, who had my order down after only a few trips to the bar! These people really deserve their tips! If you are afraid to speak up at the bar, you may have to wait a bit, though. There were always lots of places to sit around the pool and the beach area. I just read a previous review with regard to the iguanas being everywhere...hey, this is their home! They certainly didn't bother anyone, in fact I wish they would have come up to me, I tried to make contact...no such luck!

We're in our late 50's and though there were all ages at the H10, including children and young adults on spring break, we had no problems whatsoever. It's very international we found - as Americans we were in the minority. Even with that, there really was no problem with language. The buffet for all meals was plentiful - we were there 5 days and did not find it boring - lots of different food for whatever your tastes. One of the best things I read on this website was to bring a coffee pot if you want to have coffee while getting ready in the morning. There is no coffee pot in the room (maybe my ONLY complaint), and it's a bit of a walk to the main building. I brought my small coffee pot so no withdrawal for me!

No fancy decorations with the towles (friends we met there had something different each day). entertainment: mostly enjoyable tours: snorkling was great although our day out was rather windy, but fun just the same beach: not entirely what I expected. I had wanted to go snorkling each day, but had to walk away from our resort to find water nice enough shuttle and ala cart restaurants: this was a pain as each morning (early) we had to stand in line to book for the following evening and with the shuttle we had to wait constantly as the same guy who took the reservateions for the shuttle, also was booking tours and the lineups were long and tiresome. I did not enjoy wasting time each morning of my vacation standing in line to book a shuttle or restaurant. I stand in enough lines at home every day.

It was more the hotel staff than anything else. They run the place trying to trap you there so they can squeeze every dime out of you. Everywhere you look, overpriced tours, overpriced souvenirs, staff looking for a tip(or bribe). All the staff tells you, \"Buy your tours at the hotel or you'll get ripped off, Change you money at the hotel or you'll get mugged, don't take the public buses or you'll get kidnapped\". And then they supply those same services at overly inflated prices and with poorer quality customer service. The hotels tell you the locals will rip you off and the locals tell you the hotels are ripping you off. Who's right? The Mayan Riveria is almost completely reliant on tourism, any complaints from a tourist about the public transportation system or public safety system is taken VERY seriously. They want to maintain a good image as a tourist destination so the government goes to great lengths to ensure the tourists are safe and don't get mugged. They still have laws and if you get drunk and act like an ass, and run a car into a building you're going to get in trouble. But if you are smart and keep your wits about you you'll be fine. Besides trying to continually rip me off, the hotel had so few beach chairs, you had to get up at 6 AM to reserve one. I got food poisoning off one of the restaurants, the salon was a joke(they tried to shave me with a used disposable razor), the nightly entertainment was pathetic, the disco was almost always empty, and the \"free\" windsurfing/sailing lessons had so many rules that you had to bribe the staff if you wanted a lesson before your flight home. I tried every single day I was there to sign up for a free lesson and everyday they gave me an excuse why they had to cancel my lesson. I was polite and respectful to them every single day (except the last day) but I refused to bribe them. And all souvenirs are initially overpriced(even outside the hotel), you have to bargain to get a good price. The same stuff is available outside the hotel but the vendors are much more willing to bargain than the hotel staff. By the end of my trip I was ready to start taking swings at the staff. If you want to get pissed out of your tree and act like a total jerk, which most guests did, then I suggest you stay at the hotel. But if you want to experience the real mexico(at least as much as you can in the area), stay in a condo in playa.

We pretty much experienced what was noted in previous reviews. The property is emmaculate. The staff very hardworking. Contrary to other reviews, I found the nightly entertainment to be fun and very interactive. The pools were very clean and the music not too loud. The main pool has the music and poolside entertainment, if it bothered you, you could walk 20 feet and get into the bar pool where it was quieter with less kids. As for the beach, yes it was silty, but all you had to do is walk out 10 feet and it was clear. I didn't encounter a problem with seaweed or rocks. H10 does have a retaining wall on their beach, and if they didn't they wouldn't have a beach at all. The resorts on either side of us gave up alot of their green grounds and landscaping just to add to their beach, so I'm not complaining. We were in building 8 and did not have \"the smell\". I would say it is strongest around 3-5, I would avoid those if possible. Go past those buildings to the right you will see a large male iguana, and his harem of girls, he was a show all by himself. The food...well the coffee was great. The main dining room/buffet in my opinion was good as far as fruits, veggies, breads and soups. The meat on the other hand was lacking in variety and flavor. Please don't rib me either guys. I've stayed at other AI's in Mexico, Jamaica, and St.lucia, and the meat was by far the worst I have had. After the second day, I didn't eat the meat again. We ate at the Japanese rest. twice but couldn't get into the other two. You have to be in the lobby before 9:00a.m. to make the reservations for the next day, same with the shuttle. Lobby bar was fun if Nora was working. She won't say anything to you, but if you can get her to like you, she will be your friend for life. She was a hoot! She also gets upset if you don't use coasters, beware! Front desk staff speaks very little English, as you would expect so when we had any problems we spoke directly with Luis or Carolina direct, they are at the restaraunt reservations desk. They are awesome. Our room was nice. I don't understand why anyone says the rooms are outdated. I found them to be in line with any other Mexican AI. and we were not disappointed except the beds are hard, but that's me, I like my bed soft. Housekeeping did a great job and made sure we always had what we needed, extra pillows, water etc. Security...I had a lot of questions about that before going because I had to take my laptop. I left my laptop out the whole time, as well as my cell phone and had no problems at all. The only thing we locked up were the passports. We were never approached by outside vendors or others selling timeshares and the resort appeared to be pretty safe at night as well. If you are looking to party, this is not the place. This is a laid back, quiet, family resort. We spent most of our days in Playa trying different foods, bars and restaraunts.

We were there for two weeks. We are two couples that travel every year together and have been doing so for a few years. We've been to Costa Rica, Puerto Plata, Punta Cana, Mexico and a few cruises. We stayed at this resort back in 2004 when it was the El-Mandarin. I read every blog on this resort on this site before we left and I thoght that maybe it had changed dramatically since we were there in 2004. It had, it was better. I would recommend this resort to anyone of any age that wants to have a quiet, relaxing vacation. The staff at all areas work their tails off. I agree they are understaffed, but they work their butts off to make up for it. So you may have to get up and get your own drink or cup of coffee. Who cares, all your going to do is sit around and eat and drink all day anyway. The resort is even more beautiful than it was in 2004. We were initially given rooms up front by the main entrance when we arrived. We asked them if we could get a room with a view of the ocean and within a couple of days they moved both of us to an ocean view room. We had a smell in our room that was slightly unpleasant. We asked to have it looked at and by the next day they had taken care of the problem. The food was decent. After a couple of weeks it gets a little old, but there is enough variety that no one should ever go hungry. The water clarity in front of the resort and a couple to the north is a little dirty. I was told by some vacationers that it had to do with the sea grasses that grow in the area. Two resorts to the south and the water clears up and is that beautiful Caribbean green. The clarity of the water didnt stop anyone from swimming. We feed the Angel fish almost daily in front of the resort. The pools were both very nice, clean and quiet.

I know I don't work as hard as the Mexican staff do, it wouldn't hurt to drop a couple of bucks or pesos on them.

Unfortunately the patio door had no screen neither did the window.", "Date": "February 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cLoved It and Would Definitely Plan on Returning\u201d", "Author": "VancouverDeltagal", "ReviewID": "UR13176321", "Content": "This was our first time to the Mayan but not first time to a Mexican All Inclusive, so familiar with all\u2013inclusive resorts. I would rate this resort a definite 4 \u00bd star \u2013 if not more. My husband and our 2 daughters, Rachel 19 and Leigh 13 went to the resort from jan 23 \u2013 30th. I will break down my review into categories. RESORT: Grounds are absolutely beautiful at the Hacienda Maya \u2013 extremely clean and one of the nicest landscaped resorts I have been to. Beautiful!!! ROOMS: We had two rooms and no complaints for either room, air conditioners worked, tv worked, showers were great \u2013 always had hot water and plenty of pressure. Yes beds were hard but we like that. We had rooms 2203 & 2205. Maid service was excellent \u2013 although I would have liked to have more than just two towels, but we just went and got our own out of the maid\u2019s closet so we had two extra. She always left plenty of water and nice fresh flowers. Left towels made into a Teddy bear with flowers on our girls beds!! It was very cute. I defintely would not want to stay in the hotel portion of the resort though, like the individual buildings best. Yes we did get a sewer smell everyday around 6:00 pm but not too too bad at all. RESTAURANTS: The restaurants themselves are so so \u2013 the Japanese is the best \u2013 the Mexican was also good but the Argentina restaurant \u2013 was not so impressed with. What was bad about the whole restaurant experience is every day you need to go and get in line for 9:00 am to book a spot for the next day which is a pain, because if you are not in the front of the line up \u2013 good luck getting a decent time. I think you should be able to go up and book all three restaurants for one night each and then you are done. BUFFET: For an all inclusive \u2013 very good \u2013 and I require a special low in fat diet and had zero problems finding something to eat. Lot\u2019s of variety and truthfully we never really got sick of eating there. Loved the Quac & Salsa and chips at the beach restaurant, which also serves Hot Dogs and Hamburgers & Fries. STAFF: Front desk staff was very helpful \u2013 no problems \u2013 never had to wait very long at all, more than helpful, always had one that spoke english \u2013 no problems there. Yes if you arrive a bus tour you do have to wait in line \u2013 what do you expect when there are 30 people arriving at the same time; however, I think they should put on more staff for these times when everyone arrives. They give you a drink when you arrive and are standing in lineup. E NTERTAINMENT STAFF: EXCELLENT \u2013 especially Eloisa (she is a doll), Gabriel (the best), Angel and Leslie.Wished I would have gotten Eloisa & Gabriel\u2019s email address to send some pics to them and thank them again.! Thank you so much for making our trip so much more enjoyable. These people work very very hard and always have a smile and their face \u2013 they definitely make the resort!! H10 should be very very lucky to have these wonderful young hardworking people and I hope they pay them well cause without them our experience would not have been what it was. Loved the Kayaks, Catamarans, scuba lessons in the pool, horseshoe games and Volleyball!!!! Great Great Great!!! They also played pretty good music around the pool \u2013 not just mexican music which was nice for a change. SHOWS: : Some are great, Grease \u2013 Michael Jackson, Mexican night are very good!!! \u2013 some are so so - all are entertaining. The only thing about this is after the shows they move out to the outdoor area outside the lobby bar for dancing and there are just not enough tables and chairs out there \u2013 so nowhere to sit, yet they have room for many many more tables and chairs. Just could not understand this \u2013 they are trying to get everyone out there to dance yet nowhere for people to sit. Also no one goes to the Night Club and not too sure why that is. Perhaps they should dosome entertaining down there \u2013have Julio sing a song or two down there just to get the people in there, but again no where to sit in there and start off your evening. They could turn this into a great bar!!! Bars & Alcohol: Not so great \u2013 beer was always warm only cold on a few days \u2013 need to get ice. TAKE YOUR OWN GO CUP! They beer cups they use at the swim up bar are regular drink cups \u2013 so you are back there a ton \u2013 they need to use Beer Cups the larger ones. The lobby bar uses really really cheap alcohol and never enough of it. We however, bought our drinks using premium alcohol. This would be our only really complaint. BEACH: AWESOME!!! We spent every day at the beach rather than the pool. Just wish they would put umbrellas around the pool so if you wanted some shade you could get it and don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t have the small white little tables around on the beach and the pool area, it would be so much nicer to be able to put your drinks on something rather than the sand. The beach was great \u2013 plenty of beach \u2013 don\u2019t listen to those other reviews \u2013the beach was great. Take a bun out and feed the fish!!! You won\u2019t be disappointed. Yes there is one little area that is rocky but as soon as you get past that \u2013 and it is only about two feet wide \u2013 it is all nice and sandy. TOUR: Did the ATV Tour out of the resort $60.00 per person \u2013 Great and worth it for a half day tour!! OVERALL: Yes in the evenings certain areas of the resort did smell like sewer but it is Mexico and their sewer systems are not the best! Yes we heard of people who had plumbing problems in their room and took a really long time for maintenance to fix, but again \u2013 that is Mexico, could happen at any resort. Our experience was perfect \u2013 we had nothing go wrong. I will go back next year for certain and would recommend the resort to anyone. Met some great people there and miss being there!!! Loved It!

I researched this hotel and others before going and everything was exactly as people described. Read a few of the reviews and pay attention to things that are most important to you. Don't get too hung up on overly critical reviews. I was looking for an inexpensive way to visit Chichen Itza and other locations that was clean and convenient to areas I wanted to visit. I prefer a smaller and quieter hotel. This hotel met and exceeded my expectations in most cases. We were there from Jan 15-22, 2008. Best features of this hotel are outstanding grounds (beautiful landscaping), nice rooms and patios in a low density design (I had none of the room problems some reviewers had), beautiful pools and an excellent beach sand area. I have mixed opinions on the food and entertainment. The buffet was not that appetizing but I always found something to eat (excellent breads). The Mexican Restaurant was also kind of bland but the service and location was nicer (you can skip this one and not miss anything). The Japanese Teppanyaki was outstanding and I would have liked to go again to try the regular menu which was different. There is also a sushi menu (I don't like sushi) and others said it was not very good. The Argentenian Restaurant is open and there is no extra charge. I did not have time to go but others told me it was quite good (barbeque steak & chicken). The entertainment crew work very hard and some of it was quite good; some of it did not appeal to me. They are dancers and their best efforts are shows that allow them to dance (such as Latin dancing). Some shows like Grease are lip synced and seem a little too amateur. The Mexican show was really well done and involved an outside group with beautiful costumes and very authentic dances and games. There were live bands most nights in the lobby ranging from Mariachi to Jazz. For the size of the hotel it is pretty hard to expect much more than this. I think the entertainment would appeal to families with small children who would be more easily impressed. One show on the Movies was perhaps not suitable for young children (some adult themes). The ocean was rough the week we were there and did not seem as nice as in Playa del Carmen (more turbulent). We stuck to the pools (very nice) and walking the beach until we were exhausted. You can walk as far as you want for exercise. The beach area in front of the hotel is quite extensive and stays clean because of a cement wall. There are lots of Palapas. The hotel is understaffed so I can imagine they get overwhelmed at times. I usually got my own coffee or drinks in the buffet area (not a big deal). I have never seen bartenders who work so hard (I am not a big drinker but I wish I had tipped these guys because they deserve it!). I was amazed at how well they kept up even when it was busier. The service was adequate for my needs. The property is kept very clean. I did tip the maid everyday ($2 US) I did the usual tours that are popular: Chichen Itza (worth the bus trip), Playa del Carmen - Fifth Avenue (tourist trap IMHO - too many sellers competing for your attention), Tulum (beautiful) and Xcaret (don't miss this - there is something for everyone but plan ahead what you will do - there isn't time for everything in one day - the night show alone is worth the admission - basic admission is all you need and taxi is only $25 each way with tip). There are some things I learned that were not mentioned in previous reviews: (1) extra water is available from the front desk - the maid will keep your supply up if she sees you are using more than the usual two bottles per day (2) at least 50% of the guests are Canadian - announcements are in Spanish, English & French - very few Americans (3) Two Nolitours reps are there about a half day everyday - they gave a very good welcome presentation (Serge) and they can help with any tours you need (I prebooked most of mine not knowing that they are well represented) (4) Taxi is only $15 each way with tip to Playa del Carmen and is more convenient than the shuttle (afternoons only) (5) I wasted time inside the airport because I did not listen to other reviewers who said go through the terminal and outside to find the tour company rep for your transfer - in Mexico they will say anything (including lie) to get your attention and try and sell you a tour or a timeshare presentation (6) have compassion for the hard working Mexicans who are just trying to make a living - be polite and tip where appropriate - we saw great poverty on the way to Chichen Itza (7) you don't really need pesos - US dollars will do (8) there is an ATM machine in the lobby (dispenses pesos) (8) be prepared for TD - despite being careful my wife was quite sick for about six hours one evening and I felt some discomfort - Imodium, Cipro and Pepto Bismol were used when needed to keep this from ruining our vacation (we suspect it might have been the Mexican Restaurant but we can't be sure) (9) be prepared in case of wet weather - we did have some rain most days but mostly it was a few minutes and did not interfer a great deal - a cloudy day at Xcaret was perfect for seeing the park in cooler weather - it is hot when the sun comes out!

I had a great time there, i went with my whole family all-exlusive, we stayed for a week. At first i thought i wanted to go home by the end of the week but by then i just wanted to stay another week. The food was great i thought, and if you didnt want to eat at the buffet in the lobby then you could go down to the beach plus there was another resurant along the side of the lobby, i thought it was enough to choose from within a week. The beach was beutiful, and the water was great, my grandpa hates swimming and he stayed in the ocean for nearly an hour jumping waves with us. there was everything you needed right in the resort, a gift shop were you could buy smokes and anything else plus a place you could go on the internet and a lady would come out there every once in a while and make fresh cigars. The rooms were very cozy, and you would wake up early every day just because the sun would shine right into your room which isnt so bad since you wouldnt miss breakfast, it wasnt a far walk anywere i went, altho i did get confussed as to which trail i was sposed to fallow to the pool haha. and there was a theatre there so you could watch plays and listen to music and after whatever time there was a disco, its just like a dance for all the people staying there. i didnt see one person there that wasnt smiling. everyone was always happy and laughing and drinking and going to the beach. i had alot of stress on my mind when i was at home but while i was there none of them even mattered anymore it was a great first experience for me and am thinking of going there again someday i really enjoyed it and i consider saying that if you would want to go to mexico that would be the place to go, its only a half hour from cancun and like 5 min. from playa del carmon. i didnt even want to go do any activities becuz i was having such a good time at the resort. all in all it was a great trip and recomend this resort to anyone!! p.s i never really thought of mexico as a place i would like to go for a vacation but when i did im very glad that i took the chance because it changed my views.-moral of that, have an open mind and you will have a great time garentee.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful holiday\u201d", "Author": "canadiangal717", "ReviewID": "UR12905247", "Content": "After reading all the bad reviews of H10 Hacienda Maya, I was having some second thoughts about my resort choice, but they couldn't have been more wrong. We stayed here from Jan 8-16, 2008. First of all people, this is a Mexico, if you are the type of person who wants everything to be like home, then stay there. The hotel is beautiful, the lobby is very clean, and nicely decorated. We had great service at the front desk, it took us about ten minutes to check in and there was a tray of drinks brought to us as soon as we arrived. We arrived around 1:30 and were expecting to wait till 3:00 to get into our room, but it was it was ready so we had no wait. The rooms are located in bungalow type buildings, with eight rooms in each. It's really nice having your own entrance, and there is no problem with noisy hallways. Our room was clean and we had no problem with bugs. The AC only had one fan setting, but you could adjust the temp, so we were comfortable. We never once saw our maid, but she did a wonderful job of keeping our room cleaned, and our fridge stocked with water ( we never had less than five bottle per day, for two people). The pool area was nice and clean, but the water was a bit cold for me. The entertainment by the pool can be a bit loud, but if you choose a chair on the beach you can barely hear it. Service at the pool bar was slow at times, but I never waited more than 5 minutes for a drink ( most times it was only a minute or two).The swim up bar was slower, but there aren't many people at it, so i can understand why the bartenders don't really look over there as often. The lobby bar is always busy, but the service is very good. The coffee in the resturants is awful, but the lobby bar makes a decent cappiucino. The only thing i didn't like about the lobby was the smoking, but i live where there is no smoking allowed in public places, so i wasn't used to it. The buffet resturant was good, there was a nice selection, and each night was a different theme so it didn't get boring. Breakfast was the best, there was an omelet station, where you could get whatever you want made for you, and someone making fresh french toast and pancakes all the time. The juice was excellent and they had very nice fresh pastries. The wait staff, do an excellent job of keeping the tables clear, but it was sometimes easier to just get our own drinks, or bring drinks from the Lobby bar. The Mexican resturant was okay. The service was excellent, and the Tortilla soup is very good. Main course was a little bland , but fine. The Chocolate mouse, was pretty awful, it was more like hard jello. Our first trip to the Japanese restraunt was great. We had the tepanyaki, with the chef at our table cooking for us. The food was amazing and the service was prompt. Our second trip was not so great. Our reservation was lost, so we had to talk to manager to get us a table. The restruant was full and there was only one waiter, who i think resented us for complaining to his manager. We waited 20 minutes to get a drink, then another 20 for our first course ( which is prepared sushi in a fridge 10 feet from our table). The sushi was fine, nothing special ( but it's not Japan so my expectations weren't very high anyway.) My main course was excellent ( breaded shrimp). After we finished our main course, we sat and waited for 20 minutes for our dessert ( which we ordered before we started eating ,but it never showed. I asked for another drink before the main course, which also never showed, even as the table of 11 beside us got there drinks and appetizers. We finally had enough and left without our dessert and without leaving a tip. The argetinian restruant opened halfway through our stay but we didn't eat there, although we heard that have excellent steaks and ribs. The beach was okay, the water is nice, and there are no rocks. We had fun, with the seadoos and parasailing gives you a great view of the area. All in all we had a great trip. Keep in mind that you are on vacation, don't be in a hurry to do anything, and relax.

Lots of beautiful sandy beach, but unfortunately the water was a little dark in spots from the hurricane damage. We ate at the Mexican restaurant on our second night there, which was good however not a lot of variety, but the waiter did a great little show when he made our coffee. The buffet was fabulous. We ate there the remainder of our 1wk stay. The service. What can I say but \"wow!\". The staff there are absolutely amazing. A previous review mentioned hardly anyone spoke English. I disagree. Almost all of the staff there spoke excellent english. The one's that weren't \"fluent\" made a strong effort, communication was never a problem. All of the staff were so extremely friendly and hospitable, I found it hard to say goodbye. The staff in the buffet area were very helpful if you were looking for something and very were quick to remove the plates from your table. The maid service was great, everyday we looked forward to coming back into our room to see what she did with our towels that day. One day it was a swan, the next day 2 kissing swans, sometimes it was hearts with flowers. Everyday a surprise! Guest services was great and the bar staff were exceptional.

I will give a breif breakdown of different features of the resort and how I would rate them, and try to do so compared to many other resorts we have stayed at throughout the caribbean throughout the past several years. I know that as a general rule you cannot expect to rate a 5* hotel in the caribbean to a 5* in a major North American city. Lets start with the positive: Rooms - the rooms I would rate a 4 star. They were a good size, tastefully decorated. We had a small covered balcony which was nice to sit out on and read when we decided to stay in our room. Shower/bathroom was all marble and very nice. The A/C unit did not work initially and then afterwards we found to be only working on/off cycles - it would blow out cool air for a time and then seem to bring in warm air from the outside - this we mentioned to the front desk SEVERAL times and that was the best they could do - but more on the service later. It was also quite noisy as far as AC units go. Overall a very good rating without nit-picking. The beds/pillows are about as uncomfortable as almost any resort in the caribbean and so would say they are about par with almost all others. Cleanliness- This was the hotels most outstanding feature and I would say it deserves a 5 star rating in this catagory. The maid service in the rooms and around the entire property was VERY clean. Even the small things like cutlery at the restaurants were always very clean - not smudges and foodstuffs ever on any of the cutlery we ate with. Excellent rating and well deserved. Grounds and common areas - Another excellent rating I would say 4.5 stars. Landscaping and common areas all very clean and VERY nicely maintained. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star was the cushions in lobby area ususally had stains on them - but not a huge deal. Front desk staff - 2 star. Very few employees around the resort know any english at all. The front lobby staff are the best in their English, but their attitude toward guests and their apparant lack of diligence in looking after complaints/requests for getting service done i.e. fixing the AC unit for example, is one of the worst places I've dealt with. Any requests that we made were always done very tactfully, even after being ignored or no action was taken in a reasonable amount of time. Not even close to a 5 star hotel in this regard, I have stayed in 3 star resorts where the attitude and customer service of staff puts this one to shame. Food- I would rate this a 3.5 star, and thats only because the Japanese restaurant was excellent. Honestly we are not picky eaters, but serious I had already got tired of the food before the first week was over. Food was very repetative, and lacked any pinache. Pasta bar was good, usually the roast beef or turkey special nights were quite good, but really a lack of variety kills the buffet dining room. Let me tell you that it is a very informal buffet - the restaurants are severely understaffed, so you cannot blame the hard-working cooks and waiters, but sometimes you will not get coffee and drinks served to you unless you happen to flag down a waiter about halfway through your meal. You can get you own drinks and serve yourself which is good, except for coffee/tea which are only available through the waiters, and getting one to come to you is a job and a half in itself. So, if you dont mind a very informal/self-service type setting, you'll do fine unless you want coffee/tea as mentioned earlier. But, in my opinion that is definitely not the type of standard you expect for a resort claiming to be a 5 star . Restaurants - Mexican - was OK 3 star food a little bland. Japanese - 4.5 star, we ate at the table where they cook your meal before you. The little \"show\" by the chef and the food were excellent, tastiest meal by far, and the only thing that raised the overall rating of food to a 3,5 star. The beach restaurant is 3 star - good hamburgers, hotgogs and nachos, but thats about it. After a few days of that it becomes unappealing. Oh and good luck getting beer or alcoholic drinks here, again the underlying reason is understaffed - a coomon problem throughout the various areas of this resort. Beach and Pool - The pool area is lovely although there is little shade to be found anywhere around the pool area - you can only stay here if you love to be out in the direct sun. The pool is nice and big and those with little ones can enjoy the small wading pool they have for little children, Very clean pool area, but some times there are a alot of aciivites going on, and its hard to have a quiet wade in the pool with all the activites and young kids having fun in the pools. The beach area is fairly large and the sand is preserved due to the hotel building a large concrete breakwater at the edge of the ocean/ beach area. There are LOTS of palapas and chairs and we never had a problem getting one. Also very few vendors come around, you maybe see one/day so its very nice that way not to be constantly harrassed to buy something. If you like going into the ocean you will hate this hotel. The water is constantly very turbulent and murky - I personally dont like wading into water where I cant see where I'm stepping even in foot of water. This maybe due to the damaged caused to the offshore reef by Wilma a few years ago, but not a picturessque site. The beach/sand area I would say is a 3.5 and the ocean water are 1 star. If you like a beautiful oceanview and clear water - you WILL be truly dissappointed here. Bars - We are not heavy drinkers but the service especially at the pool area bar can be quite slow. This is in no way due to the bartenders - they work hard and fast but they are simply understaffed, and this is a common problem throughout the resort that needs to be addressed. Sometines there was ONE bartender at the pool bar and no less than 35 people waiting around to get drinks. I felt sorry for the poor guy, but its lots of little things like this that you would not experience in a REAL 5 star resort. Entertainment - The animation / entertainment team is hard working and very enthusiastic young people, but the shows are geared toward children, yes I mean children. For parents with young ones, the shows are great for them from about 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. After this the only entertainment affered to adult resort guests is a trip into Cancun to a bar club. We do not really like the club scene - it may appeal to younger single people, but usually for middle-aged and married people its not the type of entertainment that appeals to this general group. So, other than a kiddie show or going into a bar/ club to drink and dance with singles, there is nothing to do here but go back to you room and watch tv or sit in the lobby and chat with others. Overall, we had a generally good relaxing time, but its been the first time that we had gone somewhere for 2 weeks and felt like coming home after the first week. The resort is definitly NOT a 5 star resort, not even a 4 star- overall its been one of those places that we would say that weren't glaringly terrible, but there were SEVERAL little things that we experienced and observed that took away our satisfaction while we stayed here. This was our first time to an H10 resort, and while I would not say I would NEVER go back to an H10 resort, I will say it will have to be a while before I would consider going and trying them again, and we both were excited about the prospect of coming home like we have never experienced before.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "YVR", "Title": "\u201cGreat New Years!\u201d", "Author": "YVR_yvr", "ReviewID": "UR12770960", "Content": "Have travelled to Mexico many times, as well as DR and stayed at many all inclusives, so have an idea of different resorts and levels of service.

We also tipped handsomely in an attempt to remedy the towel problem, but still only 3 towels and no better service than without tipping ... so finally I gave up and went with the flow ... brought a clean towel back from the pool everyday to use in the bathroom.

Take mosquito spray for night time ... we did get many mosquito bites Food - buffet is your best bet ... lots of variety ... not 5* cuisine, but some good dishes ... lots of fruit available and menu changes daily. Breakfast the best meal of the day. Order your lattes from the bar ... they are very good. Mexican restaurant was very slow and food not good at all ... this is Mexico! the food in the Mexican restaurant should be the best. Japanese retaurant okay ... nice atmostphere, but not the best food ... but then again you are in Mexico ... not Japan! They do try their best and the deserts in the Japanese restaurant were good. Snack bar by the pool (daytime) - okay and saved a trip back to the main buffet for lunch, but they could change the menu a bit from day to day. Always the same menu. Pools are great ... very clean. Beach is great ... not sure what people are complaining about ... soft, white sand. Our kids spent a lot of time in the water. People complain about seaweed and rocks ... no rocks to speak of. And for those who come from landlocked areas ... this is the ocean! There is supposed to be seaweed in the ocean. Red flag up for most of the 2nd week we were there due to high winds. Book the sailboat in the morning for later in the day. Entertainment ... is okay ... have seen better, but they do their best and seem to all have fun doing it. These kids work very hard 12+ hours every day, 7 days a week and earn very little, so give them a break. New Years Eve the hotel organized a huge party at the poolside and it was very well done. Lots of entertainment and a good time was had by all until the wee hours of the morning. The staff really made sure their guests had fun and were taken care of on New Year's Eve ... thank you! Went on many tours while there, the best was Tulum. and the catamaran snorkeling tour. There is a free shuttle to Playa Del Carmen ... but does not leave until the afternoon. They need to offer this service earlier in the day as well. Was surprised upon checking out that they wanted to charge me for 3 movies (at $17 US/movie) when we had in fact not watched any movies. Two fo the movies were supposed to have been viewed on December 23rd at the same time we were arriving to the hotel, so not sure how they figured we had watched a movie at that time ... after much discussion with me and then confering in Spanish behind the front desk they agreed to waive the fee ... good thing, because I was not going to pay it! Be careful when you check out that you are not charged for things you did not use/buy. Drinks are okay, but very little alcohol in those margaritas ... I should have been on the floor after 3 of them, but barely any effect ... I suggest ordering a shot of tequila on the side and mixing into your margarita. All in all a great holiday ... wish I was still there lying by the pool.", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cHoliday A+ Hotel F\u201d", "Author": "gc1408", "ReviewID": "UR12735676", "Content": "Went to H10 Hacienda Maya all inclusive resort from Dec 24 2007 to Jan 6 2008 as part of a group of 26 family and friends. Although we booked all the rooms months ago, for some reason our room was located some distance away from our relatives in another building. The staff were extremely uncooperative to even allow us to change rooms. This took us 4 days before we could change rooms. Although we had specified 2 twin beds when we had arranged the holiday, we were given a room with one king bed. I am traveling with my wife and my two boys so this was unacceptable. It took 2 days for them to them to fix this... their solution was to throw a mattress on the ground, which blocked whatever little room was left to walk around. The air conditioner was located near the roof of the suite with no manual controls. For the first four days the air was on full blast cold 24/7 because there was something wrong with the air conditioner and it could not turn off. The room was so cold, I ending up getting getting sick. The repair man came several times to fix the air conditioner but was not able to do so. His solution was to climb up a ladder and somehow manually turn off the air conditioner. Unfortunately, after turning off the air, the room was too hot and stuffy to sleep in it. We had to call him back to turn the air back on. I chose to suffer the cold although I was already sick. Luckily the air did work in the second room we were moved to... The first room also had terrible problems with the toilet plumbing. There was a constant sewage smell and sewage blockup. The repairman came and was unable to fix this. The sewage problem was mostly ok in the second suite. There was just some smell, but the toilet did work for the most part. The second room had its own set of problems. The air and toilet were ok. However, the suite crawled with spiders, geckos, centipides, ants and mosquitoes. We complained about the bugs for 4 days, finally, after my son was bitten by a spider, they decided to fix the problem, by putting a door seal on the bottom of the front door to the suite. We had been blocking the door daily with a towel, but the bugs must have gotten in after the maid came to clean the suite. After the door was sealed, we got rid of most of the bugs, except the mosquitoes. On both sides of the resort, there are swamps. It seemed strange to me, that they didn't fill these swamps in, since this was the obvious source of the mosquitoes... The food at the resort was mediocre. The buffet was the best place to eat. However, the chicken, and beef were chewy and largely unappetizing. The fish was generally good. The pasta was cooked with way too much oil. In the morning the omelettes were uniformly good. On the mexican night ( once a week ) there are good mexican stews. There are good desserts, fresh fruit and self serve beer and wine. The salsa, gaucomole and tortilla chips are excellent. At the mexican restaurant, the food there was poorly prepared and there was very limited selection. We went once, and that was enough for us. At the japanese restaurant, it was obvious the staff there had never seen or tasted real sushi, The stuff they made was mediocre to poor. However it is worth going because the cook provided a good show making the food. The argentine restaurant was destroyed in a hurricane, it was still unrepaired during the time we were at the resort. The evening entertainment was performed by the hotel staff and was generally uninteresting, however, do see the mexican show, they bring in entertainers from outside the resort. The activities on the beach included free sailing and kayaks. There is extra charge for para sailing and jet boats. There are scuba lessons available right at the resort. However, the diving conditions are mediocre at the resort, the best diving is at Cozumel. The beach has a marked area for swimming, here the sand has been groomed and it is not necessary to wear feet protection. The water grows gradually deep and there are no strong currents or waves. The reef is just about 500 yards offshore, this provides good protection for the swimming beach, and other water activities at the resort. Some of the female guests chose to go topless at this resort, and the staff didn't do anything about this. This didn't bother us, but you might consider this if you are uptight about this kind of thing. The resort does offer free shuttle to Playa del Carmen but the hours are limited and you must book your trips. Otherwise a cab to Playa is about 15 bucks including tip and takes about 15 minutes. Playa has a Walmart, mexican supermarkets, restaurants, and lots of interesting souvenir shopping. There are a couple of tour companies with desks right in the lobby, and there is a Budget car rental desk as well. One of the best features of the hotel, is the free wifi internet in the lobby, we used this extensively during our stay. There are no annoying logins or passwords necessary. However, the connection is capped so if the total number of users exceeds the limit, the exceeding user will get the \"server not found\" error. We went on several excursions during our stay. Tulum is the most scenic of the ruin sites and if you chose to go to only one ruin, this is the one to see. We combined this with x'hel ha, which is a mexican theme park, which has excellent snorkelling among other things. Chichen itza is worth seeing, but is about 3 1/2 hours away from Playa. I found Coba to be the most interesting of the ruin sites. Coba has the highest pyramid in mexico and you are allowed to climb up the pyramid. The site is located in largely undeveloped jungle and has an Indiana Jones kind of feel to the place. At Coba be sure to either rent the bikes or take the pedicab. The site is enormous. Coba is about 2 hours from Playa. There are swarms of mosquitoes, so be sure to load up the repellent! We took the fast ferry to Cozumel from Playa and hired a local cab driver to give us a 3 1/2 hour tour of the entire island for 80 bucks. A lot of the island is nature preserve, and it is absolutely stunning. We also saw the ruins at San Gervasio. The driver took us to see his neighborhood, and showed us his home, and even helped us do some shopping in his neighborhood store. One day we took the shopping tour to Cancun for 26 bucks a person. They took us to Mercado 28, a local shopping center in Cancun where the prices for souvenirs are about 1/2 what they are in Playa. The tour also included two other shopping centers, the beach at Cancun and a driving tour of the main hotels and points of interest. We also took the tour to isla de mujeres. This is a island about an hour from Cancun by catamaran. A bus takes you to Cancun, where you board a catamaran to the island. One of the stops includes the swim with the shark. There is a 5 foot shark in a pen where you are allowed to handle the creature. The shark's teeth has been removed. The next stop is snorkeling on the reef. After the reef, the catamaran docks and you have lunch at a buffet restaurant and a couple of hours for shopping or sight seeing on the island. On the way back the catamaran crew unfurls the spinnaker sail and the kids have spinnaker rides on the sail. The tour includes unlimited drinks, including a tequila shooter contest.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cH10 was paradise\u201d", "Author": "Jay-MB", "ReviewID": "UR12605340", "Content": "Our family of four (two kids, 14 and 10) just returned from two weeks at the H10 Hacienda Maya...and we loved it.

I must also mention the excellent sports and entertainment team at the H10. They really made our stay complete, with all the fun and games during the day and the nightly shows.

Here is the rundown.... THE HOTEL (Grounds, Lobby, Interior Appearance) The overall appearance of the hotel is very classy. The lobby is large and was a great place to sit ; mainly at night time when there was a really nice breeze. It is open-air so no air conditioning but surprisingly this was not an issue. Everything was marble (pillars, floors) or at least looked like it was complemented with dark ratan, wicker and glass tables and lamps. On December 01st the staff worked very hard and efficiently to put up thier Christmas tree and other Christmas decor. The grounds were very well manicured and you would not be able to find a piece of garbage, food or anything. Lots of flowers, greenery etc. Just outside the main lobby towards the rooms was a huge fountain and a garden consisting of small waterfalls and ponds. At night they lit this up which madi it look like they were Mayan Caves with little head carving things in them. ROOMS The rooms were your typical average hotel rooms. Nothing fancy by any stretch, plain but clean. The bed was like any hotel bed; fairly firm but who cares...you don't spend much time in it anyhow! The bathroom was probably the nicest part of the room with marble tile throughout and a glass entry shower. Only problem with this was there was no bathtub which makes it difficult to shave your legs or maneuver around in there. There was a sewage smell that would sometimes come up from the drain in the bathroom but it lasted a few minutes and then went away. Nothing to complain about like some of these people giving reviews!! The maids were like Ninjas. They had such stealth and speed. The first morning they knocked at about 8 in the morning. We were sleeping and asked them to come back. We later would out the \"do not disturb\" sign when we went to bed and then when we woke up around 9-9:30am for breakfast we would turn the sign around for the room to be cleaned. After returning from breakfast they were in and out without a trace; aside from a clean room. No mini-bar here folks! We would get about 4 waters a day stocked in out fridge. My friend tried asking for Coke but the maid said they couldn't get that..oh well. BEACH Keep in mind when reading this that I am not really a beach person. I love the sound of the ocean and being able to see it when I am away but not much of a fan for laying on it or swimming in the ocean. Infact I only went twice in the ocean plus one more time when I went Sea-dooing. The ocean has random rocks and shells sticking up which i think is where i cut a huge slice out of my foot but neverthless no biggie. The ocean was rough for our stay there all yellow flag and one red flag which meant the waves were crashing which in turn grabbed the sand from the shore making the water look murky and brownish in colour. When I went sea-dooing in the middle of the ocean it was bluish green and tourquise throughout. The beach was small but lots of chairs available. Sand was nice, white and well maintained. POOL This was my favourite place to be at the resort. Whether it be lounging poolside or at the pool bar, this is where I spent y days. There were two pools: One with deeper waters and a volleyball net. They did activities infront of this pool with loud music. I did not go in this pool once. I meant to but never got around to it. The second pool is where the pool bar is as well as a sectioned off area which has jets which go on and off periodically as well as built in lounge chairs in the pool with the same type of jets. This was our favourite spot in the pool as we called it \"the bubbles\". The pool got a little chilly when the sun went out but as long as you either kept swimming of drank some more you would stay warm. SERVICE The service was mediocre at this hotel. I have been to Cuba, Dominican and another resort in Mexico where the serivce was better. You have to wait a while for drinks at the lobby bar and pool bar. When I say a while maybe 5 minutes at the most but really, what are you in a rush to do??? You''re on vacation people! The serivce that did irritate me was the front desk in the lobby. They seemed to pick the people that spoke the least amount of English to work this area. The thing that urked me though is that you would be standing there and they wouldn't even acknowledge that you were standing there for a while. One day I went up there to ask for a pen and waited about 7 minutes before someone spoke to me. This brings me to check-in. Unfortunately check in is at 3pm. Well we arrived to the hotel at 11:30am. This meant that we had to sit around and wait until our room was available for 3.5 hours. This wouldn't have been so bad if we had of known this before. that way we could have worn our bathing suit under our clothing or packed a proper change of clothes in our carry on. So be aware that no matter what they will not check you in until 3pm. ENTERTAINMENT I only seen one of the shows which was pretty chessy but that's how these shows are. Unfortuneatly the final act in one of the shows a female dancer fell and hurt her knee. She could not get up or move from where she fell. Now, instead of stopping the show and helping her they just went on with the show with this poor girl lying on the floor in paoin for almost 10 more minutes. I was very upset and wondered why the hotel staff were not helping her or acknowledging her injury. It turns out that they called an ambulance for her and she was back later that night with a knee brace and crutches and seemed fine. Just the way they handled it was very insensitive. There was a Disco in the basement of the hotel which was a very weird place to have it. There were no signs indicating that it even existed so hardly anyone ever went which was a shame because it had such potential. Good music, pool tables etc but not enough people there. Nevertheless we made a good time of it. FOOD First off I have to say that the Japanese was amazing. Very , very good! We went there twice to the teppanyaki where they cook it right in front of you as well as get some suishi. We ended booking this place twice during our stay. I highly reccomend this! The Mexicanos a la carte was pretty good but not spectacular. The buffet for dinner was your typical resort buffet, slightly more dissapointing though. We did the Mexicanos twice and the Japanese twice to avoid the buffet. We ate dinner in town one night at Playa del carmen at La Parilla(Mexican) which was very good. The breakfast wasmy favourite. Omlettes and egges made to order and pancakes, french toast etc. Only weird thing is there was no bacon???! There were rumours that if you got there first thing in th morning there was bacon but there was no way I was making the 7am breakfast. Overall we had a good time. Resort was nice, food okay, drinks VERY strong!! Our group knows how to drink and we had to tell them to put less liquor due to how strong they were making them. Blue Hawiian's were good as well as Miami Vices. My husband and I went sea-dooing on a red flag day. Probably not the best day to go but it was fun if you like feeling like you are going to fly off lol. When we went to Playa del Carmen we visited 5th avenue. It was nice and there were some nice things to buy but it was pretty touristy! Overall for what we paid ($1,450) all together for both it was worth it. More like a 3 or 3.5 star though. Would I go back?

The rooms are great. They are aprox 33 8 room 2 storied bungalows spread around the property, 4 upstairs and 4 downstairs. We had a room with 2 3/4 beds, as always in Mexico they were hard, but we like that. The odd thing was that they weren't bolted down. My boys would wrestle (they each bought nacho whatever masks) and the bed was across the room. A large shower/toilet area with sink just outside but around the corner from the rest of the room. Large balcony with an eye level view of palm trees full of coconuts. A fridge but it only had 2 bottles of water each day. Our friends were downstairs in a room with a king bed and a couch that could double for a bed. The shower/toilet room was smaller and didn't have a window. They had a little lizard living under the deck outside of thier room. The food wasn't very good. Don't get me wrong we could always find something but it was lackluster and alot, really alot of things showed up day after day after day. The hamburgers in the snack bar were awful, even loaded up with oinions, guac and everthing else, so were the chicken nuggets. The kids were sure that they'd been there a week or so. The Mexican al carte was okay but everyone was sick the next day. My youngest was up puking in the morning. It passed, thankfully!! The japanesse was very good. Probably the best meal we had. They cook it in front of you and make a show of it. The veggies were perfect and even the beef tasted good. One thing I didn't really like was that the buffet was up near the lobby. I like to eat nearer to the pool and ocean, either indoors or outdoors. Mind you the walk wasn't very far at all and probably good for me. I've read other reviews and I'm guessing that my tastes are different than thiers, but everyone I was with agreed that the food was lacking. The pools are nice and there were plenty of seats around it. They boys played water polo and had a few other vacationers join in with them. I think it was play with them or get splashed, hit with the ball or move to another chair. The beach was nice to walk along. Of course the sand is like sugar. Again lots of chairs and shade, no towel games going on that we could see. They have a retaining wall, with the chairs and sand above it, below it some days there was a little strip of sand, others the water splashed against it. Blue Bay is on one side and the beach ends there. Secrets Capri is on the other side and then after that, there is a ton of construction till you get to the Fairmont. (We never heard any construction noise) The water however isn't very nice. It's not clear and blue like it is farther south, it was very choppy and a really nasty brown (like coffee) colour for the last 3 days we were there. Not very inviting to swim in. The guy where we got the kayaks from said the water has been like this since Willma and that this little bit of beach is the worst. Farther down the water and beach is nicer. Out in the kayaks we could see the reef and thought it would be nice to snorkel in but you'd have to be careful as it was a ways out from the beach. The bar at the pool is fun and it's so nice to sit there and meet people. Half of it is in the pool and the other side is a reg bar with stools. Most days it was hard to get a drink in the pool. The bartenders stayed on the other side and you had to call and get thier attention. One day only one bartender was working and he was going crazy! Oh, and no straws at the beach/pool bar. I guess they didn't want the garbage. We would grab some from the lobby bar and take them with our bubbas to the pool, it made it much easier to drink the blended drinks. The lobby bar was nice too. They used glass there and it was a nice change from the flimsy plastic cups, made me feel like a grownup! No top shelve liquor. They had it but you'd have to pay extra. One thing I wasn't prepared for was that you have to take a bus or collectivo into PDC and then another to any point south. It sounds like a small thing but what a pain it was! It added travel time and a little confusion to everything we wanted to do. We like to go on our own to Xel Ha, Akumal and other places that are south of PDC. It's alot cheaper than a tour (even in a cab) and you set your own hours. We could have taken a cab everytime but they'll only put 4 people into a cab & we were 5!?! How is it that you can fill up the bed of a pickup truck with as many people as you want but only are allowed 4 in a cab? One cabbie took us into PDC but we had to have 2 to bring us back, they have a check stop, no really, a check stop that all cabs stop at, but only going north. One cabbie told us that cops could pull them over and that the fine was $700 pesos. We did a catamaran boat tour to Isla Mujeres. It was fantastic! We booked with they guys who are around the pool. It was $69usd for adults and $45usd for kids. The kids are all over 12 but I argued that they wouldn't be drinking and so shouldn't have to pay adult prices, they gave us kid prices which was very nice. We also did a zip line/cenote swim/tulum tour which was just okay. It was $96usd per person and I don't really think we got a good deal for the $$$ spent. It was fun and the staf was great but there were only 3 zip lines, only pop and water at lunch and we were really rushed at Tulum. I read in another review that this resort was near shopping and I can only guess that they meant PDC? Which is a $14usd cab ride away. There are shuttles but they don't start till noon and the ones returning after 5 are $3usd per person. There were tables set up every other nite near the lobby with a variety of things for sale. You could barter but it was the same old, same old stuff that I've seen everytime I've been to Mexico. On a good note, no one approched us about time shares. So, all in all it was a very nice trip.

We had stayed at this property 2 years ago when it was El Mandarian, the property is in a good location and we decided to give the new management a try. We used Lomas for transporation and where very happy they where on time and we had very little wait before they took us to the resort. We did arrive about noon so we knew that we would not be able to get into our room, however we did not expect to stand in line for 2 hours before we even started the checkin procedure. There was only 6 people in line before us so this was rather frustrating. We did our check in finally and when we where done it was already 2:30, still they would not let us go to our room. We checked back in after lunch at 3:30 and our room was still not ready until by husband produced a $20.00 bill, then our room became available. We where given a room number and a map, where we quickly discovered that we were not in one of the villas they advertisted, we where in Building B (all these units are a three digit room number) building B is essential a Cheap Motel type building. We decided to make the best of it and check out the rooms, we where to have 1 room with 1 bed and 1 room with 2 beds, both rooms you guessed it had 1 bed. We went back to stand in line a the front desk to request the rooms we had reserved (we noticed several people in line doing the same thing) After being in line for another hour we where told to go to guest services, we stood in line there for 15 minutes or so and where told we are sorry we will try and fix it by tomorrow come back to the front desk at 1 pm tomorrow. We went on with the rest of our day and hung out at the beach which is very nice and decided to make the best of it. We headed back to our rooms to get ready for dinner, the boys (teenagers) where looking forward to the buffet and it had been a long day. We went back tried to turn on our TV (a small 13 inch ) and got nothing but static, we decided not a big deal the TV worked in the other room so we could catch the news and weather there. We headed to the buffet and when we walked outside there where no outside lights at all on this building which made the narrow staircase very dangerous. We went to guest services again and requested some lights it was handled immediatley. Things are looking up. We decided to have some before dinner drinks and they where awful, I tried the 4 or 5 drinks I normally will drink and none of them where good. We decided to stick with beer, it was Corona so we figured it was safe, the second day the beer was extremely stale and had a strange smell to it. We gave up on drinks and stuck with non alchol options, they where good. The buffet was very good, lots to choose from, the food was presented very well and was all at the correct temp. The second day we decided was a beach day, we had no problems at all securing chairs at 10:30 am and enjoyed the sun and water. The boys decided to try Parasailing and had a great time. We ate lunch at the snack bar, the food was not good at all, after that we started having stomach issues, took some pepto and things got better. We went to the front to try and get the right rooms, we arrived at 1:00 as we where told and a bus was arriving at the same time. Guest services did come over so we didn't have to spend several more hours in line and said sorry we can't change the rooms today either maybe tommorrow, check again tomorrow. We decided at this point we would live with what we had and enjoy our stay, which we did. Highlights of the trip, the water activites crew is great. The Japanese place is wonderful, although a little slow as far as getting drinks and there is not much of a chance of getting your coke refilled. The beach has beautiful white powdery sand and lots of chairs. Themanagement in the main dining room does a wonderful job. The downside, the front desk is extremely unorganized, not helpful whatsoever, and very unfriendly. The management is completley lacking and unaware of anything happening on their property and are unwilling to help fix any situation. They simple call the front desk the front desk says no and that is that. The resort was not at capacity so I'm not sure what the problem was. Their alacarte Mexican rest. has allot of work to do. It took 4 of us 2.5 hours to eat a four course meal. The food is already precooked and in steam tables with the exception of the meat for fajitas and so forth that is grilled right there. Our appetizer order was not correct but we gave them a try anyway and they where pretty good. The salads had watered down dressing and set under a heat lamp for 20 mintues before they where delievered. The main course, which everyone had ordered fajitas was not very good, no one ate even half. We did order dessert and 2 of the four items where correct, again it was just okay. Don't make the mistake of going to their welcome breakfast, it is a timeshare pitch and it is very hardsale. After 1.5 hours the sales ladie's manager came out and asked why we wouldn't buy, we told him we didn't feel the product was worth the money he them threw in \"the bribes\" which was free weeks at the resort, we said that we didn' really like the resort enough to want to come back, his exact words where \"that is good, we really don't like repeat visitors because we have already pitched our product, we like to have new people come in\" Then the hardsale started all over again, we got up and walked out.

No bugs. The check-in was easy and everyone was extremely accommodating. If you needed something, housekeeping was there with it right away. We arrived on Monday and everything was pretty quite and not too many people, however by Thursday evening more people started to arrive. My only compliant was that the food was on the sub-standard side until later in the week and it started to get better. When I was there two years ago - the food was excellent the entire time. The kids that do the shows each night are really great entertainers and dancers. We had alot of fun with them. Took the free shuttle to Playa del Carmen to show my friend the shops and had lunch. On another day back to Playa to take the (30-40 minute) ferry to Cozumel - rented a car there and drove to the other side which is wild and beautiful and hotel-free. On the last day we rented a car at the hotel and drove to the ruins in Tulum. It's easy driving and take about 45-60 minutes...$2.00 to park your car and $2.00 for a round trip tractor shuttle to the ruins - $4.50 for entrance. Took my suit this time and went for a swim. I sincerely believe this is one of the most beautiful places on earth... This is cheaper than buying an excursion and you can come and go when you want.

Also every night there was a show in the theater followed by a band outside the lobby. Very good entertainment. During the day, activities were organized almost every hour. You can also feel safe since there is always security with the cleaning people so they could not steal anything, not that they would.

Nothing but 2 bottles of water in the small fridge that didnt work properly and water bottles were not replaced daily.

It wasn't until the next morning that they called an ambulance for the American and by that time, the H10 worker had already checked out. Another night I was leaving my room and I noticed there was no running water. When I arrived in the lobby, there was water leaking from the ceiling and light fixtures. This could have caused a major electrical fire and there did a poor job of roping off unsafe areas. Another night my electricity went off and when it went back on, the TV would not go back on. We had to have someone come fix that. There is a major language barrier and if you are not fluent in Spanish, no one tries to even understand what you are asking. They say that there are 4 restaurants but only the buffet is open daily and the others rotate days and reservations are required for all of them. Also, the Brazilian restaurant is not included and it is $30 US per person. Room Service is pizza only which is not inclusive and don\u2019t even ask for something to drink because you cant get it. There is no ice available for your room either. There is barely any wait staff and they are in no hurry to assist you. They must not like to get tips because none of them went out of their way to even attempt to earn a tip. Then when I did tip them, they didn\u2019t even say thank you! There are a lot of bugs that will wind up in your room if you don\u2019t close the door right behind you. You will also see hundreds of lizards and blue crabs as your walking through the resort. Be careful, the little lizards will crawl right under the door. I lined a towel by the bottom of the door every night and slept with cotton in my ears.

I do not feel that children should be allowed in a pool where there is a bar with adults drinking and smoking. No one said anything to the people who had their children in this \"ADULT\" pool. The weekend seemed to get more crowded with locals and a massive amount of children. This must be a luxury vacation for them to get away from their normal conditions but it is definitely not for an American who has traveled to several parts of Mexico and had much better experiences! The rooms were just OK! The beds were like cardboard boxes. The liquor was just awful. They only offered domestic liquor and if you wanted domestic, there was an additional fee. Good thing I bought a bottle of Vodka in the airport on my way. That was the only thing I drank because everything they had to offer tasted like rubbing alcohol. Their tropical drinks were even awful. The only good thing I have to say about this hotel is about two of the activities directors.

I'm an experienced traveller being down south to many different destinations many a time. I generally stay at 4 Star resorts as I have found spending the few extra dollars will help assure you will have a better stay. You do get what you pay for most times in life after all. Anyway this resort, although not perfect, did meet or exceed our expectations in every way. I was surprised at how well the holiday went. Too smooth almost. I've heard the horror stories about Mexico but definately not here! the Mayan is a beautiful region. The weather was sunny and 85 every day with a cool breeze blowing in off the Sea just enough to keep you from sweating. The food was well prepared with plenty variety. The beach was beautiful. Rocky in the water in front of the resort but if you go down the beach to just past the peir where they are building new resorts, you will find the perfect beach with no rocks in the water. It was like we had our own private beach. Very safe on the beach as people stroll by occationally as well as soldiers and security guards. Just enough to feel safe not threatened. The grounds are immaculate. 2 pools which are well kept. The a la cartes were good but not 5 star. The service was good and the workers friendly. It only about a half hour fronm the Cancun airport and a twenty minute shuttle ride to Playa Del Carmen which is a must see. Especially 5th Ave. The construction at the neighbouring resort was at a minimum and didn't distract us at all. The rooms were well kept. Very clean. The a/c worked great all week although I believe I found out why people were having problems. The remote MUST be set on 77 to control the a/c. Any other # and the remote doesn't do anything. I would go back in a heart beat or stay a second week no problem. All in all a fantastic time. You can e-mail me for more info. Till then, chill out and enjoy.

This was our first visit to the Riviera Maya area. Some reviews on this site have been critical of this resort, so we were interested to see things for ourselves. We traveled with two kids, ages 6 and 10. Our overall experience was wonderful. All the staff were extremely professional, warm, and friendly. When we were checking in, the bartender of the lobby bar brought cold punch to all of us (a nice touch). The resort is beautiful and the pool area is great - two very nice pools. We visited during the off season, so the resort was only about 50 percent occupied. The weekends are more crowded with local folks who drive in from Merida and Cancun. But even at the busy times there were plenty of pool and beach chairs and it was relatively easy to get service from the bar or dine at the restaurant. At the advice of our tour guide (TNT tours - they work with BestDay in Mexico), we booked our Xel ha excursion on Saturday to avoid one of the crowded weekend days at the resort - this worked very well. We booked the combined Xel ha/Tulum trip, but the kids were having so much fun in Xel ha that we didn't get on the bus for the Tulum portion (the tour guide made it clear that this was an option - I think many folks do the same). We could have saved a few dollars by booking the Xel ha-only tour. We took the free resort shuttle to Playa several times to shop and visit the beach. This worked very well - the Magic Tours drivers and staff were very helpful and professional. All of our shuttle transport was very punctual - they only wait a few minutes, so don't be late for the stated pick up time or you will likely be left behind. We found the food to be very good at the resort - there are many choices at every meal including fresh fruits and vegetables. The desserts were very good. Our only culinary disappointment was with the El Charro Mexican restaurant - the food took a very long time to come and was not anything special. We really enjoyed sitting at the grill at the Japanese restaurant - the kids said many times that it was their favorite meal. We really enjoyed eating at the poolside buffet for breakfast and lunch - not as many choices as in the main lobby, but a very nice setting. The beach is not as nice as some - you should wear water shoes to avoid rocks and other stuff in the surf. The wind and tides were not favorable for swimming while we were there - the lifeguards said that there were jelly fish in the water, but we didn't actually see any. On one of the calm days we took a short snorkel trip with the Dive shop that was very good. The off-shore reef is great and we saw a lot of fish. The dive staff was great - especially with the kids. One thing that puzzled us at the resort was the morning wake-up visits from the cleaning staff. They would knock on the door between 8 and 8:30 and actually open the door if you didn't answer right away. Then they would just say \"hola\" and walk away. Not really sure what that was all about. I suggest that you bring a rubber door stop to stuff under the door to discourage the staff from coming in the room (the deadbolts don't slow them down a bit). I pushed my swim fin under the door. We never asked the front desk staff about this because it wasn't really a problem for us (we were always up and just about to head off anyway). Also - note that the beds are very firm - we almost wished we had brought a camping mattress or foam pad along. Also there are no extra pillows in the rooms. Our A/C was off for a little while one afternoon, but maintenance staff was working on it even before we reported it (some kind of power problem). We had a great (and reasonably priced) vacation and would definitely consider returning although we usually like to explore new places every year.", "Date": "June 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "bigavsfan23", "ReviewID": "UR7845069", "Content": "Just returned from a 7 day stay at the H10, from May 25-June 1.

Having taken several day trips to Tulum, Xel-Ha, and Delphinus that involved picking and dropping people at other hotels, I can honestly say the Hacienda Maya is one of the best, esp. given the price for the quality. I talked with several people staying at other hotels (including Secrets next door), and can see no advantage that these places have over the Hacienda Maya. However, you need to evaluate the pluses and minuses for yourself: + The Japanese restaurant really is that good. One section is Benihana-esque and the other is a sushi bar. Both are good, although we liked the sushi bar better. + The activities are great, especially if you are an active person. There are yoga classes on the beach, water polo, volleyball, dance lessons, tennis, free scuba lessons in the pool, kayaks and catamarans. The fitness center was ok, good weights, but the treadmills/ellipticals are mid-grade. As with most Cancun area resorts, the jacuzzi was not hot, just jets. Of those I talked to, no other resort seemed to have so many activities. + There are two nice sized pools, one with the great jet chairs and another more for kids and activities. The bar service at the pool is great during the week. Even on the busy weekend, we never had more than a few minute wait for a drink. Although not top shelf, there is a great selection from mojitos to daiquiris. + The staff is hard-working and respond quickly. Cleaning staff is constantly working. The front desk service was good, although sometimes you have to wait, esp. in the mornings and at dusk. + Fast and free wi-fi access (however only works in the lobby/bar area, not the rooms). Bring your laptop to avoid Internet fees. - The food at the buffet was just ok (I can see why others have written poorly of it), as it needs more flavor. It is something that may be a deal breaker for some. For the best food, eat early and stick to the food made on-the-spot, like the omelets, pastas and roasted chicken. - The restaurant reservation system is a little too bureaucratic, esp. in peak times (early evenings) when lines form. Be sure to make all your reservations on day one, as same day reservations are impossible to get. It would be more efficient if they could computerize the process. Also, even though reservations were required, one night at El Charro 10 people showed up at the same time and they did not have the staff to adequately wait on everyone right away. - On the weekend it gets significantly busier and seems to be a popular place for vacationing Mexicans. During the week, it seems to be mostly tourists from America and Europe, often a good mix of younger couples and older couples, with fewer families. I just think you should be warned to expect many more people on the weekend (great time for a day trip somewhere). - We had new water bottles in our room fridge each day. Although no alcohol, so if you want to drink in your room with a stocked minibar, this may not be the place for you. Overall, we had a great time. Reading other reviews, it appears the key is to pick your time to go. If you go at peak travel times, the service does slow. However, we never had a problem and would definitely recommend this as a top tier place that can save you money for some fun day trips.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "colorado", "Title": "\u201cDon't do it!\u201d", "Author": "jen1110", "ReviewID": "UR7716412", "Content": "We just returned last night from 8 nights at the H-10, the week before leaving I almost changed our hotel to another one we were familiar with and should have done it. Now, we must tell you we have been to Mexico many times and are the kind of people who don't complain and get along just about anywhere, but this trip was by far the trip from %^^&. The resort should be rated a 2 1/2 star at best. Good; the resort grounds are well kept, the maids were great. Bad; The room we were assigned had a cracked sink when we arrived, but again not wanting to complain and thinking that it had been repaired from underneath we just let it go, on the second day we had been at the beach, came back in and put my swim suit in the sink, went in laid down, got up walked into the bathroom only to find my self promptly being flipped to the ground, anytime thoes floors are wet they are very slick, the sink had broken and all the water had drained on the floor and my feet were out from underneath me, I flipped around backwards reaching for the sink, hit my back and made a 4\" gash on my rib cage bruising my ribs along with a broken blood vessel on the ankle a torn mussle and hit my head, thank god for my cosmetic case that was on the floor. Had it not been there I would have hit my head directly on the hard floor. We went to the front desk to complain, they gave us the utmost attention and said they had never had any complaints of the sink being broken, which we find hard to believe because it was old cracks and had been that way for awhile, the said that a doctor should see me, we went to eat as they called the doctor, but no doctor ever came, a beach paramedic, who was very nice and many hotel staff members, the paramedic said we should see the doctor, after going to our room to see just how bad the crack was and relaizing it had been that way for some time and they screwed up, they called the doctor and came to tell us we would have to pay the 80.00 usd to the doctor to have him look me over. OK, this was the last boiling point for my husband, the resorts mistake and they would not even pick up the cost. Long story short, we told them to heck with them I would see a doctor in the states if I felt I needed one when I got home. They did move us to the room above us, which was better but guess what the sink also had a smaller crack! The beds seriously are only a box spring, no mattress. Now we all know that the beds are usually hard in Mexico but sleeping on these beds is like sticking something hard into all parts of your body all night. The food; ok, it appeared to be nearly all left overs each night, very bad food. the only good was the special mexican food at the beach area on only certain nights. If you stuck with salads all the time you would be ok, except the fact that many nights they had all the salad dressings but no lettuce or greens. The beach, we had picked this hotel because of the reviews of the nice beach and we do understand they have been through a hurricane, just make sure you bring your water shoes, very rocky getting into the water and many days mostly dirty water. Be aware, the resort does not let you charge anything to your room, other than laundry, the shops want you to pay cash, some credit cards but it seemed like everytime we turned around they wanted cash for this and cash for that. Much of our cash went to the resort which was a bummer because you don't plan on that and it puts you short when out and about. the internet police watch you and tap you on the shoulder when your at 2 minutes left on you internet, $4.00 everytime you walk in there for 15 minutes and it better be CASHusd. I would never reccommend this resort, I heard many people complaining it wasn't just us. Beilieve me there was some bad experiences for other people, I understand I can not report on certain events at a resort, so I will not, lets just say, it wasn't good. Spend the extra money and go elsewhere. I spoke to many people from the Ibeostar resorts who had a great time and couldn't say enough about their trips.

I was really worried before leaving because we had read so many bad reviews but now I realize that people are just really picky and I had a great time! The hotel is situated on the beach and there are plenty of huts to sit under and relax. There are a lot of seats around the pool and fun music to listen to. The staff was always very polite and cheerful. The food in the japanese restaurant and mexican restaurant was wonderful! There is another specialty restaurant but you have to pay 30 USD to eat there per person and nobody we talked to had so we didn't think it was worth it. Instead we spent the 30 apiece to go snorkeling. There is a diving and snorkeling center on the beach that is run through the hotel and they take you for a 5 minute boat ride to a beautiful reef. I have never seen so many beautiful and colorful fish. I've been snorkeling several times and this was the most beautiful. The entertainment at the hotel is great. Every night they have a show and usually a contest so some audience members can win some prizes, we were some of them that won. The entertainment crew is busy all day providing activities for kids and adults around the pool and beach. There is a large list of things to do everyday if you are interested. We joined in water aerobics twice and it was really great. Dancing lessons were fun, too, and we had something to show our families when we got back. The whole grounds of the hotel is absolutely gorgeous. There are flowers everywhere. We took so many pictures. There were bugs and I got a few really itchy bites and so did a few other people we talked to but my boyfriend didn't have any. A little bug repellent would help that. Although I had a really really great time, there were some downers. The first one was that there are only two bars, the lobby bar and the pool bar. During the day there was always a really long line at the pool bar. An extra bar over there would have been really nice. Also, the buffet restaurant which is where we ate when not at the specialty restaurants was not so great. It offered the same things every day and I didn't like much of it. My boyfriend eats everything and he didn't care for much. Also, I felt that the advertisements for the hotel were misleading when they said snorkeling was included in the price. I have stayed at many other hotels and they all mean snorkeling where they take you on a boat to a reef but this hotel means they will give you a snorkel and mask so you can swim around the beach area. We had to pay 30 USD to go snorkeling on the reef. It was worth it but still we felt misled. Also, the sand in the water was a little rocky close to the shore but then got pretty mucky going farther into the water. I really think this is due to the hurricanes a few years ago breaking up all the ground. All in all, it was a wonderful stay and I'd encourage people to stay there.

We stayed from May 11-19, 2007. I was a little worried before arriving at the resort because of the bad reviews I had read. But honestly, those reviews were not accurate. Our stay was wonderful. Flight: We flew with skyservice. Their food has gotten worse but no one flies for the food. The movies there and back were good (dreamgirls and music & lyrics). On time and smooth flight. Cancun airport: Baggage was quick. **Make sure to walk straight past the people in the airport who are offering different tour specials**. They will attract you by asking which tour agent you're with and asking if you're looking for the bus to the resort. Don't listen to them unless you want to buy a tour package (I suggest just to wait until you get to the hotel). The buses to the resort are outside of the airport. Reception: Very quick and efficient. check out is 12pm and check in is 3pm. Bottled water is available here not at the bar. Very nice lobby. Book for the la carte restaurants and shuttle to playa del carmen near the tour agents. Safe keys available for 2 dollars a night. Rooms: Wonderfully large. With king bed, fridge, couch, nice shower. Very good water pressure, always had hot water. Did experience some black outs. Some were on and off, once it was off for 5 hours. Bring bug spray just in case. I brought raid because another review said some rooms had mosqitoes. Our room did and we were thankful for the raid. Leave the maid 2 dollars a day or so instead of a large sum at the end of the week (different men and women clean the rooms each day). They don't provide face cloths so bring some. It rained really hard one night and the water came through the door so if it rains make sure to put a towel at the bottom of the door. Resort grounds: Great, always clean. Lots of iguanas and lizards and crabs. Well kept flowers and plants. Pools: Huge pools. The pool bar is usually abandoned by the bartender. Easier just to get out and get a drink at the other side of the bar. Beach: We got up early to reserve palapas (830am). During the weekend it gets really busy. You can walk forever on the beach, the said is so soft. The water is very calm with bigger waves in the afternoon. If you want, bring water shoes because there are a lot of small sharp rocks when entering the water. Lots of fish, you can feed them bananas or bread. Check out the dock as well, lots of fish at night. Nice fabric lounge chairs so your bottoms don't go numb. Food: great food, always something to eat. The buffets were excellent, great omelettes in the morning. EXCELLENT guacomole! The japanese restaurant was ok, very salty at times. If we go back I'd stick to the buffets. We didn't get to try the mexican restaurant because of the blackout. Corona on tap. Not many waiters so you can get your own beer, wine or pop which is fine. Coffee and espresso at the lobby bar. Try the sangria. Entertainment: ok. not a lot of people attend. the band that plays outside the lobby everyday is great. nice to sit and relax with a cup of coffee or a magarita. People come to sell different things on tuesday, thursdays and saturdays. Make sure to bargain. Excursions: we went on the coba trip. The best trip i've ever been on. We climbed the pyramid first, looks intimidating at first but its fine. They then take you to a cenote where you swim for half an hour in beautiful clear fresh water. Very refreshing. And the highlight of our trip was the mayan village where you meet a 95 year old mayan lady and learn about her lifestyle. Make sure to book with the tour agent that offers the shuttle to playa del carmen(sits at the desk next to the dinner reservation guy). They offer better prices then your travel agent & a GREAT tour guide. Also visit Playa del carmen. lots of shopping, great lobster restaurants and beautiful beach. The hotel offers a number of shuttle times for free. Other advice: the internet is very expensive at the resort (14$ US for one hour). Go to the city, its 10 pesos (1 US dollar for 30 min). Bring bug spray and large travel mugs. Bring a flashlight if you want (there may be a few blackouts). Overall we had a great time. We would definitely go back.

Unfortunately that turned out to be the case. I will list the good points first for those who want to be convinced that this is the place where they want to stay and then the bad. 1.The grounds and pools are beautiful. Well manicured, clean, lovely flowers, iguanas. The beach is also wide with lots of palapas. There was no reason to \u201creserve\u201d your beach chair with towels etc. unless you were very picky about where you wanted to be. There is a small retaining wall about 18 inches high that separates the actual water from the area where the chairs are so that the seaweed that everyone talks about doesn\u2019t get washed up into the sitting area. The beach heading south toward Playa goes on for miles if you like long walks on the beach. 2.The food. Even though there is only one restaurant the selection was very good. There are at least 16 stations with an assortment of food from hamburgers, salads, soups, meats, vegetables, pasta, to Mexican and American specialties every day. The pasta or dessert tables were incredible. The restaurant is open almost all day and late into the night. The Mexican restaurant, by the beach is also open for breakfast and lunch and by reservation at night but their selection is limited. We tried the Japanese restaurant twice, but actually preferred the Mexican which was much more intimate (although the way the shrimp was cooked was not for me, unless you enjoy raw bacon I would try something else) but the chicken was terrific. The waiters prepared a great Mayan Coffee and even performed a Mayan sacrifice which was hilarious. We found that the cooks at the Japanese tappan grill used too much oil in preparation of the vegetables but the meats were delicious. 3.The room itself was spacious (but more about that later) and Emilio did a great job of making our stay as comfortable as he could. Loved the flower and animal arrangements. 4.If you went to the desk right after breakfast you could book a free bus ride to Playa and back , for the same day or the next day. We took advantage of this many times. Visit Walmart or the Mexican version of Walmart for cheap tequila or vanilla. Pure vanilla extract in Walmart was 15 pesos for 500mls. If you are CANADIAN and taking a direct flight, you CAN carry liquids through security in your hand luggage. No thanks to the Nolitours reps, one who said that you could, the other said that you couldn\u2019t. NOW THE BAD 1.The front desk staff will go out of their way to avoid helping you with your problems. Their solution to any problem is to tell you to come back later. When you do, you will once again wait another half hour for assistance, and have to explain the whole story again to someone else, who usually contradicts what you have been told by the first person you talked to. They have a little book that they write down complaints or promises made by other front end staff, so make sure that if you are promised something that they write it down. Remember the date when it was written down because you will most likely have to tell them to check the book when it comes to getting what you were promised. 2.We had a lot of trouble with our room and so did others in building 15. Almost enough trouble to ruin the vacation. First of all we requested and were promised a quiet room, which turned out to be facing the courtyard where the band played until 12pm (not always the best music either)The first night the air and power went out and stayed out until late the next afternoon. For two weeks there was a really bad sewage smell which they tried to mask by spraying large amounts of air freshener and pouring copious amounts of bleach down the drains. After complaining and being promised a new room and never delivering we finally just put wet towels over the drains which helped a lot. We had no hot water for showers until the last two days of a 14 day stay. On another night a security officer started drilling the safe next door at 11:30pm for a guest who had lost his safe key. After an hour of drilling and other residents screaming for him to shut up he was finally done. Oddly enough the guest wasn\u2019t leaving the next day? So, because of the hassles we experienced, we did manage to convince the front desk to let us stay in our room until 7pm on our last day for free because Nolitours had rescheduled our flight twice and we were leaving 12 hours late. No apologies, no concessions from that company either.(first and last time )But\u2026 The front desk called us at least twice after the normal check out time to tell us that we had to get out or pay the ten dollars per hour. Luckily we knew the date that Mini had written approval for our request down in the little book at the desk. See? 3.The lounge had no ventilation (or air conditioning) and at night was blue with cigarette smoke. Not a place to be enjoyed if you happen to like fresher air. It is also the only place after 6:30 where you can order a drink and you have to pass through it to get to the dining hall. The toilets in the lounge washroom were often overflowing or plugged, or had no toilet paper and were not cleaned until the next morning. 4. We would have enjoyed sitting outside in the courtyard but for 300 plus guests they only have about 70 chairs and tables. So\u2026 if you don\u2019t like cigarette smoke and don\u2019t get lucky enough to nab a chair the only thing to do after dinner is go to your room and as other reviews have stated, drink water. 5.We will never use Nolitours again. The reps were no help at all. They were only available for about one hour per day and usually lined up with dissatisfied vacationers. During our two week stay, three different reps represented the company and not one would be briefed on what the others had promised. Our flight home was continuously rescheduled and the only way we knew that was to constantly check the board daily by the empty Nolitours desk .Noltiours made no provision for you to stay later in your room and you had to sit and wait in the lobby. We were lucky to only have to do so for three hours, but others had almost 12 hours to wait. Their information was often inaccurate or conflicting, as previously mentioned; after deferring our flight for 12 hours and being promised that that the duty free would be open we arrived at the airport to find everything on the main floor locked up and the one small duty free upstairs only open for 10 more minutes. Other stuff We took three trips through Magic Tours. The Chichen Itza tour was a bit of a disappointment other than the guide Sergio who was extremely interesting. Chichen itza is overrun by beggars and vendors selling souvenirs who follow and hound you constantly. (They do sell cheap though if souvenirs are what you are looking for) The lunch provided was disgusting, a buffet that looked like it had sat there for a long time.. We both got sick on the food, later that night although we chose carefully and ate sparingly. The cenote was interesting but so many people use it, it had a film of suntan lotion on top of the water, kind of gross. If you want to see ruins I enjoyed Tulum more. There are no vendors and just as many ruins placed over a smaller area. There is also a fabulous beach at the bottom of the cliff where you can go for a swim in the sea. The building shown on Chichen Itza brochures is the best and most impressive of all the ruins but you cannot climb it, you can only look and basically the only one that is complete. The period of time allotted on the tour was hardly enough time to see much. The shopping tour to Cancun was thrown in free if you bought 2 tours so we took that too. It is just as it says, a shopping tour, not a sight-seeing tour. They take you to three malls or you can elect to skip the last one and go to Senor Frogs for lunch.They do make a quick photo stop at a beach. Nothing you can\u2019t see in Playa for a free bus ride, same stuff, same prices, same hassles. The ultimate best tour was the Sian Khan Biosphere. Totally amazing! We are two crotchety middle-agers who wouldn\u2019t have even thought about it except for some advice from a couple even older than us. The tour takes you through the jungle to a small village called Punta Allen. Here, before you start your trip, a small sea-side restaurant serves salsa and sour cream on freshly made warm tortillas, with lemonade. You are then fitted with snorkelling gear. One word of advice, bring your own mouthpiece , shoes that can withstand water, a waterproof bag , and try to wear your swimsuit under your clothes. They claim that everything is sterilized properly but we saw a dog drinking out of the pail where they were supposedly cleaning the gear. You are taken out by boat to an area in the ocean which is surrounded by a coral reef, a natural water filter. The water is crystal clear and only about 4.5-5 feet deep. After a brief swim, you are taken to an area where you can observe huge sea turtles, and beautiful starfish. From there you continue to a mangrove, then to watch dolphins feeding and finally to the coral reef for a bit of snorkelling. I had never snorkelled before and managed fine. (I did take advantage of the hotels marina and practice with their gear for half an hour in the pool for free) When you are done you return to the restaurant for lunch which is either freshly caught barbequed fish, or paella. The fish looked good but we chose the paella, a mixture of saffron rice, fresh shrimp, and squid which was so soft and tender I thought that it was scallops. Umberto took us through the town, which is very small and gave us historical facts, which were interesting, or you could stay at the restaurant and drink beer. This will be our last trip to Mayan Riviera because the rapid growth has changed it from a quiet, leisurely place to one of massive hotel and condo chains all up the coast. The traffic has increased dramatically and if you are looking to get away from the hassles of traffic jams, and crowds this is not the place.", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "calagry canada", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel if\u201d", "Author": "sizzleCalagryCanada", "ReviewID": "UR7635932", "Content": "just got back from h10 stayed there from may 5-12.We prehired a van to take us from the airport to hotel greatidea so you can get to hotel and make sure rooms are satisfactory.Arrived at 730am could not check in till 2pm that is ok though cause we packed suites and shorts in carry on.Upon checkin we were asked for a credit card for insidentals never have i experienced that at an all inclusive unless i make a long distance call.At H10 it is for anythig ,if you want to book tours or have diner at the argentinia resurant Al Carte it is 30.oo per person are you kiddig me.Anyways at checkin they tried to put us in bungalow 25 NOT it is farthest from the beach.Not that it is overly far but too far for me.Since i emailed reservations manager prior to going,a few minutes later karla gave us bng 12 room 1201 right next to pool and beach.Room was nice air conditioner worked really well mini fridge had its water no pop or beer like at other all inclusives we had a view of pool 20 feet away and the beach 10 feet away.

This was trip 31 to Mexico or the Caribbean. It is a beautifully landscaped and very clean resort. We were assigned Building 34 but asked to be moved because it was so far away from everything and next to major construction (noise) going on at the resort next door. Building 25 was further from the beach but closer to the lobby and main dining room and somewhat quieter. The resort is spread out, but not a far walk to any area. The area on the left side, facing the beach is the construction side. Spent most time on the beach where the loungers were plentiful and well spaced. There is a break wall dividing the lounging area from the rest of the beach. The lower part of the beach is narrow and there was a problem with seaweed on most days. The pier with sandbags under it seems to trap the water and weeds when the wind is blowing. The staff are constantly raking and moving the stuff, but it piles up. On several days, few people went into the water because of the weeds. The beach is good for walking south. Lots of construction along the beach, but far enough back so that it is still a pleasant walk. The food was ok but the service in the main dining room was almost non existent. There are self-serve beverages so you can get water, wine, etc\u2026when you give up on the waiters. They were not ignoring us, there just was not enough help. The Mexican restaurant was ok, not great, but the Mayan coffee is worth ordering after your meal. Check out the beach snack bar for breakfast (opens 0800) and lunch. The pools are nice and large, but there is no shade next to the pools. They need another bar for the beach/pool area and another rest room. The lobby bar was the bar open in the evening. Did not catch any shows but a combo provides music on the patio outside of the lobby at about 8 p.m. They need more chairs and tables in that area. The resort charges $3.00 for 5 minutes of internet service or $4.00 for 15 minutes. If you go to town the charge is $1.50 for a half hour. There was also a charge for the in room safe, $2.00 a day. We used the complimentary shuttle to go into Playa one day. Overall it is a nice resort for the price, but we agreed that we would not want to be there at peak season. It would be very crowded in the public areas. On Saturday there were many children (probably local families with day passes) and it was very busy in all areas.

I like staying at nice hotels and this one definitely wasn\u2019t up to my standards. If you have low expectations you will like this hotel. If you are like me and like to be catered to, this place definitely is not for you. I would rate this hotel 1 star and although the price was pretty cheap, I think it was too much for this resort. Room: Our room 3102 had a serious mosquito problem. We finally received some bug spray that seemed to fix the problem. Other bugs even came out and croaked on the floor. Thank goodness for the bug spray. Still it was pretty nasty. The water in the shower stunk and tasted like salt water. Not that I was drinking it, but you could taste it when it hit your mouth. The room refrigerator had water in it only. I am used to other all-inclusive hotels that fill the refrigerator with water, beer, and soda. The air conditioning had a motion sensor. It only worked if you were in the room. The minute you left, the air stopped. Upon returning the room was hot. If you wanted an ocean view room, you had to pay $50 extra per night. Needless to say no ocean view for us. Service: What service? They had two people working the front desk, so when a huge crowd came in to check into the hotel, the line was huge and took forever. If you needed something you had to make sure to ask for it a few times before it actually got done. Calling the front desk was useless, because nobody ever answered the phone. Food: Great place for people who are on a diet. The buffets always had the same things in them. The buffet by the pool had hamburgers for lunch. The burgers tasted so gross. Not sure what kind of meat they were made out of. Eeew! The buffet in the main building had breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Same stuff every day and nasty. Thank goodness for the fruit and vegetables, which is basically the only thing I ate. There were two restaurants. One Mexican and one Japanese. Reservations were required for both\u2026not sure why, because they were never full of guests. The restaurants were ok. Be careful where you sit in the Mexican restaurant, because there are lots of mosquitoes in it that will eat you up. The Japanese restaurant was pretty good. There is one more restaurant, but it is not included in the all-inclusive package so it costs $30 per person. Never went to that restaurant. The all-inclusive package includes cheap liquor. If you want premium it costs extra. The cheap liquor is nasty and obviously watered down, because it\u2019s impossible to get a buzz. Other: The resort offers some kind of deal for locals, making weekends busy with local Mexican families. Saw some kids lick their fingers at the buffet, touch some food and put it back! Eeew! The resort had lots of Europeans there. Mostly French I think. Beaches were mostly topless. Didn\u2019t mind that at all.

I really want to tell people how nice the resort was because I was so fearful about going after reading some reviews that were written earlier in the year. We were very satisfied. I'll break it down: Food: Restaurants were good. Even the buffets where they made pasta to order for both lunch and dinner. Great selection of fresh fruit and salads. We found no problem making reservations for the ala carte restaurants (we have had problems before at 4.5 and 5 star resorts). We were not limited to the amount of reservations we could make based on the length of our stay. The Argentinian restaurant did cost extra. We got ours free for listening to 50 minutes of the \"presentation\" (more on that later). It was sad that they worked so hard putting on a show and staffing and there were only 4 others there besides the 8 of us who got ours comped. I think I would actually pass on it if I had to pay the $30/pp. Drinks: I loved the fact that Corona was the beer on tap. I was suprised to learn that if you wanted a Bacardi rum or Tangeray or other call brands that they charge extra for it and you could only get it at the lobby bar, not at the beach bar. They did make a good mojito. Word of advice: Bring your own insulated cup. They only use small 9 oz disposable cups which don't hold much. Spa: We stayed at the El Dorado Royal (5 star)2 years in a row and loved the spa. The spa here riveled it in all aspects. My husband and I were able to get couples massage in a great treatment room. We were given robes and plush towels to shower off before the massage if you wanted and after. We first booked massages when the were running a 20% off special. Then 2 days later it was 2 for 1 so we \"had\" to go for it again! They offered so many types of massages that it compared to a 5 star spa. Beach: Very nice in comparison to further down past Playa where it is very rocky and not able to walk the beach. We were able to take very long walks on the beach in the mornings which was great. Water was a little more murky than what I have experienced at the El Dorado a few years back. Still was able to see the gorgeous green water. Do yourself a favor and buy polarized sunglasses. Bring another pair along and you will never go back to not wearing polarized lenses. You see so much more differentiation of the water. The only excursion we left the resort for was to go horseback riding in Maroma beach. Otherwise the kids swam, played in the sand and painted pottery one day. We were all so exhausted after dinner we were in bed usually by 10:00 so didn't see much of the shows or disco. The bits of the shows we did see were loud and hot in the theater but the recreation staff does a great job. Word of advise: Don't fall for the \"give us 50 minutes to listen to to our speil and we will give you incentives\". We said we would give them 50 minutes and only 50 minutes in exchange for our dinners in the Argentinian restaurant. They guaranteed us that it wouldn't be more than 50 minutes. What a joke. We told them after 50 minutes that we were done and would like to receive what we were due. The time share guy , Jack, said no that we didn't fulfill our end. We did argue with him a bit and seen we were not going to get anywhere. He blamed the hotel staff for quoting 50 minutes but I don't buy that for a moment. We did complain to the hotel and they gave us the vouchers and said they were now going to tell people that it takes 2 hours. I hope they do in fact make the change. The other thing that was a bit problematic is that it is a family resort yet there was a LOT of topless gals. I know it is commonplace in Europe and I don't have a problem with it when we are at the all adult resorts but when our kids, (8 and 11 plus our friends had a 6/girl and 10 year old boy) are exposed it poses a problem. And it may not have been so bad had they only sunbathed topless on the beach versus the pool area as well but they would also go to the bar, the bathrooms and the ocean topless. Over all, I believe we would go back. Only the plethra of topless gals would discourage us. I believe the resort could change this by setting a specfic area aside for adults only.", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cLovely landscaping\u201d", "Author": "renia_22", "ReviewID": "UR7281282", "Content": "H10 Hacienda Maya has a beautiful landscaping; the beach and the pool area are well maintained-clean.

The Mexican restaurant has the same menu everyday so after one visit you don't want to go back for the same food. The hotel should improve the food variety and quality. The bar by the pool area did not pour any alcohol to drinks during the day. The lobby bar was great and if you tip the bartenders enough they will give you the premium alcohol at no charge (at least they did that to us but we made sure they got good tips) The air conditioner in our room did not work. We have made several phone calls to the reception desk complaining about it but nothing was done until we saw a maintenance person walking by our room. We dragged him to our room and explained the whole air conditioning situation. After two very hot nights, they finally left a letter at our door step that they were unable to fix it and we needed to move. It was also difficult to take advantage of the free shuttle to the city. You need to go to the reservation desk early in the morning to book it for the following day. There was a separate desk to make restaurant reservations. It seemed like we were just going back and forth these two desks to make reservations-waste of time. The daily shows were good but nothing extra ordinary.

It' s like a resort we stayed at in Porto Morelos, the water was just fine, shallow and kid friendly. The food was typical all you can eat food.

This hotel is beautifully laid-out \u2013 it is in the style of villas, each 2 stories with 4 rooms per floor, so it seems like you are in a beach side town, with small pedestrian walkways connecting the 38 villas to the main building. The lobby area is beautiful to sit in, spacious and open. reat pools, and great beach. We walked along a few kilometres of the beach area, and this hotel definitely has the nicest beach area, as it\u2019s in an alcove area and doesn\u2019t get much debris washing up on the shore. The bad points\u2026. I\u2019ve stayed in a lot of hotels, motels, room rentals, etc, ranging from 1 to 5 stars in various countries, including many in Mexico; this was by far the worst food I\u2019ve ever had anywhere, hands down. The cheapest ingredients are used, and then are not cooked well (indeed, often under-cooked, as several times I didn\u2019t eat the chicken because it was still pink inside). We survived on eating fried eggs and toast every day for breakfast, as it was the only thing cooked fresh that had not been sitting out for 3 hours. For dinner, bread and butter mostly. They have 2 restaurants (a Mexican and a Japanese) in the resort; these are actually quite good. But they have very limited seating (generally you can only get a reservation at 8:30 or 9:30pm), and you are only allowed to eat there twice during your stay. They also have an Argentinean restaurant that others said was good (we didn\u2019t try it), but it is US$30 per person to go (and doesn\u2019t include drinks). The staff are all very friendly and trying to accommodate, but this is by far a very under-staffed hotel for its size. For example, there was only 1 person doing check-in and check-out, even though they were expecting a bus off 40 to arrive at the same time, so it took hours to get everyone checked in properly. The only area that is over-staffed is in the salespeople that nab you the moment you are trying to haul your luggage (by yourself, no bell boys) to your room \u2013 they are selling you timeshares (although they call it \u201cClub Membership\u201d), and are very persistent, following up with calls at 8am in the morning trying to get you out to their \u201cfree breakfast\u201d salestalks. Also, the hotel next door is expanding, and was directly in front of our room (if you are looking towards the ocean, we were furthest to the left). They started digging with heavy machinery at 6:30am every morning. Even earplugs did not help much. On the plus side, it got us out of bed early to get good seats by the pool! However, as this area is swampland, the digging caused sewer-like odours to permeate the entire beach area (even going to the opposite side didn\u2019t help much). All in all, I would not recommend this hotel for the price. For another $100-200 you can stay at a decent chain resort, that really is a 4 star (this was definitely not). Otherwise, go to a cheaper resort (eg. $300-400 less), as in the end it will be similar service. Alternatively, look at some of the resorts that offer the no-meals option, with kitchenette (there\u2019s a Walmart in Playa del Carmen, you can rent a car or take a taxi and stock up on food, drinks, everything there for the week).", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat beach, great trip\u201d", "Author": "whg4", "ReviewID": "UR6910334", "Content": "We just returned last night from a wonderful six days at the Hacienda Maya. We decided to stay there based on the reviews we read here on Tripadvisor so I only feel obligated to write one myself. We were looking for, above all else, an escape from the cold winter that we've been having. We wanted to plant ourselves on the beach; aside from that everything else was secondary. We didn't necessarily want to stay in an all inclusive resort, but we found that the price was great at the Hacienda Maya and we figured that we could enjoy the beach during the day and go into Playa at night. We were right. Despite the convenience of the resort we found ourselves leaving every day for one thing or another. (Day Spa, Shopping, Tulum, etc.) One thing I wish I knew earlier was that you had to make a reservation on the the shuttle to town. The list is short and fills up very quickly. Not all the shuttles are free, some are $3 USD per person. And the last shuttle is at 7 pm. Try to make reservations as early as you can as we didn't and ended up taking far too many taxis at a fixed cost of $12 USD each way. The property was well cared for and we appreciated the work that had put into the lush surroundings. Yes, there was a foul smell here and there but it wasn't nearly as bad as we expected, only when we were walking on certain paths, and not anything that you could notice in the room, the beach, or the pool, but good to know about in advance so we weren't taken aback. The rooms were good, no complaints. We stayed in building #7, which I would highly recommend as you're close enough to the beach without giving up privacy or being subjected to the noise from the pool entertainment. This wasn't a stroke of good luck. We asked at the front desk what rooms they had available and told them that we'd wait for a quiet one. Looking back, this was a good move on our part as we really liked the room and it only added to our enjoyment of the resort. They were kept clean and while it make not seem like a big deal, they always left the AC on when we came in. Nothing felt better after a long day in the sun! The beach itself was great. They kept it clean and there were plenty of chairs available. I went for a walk north and south of our beach and we really did have one of the best spots on the beach without question. Very clean and not the least bit rocky. The food was okay. We liked breakfast and lunch. They had an espresso machine which we appreciated. For dinner we tried to go into town as often as we could, but as I mentioned earlier taxis were $24 USD + tip R/T so we couldn't justify making that trip twice a day. We ate at the buffet for dinner once. I think it was an off-night but even then it was very disappointing. On Thursday night they had a special \"Mexican\" night at the buffet which looked a lot better. My recommendation for dinner would be to make reservations at the different specialty restaurants, avoid the buffet for dinner unless it's a special theme night and to temper your expectations. Or just take the shuttle into town and take a taxi back. There were some great restaurants in Playa we really enjoyed. All in all, I think that for what we wanted, an easy trip to the beach with a few chances to experience some great food (off property) we found exactly what we were looking for.

H10 is a hotel chain out of Barcelona, Spain. Be prepared because most locals still know the hotel as the El Mandarin - indeed, many of our toiletry packets (shampoo, shower gel, etc.) still bore the old name. Overall, the grounds are beautiful--lush and well cared for, the buildings (rooms are in a series of 8-room buildings) are a tropical orange with lime, blue and pink accent walls. Although there was a spa and gym onsite, we did not use either. The two pools were well cared for and only heavily used during the pool games. Periodically, there was a strong whiff of sewage when out walking, but nothing persistent. Our room was nicely furnished - TV problems were prevalent (the signal would periodically cut out for no reason), and the water is horribly soft (thank goodness for unlimited supply of H10 bottled water). Lots of closet space, a large shower, and a large balcony were great! The beach was very well taken care of. We walked north as far as possible, and south for about 1 1/2 miles on the beach, and the H10's beach was cleaner and better cared for than all other resorts. The cabanas are nice and plentiful, as were the chairs. Drink service was spotty. There are motorized and non-motorized water sports on site, and parasailing seemed popular. Entertainment was a definite weak spot at the Resort. The nighttime gathering spot was the bar in the main lobby - the entire lobby became noticeably smoky and full of people in various states of inebriation. This resort seemed to cater to couples and groups of all ages, although some kids were there. We saw about 8 kids of varying ages (4-10) participating in kids activities each evening. The 9:45pm show was a music/dance show, most of the nights while there. Most high school productions were of better quality; my wife and I actually walked out of the first show - the costumes, dancing, and entertainment value were all lacking. There were three restaurants open while we were there - the main buffet was only OK in quality, although breakfast was better than the other meals. There was always plenty of room to get around the buffet and no wait for a table, and wait staff was typically attentive - although after-dinner coffee and tea sometimes were delayed. We ate at the reservation-only Japanese steakhouse one night - sushi and typical 'prepare-at-your-table' steak meal. It was the best dinner we had while there. The Mexican restaurant by the pools was also reservation-only; we didn't understand that so were not able to make it there. If their menu was of the same quality as their Guacamole, it would have been good. This restaurant serves hamburgers and hotdogs at lunch and was the best choice for that meal. We don't drink, so we cannot comment on the quality/quantity of alcohol. It seemed like everyone was happy enough in the bar and on the beach! Amenities in the hotel are still being added/refined. The gift shop was junky, but the 'general store' had all the basics. There is an Internet cafe, but only 3 PC's (one was broken the entire time we were there), and the cafe was only open for a few hours a day. We decided that 3 full days at the resort, with one on an all-day excursion to Chichen Itza (the highlight of our trip), was about right. Any longer, and we would have been too bored. If all you want to do is lay out on the beach and have basic food, the H10 is probably a good place for you. If you want a more luxurious resort experience, we would suggest looking elsewhere.

We ended up going and buying our own beer and alcohol which kind of defeats the all inclusive part. Also to get a drink with some of the bartenders required having a dollar bill in your hand.

I noticed that some of the beaches closer to Playa del Carmen were disappearing so the chairs at those resorts were quite crammed together....we had lots of space at H10 as the beach is still good. It was quite windy in the week I went so for a couple of days the red flags were out and swimming was impossible. I guess this is typical for the Mexican Rivera. I didn't frequent either of the 2 pools because there was almost constant loud music during the day. I even had to plug my ears on the way to the pool bar.

It was a great start to the week. Our check-in went well and the room we got (Bldg 31) was very nice and clean located about 3/4 ways back in the complex but not at all a long distance from the rest of the facilities. In fact we liked this location as it was quiet in the later hours if the evening. the place is clearly not a 5* and misses the mark on 4* in some areas but all in all we enjoyed our vacation and had no \"horror stories\" as I read in some of the earlier reviews I read prior to our departure. (Having been to the place now I really don't understand some of the graphic reviews written on this place. I suppose some people have unreasonable expectations or are always complaining). The complaint of English not being spoken is absolute rubbish. I found the staff all extremely freindly and spoke English very well for English being their 2nd language. I spoke at length with many of the staff and enjoyed their view of Canadians, American and others. Language is absolutely not a problem. Some house keeping staf speak no English but a smile, gestures or a tip is understood in any language. We had all the bottled water we asked for. ROOMS - Very clean and modern, equal to other 5* that I have been in. As we we there at the busiest time of the year, there was a day there was no wash cloths available earlier in the day, this was corrected when we spoke to the front desk. One day returning from a day excursion we were face with the AC not working. Within 1/2 hr a fellow was there and had it reset and all was fine from there on. ENTERTAINMENT - Very very good, Better than the RIUs and Grand Bahia Principes that I have stayed at. they truly do a first class job on this part of the business. Can't say enough about the Entertainment and pool staff. FOOD - A la cartes were good with the Japanese standing out over the Mexican. The Main Buffet was average with the same dishes being served each lunch and dinner, I guess because I travel so much in my job I found it boring. (Their OJ and Ice cream are awsome, kids loved it). the small restaurant near the pool was an embarrasment as they were never open and rady to serve breafast at 8am nor were the chef available to make an omelet in the morning. as the morning went on they would not re-stock the fruit, or the breafast items such that if you went in their at about 10:30am it was picked over and not very appetizing. We often went to the main buffet for this reason but noted at about 11am the same thing was occurring there. This experience alone caused me to rate this place just below a 4*. We, along with several others form Ont had a day or so of Montezomas revenge, nothing that Imodium didn't clear up quickly. I always seem tohave a day of it when going south; you can guess until forever where you actually picked it up, everyone had a different theory. Two other families from Vancouver followed the same path as we did and had no incidents. Go figure. The small restaurant by the pool (Mexican at night) is basicall a snack bar (Hamburgers and Hot dogs) at luch and through the afternoon. Again it is \"picked over by 2:30 - 3:00pm. You need to go to the main buffet. BEACH - the Beach was good and pools very good. I have seen other resorts clean the beach every day in fact the resort next door (Secrets) cleaned their beach every day and the difference was noticable. Getting beach towels is a problem, there doesn't seem to bee enough. When a delivery is made to the pool shack you got to be there or they are gone within 30min and it could be hrs before another small delivery is made. We spent the first day and a half trying to get our timing working with the deliveries. GENERAL - Good place for families although most of the vacationers we couples. I found the number of smokers was high, but coming from Vancouver that is not unusual. The smokers were predominantly from Quebec and the US, but smoking was contained to the loby and courtyard area with the eating areas being smoke free. There is no liquor in the rooms, not even beer! This was a dissapointment to me as it was advertised as having these amentities and I would much rather relax and read in my room in the eveniong enjoying a beverage rather than having to crowd around the main bar waiting for service. Their \"domestic\" booze is not great and they charge you up to 55 pesos for what they call premium liquor which in Canada is normal liqour (Barcardi's, CC etc). This is another reason I wouldn't rate it a 4*. The exercise room was barely OK. Missing was Mats, water and the floors were not cleaned the week we were there. Also there could have been one more set of equipment. We enjoyed our stay and I would recommend this place to others (with the cautions I mentioned above).

We are a couple in our late twenties and are not very picky and don't mind the \"small\" issues but as you will see this resort is not worth your precious vacation time. Folks, it's true what other reviewers were saying: THE GROUNDS SMELL LIKE RAW SEWAGE! as much as hate to say it but it's true, seems like they are having issues with the piping which will not be fixed. Also a huge dissapointment for us was the lack of AC in lobby/bar/restaurants, it's friggn hot everywhere except your room if the AC is working there. We don't mind the heat but sometimes it's nice to eat in a comfortable place. Trust me you will hate it there. NOTE: This hotel was owned by an Italian company and it was recently bought out by H10 which is a mexican hotel chain. Seems to me 65% of the people were from Mexico and it was hard to meet other english speaking people. STAFF: The front desk staff is awful, even if they speak a little English they don't try. If you have any requests (like missing air conditioner remote, shower drain clogged, you know \"small\" things) then you will get blank stares at the front desk. You have to raise your voice if you want anything fixed. Basically changing our room was out of the question for them. The rest of the staff in the kitchen, entertainment, and housekeeping are nice. ROOM: It's just ok, there is much mould accumulating around that does not get cleaned. The bed and the pillows are hard but that's the norm at 4 stars hotels in Mexico. One thing I noticed is that the bed is shorter than king beds here in CAN/USA, my feet were hanging over the edge and I'm only 5' 10\" , with my head close to the headboard. The room smells mouldy unless the AC is on and it's not particulary special. BUILDINGS: This is not a high rise hotel it's made up of 2 story apartment like units. They are currently getting repainted and of course work starts at 7 AM and the ladders and the paint buckets banged the walls of our unit for 3 days straight. If you think you won't be bothered by this you will not escape the Lawnmowers and they will get you at least one day. Our unit was by the beach and there is a 5 min walk to lobby, or any restaurant (except the snack bar by the pool). The grounds are nice but there's a lot of walking around if you get a unit by the beach. FOOD/DRINKS: Folks no matter where you eat, sweat will drip down your face beacuse AC is non existent in any of the restaurants or the Lobby. They have 2 restaurants, buffet and Japanese (GRAND GALA next door has 1 buffet and 3 a la carte) and the Japanese is not good (it was empty most of the time) and the only one left is the Buffet which is OK. The breakfast is weak but the lunch and dinner is good. The snack bar by the pool is ok too. Drinks are watered down as usual. BEACH/POOL: For us this is why we go to Mexico. The beach is ok considering that all the beaches in the area are bad and we have checked them all out by walking them. The beach situation is sad I guess due to the recent hurricanes, it is not your typical clear and blue water and also no waves, but murky and full of seaweed. You will always have a palapa and a good chair to sit on and the sand is nice. They give you free canoe to go out on the water if you want. We actually spent a day in Cozumel's south side where there are waves and the beach is awesome (rent a scooter and ride down to the beaches before CocoNuts restaurant) you will not regret it, then when you come back to Mandarin's beach you won't want to go in. The new pool is nice, but then again what's considered a bad pool? Overall we hated this place, it's 2.5 stars at best, spend a little more and go somewhere else.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAwesome time!\u201d", "Author": "Nestiny", "ReviewID": "UR5709978", "Content": "My boyfriend and I (ages 21) went to H10 El Mandarin from August 6-13. We were both very skeptical about this place because of all the negative reviews that we read. However, the resort exceeded our expectations. I can't understand how people can rate this resort so low and give negative reviews. They must be from another planet or the type of people that complain about everything. This is how it REALLY is: Our room: The room was very spacious and was kept clean every day. I would recommend renting out the safe, which is 2$ a day. Better to be safe than sorry. The bathroom sometimes smelt of sewage, which can be totally normal in any foreign country. All we did was put a few glasses of water down the floor drain. It worked out well. Sometimes we had to take cold showers. The reason, I believe, was because we took showers when everyone else was probably taking showers. Right before dinner after coming off of the beach. Other than those miniscule problems, the rooms were beautiful and private. The beach: Yes, as you have probably have read, the water is not as crystal clear as you will probably expect. But it is definately clean and swimmable. It's just algae...no big deal. And the guys out there work hard to clean it up everyday. If you are looking for a turquoise waters, then take a trip to Playa del Carmen, where there is public access to the beach. The water is breath-taking there. There are plenty of palapas and lounge chairs on the resort Most of them werent even used the entire day. The sand is white and powdery. And Nora brings you drinks all day long, which is nice because it gets very hot out there. The restaurants: I thought the food was good. I tried some things. Liked and disliked. It was buffet style with a lot to select from. If you can't find something in there that you like you must be crazy. I could not get enough of the guacomole. Absolutely delicious. The japanese restaurant was yummy and fun, but you must make reservations. And it gets very hot in there if you choose the Hibachi. The resort only has Corona as their beer. And whoever has said that the beer was watered down is just ridiculous. How can that be possible? If you feel that your mixed drinks are watered down, then just ask for more alcohol or get another drink. It;s all-inclusive, for God's sake. The bartenders are always happy to serve you. Staff: No complaints at all. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Excursions: We wanted to do a bunch of trips, but we ended up doing just one that included almost everything that we wanted to experience. I definately recommend the Coba excursion that AllTourNative offers. It was 112$ booked through the Apple Rep. It was worth way more than what we payed. This excursion is for people that are looking to do a lot of physical and challenging activities. They pick you up at 7 am and you come home around 6pm. You climb pyramids and see the Mayan ruins after bicycling through the trails, zip-line over the jungle and repel off the cliffs, eat in the Mayan village, kayak through a lagoon, hike through the jungle and swim in a cenote, which is an underground river. It was a very tiring day, but well-worth it. A definite must is taking a 7 minute drive to Play del Carmen. Its free by shuttle or the taxi is 12$. This eclectic town is filled with shops, restaurants, artists, music, everything. The beach is one block down, which I mentioned before. If we were to return to the Riviera Maya, we would stay at a small hotel in town instead of a resort. You can experience more of Mexico this way. We ate at The Blue Parrot. It does not serve Mexican food, but it was very tasty and had an awesome atmosphere. I liked this place a lot. The resort does not offer many things to do at night that includes drinking and going crazy. If you want that, I would suggest going iinto Playa. THere are bars everywhere. Or just go to Cancun. Overall, this resort is beautiful and colorful. You should not worry about the small things and just enjoy yourself. You're on vacation!!! Nothing is ever perfect, but this place was close to it. I would go back in a second (if I wanted to the resort-kinda. vacation). Bring a camera!!!

We got there at 3pm which is when check in time is, i asked for two rooms- one with double beds and one with a king- she barely understood English so she just yesed me to death. Only one room was ready- when I asked her where it was she pointed- resorts are huge so pointed really did me no good what so ever. I asked a couple of the workers they had no idea what i was talking about so we were left to wonder around our selves to find it. Once we got to our room we got changed and went back to the front desk to obtain the key for our other room- honestly 15 minutes later- after she finally talked to me, she helped everyone else before me- everyone else that spoke spanish at least. She had no idea what i was talking about- it took about anohter half an hour to get keys and more water and a key for the safe. Once we got back to that room it also had double beds. We made it to the pool finally and found out that the walk was about ten minutes just to get to the beach/pool. We asked to be changed closer to the pool, they said that they would change us the next day but then never mentioned it again. The 2nd pool was open along with the swim up bar so that was nice. The ocean water was gross the first day but after that it seemed to clear up. The buffet area inside was so hot that it was almost unbearable- but the food was not so bad. There was no apple guy at the resort there was only one \"travel person\" to help us, so every morning we had to wait in line to be able to talk to him. WE tried to make reservations at the Japanese palce but they were booked. On the third day my boyfriend got a double ear infection from the water and had to go to the doctor- they charged him $80 just to talk to him and then another $100 for medication which didnt work at all. Our room was filled with tiny little bugs all over the bath room and about the fourth night I got attacked by some sort of bed bug. My legs and arms are stilled covered in honestly hunderds of bites. It was awful- my legs were all puffy and looked as though I had chicken pox or something. The TV never worked and the power went out. When we asked to be switched to a different room they said no and that there was nothing that they could do- NOTHING. We were not able to buy anything in the resort without peso's and everytime we tried to exchange money at the lobby they said to come back later or that they had run out and there was once again nothing that they could do. The main desk people only wanted to talk to you if you spoke spanish along with the entire staff. It was geared more towards people that spoke spanish then anything else. I have been to Mexcio before and never had this problem. I will never go back to this place nor do i advise anyone else to go there. They were doing construction every day in our \"villa\" starting very early in the morning and even casueing them to come into our room a couple of times a day.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cWon't go back\u201d", "Author": "annoymous", "ReviewID": "UR5615288", "Content": "First off , let me say that I am generally easy going and not hard to please, I realize that not all things are perfect and don't expect them to be. We arrived to a hot lobby and our room was not ready. We went to the dining room to eat and it was also hot. The room was hot and never really cooled down. The a/c broke twice, and took hours to get anyone to fix (breaker was thrown). Hardly any of the staff spoke or understood English. When you tried to speak Spanish they just shook thier heads. There was enough hot water for just one person to take a quick shower. The kid's club only spoke Spanish so the English speaking kids did not participate. The beach was full of some brown gunk and seaweed, and it smelled, and you could not even see the bottom in a foot of water. There was no paddle boats, or wind sails, the snorkleling equipment you could get if the dive shop they run on the premises was not on a dive and they ran tours all day and close at five so good luck. I finally got some and could not even see my hands in two feet of water. The food was not that good and the same stuff all week (Guacamole was fabulous though). The shows were ok but not great, there was very little audience particpation. The vendors on the patio were pushy to the point where I would avoid walking by them. There was no disco. I have been on all inclusive vacations before were the staff was friendly, knew you by name, and even if they did not speak really good English, if you tried to speak Spanish to them they would try to talk to you and have a coversation. They would include you and try to get everyone to participate. We do not get to go on vacations very often and when we do I expect to get what I pay for. I paid for a good time, beautiful beach, and friendly people, and I feel ripped off.

Not sure where they found a dirty beach. Yes there was some sea weed, due to the fact that the hotel next door( gala grand esmeralda)'s beach was dirty and full of seaweed ( their customers were coming over to mandarin to swim) - hence the bugs as well. The only problem we had is that the first night we were there, the glass shower door in one of the rooms broke and the glass was all over the floor. It took us a while to make the front desk undersand the seriousness of it and move the people to another room. Otherwise, the entertainment was better than we expected, i loved the live band that would play there every night before the show, the food was good and the mojitos were great. The beach was clean and not crowded, the rooms were nice and clean, and AC'd ( make sure the room has a remote control for the ac since the equipment is new). We showed up to the resort way before the check in time and they were ready to accomodate us. It is a relatively imexpensive hotel and for that price it is of a good value.

It allowed us to interact with the same people everyday and was very easy to make friends. We never had to look for a lounger at the pool or the beach...they were always available. Rooms were very clean and they give you bottled water everyday (our room had a refrigerator also to keep it cold). The grounds were absolutely beautiful and VERY well kept. The bar/restaurant was great. The kids enjoyed the grilled cheeseburgers, fries and chicken nuggets. I LOVED the guacamole. (The best I ever ate). Others have complained the drinks were watered down... duh, ask for more rum/tequila. We had no issues with the drinks, they were to our liking and they also were very plentiful. However, they did not offer top shelf liquor for free. The Japanese restaurant is okay for the meal that is served in courses but I would recommend making reservations to have the chef prepare your meal on the hibachi grill. This was a good show for the kids and the food was GREAT. The buffet always had plenty of fresh food, a big variety and was good. No buffet is ever great. The activity staff was AWESOME. They were extremely friendly, knew us by name... I cannot say enough good things. They have more than enought stuff to keep you entertained.

We were a group of 6. We have been going to all-inclusive resorts for several years, all in the Cancun/Riveria Maya area.

The Japanese restaurant was OK, but who really expects Japanese food in Mexico. All the food areas were plentiful and very clean. There were more beach chairs at this resort than most resorts. One of the bars was very conveniently located next to the pool. It is true what some people say about the drinks being watered down, however I like them like that. The friends I went with would sometimes order doubles/triples, and the bartender readily poured them. Sure, there was some construction going on, however, we knew about it ahead of time, and the employees really did a good job of keeping everything to a miniumum. Our room had a refrigerator, that was supplied with 2 bottles of bottled water everyday. The beds were definately above average for these type resorts. The air-conditioner in the room worked great. Most of the guests were about in the 30-50 year old range, which was great, no loud college kids. The pool was kept clean and was very large. My mother and her friend whom are 75/80 years old, had a little difficult time entering/exiting the pool.

We statyed here from June 17 - 25. I was a bit nervous before I left because of several of the negative reviews I read however I had already booked our tickets. The positives of the hotel are the rooms are very nice and spacious. The staff and service is good and always willing to help you with your needs. The entertainment was above average in my opinion. The last all inclusive had bad entertainment and it was outdoors, this at least had AC. The biggest con for me was the FOOD, it was horrible. I couldnt eat dinner in the buffet. All the meats were overdone and there was nothing appealing. There were only 2 restaurants open, the mexican by the pool and the japanese which is brand new. I am from NY and I know good japanese food and this wasnt it. The mexican was a better option for all dinners. For lunch I would opt for the snack bar, which has great guacamole. Breakfast was decent. If you are a food lover this is not the best place. There was significant construction by the pool and in the lobby which can be a bit distracting but it should be complete by August. The shuttles to playa del carmen were definitely good and you can get some shopping done and beach time in. The beach is clearer at playa del carmen but you get more privacy at the hotels beach. We went on 3 excursions. I would opt for not going snorkeling since there were barely any fish to see and always ask for a discount if you are booking 2 or more and remember to shop around the different tour companies. We booked through apple and there price was higher than the rest so we went for the cheapest even though they said other companies are not allowed to sell to apple tourists. If you are looking for cheaper tequila go to covi in playa del carmen, you will save some cash but remember only 3 bottles per person are allowed back (they didnt check me but better safe than sorry). Alot of cancun and mexico is still recovering from the hurricanes (wilma and rita) so it wont look as pretty as expected but all in all it was a good trip.

Rooms were clean. We had a problem with the shower and the TV and the maintenance people fixed them within 2 hours. Grounds were very clean and beautifully landscaped. Security was always present. There were 2 security guards in the beach area all day. They monitored whose was walking across the beach in front of the hotel. There was never anyone on the beach trying to sell anything. Food was good, (I think you would be hard pressed to find a \u201cGreat Buffet\u201d at any resort). There were a lot of different things to pick from and there were enough different choices each night to make sure things did not get boring. The only construction going on is at the new pool area, and that area is surrounded by a 8 foot high fence so you can\u2019t even see in. There is no damage/construction still going on that would be the result of the hurricane. They have 2 travel company reps that sit in the hotel lobby about 8 hrs a day. You can book all excursions through them. It is nice because you can see what they both have and then they will actually try to under bid each other (We went on a Mayan ruin trip and it started at $88 and we got him down to $65). I was disappointed that they closed the pool side bar after diner. It would have been nice to drink beachside at night. You will not be wowed by the drinks. There is a large selection of \u201ctropical drinks\u201d, but few were worth tasting a second time. They definitely do not over do it on the alcohol. They will be more then happy to give you additional shots, but by default you get the bare minimum. Another thing I did not like was that if you want to use the safe in the room you have to rent a lock for ($15 US).

Both of us are easy to please and not inclined to complain about the little things, however... First of all the accomodations. Day one we were flooded out of our room with a quarter inch of water in the bathroom. After three trips to the front desk over a span of seven hours we finally got moved to another room. Which did not have a functional air conditioner for two nights. After which the room was adequate. Second the drinks. They were in plenty but of very poor quality. Everything was watered down and no matter whether you ordered, rum or vodka or gin or rye, it all tasted like tequila. Third the food. Current theme, bread and cheese with minimal meat, vegetables and fruit. One would think in Mexico that fruit and fish would have been plentiful and of good quality. Fourth the activities. Beware of the very unfriendly harbour staff. The use of aquatic equipment is highly restrictive and limited to thirty minutes a day per room. Fifth the day trip. Both of us have been to the Mayan Riveria before and have had great experiences with day trips. However, the one we chose this time with a company called Don Diego onboard a trimaran sailboat to Isla Mujares was of extremely poor quality for $70 USD and misrepresented as a small casual cruise at the time of booking. It was in fact a jam packed pre-school tour (hand holding all the way). Sixth and most importantly the beach. There was no reef and the water clarity was less than one meter. The beach was not soft and well tended, instead it was always full of seaweed and large pieces of coral. We spent most of our time on beaches in Playa del Carmen which were equally affected by the hurricane. Overall, this resort is by no means three star worthy and we would recommend spending your money elsewhere. In hindsight a much more enjoyable experience would have been to stay at a hotel in Cozumel and eat at the local restaurants.", "Date": "April 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cA 2 star at best - Full On Construction Site!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5009287", "Content": "For anyone considering this hotel as a possibility - DON'T! Prior to our arrival we were assured that the hotel was fully operational and that construction was minimal. Upon arriving there was litterally a jack hammer ripping things up outside our room (even though we told them to put us as far away from the construction as possible construction is everywhere!) If you're still not deterred, make your way to the \"beach\" - 1/2 of what it supposedly once was due re-development and the hurricane. Murky water and people on top of each other. Not to mention that they are working on the septic system so it smells like S&*!! everytime the wind blows. As you're resting in a hammock, don't be surprised to hear the sweet sound of a busy buzz saw and the clang of a hammer. Stay clear of the bobcat that drives up and down the beach and make sure to watch out for the cement truck! (I felt sorry for the people getting married here - how grim!) When you've had enough and have finally decided that you can't stand it anymore go for a walk up & down the beach ... not pretty. Construction and filth as far as the eye can see. The grassy area by the pool was replaced by plywood to sheild the parked trucks and jack hammer. If you're looking to visit a full on smelly construction site this is the place for you. I don't know about you, but when I go on vacation, the last thing I want is to bring the sounds and smells of a busy city with me. I want to hear the crash of waves and want to be able to shut my eyes and relax without worrying that someone is going to trip over me on my 2 feet of designated real estate. Food: My dog eats better. The beef was cooked til it was black! Flies gallore. Drinks: Watered down. When we were unfortunate enough to check in we had to ask the maid or whoever she was 4 times to get off the phone so we could settle into our room. Even the shower was a disappointment - the water's not filtered so if you like salt, you'll be showering in it! Worse yet, although Air Transat finally moved us to a great resort it was a huge hassel. One employee promised we'd be moved the next day because in his opinion the place should not have been up and running in the state it was at but when we saw him the next day he told us he couldn' help us cuz it was his \"day off\". The other Air Transat employe hadn't ventured past the lobby and looked helpless when we complained. We wasted 2 days of our vacation trying to get ourselves out of this nightmare of a resort. Choice is yours. I'd spend the extra cash (which you will have to anyways if you're lucky enough to get moved) + spend a small fortune on cab fare to get out of this hell hole.

We declined and advised we will pay cash for any additional charges and this annoyed the gentlemen at the front desk and he threw the paper back at us. But we tried to keep an open mind. The rooms were great very clean and we got lots of bottled water. The cable was pretty fuzzy but we weren\u2019t there to watch TV and when the TV broke they had it fixed in 5 minutes. The food was pretty good and there was lots of it but nothing was ever hot at the buffet and we were there as soon as it opened. The biggest disappointment was the construction. The Disco was closed for renovations. They were building a restaurant/kids club on the beach. At the other end of the beach where our room was they were drilling holes and by the end of the week had pile wood walls up everywhere and there went our view. The noise was not too bad but it was there. So for anyone planning on going in the near future beware of the construction.

One thing to note is that they do not stress energy and environment savings as some other hotels in the area. There was even more lounges on the beach and around pool then there was in Bahia (which is a 5 star). I guess they are either reading the comments and working hard on being better place to stay. I am curious - if it is always windy on Mayan Riviera? Or is it only in April? Please share your weather experiences.

The hotel's beach is not very nice, the water is not clear and some odors make it not appealing. We took a walk every day and went swimming to a nicer place five minutes away(we did not mind). I suppose that the hurricane last fall was responsible for that. A month before, I stayed at the Barcelo and the water was very clear. If you want to sit under a palapa, you will have to get up before 6 a.m. to put your towels on the chairs. The swimming pool is not big compared to other hotels I stayed.

The snack bar does not offer much choice so we went to the main restaurant even for lunch (had to get dressed). We tried the two \"a la carte\" restaurants (mexican and international) and it was average. There is a lack of ambiance there. The tables are much apart from each other and no music. They don't take reservation, you have to wait in line to get a table (first 50 peoples only). The buffet restaurant offers a good choice every day. Only once there was a theme for the buffet; it was a mexican night with the visit of mariachis. The animation was less than average; there was about six persons on the team. We didn't like the shows very much (very amateur) and the place was almost empty each night; people entered and got out after a few minutes. On the other hand there was live music outside, before and after the shows. We danced every night and it was the place to be at night. The phones started to work just shortly after we arrived.

Before we left we didn't find many reviews of this place and I rely on other people's opinion before I go somewhere. The first thing we encountered that bothered me was at the Cancun airport. When you're making your way to your bus, a number of very legitimate looking representatives approach you as if you are expected to go with them. They get behind their official looking posts and then bring out brochures of places to go and sites to see, all for a very reasonable rate..\"better than any other deal around\" they spew. Do not go with them..it's about time share condominiums; and while you may get something a little cheaper you will have to spend up to 4 hours sitting through one of their sales pitches. So the Club El Mandarin..we arrived at 11am and could not get our room until 3pm. Although this place is kept clean they just don't have enough people where they should. The buffet is crowded most of the time and the waiters are run off their feet clearing dishes mostly. The tables are usually dirty unless you get there right when they open. And the food is left out for almost 4 hours at a time..be careful to go early. I don't care how well they keep things hot..the pancakes were hardly warm so I'm guessing the meat can't be kept safely hot either..just logic to me. The a la cart upstairs has the exact same number of waiters for a quarter of the volume of people..hmmm? No reservations needed upstairs but they pretty well have 2 sittings (6:30 and 8)No shorts allowed aswell as no sandals for the guys. The Mexican a la cart down by the beach (opens at 7pm)serves terrible food. During the day that beach restaurant has fast food noon until around 5..not too bad tasting. I did have tummy troubles from day one but eased off near the end of our trip. Now here's the part that I cringe about..there are steps and stairs everywhere at this place. Everywhere! And in the 2 weeks we were there I witnessed 3 people fall badly (older and also younger people). I saw another man with a fresh gash on his leg too. I'm not normally a negative person but I have to be honest because that's what I appreciate about other reviews. The phones don't work in your room and the phones in the lobby to call out were out of order or you couldn't hear the person on the other end properly. The outings we went on through the representatives in the lobby were falsely advertised. We did go into Playa Del carmen with another couple in a taxi and that was great..watch out for vendors they always ask for twice what the item is worth..just walk away. And we rented a taxi and went to Xcaret which we LOVED!! It cost us less than the tour offered and we did what we wanted and came back when we had enough..no stupid wasted stops for shopping at ridiculously priced places. Tulum is beautiful too but we should have done that on our own too. The Transat flight was great and the Rep' Alex was very helpful. He warned us that 'there aren't any sharks in the water to worry about only the sharks walking the streets'. They don't have 5 kids to feed, they're doing very well apparently. And the bartender Jose, who I chatted with in the mornings while he made cappuccinos. He was the sweetest, friendliest guy in the world and he made our stay there pleasant..along with a few other fun guests. The recreation team can be annoying with their microphone anctics but I watched them interacting with the kids and they've 'got it'. The one show we stayed up for was very well done, they are quite talented musically. So that's it..oh and the coffee and tea machine by the bar is the hottest..the waiters typically serve luke warm coffee. Hope this was not too depressing for those of you going..we did have a wonderful time despite our surroundings.", "Date": "February 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "york", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "kimdon", "ReviewID": "UR4458802", "Content": "I had a group of 35 people stay the week of January 28 - February 4, 2006.

How badly did this affect our trip.... Nil. There are phones in the lobby which is just a short and beautiful walk away (the grounds are quite beautiful and well kept). We were not there to watch TV and spent so little time in our room to be bothered by this smell everyone writes about. As far as the bank machines, well that was inconvenient a couple times, but again not a big deal. As far as the chairs, we would take turns and one of us would quickly get up go down to the beach, put a towel on the chairs and then be back in bed, all in about 5 min, then it was right back to sleep. Some of the good things were definetely the people working there, clean rooms, good food and plenty of beautiful scenery. Everyone, starting from the front desk, to the room maids, to Baltazar the awesome bartender, to the fabulous entertainment and activities group, managed to make our stay a pleasant one. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Loved it! Especially Cuco, Israel, Lupita, Eric, Manolo, Alex Madeline and everyone else (you know who you are)you guys are awesome. We want to thank them for making us have so much fun. Between the 3 restaurants, there are enough choices of food to not have the same food all the time. It was never cold and always quite tasty. There is enough of a variety to please everyone. The beach is quite beautiful, and although a little rocky here and there, some water shoes can fix that problem. Overall, our stay was a pleasant one.

The hotel is in need of some work I believe due to it's age. It's a dated hotel. The interlocking around the pool is falling apart and uneven. You had to pay attention as you walked so that you wouldn't trip and fall. There were not enough chairs around the pool. Not enough tables and chairs around the out door bar or at the snack bar. Seceral of the pool tiles and hot tub tiles were missing. Water in hot tub is not hot. There is NO kids club. When I called to book my vacation I was advised it was available. It is NOT available. The building that housed the kids club was damaged by the hurricane and is under repair. The food was good. We actually liked the food. Rooms were clean no problems. Power sometimes went out but really was no problem. Phones in room didn't work, but we never needed the phones. Pillows were hard, but thats like most hotels. Sometimes the water was cold when having a shower but by the end of the trip water was always warm if not hot. All staff work very hard and deserve tips !!! Beach is ok. Wide beach area nice sand but, the water colour was very disappointing. It's not that nice brilliant blue nor can you see your feet in the ocean. When you go to Cancun you want nice clear water to play in. I asked a staff member why and was advised the hotel is located in a bay and the ocean water gets pushed into the bay and turns up the sand. They had a nightly band which was great ! People hung out in the lobby area and it was nice. Be prepared to do lots of walking from your room to the main eating and lobby area and than to the pool/beach area. If you are elderly it will be difficult. We had to drag our very heavy luggage from the main lobby area down a flight of stairs across the resort to our unit and than up two flights of stairs. The bus trip from the airport to our hotel took 2 hours. It might be a 45 minute drive but the tour company also had several other groups to drop off at other hotels. You may want to pay the extra and take a taxi. I would not return to this hotel for two reasons the ocean water is not clear and very sandy. You cannot see what is in the water. You step on several sharp rocks, there were crabs. Fine if there are crabs but if you could see where you are stepping you could avoid them.

(Jan 7-21,2006). I had read previous reviews of this resort and talked to my travel agent as well. I had some reservations on this resort given the negative reviews but decided that I would go with an open mind and then decide. We have never travelled before so we had no real expectations- although I knew it was not a 5 star and so I was not expecting that. We arrived at 1;30 in the morning and had no problems with check in. We were in villa 3506 which was close to the pool/beach but a nice walk to the main building and such. Our room was nice-- we did find it had the sewer smell but we ended up putting in a couple of cups of water in the floor drain and it cleared up the problem. We never had any bugs and such. The Tv was a hit and miss thing but we did not come to watch TV. We talked to the front desk staff and they'd fix it right away. The room phones were not working but it wasn't a big deal to us. If you needed a wake up call the staff would come to your room at the arranged time to wake you up. It would have been nice to have a clock radio. Our villa was fairly quiet. They were doing construction on a new resort so at times you could hear the trucks and such but it really didn't bother us. The beach area was awesome, they were working on repairing the dock while we were there and it was near completion when we left. I never got bite but I did see some people with bites. You had to get up early to get a chair but I have had friends who have gone to other resorts and had to do the same thing. I don't know how resorts can improve on this other than assigning chairs when you arrive and you keep those chairs for the time you are there-- maybe they could have room numbers on the chairs. the resort definitely needs to invest in more lounge chairs. We didn't mind getting up a bit early to get the chairs. The pool area was nice-- nothing fancy. the pool bar did stay open after 6pm because they were using the snack area as the Mexican Al a Carte . We went twice to this al a carte and enjoyed it. during the time we stayed you did not need reservations. We had no problem getting in on the 2 occasions were went. We also went to the other al a carte twice-- the first time we did have a long wait but we weren;t in a hurray anyhow. It was nice to be served . My husband had the steak and it was a flank steak. I had pork tenderloins the first time and a chicken dish the 2nd time and they were both okay- nothing outstanding. You could order lobster but it was $33 US. the buffet was a buffet, there were some dishes that I didn't enjoy but how do you make 700 people happy-- you can't. I found enough on the buffet to eat but after 2 weeks you do get tired of seeing the same dishes. Yes sometimes the food was not piping hot and yes sometimes the buffet was busy but don't go right at 7pm or 12;30pm and you can generally find a table. The first week we were there it was busier than the 2nd week. I would suspect by the end of Jan into Feb it will be really busy. We never had any problems with the front desk staff. We also found that the grounds were well kepted and they were always cleaning and keeping things tidy. the lobby bar was nice but it got busy at 6pm so you had to wait a bit -but you are on vacation so does it matter. They maybe should have a few more bartenders at that time. The pool bar was busy at times as well but we'd watch for a lull in the line and then get our drinks-- it wasn't a big deal to us. nora was great and she would bring drinks down to the beach and pool area a couple of times a day. We took our own go cups because they do serve the drinks in plastic cups. The beer was draft - my husband would have preferred bottled beer. (we went into playa and picked up some beer for our rooms so it wasn't that big of a deal) I didn't find the drinks watered down as some people claim but the booze is not premium brand. The pool bar was open after 6pm so you could get a drink there and sit by the pool if you wanted. I found the nights a bit chilly and always wore a sweater or light jacket. I can't comment too much on the activities during the day because I didn't participate much. I did the stretching in the morning and I did the water aerobics. They had spanish lessions and dance lessons by the pool. You just had to listen. It would have been nice to have a posting of the activities and a scheduled time. The entertainment staff were very friendly and they mingled well which was nice. The nightly shows were okay-- we only attended 3 only because we were generally too tired to go-- they started at 9:45. We did go to the disco one night-- it started at 11;30-- a bit too late for me. It's geared more for the younger 20's crowd but we did enjoy it. We went into playa a couple of times-- we were always able to get the free shuttle but you do have to book-- I suspect in the next few weeks it will get harder to book only because the resort will be full. The cab is only $12 each way. We booked a tour to Xel Ha and enjoyed the day. We talked to a couple of people who rented a vehcile for a couple of days and did the tours on their own and it was definitely cheaper but you have to be a brave sole to drive!!!!! We also booked a snorkeling/catamaran day with Rudy from the beach- it left from cancun-- the trip ended up being cancelled because of the weather but we were able to get a refund from Rudy. But I am sure some tours you wouldn't get a refund. Additional trips are costly. I was a bit disappointed as to where the resort was-- there is only one other resort by it at this time-- Secrets Capri but they are building other resorts. apparently Club El Manadrin is under new ownership-- just recently so they are going thru a transition period. The new owners were on the resort while we were there so I am sure they are aware of the complaints/concerns. We did have some electrically issues during our stay but it could happen to any resort. We all have to remember this area was devasted by the hurricane and they are still working on rebuilding and it is a long process. We were able to keep our room until 3pm but this is hit and miss depending on how many people are checking in on that day. Check out is noon normally. We were grateful to be able to keep the room til then. We had no problems at check out time. I can't say if this resort meets the criteria for a 4 star rating because I have nothing to compare it to. I think a week here would have been suffient but it all depends on what you want to do. We might try another all inclusive but only for a week and then spend a week at a regular hotel or condo and enjoy restaurants.

He would not listen to us as we tried to tell him that our travel agent did indeed request the rooms. Next time I will bring a copy of the confirmation sheet that my agent usually sends us. Even the Transat Representative, Genevieve, who listened to our problem about the rooms did nothing in the end. She also tried to blame our travel agent by saying that she had no request for our elderly mother's request. We never heard from her again. We have never encountered this problem in our years of travelling.

When we first arrived we were disappointed that the hotel was not fully operational. The restaurant next to the pool was without a roof and the ground was littered with logs & tools. However, it was fixed & up & running for the second week. The phones in the rooms dont work but how much do you need the phone anyway? The Guest Services was very good about letting you use their phone if required. We also found that unless we all showered before 7:30am, there was no hot water. We did mention it to the front desk twice and the next day it was hot, but after that it was always cold. We just lived with it, its so hot out anyway it was not a big deal. The night shows start at 9:45pm which we found to be quite late. Our 12yr old was kept pretty busy with the kids club & loved the young lady, Madeline that ran it, but our 14yr old was somewhat bored. He did get into some games of volleyball and soccer but overall there is not much for the teens. Our son cut his foot on some sharp tiles in the pool and we witnessed at least 3 other people who also got cut, one who needed stitches, so be careful. Wow, when I read back the review it doesnt sound very good but it was great! The maid did a fabulous job cleaning & we made sure to tip everyday rather than at the end of the week in case it was her day off. We felt much better about tipping at this resort. It was always appreciated but never expected. The staff were as friendly to our kids as they were to us. All the staff were great! We learned a lot more about the people on this trip compared to our past vacations. We dont ever go back to the same cities we've visited before but we would definately recommend this hotel.

We are two women in our early forties, who have both travelled a fair bit in the Caribbean.(I think this was my 11th all-inclusive trip). Although I have stayed at more glamorous resorts than the El Mandarin, I must say that I enjoyed it very much. Here is a bit of a breakdown of my observations: Beach: I am a beach lover, so a nice beach is important to me - and El Mandarin delivered. I am also very light skinned, and burn easily, so having shade is important. I think I counted approx. 30 palapas on the beach - more than adequate to cover the needs of clients travelling in the off-season. Food: This is always subject to great disagreement by travellers. I found the food good (not excellent, but good)with plenty of choice. The main buffet restaurant has theme nights every night, and we enjoyed this. As a previous reviewer noted, the buffet restaurant has exceptionally good ice cream (more like gelato actually). Coconut, chocolate and maple walnut were out of this world! Pool: The pool was certainly adequate to the needs of clients, but was not overly large or glamorous as you might find in newer resorts (i.e., like Iberostar Paraiso, where I stayed a few years ago- that is an amazing pool!). Evey second day I took part in the water aerobics classes, which were good fun, and it got me up off my beach chair. Room: Our room was very good - clean spacious and comfortable. The air conditioning worked very well as did the television. The room was cleaned well every day. No complaints here. The grounds/layout of the resort: This is something I especially liked. The resort, as others have noted, is extremely clean and the grounds well-maincured with beautiful flowers and shrubs. The lobby is spacious and has a fair of amount amount of seating (they could do with a few ceiling fans, though. The lobby bar is large and L -shaped and if you go to the end nearest the buffet you will find a coffee maker, as well as a self-serve selection of brandy, cognac, tequila, amaretto and xabentun (licorice - flavoured liqueur, which is excellent). I thought this was a wonderful touch. You could also get a great capuccino at the lobby bar. Due to the fact that is was the off-seadon, we never waited more than a minute or two for our drinks - bar staff was very pleasant at all times, and we tipped them occaisionally. The thing I enjoyed the most about the resort was the kind of open air terrace that they had just outside the lobby. You feel as though you are in an open air plaza, with tiled floors, and wrought iron tables and chairs. A fabulous Mexican band played there every evening, and many people got up to dance.Waiters also came out from the bar to take your drink orders. You can walk the length of the resort from reception desk to beach in about 6 minutes - which further added to the friendly casual atmosphere of the place. Staff and Service: We thought that the staff were very polite and friendly, and we never encountered a problem.The animation team in particular, really when out of their way to get you involved in activities, but did so in a friendly, not pushy manner. One day a member of the team came to our beach chairs to give us a spanish lesson - we really liked that. We also tried out the salsa and merengue lessons. The waitstaff, barstaff and others were equally pleasant - no problems there. As a general comment I would very much recommend this resort for its overall quality, comfort and casual but friendly atmosphere. I do think however, that due to its size, it might be too small to adequately accomodate a high-season crowd. I would also not stay there in the summer months due to the fact that the public areas would be too hot (no ceiling fans in the buffet and lobby as others have noted). As a final note, I wanted to mention that our tour company moved up our flight due to the impending arrival of hurricane Wilma. Our thoughts are with the guests and staff who may not have been able to leave. Whatever damage this beautiful area sustains, I know that it will recover quickly and be ready to welcome back visitors from all over the world.", "Date": "October 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CHICAGO", "Title": "\u201ci love it\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4043261", "Content": "i love stayed on this hotel i think this is not a very elegant hotel but it's perfect for a few nigths. i hope come back some day...and i think i will. the staff was great with me and my family....and also the food was good, and the show every night...good. i sure recomend this hotel...", "Date": "October 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel - Excellent relation price/quality\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3987775", "Content": "We stayed during 2 weeks in Club El Mandarin.

I must say that I was pleasently surpirsed by the Club El Manadarin. Based on the many critical reviews previously written, I wasn't expecting much. The grounds were beautiful, the rooms were pretty standard but very well cleaned on a daily basis. The maids fully mopped the floors every day which was good for us as we had a 14 month old baby who liked to crawl around on the floor. Don't be discouraged by the negative reports on the food. The food was good and I don't know what they could of done more with the buffet (tones of selection). I noticed food inspectors regularly checking the temperature of the food and checking for it's freshness. I never got an upset stomach which was a first for me down in Mexico. The ice cream was absolutely amazing better than the gelato I have had in Italy. The food servers were pleasant and helpful too. The a la carte restaurant was ok but nothing to rave about as we mostly ate at the buffet restaurant. The beach is fabulous and even better if you walk for ten minutes to the south. Yes, there is some sea weed but who cares as it is a beach!!! On the negative side, there were tones on mosquitos and little black flies (obviously not a fault of the resort) and I got bitten to death. You must bring bug spray. Also, they are stingy on leaving bottled water in your room. Also, the plastic drink cups are small. The lobby and restaurants can get a little hot due to the lack of A/C. In conclusion, don't be discouraged by the previous negative reviews as I guess there are many people out there who need to complain.

The grounds were immaculate and rooms very private with beautiful garden views. The staff was very courteous and accomodating. The breakfast buffet and meals at the restaurants were also very good. The snack bar by the beach was unimpressive, although they did have a constant supply of fresh chips and guacamole, which was excellent. Prior to our trip, I read through all of the posted reviews and I must say that a lot of the negative comments were unjustified. (Some travelers will always find something to complain about.) For example, many reviews mentioned a foul smell throughout the grounds. In reality, this smell was neither overwhelming nor offensive. In fact, had I not read about it, I would not have even noticed it, as it was a smell typical of a bay or beach. The one and only disappointment was the beach: a lot of debris on the shore and in the water, making it very murky and unsuitable for swimming or snorkeling. It was near impossible to find a beach or pool chair, let alone an empty hammock. There was also not much shade in the beach/pool areas, and when you have skin as fair as mine, this can definitely be a problem. Luckily, my boyfriend and I are not much for the beach scene and spent most of our days outside the resort. We loved the town of Playa del Carmen, which has a nice promenade with excellent restaurants and shops. The beach in Playa del Carmen was beautiful. You can catch the ferry to Cozumel right in town, which I highly recommend doing if you are interested in good snorkeling. Other day trips I recommend are Coba/Pac Chen and Tres Rios, an ecopark located within a few minutes' walk up the beach from Club El Mandarin. Overall, Club El Mandarin was an excellent value for the money, and it suited our purposes just fine. Again, not luxury, but if you are on a budget and looking for a reasonably nice place to stay and don't mind the condition of the beach, Club El Mandarin is a good choice. If I go again, I'd prefer to stay in town. However, if your main goal is to be pampered, lay on the beach, swim, and soak up the sun the entire time, this may not be the right place for you.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cEl Mandarin is average\u201d", "Author": "Csora2547", "ReviewID": "UR3703045", "Content": "If you have never been to an all-inclusive in Mexico then this hotel would be OK.

The fine dining place took two plus hours to eat at. IT IS NOT WORTH THE TIME OR FOOD unless you want to eat some place cool. We had also planned on lobster or steak. They wanted $38 for lobster and $24 for steak.

Trip to Resort: No problems - other guests who had stayed there before got driver to stop for Corona on the way so we started the trip with beers! Resort is beautiful, great gardens, well kept, the check in was smooth and the people are very friendly, rooms were spacious and clean - few TV channels - but I can watch TV at home. AC and power went out for a few hours the first night but came back on by the time we were ready to crash...I think this is more a function of the outdated power grids in the region not the hotel. Food at the buffets was very good, plentiful...if you are there for a week and don't leave the resort you will get tired of it...they always offer rice, beans, pasta, tortillas - but they do a pretty good job of mixing it up. Listening to previous reviews I expected the Animation Team to be dragging people out of the pool, the music to be like lounging in a disco and the pool to have an oil slick.... NOT THE CASE - they were friendly but not pushy, the music was moderate and the pool was clean. Beach is beautiful, can literally see fish swimming at your feet, they will swarm around you if you feed them bread. People were cleaning up the seaweed all day.... hey it's a BEACH, get over it. Plenty to do, plenty of cocktails, friendly staff we'd definitely go back.... Our other recommendation is \"FAT CAT\" - this catamaran trip was great, snorkeling, sun, good food.... we booked through the travel agent in the lobby (we chose not to use Apple) Our other trip was the day trip to Chitzen Itza - great tour, booked again through the agent there - it's run by Cancun Lines - they were great and saw a lot before we got there too. We went for R & R, had time to rest and still had a great time", "Date": "July 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockville, MD", "Title": "\u201cSo So ..\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3636843", "Content": "Here are the facts ..

There were 3 families, all with kids in our travel party. Our hotel selection was made, largely with the help of reviews on this site. Thanks to the large number of helpful accurate reviews (there are some surprising negatives, but even those (with coherent spelling at least) seem to have legitimate, albeit minor gripes). My wife and I are from Europe, but have lived in US for over 15 years. This was our 5th visit to Mayan Riviera, first time at this hotel. We would recommend El Mandarin, and will probably visit again some time. Entire staff was extremely friendly from front desk checkin, to water sport/scube centre (even Edgars gruff sidekick). Clientel was very cosmopolitan (German, British, French, Belgian, Canadian, even a few Americans). This was a good thing, especially for us expats, making it feel like we were back in European resort. Overall friendly bunch, some radical dress/swimwear choices (or lack thereof) Overall resort is extremely well maintained. Spacious open reception, Bungalows freshly painted, gardens spectacular and well kept. Internally rooms were very nice, but not perfect. Pool area is a little bit worn, but Palapa were being reworked, as was some poolside tile during our visit. Overall, there were slight signs of aging, but no areas of neglect. We were pleasantly surprised in this regard, having read some review comments. Food was good overall. A lot of variety in buffet, but similar every night. Mexican resaurant by pool was quiet, but still slow for dinner. Breakfast and lunches were fine. Our party could not get into a la carte restaurant because of long trouser/closed toed show dress code (our poor planning). Poolside lunches were tasty, albeit a little greasy looking. All 11 in our party got through 5 days of eating without tummy incidents, and kids in particular found something they could all enjoy. Drinks were as good, or better than any other Mayan resorts we have visited. Any beer you like as long as its Corona (not too bad), knockoff brand liqours that were fine. Activities were good and frequent. Watersports excellent (hobie cat use included was a nice touch). Poolside eurpop was a bit grating after a while. Staff were very eager to get crowd involvement in pingpong, basketball, soccer, dance lessons, etc. We had mixed attendance for the evening shows, which did seem very late (9.45pm seemed a lot later down there). Staff did put huge amount of effort (same crew doing early morning activities, who were performing in evening shows). There are a few negatives, but these were for the most part minor. We had AC drain clog in our room on 2nd day, and caused some minor flooding (2 beach towels was enough to absorb the drips from AC wall unit. Repair guy showed up quickly and fixed problem. This was not a big deal, but could have been disaster if we had anything sitting under AC unit (I moved my ipod just before water came in)... Beach was very nice, but waters a bit too rough for snorkeling (sand being kicked up). This was the ONLY item that left us longing for our prevous Cozumel resort. Probably single biggest concern was overall cooling of public areas in resort. Air conditioning seemed minimal in restaurant, and ineffectual in lobby (completely open air on two sides). Our family have a pretty high tolerance for heat (spending a lot of the time in our backyard in Austin, Texas), but would probably only consider this resort outside of midsummer heat. I would recommend El Mandarin. Its not perfect (I have not visited a resort in Americas/Europe/Asia that is). Our family got more than we expected for the price we paid.

However, the A/C worked, there was no sewage smell in our room, and the shower water was hot. If you have booked a stay with them already, you will survive. If you are debating on staying here - only do so if the price is very cheap (under a $1,000 total - I paid $807 which included taxes and airfare). The food - I ate in the main restaurant in the lobby area. The food was fine. I did eat quite a few french fries to fill me up though. Their meat selection was decent and the ice cream was good. The drinks - I'm over the party days, but drank a few mixed drinks - horrible. I didn't drink any beer, but it's probably the better option here. The mixed drinks tasted like kool-aid. The staff - The staff at the resort are not friendly. The entertainment staff pretty much walked around trying to look cool. They were really not friendly. The activities - lame. Kids would probably dig it though. The beach - There was seaweed, but it was cleaned up every morning. There were quite a few cigarette butts in the sand. The beach smelled like sewage really bad one day (I think it was because it rained the night before). Also, there were quite a few topless women on the beach. The room - the room was okay. There were ants hanging out in the sink area. They were tiny and only discovered the toothpaste on the last day. The tv worked, but the channels were few and far between. We didn't have towels one day, but otherwise the room was cleaned daily (the maid did a good job). I did the tour to Chitzen-Itza through the tour guy in the lobby. It was worth the money. If you do it though - keep in mind it takes 3 hours to get there and it is in a jungle (hot and humid with poisonous snakes and poisonous trees). The tour guide was really good. It costs $3 to take a van to and from Playa del Carmen ($3 each way per person). The taxi cost $10 and was definetly more fun than the van ride. 5th Ave in Playa has a lot of tourist shops.

This was our second trip to Playa Del Carmen, we stayed at the Riu Palace in Playacar two years ago. Having the benefit of staying in a first class resort like the Riu Palace, I was better able to put Club El Mandarin in better perspective. Here's the bottom line folks, ya get what ya pay for! I liken the Riu Palace to the Ritz-Carlton and Club El Mandarin to a Holiday Inn. Club El Mandarin is affordable because it affords less of the finer things that people may want on their vacation. #1)Staff- Contrary to what people have said previously, the workers were not all \"Great\". The front desk workers seemed aloof when you asked them questions and were a tad disorganized. The grounds crew took several days to find a palm branch strewn across the walkway just outside of our room. The bartenders did a decent job but were prone to give preferential treatment to locals who spoke the language and \"marble bag\" wearing customers who were inclined to cut in front of you at the bar. #2)Food- The food at the beach restaurant was okay, they served the same breakfast daily (eggs, bacon, sausage etc.) and lunch (hamburgers, hot dogs, chips and salsa etc). We were there for 7 days so after about day three, I found my appetite was wavering a bit with the thought of having the same things again! The food in the Lobby restaurant was buffet style where they would have different themes nightly. I found just about everything they made was very bland and not very fun to look at. One positive was that the desserts were delicious and the ice cream was fantastic! Quetzal is the finer dining restaurant that is upstairs from the lobby. Though we only dined there twice, my wife and I found this to be the best place to eat. Surprisingly, they were never busy and we were immediately seated both times. The food was very good, the house wine was delicious and the service was great. For any future visitors to this resort, Quetzal is a must! #3) Amenities- First of all, I saw reviews in the past saying that you could request an \"ocean view\" room. Oh yeah, tou can request an \"ocean view\" room for an extra $30 a night! Personally I think if you pay for your package ahead of time, you should be entitled to an identical room regardless of location. Like I said earlier, this is like a Holiday Inn as far as resorts go. The room was nice, their was a king bed and a couch, there was a nice size closet and we had a very little patio area with bird poop all over it. The bathroom was okay, there was an occasional sewery smell in there and I still don't know how you use one of those bidets, kinda scares me. Pool, the pool wasn't bad. There are plenty of sun chairs around the pool and aside from some greasy film I saw a couple of times, it was nice. Let me make something very clear to people who find this essential, there is no swim up bar! I was a tad disappointed as I think this is a nice addition to a resort. Beach, the beach was adequate. The water is clear in spots but there is a fair amount of seaweed floating around and if you're afraid of fish like my wife, you'll not like being in the water as there are schools of fish that swim around you while you're out there. I must say the staff does do a great job raking the seaweed as it is quite a task. Also, for those who enjoy a beverage or two, there is not a bar right on the beach as you'll find at some resorts. Yes the pool bar is only about a minute away but when you're being lazy on your getaway, it's nice to walk 20 feet to the bar rather than throwing on your shoes and fighting through pool traffic. #4) Guests- Folks, as I said earlier, there are different class resorts and this one having reasonable prices has a more \"mixed\" crowd. It goes without saying that some people (most are wearing speedos) have never been taught that if someone is waiting at the bar or in line at the buffet you simply DO NOT step in front of them. I had bite my tongue numerous times as I patiently waited for a drink and some guy or girl would nonchalantly walk in front of me as if I wasn't there. Also, I may be crazy but it seemed like the majority of the guests smoked. I don't judge people on their vices but when they light up in the middle of breakfast, your vice is now mine! The lobby is a happening place in the evening, as my wife and I would go to and from dinner we would be inundated with smoke as most of the people in the lobby were lighting up. If you're looking for a relaxing time, enjoy your days during the week, because I'm not sure if the hotel slashes it's rates on the weekend or what but for Friday and Saturday there was a HUGE influx of new people who basically took over the pool and made for long lines at the bar and made it very difficult to find a table in the beach restaurant. To summarize (and you may be suprised by this next comment after reading my review), my wife and I had a GREAT time! We had adequate service, a decent beach to spent our days relaxing, sunning and reading. I would recommend this to other travelers with the words of caution that this is not a first class resort but a decent resort that is worth the money.

Ask for a \"Mamasita\", a redish drink that tastes a little like a Pina Colada, only better! The staff was very friendly, often joining us during the evening parties. The only one thing I can say really troubled me was being without electricity and without A/C. I've done plenty of travel to Latin America and the Caribbean, so I've been a few times without electricity in several places, but at Club El Mandarin there was a power failure just about every night during my 8 day stay. On our third night, we realized that the hotel was shutting down the power. Maybe they could not handle being at maximum occupancy? Either case, we saw the maintenance crew going around and shutting down the power, but when we asked we were told that they were \"resetting the breakers\". We didn't buy this story!

It could be a bit more open as it has sliding glass doors but they choose to keep the air conditioning on. The food there is great. Mostly buffet but in the A.M., there's a chef cooking omlets any way you like them. The cafe con leche is wonderful also!! The Restaurant El Mandarin by the pool is perfect buffet style for lunch and a full service restaurant for dinner. That is where we had dinner most nights because it's by the beach and has the ocean breezes!! They have an all inclusive menu or a purchase price menu to choose from if you eat dinner there. We never strayed from the all inclusive menu and were never dissatisfied. The people working at the resort are wonderful. Please feel free to tip them although your travel agent may say there is no need. They will remember you and if you're outgoing, they're bound to remember you by name! Drinks were not watered down that I could tell but if you tip them, I'm sure you'll get stronger ones!! Our room was wonderful. Our bed was firm, but not rock hard. We had a bidet in the bathroom and the shower was plenty big with lots of hot water! We had a T.V. (didn't watch it), a couch, coffee table and a huge closet with both shelves and drawers!! There was a coffee machine also but the cafe con leche in the dining room was better. Also, we used the safe in the room for $2 per day. No complaints here. It's still half the price of the Iberostar! We participated in activities on the beach like volleyball, soccer/football, aerobics classes and utilized the activity hut for the kayak and the windsurfing. The folks recruiting for the games and classes are so enthusiastic and are a blast to deal with. We went into town one time on the shuttle. It's $3 per person one way. We went late in the day and took a taxi home. Make sure you clarify with any cabbie as to the fee for you trip before you get in the cab. Is the fee he's quoting for one or two people? Is he clear as to where you wish to go? Playa is a neat town, lots to do but tons of merchants yelling to you to come look at their wares. You can haggle with them if you want to and get a better deal. There are merchants with silver and t-shirts, etc. who come to the resort two times per week if you don't want to go into town. The show we saw at the resort was cute. Lots of audience participation and silliness. We are not club type people so don't know how the night life compares to that of Playa in town. There is a ton to do at night in Playa Del Carmen though. The beaches are beautiful at the resort! I'm going to try to include some pictures although I've been having some trouble getting them onto the TripAdvisor site in the past. The smell everyone speaks of seems to be the seaweed that is dumped just off the property. We smelled it too but not in our room or anything. Just when the wind blew a certain way. When we investigated, it really seemed to be all the seaweed that was cleaned off the beach and dumped just off site. Not too offensive, just noticeable. There are visitors from all over coming to this area!! We met folks from Europe, Canada and the U.S. Quite a nice mix! Everyone was nice! Hope this helps you decide!

This resort has solidified our decision to not bother going back to all-inclusives ever again as we find that we relax more when we just go to a little village and stay at a hotel and hang out with the locals. Nonetheless, I'll break it down for you: Bars: Lobby bar is great and the staff there are nice. Most nights they have a live band playing and they really get the place hopping. Saw lots of couples dancing to anything from disco to merengue. Very entertaining. Pool/beach bar is good, nice bartenders. Disco is the only place to get a drink after midnight but if you don't want to party in the disco it's ok because you can just go in to get your drinks and then take them back out to the lobby/courtyard area. Drinks were watered down but that's what you get for a 4 star property. Do order the mohitos from the lobby bar, they are awesome and refreshing on a hot muggy night. Restaurant: The Pool one is good. It starts out as breakfast in the morning (omellets, etc) then switches to lunch around noon (hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, etc). At night it turns into an a la carte Mexican restaurant and it's quite good. It's totally open so you get a nice breeze at night which is great. The Lobby buffet restaurant has good selection (salad bars, pastas, meats, fish) It is open for breakfast as well but we never made it there (only until 10:00am). Only draw back to this restaurant is that it's bloody hot in there. They have these huge sliding glass doors but keep them shut for some reason which really should get addressed as this restaurant has the potential of being pretty decent as far as a buffet goes. Upstairs a la carte restaurant totally sucks. A buddy and I ordered the pork medallions with dijon mustard and they were totally overcooked and the dijon was regular mustard. My opinion is don't waste a night there. Pool: Nice and clean. Lots of stuff to do there with the entertainment staff if you're into that sort of thing. The bar and restaurant are handy to get to which is nice compared to some larger resorts. Beach: Gorgeous. Beatiful warm Carribean sea and white sandy beach. Lots of angel fish there. Grab a piece of melon or bread and they'll come to you. At one point we had about 50 of them swimming all around us looking for food. Very Cool!! Only drawback is that the beach doesn't go very far if you wanted to take a nice evening stroll down a long beach. Front Desk staff: Seem to be confused a lot of the time but they got us checked in after only a few minor screw ups. Rooms: Awful.....they need to renovate the rooms badly. After we finally got checked in we started to unpack and noticed a light bulb not installed in the bathroom. We called the front desk and they sent someone over to put one in there. He comes over right away, puts it in there and it works........great!! NOT!!!! After he leaves the thing turns off all on its own. So...we call the front desk again, well 20 minutes later...no maintenance guy. So, we call again and wait and wait and still noone shows up. A third call to the front desk explaining that we need to take showers finally brings someone around about 15 minutes after that. At this point my wife and I are paranoid so we start checking everything out and we found that the fridge wasn't cold and the bathroom sink pipes were leaking water everywhere. So we got all of that dealt with at the same time. Needless to say, this put a huge black mark on my view of this resort. In the end everything got fixed and we didn't let it ruin our vacation or anything like that. Overall, this resort is very typical of a 4 star property to which we have been to before. If you can afford to bump to a 4 and a half or 5 star resort, do it and don't bother staying here. If you are on a budget, then this property can be a good option. The lobby bar and courtyard/turtlepond areas are nice. The food is so-so, drinks are ok but the rooms suck. One thing I almost forgot, the bathrooms in the rooms have a sewer-like smell to 'em but it's not too bad. Also that same smell occurs at the beach but , as I said, it's not so bad that you'll feel sick or anything. It kind of just comes and goes. Hope this helps.

The highlight is the friendly staff, very friendly. The \"animation\" department (guest activities) is a collection of high energy, attractive, young people. The beach area has wonderful white powder sand; but the actual beach is very small. Bring lots of sunscreen, the sun can be intense. Things to watch out for? Do not expect to find gourmet cuisine. Though generous in quantity, the quality was lacking for my tastes. With the exception of a second floor dining room, everything was served buffet style. Lines could be long at times. The second floor dining room offers a more elegant approach to dining and you receive table service; however, the menu does not change, the wine list is very limited. Seating is limited, as are the hours and days of operation. For most people, all-inclusive can be a bargain if you are a big drinker. However, lines can be long at times. The plastic glasses for beer are tiny and there is no light beer available. The \"house liquor\" is bottom of the barrel; but, you can upgrade your beverage choices for an additional $100+ for the week. If you are on the basic all-inclusive program and want an Absolute martini before dinner, your only option is to purchase the beverage upgrade. If you want to use your in-room safe, then be prepared to pay $2 per day for this option. If you need to check your email, be prepared to pay high rates to use the computers within a small shop in the hotel. Expect to take twice the time to conduct email business, the computers are set up for the Spanish language and you will go nuts trying to conduct English using a Spanish language keyboard! Seems to me that it would make sense to have English language computers for guests to use. There is not a guest service directory in the rooms. As a result, you might become frustrated in trying to make calls are call to inquire about guest services available. Dialing \"0\" will get you nowhere. Fair warning, you cannot charge purchases from the various stores in the hotel or with the crafts people that set up and do business in the hotel.

We had the time of our lives!! There were a few negatives about this resort but over all I would return. The first day we arrived the A/C did not work very well but we told the staff in the morning and they were quick to fix it and it was like an icebox every day forward. Apparently there are power issues down in Mexico; it was nothing the hotel could control. We were not affected personally but I did hear a few other guests complain about no power in the rooms and the hot water running out. One day the shower piece broke but was promptly fixed. We were in a room right next to the main building were the disco was, the first night it was annoying because the music was VERY loud, but every night after that we were so tired that it did not make a difference. There is a show every night, we only attended two, and there is the disco, which we also went two times. The staff was extremely nice and tried to keep things interesting. There was always something to do. Some people on the web site here have complained about the music by the pool, it did not bother me and half the time I was in my own world relaxing or playing a game that I couldn\u2019t even tell you the name of one song that was played. I also saw somewhere that someone complained about seaweed, HELLO you are on a beach, besides the staff had it cleaned up immediately. The other guests where a total blast too, it didn\u2019t matter if you understood each other or not, every one danced and played games together. I have to send a HUGE Hello to the CRAZIES GUYS FROM Rhode Island and to our new Friends from Alberta, JAIMIE AND CLINT\u2026Si, Si, Si. Yes the drinks were very watered down, BUT I learned by another guest, just ask the bartender to make them strong and they are happy to oblige. The beach was ok, there are this angel fish very close to the beach line and they will swim all around and under you, that kind of grossed me out so I was good with just staying in the pool, not to many people did go into the ocean, the water was blue but a little cloudy, we were further south one day for a Dolphin Adventure and that beach was so clear, so the beaches further south are a bit better, but I prefer being closer to Cancun and the Airport. The food was ok, the buffet got a little boring our favorite night was Mexican night, the upstairs restaurant was stupid, it was way to much of a production, it took to long to sit you, and serve you. The Mexican restaurant was a bit of the same way but not as much and the food was great. There was plenty of chairs on the beach and you can always find a shady spot if you want on. The last night we were there the hotel staff put on a strip show for the ladies in the disco (it was kept pretty clean, I\u2019d say PG 16), the men were mucho hot!! The rooms and the ground were spot less; I never smelled anything funny, no sewer smells or anything. This is one of the more economy resorts but over all we had a great time and I would go back.

Our experience was very mixed: some things were good, some things were not-so-good. Our summary is that if you get a package deal of a good price, then you will probably have a very nice time, but don't stay here looking for perfection. Some details: we loved the bar/lobby area, with its big wicker chairs and lots of plants; having cocktails by the turtle pool in the evening, among long colonades and palm trees. The front desk staff were extremely helpful at all times and responded with efficiency when we complained. Everything was very clean. Some of the theme nights in the main buffet were rather good, particularly the Mexican night. The grounds are beautiful, and the fact that it is surrounded by jungle is wonderful. The clientele was quite international, which we liked, and the small size of the resort made it easy to make friends. Things that we didn't like: there was a smell of drains in our room, and one night there was a flood in our block. We were surprised at how quickly it was dealt with, but nonetheless, it was irritating to be woken up at 4am with water slooshing under the door. There was intermittent power for a while, and although this seemed out of control of the hotel for the most part, there was a night when some rooms had power and ours didn't. Also we had insufficient hot water resulting in several cold showers, and after complaining on two occasions, we were moved to another room. The staff were very courteous about the complaints. The food was ok, but at times pretty average. The breakfast omlettes were very good, and the guacamole excellent! The fish at dinner was good too, but often many of the dishes looked rather tired. The a la carte restaurant was a bit hit and miss: my food was overcooked and uninspiring but my husband's was delicious. The entertainment staff were full of energy. The constant raucous music at the poolside was a bit irritating, and the evening entertainment was frankly bad (except for a traditional dance troop from Playa del Carmen), but other activities were fun. Top marks to Annie and the beach volleyball.

We only ate a la carte once; the food was wonderful but we weren't able to eat much of the entrees after the series of appetizers we were given. Buffets suit our consciences better. Our only concern, and we consider it major, is the sleeping arrangements we were given as a result of taking advantage of the resort's teen and kid discount rates. Usually, my son and husband share a bed when we are four in a room, and usually we are given two king or queen sized beds, but a double bed is barely big enough for my petite daughter and myself (I'm also on the tiny side). The two guys didn't have a hope of a good night's sleep. We find Transat Holidays partly to blame because they had assured us that we could request a roll away bed upon our arrival. The resort does not supply cots or roll aways. We ended up taking turns on a makeshift bed of extra pillows we got from the resort after three days of pleading.

The Not So Good: you have to pay for the room safes and they didn't have any available for us when we first arrived, we had to wait for some people to check out; the food is average at best and pretty repetitive -- my son and I have some food allergies so expected some limitations in choice, but even at that we were often hard pressed to find something that appealed to us; the buffet restaurant is all self-serve (including drinks) -- wait staff are there only to set and clear tables, replenish food etc., not wait on guests; we were told that bottled water would be placed in our room fridge everyday, but this never happened unless we specifically asked the chambermaid to provide it; this is a matter of personal preference, but I did find the music and noise from the loudspeaker system at the pool a bit loud at times -- our room was not near the pool, but the noise was enough to interfere with an afternoon nap; evening entertainment starts fairly late (9:45 pm). Some other information that future guests might find helpful: the king-bed rooms have a day bed that we didn't know about in advance -- for families planning to share a room with children this may be more comfortable than a two double bed room; the trip to the airport takes longer than 45 minutes as we made a number of stops to pick up guests at other hotels, so make sure you use the facilities before-hand; similarly, on a half-day trip to Tulum, which is about an hour south of the resort, each one-way trip took closer to two hours because of all the pick-ups and drop-offs along the way (although this is not related to the resort itself). Having been to a 5 star in Cuba last spring, I wouldn't rate El Mandarin as a 4 star, by comparison. I'd put it closer to 3.5 stars. Overall, not a bad resort. There are a number of positives, but a few issues to be aware of before you go.", "Date": "March 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary, canada", "Title": "\u201cGo prepared!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3291779", "Content": "I had read all previous reviews prior to booking at the Mandarin, so was prepared not to have a 5 star resort but to have clean rooms, ,good food and great weather. I also figured that the people who had trivial complaints were just people who could not be satisfied. To those I apologize. I now understand that when you are constantly being annoyed by pesky problems they compound and truly changes your attitude. Basically our main complaints were: 1. Our initial room stank so bad of sewer that my daughter refused to go into the washroom. Yes I brought airfresheners, ,they couldn't touch the smell. The airconditioner leaked like a tap - and beeping noises from the utility room kept us up half the night. Maintenance came and fixed the airconditioner promptly but could do nothing with the smell and had no idea what the beeping noise was. We ask to move rooms and were told none were available but in a couple days they maybe something. We were led to believe that the only rooms available had either 2 double beds or one king bed. No so!!! After meeting with a couple from Ontario they informed us that they had a suite with soaker tub, huge bathroom, seperate bedroom with 2 double beds and living area with 2 daybeds. Needless to say we went to the front desk to ask to be moved - told to come back 3 different times and were treated very rudely. Finally were shown new rooms and opted for the kingbed and 2 daybed room. We were very happy!!(Some people were told they would have to pay for a room up grade - but no one we spoke to had to pay any extra charges) 2. This concern did not affect us directly but was very disturbing. Most of this hotel consists of levels. The main lobby is beautiful but to go from one area to the next there are step ups or step downs. The night show also has this. To get to the main level from the lobby is a series of stairs ( I did not see an ramp) We saw in our two weeks someone getting hurt almost daily by missing the single steps. 3. The pool area is beautiful but the cement around it is very uneven. Several people cut their feet and one fella broke his toe here. As for cleaning the pool - we did see a guy vaccum it and skim it in the morning but never anyone cleaning the grim around - you could see the mildew in some areas. 4. The line ups at the bar was a bit annoying when you consider that one bar with 2-3 servers who were usually busy washing the dishes or talking on the phone had to serve the entire hotel. Okay enough of the complaints - Here are some helpful tips that if you go to this hotel I think may help you. - bring insulated cups for you drinks - the ebigger the better to avoid line ups. - check out the prices of tours from each tour operator before you book. We found World tours in the main lobby to be great. -Do the Isla Mujares trip from World Tours - you won't be disappointed!! - If your a family of 4 like mine consider doing taxi rides instead of the shuttle. We also booked the Xcaret by only buying the entrance tickets through World tours and catching a cab for $18. each way and burgers for lunch. So would I recommend this hotel? Possibly to someone who hasn't been to an all inclusive or a 4 star or better. Never to an older couple! We did over all enjoy ourselves - got drunk, got tanned, and saw a lot. Met some great people and felt very relaxed.

Please do not go by any of the negative reviews posted. We were quite nervous about this resort because of previous reviews. This place is awesome!!! The rooms are huge and very clean. The beach is beautiful with very little seaweed as it is cleaned every day. What can you expect this is the ocean!! We took our 2 teenage sons with us and they really enjoyed themselves. The entertainment was good in the evening. The food was a bit repetitive over the week but you have to remember they are serving soooo many people. It is not difficult to get the free shuttle to Playa. Yes the van only carries 12 people, we are a family of 4 and had no problem. As for the a'la carte restaurant, you can go as many times as you like, we walked right in. We booked our Xcaret tour through our rep approx $550 Cnd for 4 adults. Only complaint about the tour is, it should start as soon as the park opens (8:30am) not at noon. The exhibits close at 5pm. We missed out on alot of things because we ran out of time. The only changes we'd like to see made: There is no bank machine at the resort. The closest one is in Playa. The entertainment starts a bit late in the evening 9:45pm. After supper there really isn't much to do. The beach bar should stay open much later than 6:30pm. This was our 4th all-inclusive resort in Mexico and we will definately go back some day.

This resort is not suitable for anyone who would have problems with steps or uneven surface walking. My sister and I just returned, she has rheumatoid arthritis and found the walking difficult for her as in the lobby part of the resort you will have many steps for the different levels. The accomodations are all on a lower level which means that each time you wanted to go to the buffet or restuarant you had to climb approx. 12 steps. Our accomodation was on the ground floor but the 2 steps which was the entry way to your room were higher then normal steps with out any railing to help you. We soon found out that it was better for her to use the patio entrance but that only worked if I was with her to go in the normal way and unlock the patio door. We did notice a few injured quests during our stay and knew of one lady who had broken her ankle and was trying to enjoy her vacation in a wheelchair. My sister did fall as we were walking up to the lobby for dinner on our last night, the Guest Service Rep did come and talk to us, suggested that she should put ice on her side where it was hurting and if we wanted the Dr. to be called she would. At my sister's request no Dr. was called, but after returning home the next day, xrays taken and she has 3 cracked ribs. I must comment on the grounds which were beautiful and the staff at the reception desks were very polite and most helpful. I was disappointed in the ocean water which was mukey so that you could not see what was brushing up around your legs (angel fish) which made me very uncomfortable, this of course has nothing to do with the resort but think someone might want to be aware that these angel fish like to be around your lega. I was very surprised as well to find out that the resort is only 5 years old and of the conditions of the rooms. My first thought was that we were in an older section of the resort and that was the reason of the conditon of the room but after talking to other visiters and finding out their accomodations were in the same we determined that it must have been the poor workmanship at the time of building. The outside of these villa's were all in good repairs. Would I go back to this resort, the answer to no.

We went for 2 weeks and wished that we could have stayed longer. We arrived around dinner time and as we had our welcome drink we had a painless check in. We asked for a non smoking room with an ocean view and king size bed and we received everything that we asked for. Our luggage was delivered to our room with no problems. The grounds were amazing. They were always being looked after and kept up. The beach was great. After the storm of last September, the beach is now a wonderfully sandy area. Nothing wrong with the beach what so ever. There were always chairs to use but alot of times we stayed at the pool. The pool was on the cool side but it was great for those hot days! The ocean didn't even cool you off, so we really enjoyed the pool. The drinks were ok. We've definatly had better, I don't think you can expect more in that area at an all inclusive. I had an amazing massage at the massage palapa that was on the beach. It was a full body massage - so good!! I could barely stand up when they were done as it was so relaxing. The animation staff: We found the animation staff extremely friendly and fun. We got to know them right away and they definately made our trip! Eric and Rolando are always around if you need a dancing partner and WOW can they dance! Benjamin who is the manager of the animation staff is great. We often sat with him and talked, laughed, and joked. Eric's spanish lessons were a hoot! There are always activities and games going on around the pool. I am proud to say that my husband won the beer drinking constest. It was close though as Lupita who maybe weighs 85 pounds who is the staff coriographer for their shows almost beat him. Next time Lupita - Tomela Tomela! The music at the pool was great, never too loud as some of the reveiws have said. Our room was very clean. The maid did a wonderful job everyday leaving the bed made in a different way with fresh flowers laid on top. We had no problems with our personal belongings. I often left my jewellry in the room and there was never any issue. The food was amazing! Anyone who complains about this is crazy! We ate at the pool bar during the day and at the buffet every night. The buffet always had a variety of foods. They even had sushi a couple of nights which I thought was pretty good. Their pasta was so good! We loved the corona and wine on tap in the eating area. Thanks to Jose who always treated us well and kept our glasses full. A tip at the beginning of your stay goes a long way(with all of the waiters)! As some of the other reviews have mentioned - no there is no food after a certain time at night. We just took an extra few pieces of pizza from the buffet and put them in our fridge for later on. We found that by having a late dinner - we weren't too hungry after that anyways. The disco goes until 1:00. Its not too full in there but we went a couple of nights and it was fun. If you want the real \"party\" go into Playa Del Carmen. As for the bit of sewer smell around the resort that you get at times.....Don't forget that you are in Mexico!! The sewer systems are not like ours. The smell didn't bother me at all. Yes you may smell it once in a while but you forget about is so quickly because you are having such a good time. You are there to have fun and enjoy just being in Mexico and don't worry so much about the smell! Have a drink! You'll get over it quickly. We met alot of great people there from across Canada. Hello to Patty/Vince(Ontario), John/Brandy(Ottawa),John/Sarah(Ontario), and Phill/Diane(Saskatchewan) Thanks to everyone at El Mandarin for showing us such a good time! I was worried that we might be bored after a week as we didn't go with anyone else. As it turned out, we didn't need to be there with friends as we made so many there. A special thanks to Benjamin, Lupita, Annie, Daisy, Fred, Rolando, and Eric. (Perfecto) For those of you nervous from the bad reveiws - don't be!

We found the hotel amazingly clean, inside the rooms and the main lobby of the hotel and the grounds were kept immaculately groomed. The staff friendly and very willing to help. Upon arrival at 2:30 in the afternoon we got checked in and were welcomed with drinks served directly at the main desk. We were told to leave our bags and they were taken to our room within 20 minutes. We were made aware that if we hurried we could still get food from the buffet before it closed to prepare for dinner. The hotel lobby is lovely and comfortable and I can't even imagine complaining of having to sit and have a drink there for even a few hours ( as stated in other reviews) as we often just sat with a drink there during the late afternoon before dinner. We only attended the buffet restaurant for all meals but one and the bar restaurant once for lunch. It was lovely that each night had a theme to the dinner that carried over into the nightly theatre show as well. We tried to go to the A la carte restaurant one night but it was full, and then decided that the buffet allowed us more options anyways. While on occassion the cutlery wasn't at the table, I would go and get cutlery and a server was usually there quickly to ensure we had everything else we needed and were very courteous and so polite. The staff at the main desk was polite and cheerful. We arrived and recieved two double beds in our room and then next day requested again a Kingsize bed, while they couldn't meet our request that day they kept record of it and did notify us on day 5 that there was a room available. At that point we chose to keep our room, as it was close to the main building. The pool was cool, and a pleasant relief to the hot sun. The staff kept the music playing and activities are always happening, never did the music become too much as I have read in other reviews. The bar did get busy on occassion but come on folks... your on vacation ?? where are you going in a hurry anyways???

If vacation time is about kicking back and remembering what relaxing means, and not expecting to be waited on hand and foot, then I recommend the El Mandarin.

We arrived when four other planes arrived to go through customize and it took over 1 \u00bd hour for all of us to get through. We went with another couple to Club El Mandarin for a 10-night vacation. First of all I would like to tell you the weather was great. A little breezy at times but we couldn\u2019t of had nicer weather. I think out of 11 days, two days were partly cloudy or cool. We arrived around 3:30 in the afternoon and our check-in went like clockwork. We wanted an oceanview room but there was none available and the waiting list was a mile long. So we ended up in a upper bungalow by the kids club and could see the ocean partially. The room was very big and simple. The problems we had with the rooms were the sewer smell from the bathroom, the sliding screen door never work, refrigerator was not working and two of our table lamps didn\u2019t have switches. Can\u2019t forget our electricity went out once and others did not have water a few times. But I would have to say our A/C work great. When your refrigerator works you can get bottled water at the lobby bar. But after 7 days they ran out of bottled water so you had to fill your own bottles with water from the coolers at the bar. The overall layout of the resort is nice. The pool was cold but very refreshing in the afternoon \u2013 no swim-up bar. The beach needs some improvement. Lots of broken shells and seaweed by the water. We have seen better beaches and we both enjoy walking 3 miles a day and this was like work trying to dodge crap by the oceanfront. Like other people said it is about a 1-hour walk to Playa Del Carmen. You have to get up at the crack of dawn to save sits by the pool. I think we saved lounge chairs earlier and earlier each day to make sure we got the chairs we wanted (6:30 in the morning). Most of the nightlife is up in the main building and the daytime activities are at the beach and pool area. If you lucky enough to get a oceanview room be ready to make a hike every night to the restaurants and disco because it is a nice walk back especially after a night of having fun. The problems we had with the restaurants and bars were that the pool bar closed at 6:30pm. It would of be nice to have this bar open longer because the breeze off the ocean and sound of the waves were very relaxing. After the pool bar closed we headed up to the lobby bar (only bar open) until that one closes at 11:00 pm (these bartenders need help in being friendly). Then you have to head into the disco where there is no air circulating, lights and get drinks until bar time. The resort would be better off if they would open the beach bar later in the night to get away from the lobby/disco area. One thing we almost forgot to mention is you have to pay for premium liquor and they have no bottled beer. There were many people upset at the extra cost. We did go into town and bought bottled beer for around $16 a case (XX). The food was OK for a all-inclusive. We didn\u2019t have time to go to the sit-down restaurants but the buffets were find with us but very similar every night. Our other suggestion about the beach bar would to open the beach restaurants for late night snacks after the main restaurant closes. The main restaurant closes at 10:00 and there is no other place to get food. We came back from Playa Del Carmen one night around 1:30 in the morning and we were all hungry and thirsty and nothing was open. We did go into Play Del Carmen three times and took the ferry over to Cozumel. If you have ever been on a ferry before just shop in Playa Del Carmen and save your money to Cozumel. Both places have the same shops, bars and restaurants. The taxi ride is $10 each way for four people. We never took the shuttle from the resort because it is only free for a few hours a day. The staff works very hard. We had a few run-ins with the lobby and wait staff in the main restaurant but overall they treated us well. We would like to say thank-you to Annie from the activity staff and hope she is still wearing the cheesehead and say hi to Antonio and Nora at the beach bar they were great\u2026\u2026. Overall rating of this resort is 5 out of 10. We all felt this resort was rated too high from the previous trips we have gone on in other parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. We got a great deal on this vacation so I guess you pay for what you get and this resort was not rated appropriately\u2026\u2026\u2026. We would probably stay south of Playa Del Carmen next time.

We arrived just prior to noon and were told our rooms would be ready at 3:00 p.m. We were hungry and found the restaurants closed and would open at 1:00 p.m. so we just walked around or sat and waited. It was not a great welcome. Staff, although polite were not all that helpful. The floor in the main lobby is terraced and poorly marked so when a level changes it is easy to loose your footing and trip when you step down. This place is not recommended for anyone with ambulatory problems. We were given no assistance with our luggage when we checked in. We were told to take it to a storage area where it would be held until such time as our rooms were ready. We then returned for it and picked it up ourselves. There are a series of stairs one must descend to the pathways which lead to the various hotel room buildings. When we finally got our room keys, we had to drag our luggage down this stairway. Again, this place is almost impossible for anyone having difficulty walking, as these stairs must be traversed each time you go to eat, or do anything else concerning the main building. Room safes which go for $2.oo US per day were unavailable. We were told to check daily to see if any locks (for the room safes) become free. One would think they would have the same number of locks on hand as they have safes! The grounds were very well kept and the rooms, although dated were spotless and the queen size bed was comfortable. The buffet where breakfast, lunch and dinner is served was rather tiresome. Food, although adequate was very uninteresting. The restaurant \"Quetzal\" was supose to be 'a la carte' dining but the management couldn't decide from one day to the next how to handle the patrons. Reservations were not required but only the first 45 people in line were allowed at each sitting. (2 sittings per evening). That's rather silly when the facility could seat more and there were 320 rooms occupied at the resort. The food was good and the service excellent for the lucky few who managed to get in. We departed at 6:00 a.m. and had to drag our luggage up that long staircase ourselves. We were offered no assistance. The beautiful pathways leading throughout the grounds were not lit and we walked in the dark to the main building. The lobby was also unlit except for the check out counter. There was no snack or mini breakfast offered. We sat there in the dark waiting for our shuttle to Cancun. The Air Transat Rep also had a bit of an attitude. This was truly a disappointing stay and deffinitly not a 4 Star Resort.

I read all the reviews and was a little nervous. So I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel. I thought the food was very good for a buffet. The service in the dining room needed some improvement has at times it was hard to find a clean table. I didn't get to try the upstairs resturant because it was always full by the time I got there. The food at the grill by the pool was excellent, best cheeseburger I have has in a long time. The service at the main bar left something to be desired even after tipping many time over. The pool bar service was much better and Nora and Antonio really worked hard to wait on everyone quickly. People stated that the music at the pool was so loud that they could not hear the waves at the beach, I don't know what resort they were at but we never had that problem. The rooms were excellent and very large, we had building 36 room 3607 which was an oceanview and it was very nice with a very great view. Only problem no rollaways, we had 1 room that had 3 people and it only had double beds which are not very big when it is 3 young men sharing a room. The grounds were very well kept up and clean. Staff works very hard at keeping everything very clean. The ocean was not as clear as I would have liked until our last day so snorkeling was not an option. My kids had fun with the kayas and the catamarans. The beach was clean and I never saw the seaweed that people were talking about all I saw was the beach boy out there cleaning the beach several times a day. If you go DO NOT throw away the bottle from your water. They only give youu 1 bottle of water and you have to refill from the water jugs they have. Or you have to buy more. And as stated before bring a large thermal mug. If I had to stay at this resort again I would and so would any of the other 22 people in my group.

We had an excellent trip--very relaxing. I can echo many of the other comments on the board. I was pleaantly surprised in the resort. For a 4 Apple Rating from Apple Vacations, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I feel the Resort definitely stacks up to 5 Apple Ratings of places we've stayed at in Ixtapa. Each place is unique and wonderful in it's own way. What I really liked about El Mandarin was the beach, the food was good--the was fresh grilled fish was to die for. Elegant night (just the buffet theme - don't have to dress up) was the best night. Grilled Grouper I can't quit thinking about. Had beer, red and white wine on tap in buffet. I liked the red wine, although I'm not used to having it chilled, it was very good. I just let set at room temp for a while. Our room was one of the nicest we've had when staying in Mexico. We were in Building 6, Room 620 and it was very centrally located, which I liked. Tons of hot water and water pressure. As others indicate the grounds are truly beautiful and the place is spotless. I didn't see a mark on the wall. Constantly polishing the floors. They were painting buildings that I thought were already freshly painted. Staff was extremely pleasant and helpful--especially Antonio and Nora at the pool bar. Didn't see a lot of tipping. We tipped room service and bartenders frequently. There are 4 shops on premise, as well as an internet store. In the beauty salon, I had a massage, which was great. $60 US for 1 Hour. Well worth it. Playa Del Carmen is definitely worth the trip for shopping and looking around. Very clean, as well. I would definitely go back or recommend Mandarin to anyone who asked. Very diverse group of guests--many Canadian, French, Italian, German, and Americans. People were pleasant but not overly friendly--I believe because most were traveling in groups, it wasn't as easy to meet other guests, which was okay, as we really didn't go out of our way on this trip. It is quiet hotel--mostly family and couple oriented. Definitely not one of the mega resorts. I think Mandarin has about 200 rooms--which is nice sized. It never felt crowded, although I believe the hotel was full. If want specific beach or pool loungers, you will need to do the towel run and reserve in am before going to breakfast. If I were single and wanting some excitement, this wouldn't be the place--but I'm past that point so everything suited my husband and I just fine. Tips: Do bring insulated cups. Hotel is very, very casual and laid back--don't need to overly dress. Only negatives I can think of: 1) No swimup bar, and 2) the pool water was so cold that not many people were ever in the pool. There is a smaller jetted pool, but I wouldn't say it is a \"hot\" tub, as the water is not heated in that pool either. Even so, I wouldn't hesitate to go back. In October we're going back to Playa Del Carmen, but trying the Rio Tequilla, so it will be fun to compare.

I would give this resort about a 3-3.5 stars. I'll start out with the positive things. First, the grounds and facilities are beautiful and kept very clean. Our rooms were the largest and nicest I've visited in the caribbean area, and always clean. The food was average, nothing spectacular. We mostly ate at the main buffet, and once at the outdoor Mexican restaurant, which was good. We didn't get a chance to eat at the upstairs restaurant, which was rated very good by our traveling partners. The main buffet had good food, but it seemed like it didn't vary enough from night to night. The resort was good at organizing tour buses to various attractions around the area. We took the shuttle into Playa del Carmen for shopping one day and into Cancun with a guide another day. We also took a guided tour to Chi Chen Itza, the mayan ruins. The trip was well worth the three hour drive and money. The beach was clean, and there was always enough room and chairs to layout. The water wasn't as clear as other places, but not disgusting. You can rent jet ski's and catamarans to cruise in the water with, which was fun. There were a couple of things I was disappointed about. First of all, the bars here closed at very weird and not convenient times. The pool bar closed around 6:30. We were usually still lounging around in our swimsuits by the pool at that time. Then, the main lobby bar closed at midnight, forcing you to go into the disco if you wanted to drink. The disco was really fun, but if you didn't want to drink around the loud music, there was no place to go. Also, there was not any where to get food after 10:00 in the evening. At other resorts, there has been some sort of quick food option late in the evening, here there was none. This was a good, quality place, but certainly not one of the best I've visited.

I found the staff to be exceptionally pleasant and helpful. Not once did I encounter an unpleasant situation with anybody from the bar staff, maintenance staff, frontdesk staff, shuttle staff, activities staff. I found our room much larger than most resorts I've been to and it was kept very clean. For some reason, they didn't like to stock my bathroom with facecloths. When I requested some, they were delivered immediately, but then the cleaning staff removed them the following day and didn't restock them. It wasn't a big deal to me so I didn't bother asking again and I was humored to see if I would get them. I enjoyed the varied food and thought it was well prepared and exceptionally presented. There was a lot of variety every night and in as much as I enjoyed it and wanted to try everything, after a week, I was tired of eating. The reviews I read about the pool were unfavourable because they claim the pool is too small. I found that even with the activities in the pool, most people didn't use it. even the kids didn't use it much. It felt colder than the ocean so most people chose to wade in the sea. The outdoor jacuzzi was a cold one, not a hot tub like us Canadians are used to. The shuttle to Playa del Carmen left on the hour for 6 hours and cost $3.00. The cab by comparison cost $10.00. The last shuttle was at 6:00 p.m. and I found that wasn't late enough. Fifth Avenue in Playa is a hot spot and there is shopping until midnight so I was always forced to cab home. I found that there was lots of space on the beach to lay around without feeling crowded. I read several reviews about the seaweed washing up on the beach and when I was there, we had 2 nights out of the 7 that some seaweed washed up. It happened during the night and it looked almost like 5 inch spruce needles. The clean up staff were out there at first light with their rakes and they cleaned up the beach immediately. At no time was the water unswimable because of the seaweed. I live on Vancouver Island and when we get seaweed it generally has a pungent odor and is ankle thick. The seaweed on this beach was nothing compared to what I'm used to. There was no smell to it or sand fleas. Out of curiousity, when I saw the seaweed, I walked the beach for several hours and every resort was faced with the same thing. This is the ocean here! There were no rocks on this beach as I found on others. I found the entertainment to start too late in the evenings. They had a live band that played on the outdoor deck for about 45 minutes until the show started, then they would resume after the show ended. People would dance outside anywhere they saw fit and also in the lobby. The indoor show started at 9:45 p.m. and I found some nights to be quite entertaining but overall not as good as I've seen in other resorts. I found this resort to not be too handicap friendly. There were a lot of stairs to manipulate and people in wheel chairs or with heart problems may not be able to deal with this. I tried the international restaurant and it was nice. I wasn't too keen on the quality of alcohol that was being served. I wouldn't not go there because of it because I could go buy a 26 of really good stuff and drink for the entire week on 15 dollars.

We asked for top floor facing the ocean and that's what we got. It's also close to the pool area, so if you like peace and quiet during the day, choose a room closer to the main hotel. The pool area was quiet after 5:30 however and then the ocean view was worth waiting for. Downside: You need to be an early riser if you want to book the two a la carte restaurants... they were fully booked by early to mid morning every day. The same goes for the free shuttle bus... it only holds 13 passengers at a time and that is nowhere near enough capacity for a hotel of that size, so get up early to book the shuttle bus too. The trips to Chichen Itza etc are best made in Playa del Carmen rather than the hotel.

If you wanted a nightlife or something different than just staying at the hotel there were free shuttles 2 times daily to Playa del Carmen or any excursion you wanted could be set up in the lobby by a number of people. We took the Apple tour to Chichen Itza one day and one freeby to Playa del Carmen (too crowded and touristy, could have been back in the states if it wasn't for a few local restaurants and more Spanish than English spoken) and spent the rest of the time RELAXING and getting to know each other again,and soak up the sun and the ocean breezes. It did rain almost every night we were there, usually for a short burst and then over in 15-20 minutes. Not bad for the rainy season! Our last night we had a bad storm come through and knock out most of the electricity to the rooms. We had our wake up call at 5 am as we requested ( a knock on our door since the phones were down) and had a porter from the lobby come with a flashlight and help carry our bags to the lobby! How many American hotels would do that for you? The staff went out of their way to help us as my husband is handicapped and had difficulty climbing the steps to the lobby and other places. Other than the steps from the lobby to the rooms, and to turn down the volume from the pool loudspeakers we have almost no complaints about this wonderful piece of paradise! Excellent food, wonderful rooms, great staff- we'll defininately go back!!!! P. S. Oh and the people complaining about the crabs- if they bothered you that much why didn't you pick some up, throw em in a pot and cook them?? The ones we saw were plenty big to eat and usually tried their best to scurry away from people when they were approached. And-horror of horrors- we had a live gecko crawl into our room that we \"adopted'\" as our room pet while there. We figured it was his home long before we got there. Since he was only about 4 inches from head to tail I don't think we had much to worry about. I suppose those kind of people (\" the crabs were all over the walkway\") didn't take the chance to appreciate how lucky they were to be at a place that still has live crabs to walk around , or turtles in the pool outside the lobby or watch the bats fly in the lobby at night eating the insects that might bite you.", "Date": "October 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Sun22", "ReviewID": "UR2701444", "Content": "I just got back from spending a very long week at El Mandarin and boy was I disappointed.

I stayed at the Mandarin in May 2004 with my family. This was my second time at an all-inclusine resort so I do have a valid comparison. Upon arrival, the lobby was packed with locals and the luggage guy told us it was the end of gay week and now they were promoting a special for locals over the weekend. It took us 3 hours before we were able to get into our rooms. Atleast we were able to get our swimming suits and store our luggage so the entire time was not a waste. The rooms were beautiful, spacious and clean. The same goes for the grounds of the resort. The ocean was dirty and the pool was packed full of local kids....everything was in Spanish. We felt as though we were in Mexico City and no one spoke English or even cared that we were there, it was tough getting drinks, towels etc. The worst complaint is the food at this \"all-inclusive\" resort. There was little variety and everyday the food was exactly the same. The staff was annoyed and very cold-perhaps because it was local week. They ran out of food on several occasions and were reluctant to replace it. I tried to get a fountain coke in the morning and they refused to turn on the machine! I am sure that the locals being there had a lot to do with the lack of service we received, but it did take a lot from our vacation. The dive shop was great-not too busy and I received a lot of personal attention from the divemasters and had a great time diving the Cenotes. My non-diving family left the resort very dissapointed. Next time I stay at an all-inclusive I will make sure to call ahead and ask about any \"local specials.\" Apparently they do this to fill up the hotels.

Even the bars gave you tiny Dixie sized cups of beer and NO premium liquor. We figured if we are paying for drinks included, the drinks should be desireable at least. Margaritas were awful too. The pictures on the wall were all lopsided and the shower did not drain. The worst was the salty water in the showers. You have to bathe in salty water! We asked for another room and none available. We even tried to change hotels with funjet and nothing was open. We had to get to the beach by 8am to get a beach chair.

Unfortunately, our flight was significantly delayed. Upon our 10:00 p.m. arrival we learned that a number of guests who had been scheduled to depart earlier that day were delayed because of the same airline delays. This resulted in management telling us \"there was no room in the Inn that night.\" We were taxied to a substandard property about 15 minutes south of the Mandarin. Upon our return the following morning, however, Mandarin management more than rectified our situation. We were given room 2907; a very spacious room with an incredible view of the beach and sea. Our houseman took care of us as if we were royalty. It is amazing what a few US dollars per day will do. Prior to our trip I had read several poor reviews. In particular the ones about how loud the pool area had been; about the poor air conditioning; poor attitude of the staff; about the less than stellar food offerings; about the \"less than clear\" water and the seaweed; the buffet restaurant was too warm, etc. Keep in mind these were reviews for stays that took place just a week or two before our trip. Frankly, I think those writers went to a different resort. Our air conditioner worked fine. If we had a problem, then we reported the problem, and management rectified it within hours. The buffet restaurant was very comfortable and the food offerings were tremendous. The bartenders at both bars work their tails off. Demetrio is a great bartender. The pool area was sometimes loud, but the noise was from people HAVING FUN! Sure, there was seaweed and the water was sometimes not very clear, but this was not one of the protected areas for snorkeling. The transportation to and from Playa Del Carmen was more than adequate. The Apple tours we took were to Chitzen Itza and the Golden Cruise. They were both excursions to remember. The bottom line is I would recommend this resort to you if you are looking to relax and have fun in paradise.

The Free shuttles, when we got to the resort they were all booked up for the first five days. So we ended up paying $10 per way to go to Playa to have a decent beach. Why pay all inclusive if you can't lay on a decent beach. Our Apple Rep that is in the resort. We asked to be moved up to Cancun, withthe understanding we would have to pay the difference. He told us there were NO room in cancun, so I went in the internet cafe, found some phone #s and called the propeties myself. Not only did everyone that I called have rooms, they had lots of them.

We especially enjoyed the food, and although alot of the buffet was redundant, there was so much to choose from, you could satisfy any pallette. I especially enjoyed the desserts and the never-ending guacamole! The food was always available, and in the hours (only a couple during the course of the day), when the restaurants were all closed, there were drinks and appetizers, along with live music on the veranda, and in the main lobby. There was music on the beach starting at ten, when all the entertainment started for the day. Though some may find the music too much, we really enjoyed the fun and laidback atmosphere of the resort. There were activities and lessons going on all day, everyday. There is also a daycare for children (though we left ours at home). Although the beach has a seaweed problem, a short walk down the beach, it is very clear and lovely. For other daily activity, the hotel has an agreement with the Tres Rios park, just a short walk down the beach. $17 gets you a week-long pass. Tres Rio is a nature park where you can enjoy snorkeling, horseback riding, bike rides, kayaking, and a host of other activities. We also ventured out on a snorkeling trip from the hotel. The staff was very helpful, as it was our first-ever snorkel adventure. $25 for an hour may seem a bit steep, but an hour is pretty much all you need!

They resisted giving us another room at first, citing how they were fully booked, but after working with the a/c and finding out the hoses were busted and leaking water, they gave us a great room close to the courtyard. They also allowed us to use the phone in the hotel office, which reflected their desire to make our experience a good one. After that, everything went well for us, but each time I passed by the check-in desk, there were more people complaining about their a/c and phones. The International Restaurant requires long pants, so we were not able to eat there. The buffet restaurant was very warm inside, but the food was good. Drinks were good, and the bartenders were good. The staff was very courteous. The store clerks inside the hotel stores would not always accept our credit card even though they said they would and our credit card was good. We tried to make 3 different purchases, and 2 of those times they would not process our credit card. We think it either was due to them not knowing how to use the credit card machine or they just wanted US currency. The hotel charges 3% commission to cash in Travelers checks. As for activities, we chose to go out on an excursion for snorkeling to Paradise Reef Adventure because, even though it's a little more expensive than going snorkeling through the excursions from the hotel, it was worth it. We also went to Tulum - highly recommended and the beach at Tulum afterwards was great. We also went horseback riding, so our 3 day stay was full and those activities were excellent. I was disappointed with the resort's beach, but the hotel offers free kayaking, catamaran, and windsurfing.

We had a delightful time. As a road warrior, the resort provides me with just the right amount of activity and relaxation time. For those of you who want glitz, glamour and feeling like you are in the states this is not the place. About 80% of guests from Europe(Italy, Spain and Germany) and South American, Americans all very continental in their view of the world. The grounds of the resort are lush, well groomed and extremely clean. The rooms are large and gorgeous, sure like anywhere in the Carribean the water pressure was not terrific all the time. We stayed in the 2100 building and had a great view of the pool and sea. The housekeeping was excellent, we did not have wash cloths, asked the maid and then had wash cloths daily. We truly enjoyed the beach, many different areas to sit, not just one large beach. Was amazed that you could find a palapa any time of day. They are truly working hard to keep ahead of the seaweed and erosion, towards the end of our week the water was very clear. However one could swim or wade out to find clear water. Could also walk south beyond the Secrets resort and find clear water. FYI Secrets had the same seaweed concerns. The Activities and Entertainment staff were the best we have ever experience. All very friendly, interesting and engaged in creating a pleasant day for all guests. Cannot say enough about all of them. Some from Italy, Mexico, Canada, South America. The water aerobics class is a great deal of fun, however they make sure you do get a work out. Would also recommend the morning strech and beach walking tour. I read that someone was turned off by the music. Yes there was music on the beach, however is only loud at certain times(lunch, late afternoon). I actually enjoyed hearing Mexican music. We truly enjoyed the food. Very well done and a vast variety. However if you only enjoy American food, there is not much of a variety with the exception of hamburgers, hotdogs and french fries. Drinks were great and plentiful, be sure to bring an insulated cup for beach drinks(only use plastic cups). Beach bar closed at 6pm. However the bar in the lobby was open. Found it lovely to go to room around 6pm shower and then go to the lobby where they served very decorated native drinks, some with and some without alcohol, most evening had live music befor and after dinner. There are 2 gourmet resturants, reservations can be made at check in only 1 at each per stay, good nights to book are Saturday and Sunday evenings. Queztal is air conditioned, the Mexican is not. Also the main dining room does not have a strong ac system, if traveling in summer dress lightly. My husband found that regular golf shirts were too heavy, bring light weight shirts, I had no problem wearing sundresses, short skirts or shorts with sleeveless shirts. Men must wear trousers to Queztal, not the Mexican resturant. If going into town with 2 or more people, bus space limited on free shuttles (to at Noon and 1pm, from 4:30pm & 5:30pm), other times available but $3/person/way............taxi $10 each way. We took at taxi one day and like the freedom of when to go and come back. Town built up even more than a year ago, decrease in # of vendors to bargain with, enjoyed not having the hassle. Word of advise town is HOT HOT HOT, go later in afternoon. There are many tours from the hotel. This was our 6th time in Mexico and the beach and relaxing is what we were seeking. Would recommend going on the ISle of Muijeires tour, from hotel all day food, boating, snoerkling, sailing, tour of island and parasailing for $65/person. There is also a 1 hour snoerkling trip to a reef for $25/person which is extremely worth while and will see many fish and coral. As I said earlier, I am a road warrior and for vacation I need a place that is clean, pretty and where I can just hanging out in my bathing suit and sarong all day and not really think about anything except if I have sunblock on.

Like most of you I did alot of reading on this website on the El Mandarin before we travelled and to be honest I started to dread what we'd find when we got there. Thankfully most of the bad comments are grossly exaggerated and as with anywhere the holiday is what you make it. We arrived on 4th June 04 and spent two weeks and what we considered to be a beautiful well maintained resort. Yes we had bad storms whilst there and experienced a lack of water and electricity, but in comparison to people in other hotels who were evacuated the El Mandarin coped really well. They always kept you informed and did their very best to keep moral high. We were lucky to get an umbrella from reception however I do accept that other guests weren't as fortunate. Food was good but very Americanised especially the breakfasts, staff everywhere were the friendliest I have ever met. The grounds, rooms and beach are always kept immaculate. No the sea isn't clear blue, but there is no problem in swimming there. They organise excellent trips from the hotel which tend to be cheaper than the same trips through your travel company. For those of you visiting Mexico for the first time, swimming with the dolphins is a must!

Parts of the beach made swimming in the sea accessible It was not too bad as we had pleasant calm weather for the two weeks.Mexico has a terrible habit of placing paper bands on your wrist for visits either to Talum,snorkling orother outsid activities.I did object to the hotel band and managed to hide it under my watch strap.It meant that in all our group photos they were visibile all the time.The food was well presented and the upstairs resturant is a must , found the wines a bit expensive.Would have thought that good Calaforian wine would have been lots cheaper than the others as its right on their own doorstep.A major problem was the heat in the main resturant,no moving air and the doors were shut i`m sure to stop people taking their meals outside.From a European view point lots of the meals are geared for American tastes,saying that there was plenty of salads and mouthwatering fruits.Cheeses very boring.As mentioned else where the beer is one step up from tepid weak watered down pale liquid,one good tip is to seek out the head barman tip him early on and hey presto instant service.We found the staff extremely helpful and always cheerful,they do work very hard for their meagre wages.Mind you some of their health and safety practises are non existance.Man blowing ant dust with machine not wearing a mask.Also with the room maids a few extra Pesco`s go a long way to make small request go smoother.The pool was a bit small but we coped and the pool bar was well placed as we were not always inclined to walk up to the main resturant every lunchtime.Rooms were spacious and we never had any problem either with the power or air-conditioning.The bathroom could do with having extracta fans fitted to take smell outside. Room to room cavities a bit thin as people up stairs having a arguement kept us enterained for some time. Lastly we could not fault the entertainment staff first class how they keep their cheerful demeanor up all all day every day is to their credit,from activities around the pool to evening shows they were a pleasure to know.

When we arrived it was raining really bad, thinking it would stop we checked in and waited in the lobby for a while where it was very hot, no air conditioning. So we waited, and waited and waited but the rain just kept coming down, and there were no umbrellas available, being that our bungalow was a distance from the lobby. Finally we got our hand on a half assed umbrella and decided to go to our room. Well let me tell you all, by the time we found our room we got there soaked, due to all of the rain, all of the walkways were flooded. When we got to our room our luggages were outside waiting for us also drenched. The room was average, nothing to write home about. At 3a.m. we lost power and had no a/c, and to boot no water!! The water and electricity came back the next day, but we still didn't have any a/c for about three days. Finally we asked for a room change with a/c that worked and we got a great oceanfront room with finally a king size bed that we had requested from the start. The phone were out for about four days so we couldn't call home at all, and when they finally did come back we had to pay $1.50 just for the connection charge to use a prepaid calling card. The rest of the week the weather was beautiful, no problems. The animation staff are great, during the day by the pool and at night putting on shows, very friendly. The food is good, we alternated by going to the resturants and the buffet, make sure you make reservations a day before you want to go to one of the resturants. The beach as we had heard was murky, I had to see it for myself, but the beach in Playa del Carmen is beautiful, worth the trip. The grounds are very well kept and the wokers on the resort really do work hard. There are blue crabs all over the place, but the are harmless, and will run and hide when you get close to them. Alot of big bugs outside at night, we had some ants in our room sometimes, but what do you expect in the middle of a jungle! Tipping the housekeepers does help sometimes getting extra towels, especially when the towels were limited due to the storm flooding their laundry room. A dollar goes a long way, these people work nearly for nothing, we even felt sorry for them. There is a free shuttle to Playa del Carmen at 12 & 1p.m. but you need to make reservations the day before, it does fill up fast. If you want a good spot near the pool you need to get down there early in the morning and put your towels down. Drinks are ok, not the best, and they only had one type of beer, Corona. The main dining room where they have the buffet is very hot, they have no a/c there and none in the lobby and bathrooms either. All in all for the price we payed, we got our moneys worth, but I think next time we would upgrade. Maybe the Mayan Palace, check it out if you get a chance. We got a free breakfast and a free excursion to Xel-Ha and Tulum, just for going to check out the hotel in hopes that next time we would stay there.", "Date": "June 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGREAT PLACE FOR THE PRICE\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2187878", "Content": "We Honeymooned here at El Mandarin from June 6 -June 10, 2004.

They have a deal with guest of the mandarin pay $17 per person for unlimted use during your saty at the hotel.

Everything else canoes, kyak, bikes, chairs, palapas and beach (crystal clear) are included in the $17. Our room was great Ac was cold, every now and then you would see a bug( remember this is the 3rd world). The funky smell people complain about we noticed only once and lingered for a few seconds. Now as far as pool bars and what not who cares about that, the bar is right by the pool, get ya butt out of the water and get a drink. Recommendations go to the gift shop and buy a big beer stein.

They say \"you get what you pay for\", however, you definitely get more at Club El Mandarin. Is it a 5 star resort? No! Is it worth the price? Absolutely! The resort is beautiful! The beach is nice, but the water is nasty! I tried to go in one day and cut my foot on some coral I couldn't see because of the murkiness! I never went back! But we came to relax, and the kids loved the pool! We went to Xel-ha and enjoyed the snorkeling and swimming there. It is a must-do especially with the all-inclusive! The kids said \"this is the most fun I ever had in my entire life\" - even more than Disney World! You can travel for free to Play Del Carmen by shuttle at the resort which you must schedule ahead of time. We all enjoyed shopping there, and you can enjoy some beautiful beaches while there. The animation team there was okay at best. The children liked a couple of the shows, but a few were pretty stupid, and one had to do with pretending to kill your wife then yourself! Not what I want children seeing (or myself for that matter!) Also the shows don't start until 9:45 or 10:00 which is too late especially for kids. The kids club was practically non-existent and one child age 6 was left by herself by the pool by the staff with no parent or guardian! The buffet restaurant is way too hot and needs air conditioned! When they do open the sliding doors, you get attacked by mosquitos - buy repellant! The staff is very friendly and hard-working. The food is good and none of us got sick! The kids recommend the hamburgers at the snack shop/pool bar for lunch! Definitely scope out prices at the souvenir shop by the lobby counter before buying from the vendors by the turtle pond (which is cool) or in town! Best prices we found! And never pay the price the vendors in town quote you! They tried to get us to pay $45 for our daughter's hair braided and I got them down to $25! Just start to walk away and they usually bargain! Also do NOT listen to the people trying to get you to go to the Mayan Palace by offering you discounted prices at the local tourist attractions! They are found in town and at the airport when you arrive! Just keep walking! It is a gimmick! The rooms are nice - ask for a bungalow and possibly an ocean view! Best to call a week or few days before while confirming your reservation! There are definitely a drawbacks to this resort, but we had a wonderful time! Nothing that caused any regrets to our choice!

I wouldn't go back to this hotel. I don't understand why APPLE gave it a rating of 4 star. It is 3 star at best. Personally I would give it a 2 star. The beach was murky and seaweeds were all over the beach. We checked into the rooms. The rooms were okay. We had a balcony facing the pool. But the air conditioner didn't work. We called them as soon as we checked into our room. They came by pressed some buttons and said it'll be better if not they will fix tomorrow. Tomorrow came by the ac still did not work. They offered to change our rooms but it was further away from the pool. Since we were only there for 3 nights..and this was our last night. We said forget it. So we sweat through our whole vacation. The other problems was the lights in the room. When you use the hairdryer the lights in the bathroom starts to flicker and turn off. All the lightings in the room was screwy. Lights would turn on by itself or you can't turn it on. We thought the room was haunted! But if you play with the bulbs or the switch it's just loose wires. The toilet got clogged on the 2nd night and they never came to fix it. We ended up using the toilet next door in our friend's room. For a hotel that's somewhat new, the condition of the hotel looks old. There were cracks everywhere. It's true. They only have 1 pool for the whole hotel. So everyone congregates there and if you dont wake up at 7am to grab some chairs they're all gone. The other complaint I have is the food. They said all inclusive but you can't really eat 24 hours. No room service. And you have to eat at a set time. Breakfast is served at main dinning hall from 7am to 10am. If you miss it ..too bad. Then you will have to grab continental breakfast by the pool. Dinner is from 7pm to 9pm and you can't bring food out of the dining hall. So you're out of luck if you are hungry at midnight. As for the alchohol? What alcohol. Everything was watered down. Tough luck trying to get drunk. The only thing that I really like about the hotel are the staff. I really give it to them. Great job on the entertainment.

Overall, we enjoyed our trip. But there were a few hiccups along the way. This is going to be a pretty long review since I'm going to try to comment on things that I think other potential visitors should be aware of before deciding where to stay: Let me just start with the fact that the sevice was very good. Everyone was very cordial and polite. We tipped particularly the maids and waiters whenever we thought appropriate, which was quite frequent. It's obvious that they work very hard. As most other reviews have commented on, the beach was more than lackluster. It was full of seaweed. I had been checking the weather starting the week before we left and did not see any evidence of rain or storms to account for the murkiness, which remained this way the entire trip. (FYI... the beaches in Playa de Carmen, just south of the El Mandarin Hotel, was absolutely beautiful.) So with a disappointing beach, guests are left with the swimming pool which is not very deep (good for little kids) and feels quite slimy. There is not swim-up-bar, but the bar is poolside. The animation team (at poolside, they're the ones in the red swimsuits) work extremely hard to keep guests entertained. At night, they put on shows which were good and entertaining. There are 2 tennis courts (located close to the entry of the premise) which were clean and playable (there were lights but we didn't play late enough to see if they worked). There is a small work out area in the corner of the lobby (close to the buffet dining hall); I actually didn't use the facility myself but looking from the door, the equipment looked adequate. The landscaping was very beautiful. The rooms are tiled and are large and spacious and most importantly- well air conditoned. Each room has an airconditioner which is remote controlled. We never had a problem with the AC. Each room has a small refrigerator (which is not cold at all, but enough to keep the contents cool). On arrival, there were only 2 bottles of water. So whenever we walked through the lobby, we would go to the bar and pick up extra bottles of water, which we tool on our excursions. There is a safety deposit box in each room. But guests need to pay $2.50 USD/day for a lock to that box. If you are traveling with a large family, you may want to verify beforehand that you are all staying close together. We had 4 different rooms- 2 rooms were in the same bungalo, 1 was in the bungalo next door, but the other couple had to stay way on the opposite end of the premise. Also, just be aware that check-in time is not until 3:00 PM. But during the interim, they have any area where you can change to go swimming or you can go eat until your room is ready. A problem that we all had was the running water. Often times we did not have hot water. They would try to fix it as quickly as possible but it beame a recurring problem. Furthermore, the 1st night that we were there, our tub was not draining well, but the maintence ppl came and fixed it relatively quickly. The tap water is salty but tolerable. We didn't do this- but future guests may want to use the bottled water to brush your teeth, etc. Be ready to endure the heat. One of my biggest complaint is that other areas of the hotel is not well air conditioned at all! There are no ceiling fans anywhere. The lobby area is an open area and is hot with some relief when there is a cool breeze. The buffet dining hall is HOT, HOT, HOT. Sometimes, they'll open the side doors to the outside, so try to sit next to these areas if these doors are open. Future visitors may want to bring one of those small portable fans. The food is safe to eat. The buffets themselves are plentiful and offer a wide variety with lots of fresh fruit. Breakfast starts at 7:00AM, lunch at 12:30PM, dinner at 7:00 PM. The breakfast buffet was great- the best of the buffets. The smoothies are very good. The lunch buffet was so-so. They have a very wide selection for dinner. There are 2 a la carte restaurants where guests can eat at, but reservations are required the day before (there is a desk in the lobby area where guests go to make reservations). The sevice at both places was very good. The Mexican restaurant (during the day, it's the poolside grill) was okay. The best dish is probably the speciality, the \"El MAndarin..\" (its shrimp stuffed in a plantain). The international/goumet restaurant (located in the upstairs lobby area) is better. Again the main entree was okay, but the desert that I had (chocolate cake and ice cream) was delicious. We rented 2 cars to go on our excursions. When fillin gas, there is gas station attendant who will fill up your gas tank. Remember to check and make sure that the pump has been zeroed before they start pumping the gas- unfortunately, we had this happen to us. We went to Xel Ha and Tulum on our excursions. The entry to price to Tulum was $4 USD/visitor. You could pay $30 USD for a tour guide. The ruins are roped off but it was still an amazing site. There are beautiful views of the shoreline and beach. Just be sure to be ready to endure the heat. Xel Ha is closeby to Tulum. People can swim with dolphins (it'll cost you >$100 USD to do this). We went snorkeling here, which was very fun. If you don't have your own gear, you can rent all the gear for $10 USD to use the whole day. However, one of my traveling companions, who had been here before, was very disappointed at the lack of corals and fish. For those who want to purchase souveniers, I would recommend checking out the souvenier shop (not the gift shop) in the lobby; it's open from 9:30AM to 10PM. The prices are set but reasonable. We had gone to the stands located just outside the hotel and other shopping areas in Cancun and realized that these outside vendors really try to rip you off. Would I go back? Only if the beach clears up and ceiling fans are installed.", "Date": "June 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermilion, AB.

We spent the rest of the time sitting by the pool and plain old relaxing, glad that we weren't back in cold Canada. How can this not be great? Our room was right beside the lobby, which we ended up thinking it couldn't be more conveniant. The time spent in the lobby (restaurant/bar) or reading a book out of the sun was right next door to our room. Our own washroom was handy. Why use the public one?

The food was great. Such a big buffet. No problem finding something you liked and a lot of it. The only thing I didn't care for was the coffee. It seemed bitter, but the banana milkshakes made up for it! The house wine was good. The outside restaurant/bar was also nice. You could get out of the sun and have a hamburger, hotdog, fries, nachos, fish, etc. They had slushie drinks that were so good in the heat. The animation team were awesome to say the least. They were all friendly, and always so busy! They spent their day entertaining the guests, giving spanish lessons, dance lessons, playing water and beach volleyball with whatever guests were interested in that activity. Football soccer was also also played. I don't really know the rules to it, I didn't go watch it. There was water arobics every morning. This seemed to attract the older visitors.

We booked a package online through Expedia. The cost of the hotel for two of us, excluding airfare, was $500. Not bad for an all-inclusive. I did a lot of research regarding this resort and like most I was excited, yet a little skeptical. Overall, it ended up being a decent vacation. DAY 1 - We arrived at El Mandarin on Sunday 5/14 at around 4PM. We were given a room in the efficiency building which I was not aware that they even had. Room was of a nice size and was clean. Air worked ok. One problem was that our bath tub did not drain very well which I cannot stand. Also, the resort was extremely crowded and therefore the efficiency building was very loud. We later learned that it was Mother's Day in Mexico on Monday so the resort was really crowded with families and tons of kids. After we settled in we went straight to the beach. I was dying to check out the water, one of the main things I was looking forward to. All the reviews I read said the water was murky, but I just couldn't believe it. After seeing the water for myself I was sadly disappointed. It was very murky and full of seaweed. It was windy while we were there, but I can assure you the wind had nothing to do with the color of the water. It is just the location of the hotel. After a while we went to get a couple drinks. It took forever. The bar at the pool was crowded and there was only one bar tender. They even ran out of beer later on in the afternoon. I couldn't believe it! Later on that evening we requested to switch rooms and to be moved to one of the bungalows. By the end of the first day I couldn't wait to get home and was quite disappointed. Day 2 - We woke up to find a room change notice under our door. I was glad because I thought we'd need to constantly ask them to move us. It rained for most part of the second day so we did not do much as far as sitting at the beach. All the families and little kids were checking out. From here on out the resort became nice and peaceful. We made reservations for the free shuttle into town for the following day. We moved into our new room around 4PM. New room was very nice. AC kept the room like an icebox. Shower worked good, and our bungalow was very close to the beach in building 9. DAY 3,4,5 - Vacation turned around from this point. We took the shuttle on the third day into town. It drops off right near 5th Avenue. We went straight to the beach which is like a 5 min walk from where the shuttle drops off. Now I was happy. The water was absolutely beautiful. It was the aqua blue water you picture in the Carribean. We took the shuttle into town 3 days in a row and sat on the beach there and played in the water. There are also a couple really neat bars we went to there. The one we like was El Pirata (the Pirate I believe). The thing that was cool was instead of bar stools there were swings at the bar that you could swing in while you drink. Was nice and relaxing. The Rooms - The room that we were in at El Mandarin after we moved was nice. Couch, fridge, great AC. Very clean. Make sure you request a room in the bungalow. The Beach - Like I said the water is very murky, even black at some points with all the dirt and seaweed. However, the sand itself is clean for the most part. There is a beach boy constantly raking the seawide that washes up on the shore. There are plenty of beach chairs and palapas. We never had a problem getting one. The dive shop is right there if you want to check out kayaks, catamarans, snorkel stuff, or rent jet skis. If all you want to do is sit at the beach and tan then the beach here will suit you just fine. The Food - Overall the food was very good. The buffet had a different theme everynight. Lots of variety. I really enjoyed the spicy Mexican salsa and all the guacamole. Lots of fresh seafood. Fresh omelettes filled with what you like for breakfast. There are two specialty restaurants which require reservations. They can only be made the day of. I prefered this because when we have been to other All-inclusives you could make reservation days in advance and they would always fill up. The specialty restaurants were good, nothing spectacular. There is the international restaurant, El Quetzal upstairs in the lobby. It was the restaurant where you needed to look nice, no shorts etc. The food was good for the most part. One night I had the fish in esparagus sauce which was really good. Another night I had the lamb chops which weren't that good. The other restaurant is El Mandarin Mexican restaurant which they have at the pool snack bar. I think I had the fried chicked tacos for the main course which werent that great. However, the appetizers the had set out were really great. Tostadas, tomales, etc. Between the 2 restaurants and the buffet the food was overall pretty good. The Bars - Lobby Bar and Beach Bar. Both were fine. I drank lots of Corona and Bananna Mamas. Didnt have to wait long at all (with the exception of that first day) The Pool - We didn't spend any time in the pool. The pool was kinda small, but big enough for the size of the resort. Don't think it was very deep. Maybe 4 ft at deepest. No swim up bar. Had activities like water polo and pool volleyball. Hotel Shuttle - This is what saved our vacation. We took the free shuttle to and from town 3 days in a row. It is about 15 min into town. Shuttle drops off right near 5th avenue. 5 min from awesome beach. You can only sign up one day prior. I believe Alex arrives at the desk around 8AM so sign up early. However, one day we even managed to sign up for the free shuttle a couple hours prior. The shuttle runs every hour starting at noon. Only the 12PM and 1PM shuttle leaving the hotel are free, otherwise its 3USD per person. Coming back the free shuttle is 430PM and 530PM Staff & Service - Overall the service was really great. Alex, the guy at the tours desk that does the shuttle reservations is very helpful. Remembered our name during our stay. The activities guys and gals were really cool. Always had something going on. They would talk to you and ask you to participate, but would never pressure you. Staff was very friendly. Bartenders were great. Very friendly and remembered your name and always made great drinks. Entertainment - At around 830PM there would be a live band on the patio area by the main lobby. They would play oldies and rock. A lot of the older crowd seemed to enjoy it. We did not see any of the other shows they did later at night. Grounds - The grounds of the resort were beautiful. They were very clean and very well maintained. Always someone doing gardening or making some sort of improvements. Overall, our stay at El Mandarin was a nice one. For the price it would be hard to find better quality, especially for an all-inclusive.

Go into Playa and eat at La Parilla - a fantastic restaurant!!! 3.) the power went out maybe 10 times on Sat and Sun - very annoying but it stopped and as far as we could tell never went out again. We had no problems with our a/c - but it seemed to be a hit or miss thing. Some of our friends had issues, while we did not. 4.) the bugs - there are bugs in Mexico, but again it was hit or miss - some rooms had issues, while others did not. **Not sure we'll go back to this resort, it won't be next year at least!

The beach itself was well kept and has a new pier you can walk out on. However, the water was the real downside. The water was full of seedweed all week and was a dirty brown color. No one went near it. As we walked down and up the beach we saw that other areas had water that was quite clear and clean. So it appears to be a localized problem at this resort. The rooms are somewhat plain, and we did have an ant probem in our room. We also had a problem with the a/c and the electricy the first couple of days.

There were plenty of activities organized by the hard working staff, however, if you didn't want to do anything but eat, drink & people watch, that was fine too. The grounds are beautifully maintained and our room was very nice. The food was not gourmet, but for being mostly buffets, it was fresh and there was plenty of things to choose from at every meal. The drinks were good, make sure you find Antonio at the poolside bar, he makes the best Long Islands we've had anywhere. The only downside we encountered was that while the beach was very well maintained, there is nothing to break the surf, so the water is not very clear or usable. While we were there, the only people in the Sea were some brave souls who had rented Jet-Skis. But the pool is very large and that's were everyone hung out during the day.

My wife and I just got back from Playa del Carmen, we spent 1 week from March 27th, and we just loved it. This is going to be a long review, as I did lots of research for months before we choose El Mandarin, and feel its only fair to cover off EVERYTHING! The resort is beautiful. It is 10-15 minutes north of Playa del Carmen by shuttle or taxi. The shuttle runs from noon to 5:00pm, and then returns. It costs $3 USD, but, the noon & 1:00pm shuttles are free, and the 4:30pm & 5:30pm back to the resort. Otherwise, you have to pay. You also have to book your spots the day or days before. We had no problems, just go up to the travel agent desk in the lobby and sign up asap. Taxi's cost $105 pesos or $10 USD. They are great, direct, clean, safe and taxi's can be found anywhere. The resort itself is on the beach, and it is a few minutes just to drive to the lobby from the highway. Don't worry, all shuttles, buses and taxi drop off and pick up at the lobby. We never walked further then the lobby. The grounds are so well maintained and beautilful, it is amazing how many people they have working throughout. Everyone essentialy spoke English. We basically said Hola, Gracias, Que hora and Cuando Cuesta Esta (how much, you will say that alot). All the staff were exceptional, and made sure that if you had questions or concerns that they were addressed. They were always friendly, outgoing and extremely helpful, especially those at guest services. The animation team were great, incredible that they work from 9:30am till midnight, 6 days a week. They are on the beach in the morning, stretching, walks, beach & pool volleyball. They are very outgoing and friendly, speaking English, Spanish and French. It really reminded me of camp and they were camp counsellors. The reception is the only thing that was average. Although, I think it is because they have to listen to all of the complaints. We had none whatsoever, and I am a very, very picky individual who does not want to have any stress to deal with. You can exchange USD, Euros or Canadian dollars, but only at specific times. Also, whenever you pay for anyting in the hotel or town in USD, they will try to give you pesos, then when you ask for USD back, they seem not to speak English as well. This is everywhere though, not just at the hotel. The safe is $25 pesos a day, and recommended, as there is no where else to leave valuables. Make sure you got a proper phone card that will work in Mexico. We got one from home, but were unable to use it. The hotel had a payphone, but it was out of order? They charge you $7USD a minute to use the phone, so don't bother. You can use the internet room in the hotel for $3.50USD for 15 minutes. It is expensive, but cheaper then the phone. They have internet cafes in town that apparently were $1 for the sametime, but we used the hotel one for quick communication, and had no problems. Even if you arrive early, your room will not be ready. Everyday it seemed the people arrived early, but the rooms were not done until 3:00pm, which, is the actual check-in time anyways. They put you bags in a room with a security guard, then you can change to goto the beach or normally it is lunch time, you can eat. Not an inconvenience, so, don't worry about it. The rooms, well, we were in 3606, and we think that this was the best room at the resort. We asked for a king bed, balcony room with a view, and that is exactly what we got. It was beautiful. The room is the very last complex north of the resort on the beach, and it was just great. The room itself was large, clean and we never had any problems with insects, geckos or anything. They were cleaned everyday and we tipped a dollar everyother day for the maid services, and things went well. There is a mini fridge, 2 waters when you arrived, nothing else. I thought this might have been a problems, but it was not. Drinks were at the bar in the lobby and the bar at the pool. Make sure you ask everytime you go by the lobby bar for bottled water and take it to your room. We didn't know this the first night, spend lots of money for bottled water at the store in the lobby. We just kept stocking up on the bottled water, take water with you everywhere you go, especially if you are going on an excurstion. The bathroom was clean, no problems. Everything is tiled. When you get your key to the room it should also come with a security key that you plug into the wall that turns on the electrictity. The AC was great and no problems. The last day the hairdryer blew a fuse. I told them at the front desk at breakfast, said that it was not a problem, but they still fixed it in an hour. Remember, this is Mexico, and time is slower, that is everywhere. The beach and pool are clean. The pool is not huge, but, we never went into it anyways. We seemed to wake up early everyday, so, we went to put our towels out by 6:00am. You don't have to be this early, but it ensures that you get a cushioned lounge chair where you want. There are signs that say you can only be away from the chairs for a half hour, but that doesn't happen. We never had a problem though, and always sat where we wanted. The water on the beach was mainly clear. It is a windy location at times, and this really can cause the water to \"whip up\" sand to make it a little merky, but still clean. The water was also mirky in Playa del Carmen when it was windy as well. There is Tres Rios about 15 minutes up the beach, this is a natural park that has rivers running out to sea. You can walk up to the facility, and for $17 USD can use the resort for the day. We did not go, ran out of time, but were told it was a lot of fun. The smell, well, if you live on the west coast in BC, you will know what I am talking about. There is a \"swampy\" smell near the middle of the resort, and it is not sewage or garbage. It is the nature smell of \"swamp\", I can't explain it any other way. It is not bad or overwhelming. Apparently, it is the area where the Blue Hermit Crab's live, and it is a \"natural\" occurring smell. It basically is only when you walk by the spot, and no where else at all. Room 3606 seemed to be the furthest away from the main building, and it was less then a 5 minute walk, which we enjoyed everyday. The Mexican restaurant is at the pool bar, and is nice to sit at. They have breakfast there after 10:00am, then snacks from 3:00pm-5:00pm. Smaller selection then the main buffet, but just as good. They have fruit slushy drinks there all day, very sweet. This place then becomes the Mexican restaurant at 8:00pm, we never went, but were told that the food was great. There is a gourmet restaurant on the 2nd floor of the main facility, and it was excellent. I thought that I was back in the 50's in Europe, it was a nice atmosphere. Remember to tip the waiter, we gave him $5 USD. We also tipped the busboys in the buffet every now and then. $1 USD seems to work, also for the bartenders. Not all the time, just when you feel they do a little more then normal. We were told that everyone tips, but we saw very few people doing this. Tip Jorge in the main buffet, he was great. The main buffet was wonderful, every night there was a differant theme for food, but the main stays were always there. The food was hot, plentiful and we never got bored with it. The deserts were great, lots of fruits as well. We stayed away from the salads, but they looked great as well. The resort has purified water throughout. All the ice and drinks are made from the purified water. We just stuck to the bottle water, but drank everything else. We did not start to feel \"odd\" until the night before we were leaving, so no problems. You will most likely have some \"changes\" once you get home as I am. Fortunately, it didn't happen when we were away. We think that this is more to do with eating fruit at everymeal, drinking water all day and eating large meals 3x a day at a buffet. I think I gained 20lbs. There is no room service, no snack bar later on, but, you can ask for a take away container and get food to go. We did this with breakfast buns and deserts, just take it back to the room and keep in the fridge. We had friends who were here a few months ago, and they asked for a picnic lunch for Tulum, and they staff helped them out. Security was great. There were staff members around all the time, even late at night. There were gates at the entrance, every vehicle going in and out was noted. It was just terrific. This was a fabulous vacation for both of us. For people who never thought of going to Mexico, we would certainly return to both Playa del Carmen and Hotel El Mandarin. Oh, the guests were mostly Canadians, Americans and Europeans. It seems that on weekends Canadians arrive, then the Americans, and in the early week the Europeans. A lot of people from Quebec, lots of French spoken. There were never any problems, most people kept to themselves. We did meet several couples on the excursions, and kept bumping into them at the resort. You can see the other resorts if you go on excursions, as quite often the bus will pick other people up. You can see how nice El Mandarin is, and that being a smaller resort is great. There were families there with young children, no problems. They have a small area for the little ones, and apparently, one of the animation staff can babysit them almost all day. The kids seemed to be having fun. There were lots of older guests, retirees, families with older kids, some singles groups and young couples. We are in early 30's and loved the place. We are not party goers, so, if you want to drink, dance and be merry all the time, all day, Cancun may be more suited for you. If you want a wonderful, relaxed vacation with no worries. El Mandarin is great. As this is really, really long, I will do seperate reviews on Playa del Carmen, tours and Air Transat, which we will never fly again.

We have been to the area at least 30 times over the last 30 years, and have had an opportunity to visit at least 20 of the properties there. This property is priced at the lower end of the offerings in the area. It is not a bad value within that price point. First the good points, the hotel grounds and rooms were clean and nice for the price. The food was slightly better than others in which we have stayed in the same price range. We were a party of eight and had two small children, ages six and two, and they hotel offered a children's program which would offer babysitting services at no charge during the daytime until about 6:00PM. I was pleased with the program and the staff was better than expected. The pool was large for the price, and was adequate. If you want an inexpensive vacation and expect to stay mainly around the pool, this will work for you. The bad, this hotel is a 10 minute and $ 10.00 US cab ride from Playa del Carmen. It is about 12 KM from town. The hotel offers shuttle service after 12 noon for $ 3.00 per person. You can rent a car at the hotel but the prices were 70% higher than in town. The hotel has a rental service on site, but will not allow other rental companies to deliver to the door of the hotel. I rented a Suburban for $ 120 per day including insurance in Playa and the hotel rate was $ 200 plus insurance. The gym consists of an outside area near the pool with older free weights, and the hotel would be best served by removing the equipment. The beach has an artificial reef which traps what I believe is seaweed, causing the water in front of the hotel to be brown and smell of sulfur. The front desk personnel were not eager to serve us, and although this did not cause us a great problem, I believe it could be a problem for others. The lobby bar was understaffed at times and could or did not promptly serve its customers. The hotel offers Internet service, but it was expensive and slow. The hotel charged $ 1.00 to connect you to a local telephone number. The shows were amateurish, but I have never see a great show at any of the hotels in the area. None of these were terrible problems, but I believe there are better buys in the area and I would not recommend this hotel for most travelers. If you need any help or advice, please email me.

I am happy to say that most of what had been written was not, by any means, completely accurate. I am usually a very picky \"Five Star\" type who would rather spend the extra money and not worry about anything. But in this case, my daughter and I were very pleased. The rooms and bathrooms were a bit shopworn, and my guess is that they will probably be redecorated soon. But they are immaculate, with clean marble floors, delightful balconies or patios, Cable TV and other amenities. The gardens are just gorgeous, reminding me of some of the more beautiful resorts in South Florida. We went for the sun and not for the food, so I really can't comment on the food except to say that it was presented very nicely each evening. The ocean was a bit murky the first few days we were there, but the wind cleared it up in a few days, and by the end of the week I was swimming and kayaking in crystal clear water. We never really had trouble finding beach or pool chairs. A few were broken, but there always seemed to be plenty. The beach is beautiful and clean. As is so often the case in Mexico, the staff were extremely hardworking and friendly. The common places in the resort were always immaculate, with staff always cleaning, picking up, painting, you name it. I never felt at all uncomfortable there. Children were well behaved, and the pool seemed more than adequate for people like me who swim regularly. There is a very neat, roped-off deep area, which allows for more rigorous swimming if you want it. My only complaint is that Club El Mandarin is quite isolated, and a taxi or shuttle is required to get to Playa del Carmen. And reservations are needed for the non-buffet restaurants and the shuttle into town. The power does go out from time to time, but the staff is generally very quick to attend to that problem, so we were never really inconvienced. All in all, it is a fine place.

The staff at the pool and beach work hard to entertain you, just give them a chance and be polite just as you would in any social situation. The beach did have \"murky water\" due to a sea weed like material but this was cleaned up March 8 and 9, now the beach is quite clean subject to wind and rolling waves disturbing the sand. There is not very good snorkling at the beach of El Mandarin but we had a good expeience going on the tour given by Blue diving traveling to Cozumel. Apparently you need a coral reef below the water to provide the habitat for the fish, sandy bottom is nice to walk on but does not sustain the fish. I have never been to the Mayan Riveria before and found it to be a tremendous experience of lovely sandy beaches,warm water, and fabulous sun shine for water recreation.

The cleaning staff were exceptional and the maintainence of the property is excellent. Anything that was asked for was taken care of immediately.

All they keep asking is: \"when can we go back again?\" Service in the dining areas was always friendly and the 'animation crew' was spectacular at keeping the guests well entertained, busy and laughing! There was always something for all age groups to do - and the guests on the whole were happy and relaxed. The service from the tour booking staff and the meal booking staff was not quite so good - they have no problem keeping you queueing up for hours while they fill in an amazing amount of paper work in order to complete their tasks. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious, and kept clean at all times. Water was highly chlorinated - but we should probably be grateful for that! Food was of a very high standard with a huge amount of choice - especially at dinner time, and the biggest complaint everybody had was that they were eating (and drinking) too much and that they wouldn't be able to fit into any clothes! They have a 'fine dining' restaurant which you can only eat at with a booking - but it was quite disappointing - it lacked atmosphere, was fairly slow and had very few choices on the menu. The main dining area was a lot more fun, always lots going on, and not quite as stuffy. The dining area down at the pool was great for lunches - quick and easy break from the midday sun. Beaches were kept in pristine condition, and there was additional beach area closer to the pool where shade under the palapas was to be found. There were times of the day that a lot of music is played at the pool area - mostly the middle of the day - this is to accompany the various pool sports and activites that are taking place - and generally it just adds to the fun atmosphere. If you prefer it quieter - one can set up camp on a beach a little further south of the hotel, or choose to sunbath a little earlier in the day while its still quiet. We were dissappointed that their were no snorkels/goggles for hire at the water sports section, so take your own. The resort is just a nice size, not so big that you need transport to get back and forth from the beach, but the walk up to the main building where everything happens in the evenings - is good to help digest the food you're taking in! It's a major trek to get to the archery - but fun nonetheless. A visit to Xel Ha and Tulum is well worth it - we booked through a tour group in Play del Carmen - probably saved ourselves about $8 per person, but there were some tricky moments when we thought they had forgoten all about us as they arrived so late to pick us up. Nice thing about being as far north as El mandarin is that you are one of the last set of guests to be picked up on the route back to the airport, yet one of the first to be dropped when first arriving. The hotel does provide one or two free shuttles into Playa del Carmen a day - but again its a major process trying to book yourselves onto them. The rest of the shuttle rides during the day cost $3 per person. We discovered that a $10 taxi ride for the whole family was quicker and less frustrating. So - if we are looking for that 'club type' experience again - I would not hesitate to return to El Mandarin - but next time I would like to experience some of the REAL MEXICO and for that I think we'll have to stay in a B& B or hotel in one of the nearby villages.

Ages in our group were 5 to 60 and everyone enjoyed their stay. After reading previous reviews of this resort, I was a little scared to go, but decided to make the best of it, as reservations had already been made. Much of what you read is true (intermittent strange smells, rooms not perfectly maintained) but I also found many things better than reviewed (food, exercise equipment, beach, service). True things-we did expereience either musty or seweage like smells intermittently, but never in our room, and we could easily walk away from them. Our room was large, but we did notice some mildew spots in the shower and missing or sloppily applied caulking or grout (however, it was cosmetic only). Better than I read in earlier reviews-service. We had booked a room with 2 double beds, but were pleasantly surprised when we upgraded to a jr. suite at no charge, when we arrived. Junior suite had 2 double beds PLUS 2 couches that converted to single beds. We also had a 2 person jacuzzi tub in addition to a separate shower stall. No problems with crabs or geckos in our room, although we saw alot of geckos in the exterior hallways after dark. Food-lots of good choices at buffet type restaraunt. Great for all of us, as kids could eat food they were used to (ie-chicken, turkey, steamed rice), and adults could try some new things. The El mandarin restaraunt next to the pool had a grill serving hot dogs and burgers at lunch time, and cold drinks all day long (nice to have in close proximity to the beach). We ate 1 night at the gourmet restaurant and all enjoyed the 4 course meal. Some tried the ostrich, kids mostly had shrimp or beef. Exercise equipment-not rusted, but was sparse. Was in an outdoor area-hard to concentrate on work-out when beautiful ocean is beckoning. Beach was swept at night, and all morning after stormy, windy night and morning. Courtesy of Beach boy staff (beach cleaners) beach remained easy to walk on even with windy weather stirring up the seas and sending gunk up. On good weather, calm days, seas was crystal clear and beaches incredibly beautiful. Service. We are english speaking, americans and had NO trouble with service, from front desk to concierge to grounds staff. There were 2 color wrist bands we noticed while staying at the El Mandarin-1 color for adults and another for minors (under 18). No difference was noted for different languages. Very friendly area-while walking through the resort, most people gave a greeting (Hola) to others walking nearby. When dealing w/service staff, it seemed to soften people by starting with hello, or hola, and Buenos Dias. It was a simple courtesy we saw people of all languages making. If you look for bad things, you will find them, but if you look for positive things-you will find them in abundance. This is true for most places you visit, anywhere in the world.

They left our luggage upon arriving out front of the hotel for over an hour unguarded. We finally asked them why our items were left there and they said sometimes things slip between the cracks. Our room was not ready at 3:00p, it was closer to 4pm. When our room was finally ready the bellboy led the way and I had to carry my own luggage to the room. There was a lot of stairs to go down. The staff did not speak very good english and it was hard to get answers. Food is OK at best. Not enought staff at the bars. Tip BIG if you want waited on. TV has 3 channels, one english speaking (ABC) Detriot station. They promised to send up a wine basket because our room was not ready and we never recieved it.They seemed to prefer Euro's over Americans. They waited on them first. I ordered beef at the resturant, they served the Euro's first and their portions were much larger. My girlfriends portion was much larger then mine also and we had the same thing.Rather then argue with the hotel staff we went to Playa Del Carmen everyday and salvaged the vacation. We found a great club on the beach and the beer was only $1.50 USD. Funjet said if we had any problems to let them know and they would handle it for us. They are worthless, when we explained our treatment they changed their story and said they were just liasons and couldn't do anything. I asked for a room closer to the pool because I have bad knees and it was a long walk and they told me the hotel was full. We met four girls down there, they asked for a different room and got it.

My wife and I had a reasonably good time. The resort was very clean and our room was very nice. No problem with the AC. We were on the second floor of one of the eight room villas. Ocean view if you stood at the end of our patio and stretched your neck.We did see them replacing the AC unit in another villa. In a day and a half they had it all done and it looked to be major job. The old unit that came out was the size of a car. The food was so so. If you want to eat upstairs at the sit down restaurant \"Quetzel\" you have to be at the guest services desk at 7:45 AM as the desk opens at 8:00Am and it books quickly. The drinks were OK but no fruit in them like other Riviera Maya resorts. No big deal. The beach at the resort is pretty good but if you walk south a couple hundred yards its much better. If you walk north on the beach you are at Tres Rios eco park. We acted like we belonged there and just checked out where the river meets tha ocean. It's real pretty. We did things on the cheap. We used the collectivos to get around. You have to walk up to the highway about 10 -15 minutes to catch one. If you're going south it's a pain because you go from the resort to playa de carmen, 10 minutes,15 pesos and the have to switch to go towards Tulum. Playa to Tulum is about 50 miles, only costs 20 pesos. We checked out the beach and bungalow type resorts south of the Tulum Ruins and the beach is incredible. Maybe next time. The collectivo from Playa to Cancun is 30 pesos, about an hour. We didn't care much for the nightly entertainment. After the 2nd night we stopped going. We were there for a week. It's like they bought a powerful stereo system and gave a few high school kids $100 for a budget and said put on some sort of show every night for a week. I'm not into boom boom music. The hotel staff were fine. They charge 25 pesos a day to use the safe in the room. It seemed a bit petty but what are you going to do. You need somewhere to put your travel stuff and money. We've stayed at better all inclusive Riviera Maya resorts for the same price but this was the cheapest when we could go. If the US economy gets stronger I think these places are going to get more and more expensive. For $650 you really can't go wrong. Being all inclusive is nice , not only is it more economical especially if you're a drinker, but if you stay at a place that's not it seems you spend all kinds of timefiguring out where to eat and how to get there.

The gourmet restaurant upstairs was OK, but we preferred the buffet. The rooms were nice sized, and each had air conditioning.

It is average, nice decoration, smiling Mexican waiters and bar tenders but a horrible entertainment and activities team.

But how should they smile and greet if even the Manager doesn^t. No service, no chance to get some help to get a tennis partner! 25 minutes after volleyball is announced still no staff at the volleyball court. Staff is flirting with guests and not doing the job. The village is European has nothing to do with Mexico. They waste a lot of resources, use too much water and produce tons of plastic garbage. At the beach sometimes 3 different musics from 3 different spots, horrible stretching and a horrible programm. Guests are waitinhg permanently for the \"primadonnas\". Worst of all is the daily showtime. Sketches about gays and transvestites for more than 1 hour and the entertainment team doesn^t even stop when 50% of the guests have left. I saw programms that Club med played mor than 10 myears ago. Parts of \"Cabaret\" so so poor and horrible quality: the guy didn't even learn his playback!

We preferred to go to the beach and we were never pestered. The water was clear and clean when we were there and no smell (other than the salt smell which I like) There is a pier out to one side but I also liked to walk out on that and see the pelicans. The other way you can walked for miles on deserted sand beach. There is a new hotel going up next door but we didn't hear any noise from it. We also thought the buffet was very good with a lot of choice and the staff were very courteous and friendly. It was rainy season when we went so we were prepared but we only had rain overnight one night. It was extremely hot and humid so I would probably go at a different time of year but nothing to do with the hotel.

We went in a shuttle van with a small group. Our quide was Rauol and he was wonderful. We went to Akumel area and snorkelled in a lagoon and then out to the reef. It was also perfect visibility and calm which helped. We saw sea turtles and sting rays and tons of beautiful fish. We then went to Grand Cenote and snorkelled in the fresh water and into some caves. Very cool. We then packed up and went to a deserted beach south of Tulum and swam in the ocean there while lunch was prepared. It was wonderful sitting out under a simple hut, eating lunch, looking at the ocean. (Maybe not for the playacar set) Then after lunch we went inland and into a jungle area and snorkelled at another cenote.

This is something that we felt APPLE travel could have mentioned when we booked this trip that cost us each over 1050.00 bucks!We arrived to the hotel and checked in rather quickly. Headed to the beach and were very disappointed in the water. Not really clear and blue like the other times we have been to Mexico. More green. Now this could have been caused by the tropical storm they had prior to our visit. The landscaping was beautiful and rooms were arranged in bungalows with about 7-8 rooms per bungalow.

Each night we killed at least 20 of them before falling to sleep and then waking up to even more the next morning. This is no lie, we took pictures of the mosquitos we killed to send them to APPLE. We wanted to sleep under the covers to avoid mosquito bites however, the AC was not working. It was extremely hot in our room the entire week! Calls were place by ourselves and other guests and it never got any cooler. No ceiling fans to even move the hot air around or possibly keep the mosquitos away from our bodies. The dresser was broken, along with the refrigerator and the two lamps that were in the room. Power was lost a few times we were there. One night it was out for over 4 hours. Which made the room even more hot because the AC was not even blowing out the typical warm air that it had been throughout the week. This place supposedly had a swim up bar. In past years swim up bar to me was you swim up to the bar without having to get out of the pool. At the El Mandarin you had to swim through the pool, get out and then walk to the bar. We were told that reservations to the \"Gourmet\" restaurant were made through guest services. After getting the run around we found out reservations were made through the place were you picked up your towels for the beach/pool. Go figure! The lobby was nicely decorated with lots of seats but it was like a sauna in there. Very, very HOT!There were four of us traveling and as of now all four have spent the day on the toilet. One got sick 2 days before leaving and the other three were at least able to make it back home. We expected the food to be not so good anyway, just because we are away from home etc. We stayed clear of the meats, seafood etc. and still got sick. Not sure if this was from the food or water. Supposedly the water was filtered. We did not drink the water but had drinks with ice i in them. We have visited the Mayan Rivera and Cancun previously and have never had an experience such as this one and have never been sick like this.The maids, waiters and other staff members were very pleasant and did their jobs excellent!If it wasn't for our sense of humor, we may have left Mexico earlier than planned.

I am not a very fussy person. I like to relax with the best of them! However, it buy no means met my expectations. I must admit that Punta Cana in the D.R. is still at the top of my list! We arrived Cancun via Apple Vacations from Pittsburgh, PA. USA 300 Charter flight both too and fro were excellant! Great Service all around. Once checked in we were insturcted to go to our rooms that our luggage would be right up. Well, an hour later it did arrive only after I tracked down the bell boy at the front entrance and made a special request to have it brought to our room. The rooms are spacious but plain. However, tub is very narrow. No extra linen was provided. One towel per person. Wash clothes were not always left in the room after the maid cleaned. Our Tv had two channels and no remote. That's no biggy though we really didn't go there to watch tv anyhow. We had no hot water one entire day. Did call the front desk. Although someone came in to check our rooms water temp it still was not hot until the next day. There was a mini bar within a cupboard in the room. Was stocked with two bottles of water. That's all. All other resorts we stayed had a few bottles of the local beer, soda, etc, stocked daily. There was a safe in the closet. However, if you wanted to use it you had to pay $9.00 US dollars a day for a key. All inclusive???? That's [--]! SO much for all inclusive! I'll fill you in later. Why not now! Ok! The pamphlet you get when you check in say's snorkeling is included! Guess What? It's not! They said they have made some changes since that flyer was printed! Food: I must admit that the food was wonderful. Great selections both afternoon and evening. Overall presentation was very nice. Evening buffet was not open until 7pm or a little later on the norm. My husband is an extremely picky eater. He made out just fine though. I will say that the resorts in Punta Cana should take a few notes with respect to food preperation and presentation. But, think about it. Punta Cana is moon years behind Mexico as far as travelers. This I think is what I like. It's not built up or near as commercial as Mexico. At least not yet!!!! You get the true feel of the tropical Island atmosphere in Punta Cana. No Interstates, no Wal- Mart, No Chili's! Pool is not very attractive. Nothing special. Water was bath water warm, bottom was extremely slippery as well the water felt slimmy. You actually felt like you had a film on your skin. I am sure this is from all the tanning products. But, Can't they maintain this through chemicals or filteration systems? The beach I think was the most discouraging!!! Water had horrible odor. Not the crystal clear seas as you see in any catalog. Not by a long shot! The beach front of the hotel was groomed well. You just seemed so far from the water if you layed in the loungers. Humm, maybe that's not a bad thing because of the odor! lol Anyhow, if you read this and need more info I would love to chat about this trip. Oh, one other thing. When you check in you are given an arm band. You will find that Red is for US Folks (English). All other nationialties are given there own color code as well. Yes, that's right youa re color coded! Believe that one! This is good in one way only. And that's somewhat debatable!!!!! Most all of the staff speak a little of each lanquage. When they see the color of band they know exactly what lanquage you speak! That is if your not BI Linguial! HUMMMMMMM I had great fun with this while I was there! lol Entertianment: What's that??? Oh, they had a show at 10:00pm.....That's if you had not already retired to your room because there was nothing going on after you had dinner. I mean nothing! A small band playing american music out side of the lobby.. Hello, you are in the Islands. Something authentic would be a nice splash!!! You can only drink so much Tequilla for excitement! You know what I mean? I think the disco started up one night while we were there around 11:30pm.. It was after the show! It's funny that this bothered my husband and I. We are both very layed back people when it comes to night life. We don't go out often. But this place seemed like a retirement home not a Resort! No offense to the older croud. They had the same reaction....That comment was not directed toward the Smith's! You guys were much fun! And buy no mean's do we think your old! The two of you made our trip fun! Great People! Anyhow! I think I have touched all aspects. Like I said. It was an \"OK\" trip. Not a place I would recomend or ever return. I did hear wonderful reviews on my travels back that the Ibelostar (Spelling?) in PLaya Del Carmen was out of this world. Heck, it's right down the road from the CLub EL. Now They tell me....

What few alcoholic drinks we had, they were severly watered down, and draught beer sucked. Nice grounds and the busboy in the restaurant was extremely nice.

But, I believe it is on a bay which doesn't allow the water to be washed out as easily. This by far is not a Ritz Carlton, but I would rate it a 4+ resort.

We had a GREAT TIME. The resort is very clean and beautiful and yes there was a sewer smell at times but it was no big deal you are in Mexico, our room as well was very clean- no leaks anywere. The staff was very good- I guess one plus is that we also speak spanish so it was a little easier to communicate. The food was good- breakfast was the best and the chesseburger and nachos at the snack bar were great- very addicting (I must say it does get little boring after a while). Drinks were a little water down- but they were are always willing to put more alcohol if you requested (I also tipped every now and then) they work really hard and they appreciate it. The pool was nice- the beach was OK- but hey its better than what we have here. My only advise to those who are single or couples with no kids and are looking to party this is diffently not the place for you it is very laid back, as (I mentioned in the beginning I went with my 7yr son so I was not into the parting mode) the resort is way in from the main road, so the only way to get around is via Taxi or shuttle. Please take my advise if you are looking for nightlife stay closer to Playa del carmen or cancun. I had read on a previous review, as far as, avoiding funjet tours-we reserved an excursion to Xel HA and I have to say I had no problem at all I was picked up on time-actually a little earlier and was dropped off on time. So overall I had a great time at Club EL mandarin and for the price I payed 1,688 for three people 6nts including air-all inclusive you cant beat that.

We found the grounds beautiful and well maintained and the staff hardworking and accommodating. You can choose to be as active or inactive as you desire. Our tips: Stake out your lounge chairs at the beach or pool early, and I mean early, because shaded areas go fast. Take plenty small bills. Though tipping is not required, when you see the workers hustle you want to tip them and they are truly appreciative. I used #50SPF sunscreen and was glad I did. There were a lot of toasted people! It is a lot of walking between the rooms and the lobby but you get used to it. You can't reserve the shuttle or wake up calls more than a day in advance so do it while you're in the lobby, perhaps on the way to the bar or dinner. Other comments: the sewer smell people spoke of in other reviews is just the seaweed and natural decomposition. We were on the side by the construction next door and it never disturbed us. If you can't find something to eat and enjoy at the buffet you are way too picky. Check out all the food first before you start packing your plate. You'll find nice surprises further along the buffet line and off to the sides.

When we first arrived, we were a little disappointed. Even though the hotel is beautiful and the property is well maintained, the hotel is relatively small compared to others we had stayed in before, with what seemed like 200 people. There was always a lot of walking involved. The walk from the lobby/restaurant to the room, and the walk from the room to the beach. Our room was beautiful, but the bathroom showed signs of aging (the door frame was rotten), and after a few days I noticed a leak in the bathroom, which someone attempted to repair while we were out. (We found a removed tile later). We never heard the cleaning personnel in the mornings, and usually left a tip for them, which they thanked us for with fresh flowers and nice towel arrangements. As other people had mentioned in their reviews, I also noticed the sewage smell at the beach one day, and the row of buildings we stayed in was close to a wooded area, which also smelled strange. Other guests were from Canada, the U.S., Germany, Italy and Latin America; a nice mixture. If you are thinking of taking your small children, I noticed that there were not a lot of other kids around (I could count them on two hands). Also, there was no separate baby pool. We noticed that people with similar interests would hook up with each other after a few days. For example, a few party people who liked to drink at the beach, yell jokes at each other, and hang out, created a small group of eight and had fun this way. Several teenagers became friends after a while, and were seen together, and so forth. But, this is definitely not your Cancun party crowd. The swimming pool was relatively small, and had only one tiny, deep area for swimming. There are no swim-up bars. There was limited shade around the pool area, but more shade and straw huts at the beach. The beach had nice white sand, and the ocean was also nice, even though not what I had expected from stayhe water was murky at times, and I got a rash on my arms after a few days since I have very sensitive skin. (I don't know if it was from the water). This hotel was by itself, a few miles away from Playa del Carmen. There were no other properties next door, even though a new hotel is being built next door right now. Once I went jogging by myself around 7 p.m., and I felt a little strange running all by myself along the beach after I noticed locals in some type of shed in the wilderness following the construction area. The lights around the property were very dim in the evening, and I would not send children to explore the hotel during the evening by themselves. (I saw very limited security there). We received a separate key to turn on the A/C unit, which was a smart way to be energy-efficient, and provided an instant cold room once we returned. Our room did not have a refrigerator. The tap water was salty, and we made sure to brush our teeth with drinking water to avoid getting sick. There is fresh water all over the hotel. The telephone was very expensive, with a $7 connection fee and a rate of $5 per minute. But there is a cheaper Internet alternative at the hotel and in Playa del Carmen. (The hotel offers free buses to town). The food was buffet-style and was very good and fresh! Even though I am a picky eater, I always found something to eat. I liked the coffee, and the alcoholic drinks were not too sweet as in other resorts sometimes, but a little watered down during the day. As in other all-inclusives, there was a restaurant with hamburgers and hot dog-type of food by the beach for people who were too lazy to walk up to the main restaurant by the lobby. We had the feeling we'd get bored pretty soon, so we attempted to learn windsurfing, which we really enjoyed. The staff for non-motorized watersport was extremely nice, so was the entertainment staff who motivated people to participate in activities, such as aerobics, volleyball and salsa dancing, but wasn't pushy. Their idea was: \"Go, have fun, this is hink!\" There is a pool table, which is not in great condition, and a ping pong table with horrible peddles. The \"gym\" at the beach is very old, but I was able to use a few weight-lifting machines to keep in shape. The evening entertainment was okay. Of the three shows we saw, two times were dance evenings for which the hotel had hired dancers not belonging to the hotel, and one was a game evening for hotel guests. Some guests told us that they would go back to this hotel, which is understandable for people who usually go three star. Overall, it is a good value for the money, but from the four four-star all-inclusives I have been to before, this would be my least favorite because of its smaller size, the hotel being in the middle of no-where, the inconvenience of walking long distances, the limited entertainment options (unless you want to spend money on tours), the average beach, and the sewage smell.", "Date": "May 30, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, IA", "Title": "\u201cAaaaahhhhh!\u201d", "Author": "IA_rover", "ReviewID": "UR1031746", "Content": "Just returned from a week at the El Mandarin. We were delighted with the resort, and had no real complaints. We were treated well, and enjoyed the resort immensely. Unless you are unusually picky, you couldn't go wrong. Keep in mind, though, that it is in the jungle in Mexico. There were geckos hanging out on the balconies, and in one spot, the scent of mangrove swamp can be detected. Our room had a few minor problems like a balcony light that didn't work, and they shut the water off for repairs for about fifteen minutes one evening. We accepted it as part of the adventure.As to the food, there was no need to go hungry. The buffet was abundant and varied, and quite good, with a number of cultures represented. It is buffet food, so don't expect the same sort of artful food as a fancy restaurant. However, it is much better than buffet food I've had elsewhere. The \"gormet\" meal wasn't that different, other than the service. Enjoy it, but skip the lamb chops - they only had about five bites of meat. Drinks were ever-present and generally tended to be mixed somewhat weak. I didn't travel to Mexico to spend the week plastered out of my mind, though, so I actually preferred them the way they were.Trips to town were fun - except that the air conditioning on the shuttle van was broken, so they tended to be warm.
