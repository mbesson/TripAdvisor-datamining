Stayed in room 202 at the front of the hotel. We arrived before check in time and the lady at the reception kindly let us leave our bags whilst we went sight seeing. The other 3 members of staff we met at reception were equally friendly and helpful. On the plus side this hotel is in a great location for the museums, restaurants and bars. The room was clean and tidy and reasonably spacious with plenty of wardrobe space and a hairdryer. It was -10 outside but the room was very warm, infact too warm for my partner. There was plenty of hot water in the shower which had good pressure. We had breakfast on both mornings which worked out at 5 euros per breakfast. If you only had breakfast on one morning it is more expensive. The breakfast was a cold buffet with meats, cheeses, smoked salmon, bread, hard boiled eggs, toast , fruit juice, fruit, tea and coffee. For the price it was a perfectly acceptable start to the day. On the down side, the staircase upto the rooms is very steep, but only what you would expect in the small hotels in Amsterdam. The bathroom floor is marble and was very cold and no bath mat was provided. I welcome addition would have been a tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

On our departure day we checked out of the room but left our luggage to the hotel as our flight was to leave only later and we wanted to still go walk around the area.

As we did not confess to the crime we were accused of (we definitely had no reason or need to steal a blanket), the manager threatened to call the police. As it was only a blanket and we did not want to miss our flight because of it, we had to pay 40 euros for a blanket we did not steal.

The hotel was conveniently located only across the canal from the Rijksmuseum, 3 blocks from the Leidseplein Square, also the Interliner #370 bus got me from Schiphol to the square area in under 40 minutes and for only $4 euro - as well it was a short jaunt from this bus stop & tram stops at the square, so it was super easy to take trams #2 or #5 to Centraal and Damrak. The night auditor, Ramses, was super accomodating and highly entertaining, his impressions of the Godfather left me in stitches. My room, a single located on the 2nd floor, was behind an extra doorway and through a very dark short hall, I felt rather like \"Ann Frank\", staying behind a cupboard, and this tended to make my short Amsterdam stay even more atmospheric. The room was all I needed as I was not 'in' much, the bathroom was only just past my 'cupboard' entryway and was clean & neat as a pin. The entire hotel was neat, smallish and very European in every way; breakfast buffet was ample and the nook in the lower basement area was simply perfect! From this location I could easily walk to the square, where as I said, trams and buses could take you anywhere easily, also nearby was a canal tour pick-up point, only 1/2 block from the hotel. I went to Boom Chicago, at the Leidsepleintheatre, and thoroughly enjoyed their Improv Show as well as the friendly staff. I also easily and cheaply rented a bike (Mac Bike) only 2 blocks from hotel and was able to cover entire Vondelpark, AlbertCuypstraat and other areas handily.

The hotel is a very typical Amsterdam building one like many I've painted during my 12yrs running a repair and decorating company in Amsterdam. It has small steep narrow staircases and many Europeans to say nothing of N. Americans would baulk at the stairs, however for those on a budget and for younger travellers I can't recommend the Art Gallery (0031 (0)503175510) highly enough. 100 meters from Rijksmuseum with the van Gogh and the Stadelijk behind that - also the Concertgebouw Concert Hall. Right behind the hotel is old Amsterdam with all one would ever want from it. To the right (East) is Liedseplein and to the left and south in the biggest street market in Europe - Albert Cuype - where I lived in the early 80's.

First the good points: The hotel is reasonably near the centre of things; quite busy, convenient for transport and not too far from the major attractions. The buffet continental breakfast was very acceptable. On the more extensive negtaive side, it is the other side of the city centre from the central station (which is good for getting to and from the airport), which did cause a little extra cost and inconvenience. The hotel itself is only ten years old but shows its age; I suspect it has never been refurbished. The breakfast room is very small (only 4 tables) and becomes congested. I think the occupancy rate is not high as I was upgraded from a 'small double' to a rather misnamed 'delux' room: the double bed consisted of two singles pushed together with separate duvets for each. The flush button on the toilet was broken so that you had to use a finger nail to press the plastic stub to flush the toilet and the shower has the habit of going from warm to scalding hot rather rapidly. I did wonder what my non-delux room would have been like! A major inconvenience was that there seems to be no routine cleaning of occupied rooms! Reception informed us that rooms were not entered except when guests checked out! We were only given this information when we queried why our room has not been cleaned, bed(s) made, bins emptied or towels replaced. This despite information and notices in the room saying to leave dirty towels on the bathroom floor if they are to be replaced (the receptionist informed me that towels are only replaced on request and didn't seem to recognise this contradiction). This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in where rooms are not routinely serviced and towels replaced.
