This should have been clearly stated to us when we first buzzed in - and were seen on the tv monitors. Apart from this, which was very annoying, the staff were very good and gave us a fabulous restaurant recommendation for dinner - we ended up dining there every night.

This however, was not a problem, since there is a cafe next to the piazza. So every morning, we just buy croissants and pastries before we hit the road. The location feel safe even past midnight. The nice thing about the hotel is the free internet access via a provided laptop in the room. There is also a 46\" plasma TV, and safe.

Hotels with little signage and located in apartment buildings are a norm in this country...just look for the big green door. The room was small but well appointed and very clean, with plasma television and laptop with free internet access. This is an exceptional service for the price point (100 Euro a night). The shower is very small, so those who are larger-sized need to take this into consideration. I am 5'6\" and 130lbs, and I found it tight! The location is ideal, off the major street Via del Corso, which bisects Rome. The Spanish Steps, Piazza Venezia, Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain are all a walkable distance. And the clerks will provide you with a map. Some problems: the breakfast is meager (but again, a norm for Italy) and not served on time. The night clerk is an old man with an extremely thick Roman accent. I have spoken Italian for years and still found him difficult to understand. Good luck, for he doesn't speak English! Moreover, he smokes all night long, which is now illegal in Italy. Our room (which was on the same floor as reception) stunk during the night. The phone in the rooms only call reception. To make outside calls, you need to make them from the reception desk. Or purchase a phone card and call from a public phone. If travelling alone, or for those on a budget, or those who are only concerned about location, I recommend the hotel. But, if you want a more comfortable home-base, especially after a long day touring the sites, I would suggest looking elsewhere, and even spending the extra Euros for a more swanky hotel on the Via Veneto, where the staff is more professional and fully trained to accomodate you. This is more of a \"mom and pop\" establishment.

So location wise, you will be hard to beat it amd yes after just about finding it and using the stairs (we were lucky as our room was just on the reception level) we were ready to go! Breakfast was fine and there is a cafe just opposite if you wanted to top up but again we did not stay at the hotel for the cusisine when Italy has restaurants and cafe's in abundance! all in all, reasonable value, enough room and customer service was fine - everyone was most attentive to our needs when asked so I encourage anyone to stay here and look beyond the \"climbing of stairs, average breakfast and non American style hotel floor space\".

(you may not be as lucky---the price went up steeply after we booked our room) and this was unexpected luxury at that price point.

NO ELEVATOR, you have to climb 3 to 4 flights of stairs. Breakfast is prepackaged and brought to your room. It is very HARD to find the hotel, as the only identification is their name on the directory near the entrance. The room was not very big (but most hotels in Rome are not), and I tripped over the luggage a few times. The shower is small. In the particular room I was in, I felt like I was showering in a capsule (and I'm a small person). Don't drop the soap! The same goes for the double room my other friends stayed in. With those things in mind, the pluses are: The hotel clerks were very friendly and helpful; the room was very clean and was renovated earlier this year. There is a plasma t.v. on the wall and they have free internet access via a lap top that is provided. Located in a good section of town and the room was quiet. The colesium was a 15 minute walk and the Panthenon about 10 minutes away. If you are going to take a taxi from the airport, make arrangements for their taxi service.

After two days of travel (New Zealand is a looooong way away from everywhere), we arrived at the hotel, hot, sweaty and exhausted only to be told 'There is a problem with your reservation....but it is no problem - e have booked you in somewhere else'. I am sure that this hotel is consistent with the excellent reviews that it has received via this forum - but we will never know because the ------ bumped us, probably in favour of a dollar waving Yank! Most disapointed to be treated like this when we were anticipating a marvelous stay in a hotel that we had carefully selected and booked months in advance.
