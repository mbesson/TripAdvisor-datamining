At time of booking we requested a top floor room with terrace. Were advised that our request could not be guaranteed as rooms are allocated on a first come-first-serve basis and that these rooms are smaller. However, our request was met and we were allocated room 503 - with small terrace (big enough for small table and two chairs) overlooking nearby rooftops and beyond. The room was small but perfectly adequate and very clean. Bathroom also very small (no bath just shower, which we prefer - but with proper shower door!) but, again, very clean. There were some toiletries provided but, as we always take our own, I'm not sure what they were although I think there was shampoo and shower gel, soap of course (and shower cap). Hotel due Torri is located in the historic centre of Rome within easy walking distance of all the main tourist sites and plenty of restaurants. As soon as we arrived we were handed a very useful tourist map with the hotel's location marked and tourist sites pointed out by the Receptionist. We had done our homework before travelling, so were pretty confident of what we wanted to see and where to find it but you only had to ask the staff if you had any questions, they were always very helpful and obliging. On our first evening we asked at Reception if they could recommend a local restaurant and we were given the name and address of a small simple restaurant (Marco & Gloria) just minutes way. The food was excellent although we were a bit thrown by the staff's lack of English (but, hey, we were in Rome and didn't speak much Italian!) but we got by. Unfortunately, as we like to eat fairly early the dining room was deserted except for us, so it was a little lacking in atmosphere and a bit cold. However, having tried the usual tourist fayre on later evenings we would not hesitate to recommend it - it was the best meal we had and at very a reasonable price. There is no restaurant or bar at Hotel due Torri but, as mentioned, there are all types of restaurants, bars etc. nearby. The small breakfast room is very pleasant, and offers a basic breakfast - cereals, pastries, toast, preserves, boiled eggs, tea/coffee, juice (but not a \"cooked\" breakfast) and some fresh fruit. The lady in charge here is very helpful. I don't drink tea or coffee and asked on the first morning it they had peppermint tea. They had green tea, and a few other herbal varieties but not peppermint. However, it wasn't a problem - I went to the local Spa supermarket and bought some. But on day two, the breakfast lady (sorry, I don't know her name) had got some peppermint tea for me - brilliant! All in all, our stay at Hotel due Torri was extremely pleasant.

The bathroom was small but the shower was great - nice and hot, with good pressure. They have a nice set up where you can get internet on your TV - 5 euro for 24 hours.

The Due Torri is not a four or five star but it is very comfortable and friendly. Then regarding location, it's perfect because my wife and I love the Piazza Navona - Pantheon area and the greenery of the River Tiber walks and the Castel Sant'Angelo. The surrounding neighborhood of the hotel is a maze of narrow cobblestoned streets filled with shops, artesan workshops, and tiny trattorias where you can still find excellent Roman cusine. The Hotel Due Torri is in a building dating from the 16th century. Notwithstanding, it has very nice common areas and a nifty breakfast room. Our room was on the second floor (number 201) which could be easily reached by the elevator or the internal stairway. It was a fairly large room with a very comfortable bed, a dresser, chest, wardrobe and two chairs and a mini bar/safe with a 21 inch flat screen TV on top. The bathroom with tub/shower was also good-sized and relatively new. There was also a small entrance area with another built-in wardrobe. The air conditioning worked fine and could be controlled from the room. However we didn't use it hardly at all because even though it was very hot outside, the room was quite cool. We usually kept the window open (no mosquitos at night!) and were very comfortable. The only window was maybe the negative aspect of the room because it was very old and in dire need of replacement (here a modern double-glazed window would be nice). The view was to the building directly across the alley (about three meters or so) and the windows of that building. Another type of guest would not appreciate the noise from the TV of the apartment across the alley, or the metal shutters of the garage and shops opening in the morning and closing at night; voices of people occasionally passing through the alley, the garage dog that barked some times, etc. For us it was all okay because it's what one should expect living in that area. What would Rome be without a little noise? I noted that the rooms on the first floor had maybe been renovated recently. Plus I was told that the fifth floor rooms have balconies and views but are small in size. Okay, our room cost was 200 euros per night (due to go down to 150 in August I believe). This included a good and very adequate buffet breakfast. I parked our car in the garage (autorimessa) in front of the hotel. It cost me 40 euros a night but leaving a nice car out on the street is not a good idea. The hotel is dog friendly so we were able to keep our little dog in our room and there was no problem walking him in the neighboring streets or along the Tiber (with clean-up bags of course). I should mention that the streets are not super clean in that area! Some trip advisor members staying here have mentioned being afraid at night because of dark streets, but aside from an occasional harmless bum or homeless person or group of drunk tourists wandering around, the area seemed to be perfectly safe even late at night. The hotel owner and staff were all very nice and friendly. I would cite specifically the lady in the breakfast room and the gentleman at the front desk as being great!

The main attraction of this hotel is its central location within Old Rome. You can easily walk to most attractions such as the Vatican, Plaza Navona, and the Pantheon. The actual \"front door\" of the hotel did cause us some concern because it fronts on to a very narrow alley adjacent to a car repair shop. The alley is so narrow that our taxi could not drop us off (or pick us up) and we had to haul our luggage over the cobblestone street to the front door. The alley does, however, appear to be just the right size for the motorcycles and scooters that occasionally roar through in the middle of the night. The alley is dimly lit at night with few people walking about and the overall effect is quite foreboding. It is not a welcoming enviroment by any stretch of the imagination. We rented two rooms on the first floor which probably didn't help with the noise issues. The views from the rooms were nonexistent because of the 5-6 story buildings surrounding the hotel. We rented one queen bed room and one twin bed room and they were adequately sized for European hotels and generally comfortable. From our conversation with the other hotel guests, we may have been on the least favourable floor of the hotel. The upper floor rooms apparently were larger with better accomodations. The hotel website claims they have a upper level view terrace for use by their guests that is actually large enough for 4 people to stand and look around to the adjacent buildings. Most of the staff was pleasant but seemed to lack any knowledge of Rome outside of how to get to Vatican, Spanish Steps,etc. They had no idea where the currency exchange offices were located, when the banks were open, where the Metro subway stations were located, and were generally not interested in helping you find this type of information.

If we go back to Rome, I think we will take our chances at another hotel.", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cJust how small are the single rooms at the due torri?\u201d", "Author": "marcusandgriffin", "ReviewID": "UR5814231", "Content": "Think NYC galley kitchen, college dorm room (the bed is some sort of dorm type bed - not even a real single bed), monastic cell, east village apt.

There were 6 people in our group and we had 3 rooms, all on the 3rd floor. First of all, the hotel is in a fantastic location in the center of Rome. It really gives you a feel of an older Rome with narrow streets within walking distance of everything you need. We walked everywhere--from the Vatican to the Colosseum without problem. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Piazza Navona and the Pantheon with so many great restaurants and gelato. The hotel is on a very small street. We were picked up by Stefano Constantini (highly recommended for transportation in Rome) who found the hotel without any problem. The van was unable to turn onto the hotel's street, so we had a 75 yard walk to the entrance. We noticed very little traffic on the street during our stay. Any car or scooter that did drive through the street did cause some echoing noise, but the windows were effective in cutting down the noise to a low level. There is an elevator for all except the top floor. The rooms are small, but no different than most rooms in Italy. I would assume the rooms are similar on all floors (except the top floor which have balconies). We had rooms 302, 303, and 305. Rooms 302 and 303 are located right over the entrance to the hotel and are similar. These rooms had queen beds with a table at the foot of the bed and 2 bedside tables. There is a TV with CNN. Room 302 had a small closet. The bathroom is small, but functional. Ok water pressure. Room 305 was a little larger with an armoir and 2 sitting chairs. There is an automated wakeup call system that always worked. Breakfast was basic, but had fresh rolls and pastries, granola, cereals, yoghurt, hardboiled eggs, coffee, cheese, and jams. There was also fresh orange juice available. Overall, I would say it was above average compared to most places in Italy. The staff at the front desk spoke english, helped us call taxis and helped us locate stores we were interested in. There was no discount for paying cash verses credit card. Overall we enjoyed the experience as the hotel was clean, quiet, and had helpful staff. It is a good 2 star hotel with a fantastic location (thus its rather high price) that I would definitely go back to stay in the future.", "Date": "November 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cI'm ambivalent\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4093812", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel due Torri for 5 nights.

It's set back on such a small sidestreet that our Limoservicerome wagon could not get closer than the end of the street and we had to drag our luggage to the entrance. You'd think that would mean a quiet location, but motor scooters roar down the street as a get-through all day and night, and they are particularly loud in the morning when the scooter-repair shop next door opens for business. We were in rooms over the front door and it's possible rooms at the other end of the building would be quieter, but things do echo in those small, dark streets. The location from the point of view of proximity to things IS quite good, however, once you get your bearings and realize how easy it is to get just about anywhere.
