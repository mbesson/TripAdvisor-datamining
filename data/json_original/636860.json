No vacuming or cleaning.You get chinese hot breakfast and if you are lucky there is some toast and jelly.The location however is close to tiananmen square and the forbidden city and close to the subway.This would be the only reason to choose for this hotel.", "Date": "May 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR583152921", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jvdv"}, {"Content": "Cold City We arrived in Beijing looking forward to a cold wintery vacation. It turns out that not only the weather was cold so was the hotel staff and the hotel food. The only things that were hot that first morning were the beverages and our temper. Moreover, the wait staff had no intention of re-filling the food when the food at the buffet table runs out. And they promptly remove all the food at 9am even when there are still diners in the dining room. They did not even have the courtesy of asking the diners if they needed anything else before removing the food at the buffet table.Housekeeping was no better. We took three rooms stayed for four nights. Our rooms were never swept nor vaccuumed during the course of our stay. Needless to say, the bathroom floor was really messy by the fifth day. The only thing that was noticeably done by housekeeping was the bed being re-made and new towels were provided. The rooms in general are poorly lit including the bathroom. Some of the bulbs were even missing. The facelift being done on the building was not a bother unless you were in your hotel room between 8am to 5pm. Like most tourists, we were awake by that time and returned late in the evening. Their doors have no peepholes nor chain locks. So when someone knocks on the door or rings the bell, you have to open the door first to see who it is. But because there are no chain locks, it felt so unsafe every time to open the door when someone knocks. We had resorted to shouting to announce to family members to open the doors for us.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR561453432", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lalachoa"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d636860-r16168325-Rich_Hotel_Beijing-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "636860", "Price": "$95"}}
