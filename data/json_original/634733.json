{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great stay at Vista Kamata Vista is a three star hotel and nothing fancy but it is a quiet and clean place to stay with a courteous staff. It is within walking distance of the Kamata train station which gives you full access to the rest of Tokyo. The hotel front door literally opens into the Tokyu Plaza shopping center with lots of local shops and great restaurants. For the squeamish there is a MacDonald's, a 7/11, an AM/PM, a large supermarket, and a large plaza full of pastry shops. You cannot go wrong with this choice. We loved the stay.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR253600329", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Faymos"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066454-d634733-r11678669-Hotel_Vista_Kamata-Ota_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "634733", "Price": "$229"}}
