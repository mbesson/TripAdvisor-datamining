That sounds good to avoid cab fare to the hotel, but the shady characters hanging around at every hour are not worth your worries. Furthermore, the subway station in Termini is practically 3 blocks below surface and through an underground path, so you end up walking a lot before you get there. On the other hand it is very close to a lot of buses, but you will have to buy a bus route map as no info or tourist boreau has one available. Location: 6 out of 10. The room was tiny as a matchbox. Our two lugages barely fitted in. I was on my honeymoon so I asked for a queen bed, but I was given one of the smallest rooms in the second floor with two single beds stuck together!!! the bathroom was about 2 sq. mts, and the shower \"space\" could barely fit a skinny person. Everytime I moved I touched the faucet, not nice! The TV, al 12\u00a8 of it, was mounted 2 mts high, and it was one of those plasma that can only be seen standing right in front of it. So when you layed on the bed, you could only see a black screen. how stupid!! The TV was useless and you couldn\u00b4t see any of the 4 (yes, four) channels available.Room: 4 out of 10.

The temperatures of the shower knob where inverted so when I set the lever on the hot setting, cold water poured out and it took us some time to realise this \u2013 my wife was already worrying we did not have any hot water! The towels were really thin and got wet very quickly. Some sites say that the rooms of this hotel have a minibar ours did not have. The bed was not that comfortable and the pillows really thin. The bed headrest was covered with old upholstery rather than a wooden one as appears on the site\u2019s photos. At least our room was quiet as it overlooked a yard. Another drawback of this hotel is that it has the key system instead of a card for accessing the room so if the receptionist is busy with other customers expect to wait for the key. Finally the breakfast was very poor....!! The breakfast area is quite welcoming and even the main entrance however the room and the service was certainly not as expected.

And yes it was perfect for that. The Contilia was a very stylish, impressive hotel and gave us the impression of being a very new fitout to hotel of an older apartment building. The hotel is only 2 streets down on the left from the Termini front entrance. Look at McDonalds and take the Via to the left of that. Easy to find and pull luggage to even at night. Lots of hotels in the area and the street so safe too. Reception staff were extremely pleasant, helpful and spoke English. There is a modern elevator servicing floors to the 5th. The mechanics of the elevator take up the cavity of the cage to the 6th floor space, unavoidable. Great care and respect of the original building has been taken in the conversion to an hotel, which we appreciated. We had Room 602 so took the elevator to the 5th floor and carried our suitcases up the stairs to our room. No problem. It was worth the effort. Room 602 accesses the terrazza running the width of the hotel frontage. I had requested a room with a balcony or Terrazza if possible, and was delighted with 602. We later enjoyed the pleasant Rome evening and rooftop views outside very happily by ourselves. Bliss. The bedroom was large with an attractive modern fitout as was the tiled bathroom, which had a jet bath and wall hairdryer. We had air conditioning, a mini frig, free Wifi and the bed was large and extremely comfortable. Cleanliness of our room and whole hotel impeccable. Everything looked brand new. The breakfast room was very large, beautifully decorated, again sparkling and the layout and food available was excellent. Staff were very efficient. We had Dinner in a restaurant one street up parallel to hotel, and full of locals which made my husband think he had found heaven when they had his favourite pasta Tortellini Alla Crema on menu. Serving was vat sized (a giveaway as Italian servings small) and the tortellini pasta had not been cooked long enough, it tasted raw. Cheap anyway but this area is full of eating places so suggest ask hotel staff for recommendations. From many visits to Rome we hadn't considered that area, Termini, as a salubrious place for a longer visit for tourism purposes. The Contilia has changed our minds. It will become very popular I suspect. The Contilia was a wonderful hotel, in a great spot and excellent value for money. It would be possible to use The Contilia as a hub if planning to travel by train to locations close to but outside Rome and the Metro at the Termini is advantageous for Rome.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queen Creek, Arizona, United States", "Title": "\u201cGood and bad accommodations.\u201d", "Author": "Sallie F", "ReviewID": "UR120134549", "Content": "Our first night was in a quaint room.

The WiFi was completely ineffective, the bed was very uncomfortable, the AC stopped working randomly, area was VERY noisy, warm water ceases after 8am, internet costs 2 euro per device, rates were raised on us upon checkout by 20 euro without warning, clerk told us 60 euro for cab to the airport but when we hailed one they said 40 was fine, and breakfast requires a drill bit to open the rolls. The good parts include location which was close to Termini, commercial businesses close by, decent service, and security by keycard access. This hotel would be fine for the boys out on the town but not so much for couples and the more seasoned citizens. The Termini area is a little shady but nothing to get paranoid about. Women may get some verbal jabs but nothing physical.

However we felt the hotel was great value (let's face it, it's not the most expensive hotel and it is in Rome, so why are people expecting five star luxury!) We were greeted with very helpful reception staff, who were happy to help throughout our stay. I think the hotel may have been refurbished since some of the reviews, so don't base your decision from a bad review over a year ago. It is well decorated, very clean and had everything we needed for a four night stay. The breakfasts were a typical European breakfast, nothing spectacular but good coffee and some nice pastries. The room was a reasonable size, but was clean and comfortable and the bathroom seemed brand new, again being above my expectations. In particular the air conditioning in the room was very good (and quiet!) which was essential as it was a very hot week! I would completely disagree with some of the reviews who say the location is not great. You are a very short walk away from Termini to get buses or the metro. We also walked down to the Colosseum on the evenings which took us 20 minutes and around the same to the Trevi area (baring in mind we are in our twenties and quick walkers!) The road itself is not the most attractive but at no stage did we feel unsafe.

I think it is because the other men and women working reception are so friendly that Mr. Grumpy stands out. He really isn't grumpy, just busy. I love this hotel and am going back soon! It is so close to the Termini and everything else! The rooms are cozy and small just like they are going to be everywhere in Europe. You have to go outside the bathroom to change your mind, as my Mother would say, because the bathrooms are small, but that is to be expected! Embrace it and you'll love it! The free morning breakfast had cappacino and americano coffee, juice, bread rolls which I am now craving, turkey meat, cheese and cereals. We took the train from the airport to the Termini and it was very easy. The street outside the hotel is very busy during the day and it was safe. There is a little shopping center to buy water, food or incidentals by the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore (you must visit this Basiclica to see where Bernini is buried). Day trip tours leave from this Basiclica's square and it is an easy walk to and from the hotel. We went to Napoli and Pompeii on a day trip and it was absolutely amazing! It was kind of creepy at 6:45 am walking to the meeting place for the day trip because the streets literally close up and nothing is open and there is no place to get coffee that early, unless you go to the Termini. The internet was free and worked well in our second floor room. They also had a DVD player on the television in the room, a safe and a small refrigerator!

We thought that we had booked a bed and breakfast called Budget B & B with a little kitchen that we could use but when we arrived the staff told us that the B&B was now part of the Hotel Contilia. I have to admit I was a little disappointed not to have the kitchen facility as I hadn't even taken a travel kettle, plus it meant we had no fridge. Having said that, the Hotel Contilia was very nice. The staff were very friendly and pleasant, the hotel was what I would describe as typical old italian - ie marble floors, tired worn looking curtains and fabrics, but all in keeping with the property. Small rooms with high ceilings, reasonable bathroom although no shelf to stand shampoo etc and our air conditioning worked fine. My son and I were travelling with his friend and his mum (long weekend break for their 16th birthdays and to celebrate end of GCSE exams), and it would have been nice if we could have been on the same floor instead of us in 402 and them in 115 - having to text to meet for breakfast etc instead of a short trip down the hall. The location was fine so long as you stayed on this side of Termini railway station - the other side was as you'd expect near a station! There were plenty of restaurants, bars, cafes etc nearby, plus a small supermarket between the hotel and the station and a larger one up near Maggiore which was very well stocked. Having said that the continental style breakfast was actually quite nice. Tea, coffee, juice (packet flavour), cereals, fruit, yoghurt, bread, cheese, meats and lovely pastries. We mostly used the open top bus to get around (a couple of minutes walk to Maggiore stop), excellent value as we got a family ticket (2 adults plus our 2 15 year olds) which gave us 2 days unlimited travel for 45 Euros total. The two routes covered the whole of the area we wanted to visit so saved a lot of achy feet and calves. Most major sights were reduced rate or even free for the boys (under 18). Only downside was that the buses stopped around 7 or 8pm depending on the route you were on so we did use the metro at night to go and see Colosseum, St Peter's, and Trevi Fountain lit up. The metro was ok, wouldn't want to be traveling alone down there but I would say that about metro anywhere in the world. All in all a good hotel, in a good location. Not luxury but then we only paid 480 Euros for 3 nights (total for 4 people) so 40 Euros each per night.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Healdsburg, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat breakfast, helpful staff, clean room, close to Termini\u201d", "Author": "annkr", "ReviewID": "UR33032241", "Content": "Arriving by bus from Ciampino, we just needed one night before our regular hotel reservation started.

I later realised that I found that kind of smell in many places in Rome, even in luxurious shops. However it was very clean, just ask for a room with a view on the central road.

The breakfast was good too, but I didn't like the coffee (you get it out of a machine and I prefer the classic cappuccino).It's within a walking dinstance from the train station and the tube.

I intend to go back to Rome in June, because I stayed there only for one night and it's not enough. I will certainly book at the same hotel, as the price is really good comparing to what the hotel offers. BEAR IN MIND: Don't eat at any reastaurant near the Vatican! They offer full meals with only 10 euros but you end up hungry, as they are just awful! There are many restaurants near the train station and the hotel, where you pay about 15 euros per person and you eat local Italian dishes!

We kindly said we don't feel safe here and the rooms are in a pretty bad condition, the manager and the staff argued very aggressively saying it is impossible for us to check out early, kept saying they have a 48 hour cancellation policy. They did not understand the difference between cancelling a reservation and checking out early due to customer dissatisfaction. I insisted on not paying for the second day as I had no intention of staying here and the manager called the police. Then he started yelling at us and told us to evacuate our room in 10 minutes or he will throw away our stuff on the street. At this point, he is calling the police to make us pay for the second day AND he is throwing our stuff on the street, notice this guy's logic. He even showed us the finger (with his arm, Italian way). It was so ridicilous that the term unprofessional does not even begin to describe the staff at this hotel. We waited for the police for a while, they didn't show up. In the meantime, the manager was making calls to the station from his cell phone. Most probably the police could not have done anything anyway since they had no check out policy stated anywhere - but we offered half price for the second day so that we can go on our way and not waste the entire day waiting for the police.

If this is your first time in Rome then this neighborhood is ideal because it is only a few blocks from the Termini Station. Rome only has 2 metro lines and they intersect at Termini so you can head off in 4 directions from this point. Termini is also the main hub for the bus routes with a large interchange lot in front of the station. Once you learn the buses you will use them as much as the metro. Beware of pickpockets especially on Bus 64. I must plug a restuarant. If you have a sense of adventure hop on the #170 Bus and take it almost to the end of the line. You will be going to the far side of the Testaccio neighborhood and almost to the river.The restuarant is Il Pizzettiere 2 @Via Rubattion, 22 (06.57289587). They only have pizza and pasta dishes - no secondi. A family run place, great food and cheap prices. A great and rare combo in Rome.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, quebec", "Title": "\u201cOK - Good location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5294706", "Content": "Couple in their 40's.

We had streetside rooms and found it quite interesting to have a view of 'real life' in Rome. The staff was quite nice and always helpful,which is always a plus in any hotel.

There's also a closet and desk/desk chair. A small TV gets a few channels, including CNN. There was a mini-fridge in a compartment of the desk. The bathroom was also small, and very clean. The shower stall was tiny. The window looked down into a very grim courtyard. Very firm bed, flat pillows, thin linen towels. The biggest negative was the overwhelming sewer gas smell coming from the bathroom. We had to keep the bathroom door closed and the room window open. Breakfast was decent - ham and cheese, rolls and various croissants, cereals, coffee, and some sort of odd juice-like drinks. The neighborhood is a pretty dingy, but there are a lot of tourists around since there are many hotels in the area. It is a bit of a hike to most sights. It's easy to get here from the airport using the express train.

My family (2 parents, my sister and I... both in early 20s and young professionals) went on our first family trip in years over Thanksgiving 2005 and decided to book online at Hotel Contilia. At first I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews written on this site about the surrounding areas (proximity to Termini) and also the size of the rooms. Upon arrival at the airport, we were told to take a train to the Termini and it worked out very well because of the proximity of the hotel to the station. We saved a ton on cab fare! The staff was extremely accomodating and gave us 2 rooms on the same floor even though our travel agents had made a small error with the booking (they booked a \"twin\" room for my parents but they wanted a larger bed to share). The staff is English speaking and very courteous. The rooms were not impressive at first glance (yes, very small but comfortable) but upon further inspection, they were extremely clean which is what we were most afraid of. The shower was tiny but the bathroom was very sanitary ... the beds were comfy although the pillows were a bit flat. My only real complaint is the bathtowels which were basically more like table cloths than anything else. I would suggest stuffing a fluffy towel into your suitcase and then the hotel is pretty much an amazing deal! There is also CNN International so you can keep up with current events in English. The hotel is located within walking distance of all the major attractions. We did not take a taxi even once in Rome... although being from a big city we might have a higher tolerance for walking than most others. The only attractions you would need a taxi to are those close to Vatican City. (We took a private tour there which picked us up at the hotel, took us to the vatican, then dropped us back off at the hotel for 37 Euro a person) We walked from Hotel Contilia to the Colesseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, Spanish Steps, Trevini Fountain, Piazza Navona, shopping district without any trouble. We did not find the area around the Termini to be threatening at all. We do not speak any Italian and found the people around that area friendly. We were warned of pickpockets and gypsy theives before leaving for Rome but did not encounter any of this, especially not near the Termini. I hope you all choose this hotel for its value. Although it's not a high end luxury hotel, it is great for the traveler who wants to spend more time and money seeing the city than in the hotel.", "Date": "December 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin ireland", "Title": "\u201cNEAR TO TERMINI\u201d", "Author": "silky2", "ReviewID": "UR4121281", "Content": "This hotel is well located for those wanting to use the Italian train system, or the Metro and bus stations, it's a five minutes walk.

We found the location excellent with many good restaurants in the area and close to the termini for both train and Metro travel. The staff was very helpful and did all they could to make our visit pleasant. Rooms are spotlesly clean, newly painted and immaculate bathrooms. They are small as are most in europe. We loved the firm beds! Our airconditioning worked well and the hot/cold water was never a problem. The hotel is currently being removated and should be complete in September. All work was done during the day and we were never bothered by noise from the construction nor the city/train/etc. Breakfast was adequate as described by other travelers. Michele can answer your emails and he speaks English well enough to be helpful. The only PROBLEM we had was getting to the hotel as the directions were rather vague -translated into English. We all wandered around for 45 min. or so before locating the Contillia. So here's our advice: If you arrive on the train from the airport, DO NOT follow the exit (Ochita) signs down the stairs. Instead follow the Metro signs to the front of the station. You'll know when you get there, by all the shops. Exit the station to your left. You should be on Via Giovanni Gioletti. Walk straight ahead until come to Via Principe Amedeo. Make a left and the hotel will be ahead on your right. Easy and will take less than 5 min.
