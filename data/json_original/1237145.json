Checked in at 10pm and found three reception staff on duty. All of them spoke excellent English and provided a smiling witty and charming welcome to our party. Check in was quickly accomplished and on the advice of the staff we accepted the special rate for pre booking our breakfast which saved us approximately 25% off the standard price of 19 euros. Breakfast was the standard buffet fare of sausage, bacon eggs, toast, croissants, cold cuts, cheese, cereal etc. It was delicious but even at the reduced price of 14 euro i thought it was expensive,especially if you simply prefer cereal, tea and toast. Given the standard of the hotel which was excellent i suppose you could say the very competitive room rate compensated for the breakfast rates. The hotel is very modern in style and spotlessly maintained throughout including the fitness suite and sauna on the top floor. The stylish bar area was comfortable and served until 1am with plenty of waiting and bar staff who were very attentive and made sure no one had to wait for service. In fact if i had to choose which aspect of the hotel impressed most it would be the staff. There were lots of them, they all spoke English, they were invariably polite, friendly and genuinely seemed to enjoy interacting with and providing a superb service for the guests. e.g. I asked at reception for an iron and board, went straight to my room and as i reached my room and opened my door the items arrived and were set up for me. Fantastic service. The staff at the Concierge desk were superb, very friendly and really helpful in advising us what to see, how to get around, how to get best value from the transport passes they provided. Finally , the location of the hotel, Less than 15min walk from Alexander platz or just a few minutes in a tram. You can get a tram, S train or U train to anywhere in Berlin from here. In the railway arches under the S train station here there are some excellent restaurants serving great food at great prices. I think you will struggle to get better value than this hotel.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cSuperb room at very little cost\u201d", "Author": "jetsetmark", "ReviewID": "UR128513457", "Content": "We went for the upgrade to a superior room even though the regular rooms looked pretty good in the photo.

I will post reviews of each hotel separately. This one is about Leonardo Royal. Leonardo Royal is located near the Friedrichainspark. Although they bill themselves as Alexanderplatz hotel, it will be more appropriate to call it a hotel not far from Alexanderplatz (I would say about 700 meters from the western part of the Platz). It is a converted office building and you do feel it inside, especially in the corridors. There is a nice stylish restaurant on the ground floor. We did not try it for dinner but did have breakfast there. It is 9.60 euro if you prepay your stay and 12 euro if you pay at check in. The breakfast was awesome; we would rate is higher than at Hilton on Gendarmenmarkt where we stayed later and where it was exactly 3 times more expensive. We did not use the exercise room (only cardio) or sauna. But the view from it was great \u2013 you can see the TV tower or a nearby church. We loved it; we love to walk or bike, so a bit remote location of the hotel was fine. But if you have problems walking, then it might not be for you. Aside from a steakhouse and a restaurant on premises, there is nothing else nearby. But again, just a short walk north, to Prenzlauer Berg and you will have a lot to choose from.

I will list below all the positive and negative points in my opinion: - Price is one of its main advantages. Very competitive for a 4* hotel. - The hotel is conveniently located, 15 minutes walking from AlexanderPlatz (or just 5 minutes by tram). - The area is beautiful. The hotel itself is located in a wide avenue with a lot of traffic in the East part of the city, but there is a beautiful huge park nearby and Prenzlauer Berg district is also very close (there are loads of caf\u00e9s and restaurants there). - Our room was comfortable, a bit small, but it had all the required comforts. The only thing I disliked was the bed, which in my opinion was too soft. The bathroom and shower were fine aswell. One detail I disliked, though, was that some toiletries such like toothpaste, toothbrushes, razors, paper tissues... were not directly left at the bathroom for us to use them, but we had to ask for them at reception or to the room-service staff (great idea, what what happens if there are only two people working at the room-service per plant in a hotel with so many rooms and when there is a long queue at the reception desk at all times? It happens that I had to go to the supermarket to buy all toiletries to safe me a long queue. -Cleanness. This is the main negative point. On the first day I found rests of hair and nails in the bathroom floor and drawers. I communicated it to the reception personal, but though they assured they would take care of it, the hairs made us company through all our stay (8 nights!). They also forgot to wash the tea mugs most of the days. This is a shame for a 4* hotel and a real pity, for all the rest was fine. - Extras. Wi-Fi access was extremely expensive (15\u20ac per day), thought the hotel has a business center equipped with some computers and a printer, so it is possible to access to the Internet for free.

The M4 tram stops just up the street and runs quite frequently, so it is easy to get from the hotel to most parts of the city via the fantastically efficient (albeit, on first acquaintance, rather complex) public transit system of this great city. You can purchase tickets for the tram (which will also work on U Bahn and the S Bahn trains as well as the buses) at the concierge desk: at 6.30 euro, the day pass is a no brainer (longer options are also available along with combination tickets that include museums). There's also quite a bit of material available there and in the room to help you find your way around. The hotel is also about a twenty minute walk to the heart of the leafy and trendy Prenzlauer Berg district, with its restaurants and bars. There are also trams and buses that run out that way. After going through Alexanderplatz the M4 tram continues on to Hackesche Markt with its restaurants, shops, and great old buildings (including the elegant old courtyards in the Hackesche Hof, which is worth entering, even you're not interested in the shops). The hotel itself is clean, modern, and well-equipped: it has a restaurant, gym facilities, a bar, and what appeared to be reasonably priced bike rentals (I didn't do competitive pricing). The neighborhood itself features a fine bakery/coffee shop up the street (Melis Cafe and Bakery) as well as an excellent \"Orientalische & Mediterrane\" (i. e. cosmopolitan Turkish) restaurant called Merhaba just a block further up the street in the direction away from Alexanderplatz (Otto Braun Strasse changes its name to Greifswalderstrasse at the intersection where Melis Coffee is located). There's a large park (the Volkspark Freidrichshain) just up the street in the same direction, which dates from the 1840s and features a fountain built around 1900 with various fairy tale animals \u2014the day I passed through it was filled with families. As a clean, modern, reasonably priced hotel with quick access to all that Berlin has to offer (most tourists will want to stay in the old \"East Berlin\" rather than the West, since the heart of the city has moved back there since the reunification) the Leonardo is an excellent choice. The staff was consistently helpful during our time in Berlin. They were able to check us into our room at around 9:30 AM on the day of our arrival, which allowed us to leave our bags in the room, change our clothes, and begin our assault on Berlin. They were also enormously helpful during a rough patch when my wife was injured in an accident and had to be hospitalized for a few days. They extended our booking at the discounted rate we'd originally gotten and helped me to work out the logistics of getting back and forth to the hospital, which was located on the far south western edge of the city. Berlin is a fascinating place to visit and almost any halfway decent hotel will probably suffice (after all, you're there for the city, not for the room).

It was stiflingly hot in our room, even with the AC on the coldest setting. The room was cramped and the tv faced the front door, not the bed! (But there was nothing but German tv without subtitles available anyway, unfortunately). We slept poorly - the bed head tilted down and made my husband dizzy, while I had night sweats from the heat. (Opening the windows was too much noise from the busy main road outside). We told the woman at the desk about the AC and she looked at us blankly, asking several times if we'd made sure we'd turned it on properly. She finally agreed to send a mechanic to the room that day. We returned to the room later to find that not much seemed changed, but we were willing to give the room another night. (We passed the same receptionist later that night, but she neglected to ask us if it was improved, nor did she greet us at all). Another blazingly hot night resulted in my staggering exhaustedly down to the desk at 5am and requesting a new room. We were given a new, comfortabe and normal room with AC that was much improved and we were much happier. I must say that the room was exactly like the photos and was very nice.

We liked to most Prenzlauer Berg, Mitte and Kreuzberg (lots of second hand and other cool shops, bars, cafes and restaurants). The only con was that there wasn't so much to see right there where to hotel was located. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel because it was so expensive: 14 \u20ac / person if you order it in advance, otherwise 19 \u20ac. I'm sure the breakfast would have been excellent but we were happy to eat in different place every day, since there was lots and lots of great breakfast & brunch places in Berlin. And much cheaper. I used the gym in the top floor couple times and it was ok for me. I got to excercise all by myself which was great. We tried the sauna once but it was so small and crowded that we didn't go twice.

It was spotless and very quiet, overlooking an inner courtyard. Church bells nearby stopped at 21.00 and started again at 08.00 so not a disturbance. Really good firm mattress. 32\" flat screen TV with sofa was very welcome after a long day on our feet. Room was very warm so we turned off the heating and left the all the windows open while we were out. Bathroom opened directly onto the room, which means it didn't have a door. However, for those unused to sharing EVERYthing, the loo was separate and did have a door! There was also a bath with a shower head the size of a dust-bin lid! I was surprised to see that the shower gel and shampoo were generic products, nothing special. The room also had a little office area with a desk and chair. All the usual accessories were in the room; the ironing board, the safe, sewing kit, shoe shine. We didn't read the information pack immediately and so bought blades and shaving cream in the supermarket . Perhaps they should be provided in the room instead of held in reception. The mini-bar was off limits. What is it with water in Berlin? The minibar water was 6.5 euro for a bottle and we were charged 5.80 in a restaurant outside. We stuck to tap water at meals and bought it in the supermarket otherwise. What can I say about the breakfast? Fantastic!! Fresh fruit, all the cereals, seeds, juices, yoghurts, eggs anyway you like, bacon, sausages, ham, cheeses, breads, pastries, coffee and a selection of teas all served until 10.30. Dinner is served in the evening. It is not inexpensive, best described as fine dining, the staff are very attentive and the food is excellent and well presented. There is also a bar and lounge and 3 computers and a printer. We weren\u2019t interested in room wi-fi. Didn\u2019t have time to check out the leisure centre. Check in is 15.00 but there is a little room off reception where you may leave your luggage if you come in on an early morning flight. Check in is swift and painless. The concierge was fantastic. She had loads of tips and information, spoke 5 languages and clearly loved her job. Museum and travel passes are on sale here and even postcards. Location wise Alexanderplatz is a 10 min walk straight down the road. The museum island is another 10 minute walk beyond it. The tram stops 50 mt from the hotel door, end of the line is 200 mt from museum island. From the hotel Unter den Linden is the far side of Alexanderplatz., Kadewa and the Sony Centre are a 6 -8 stops on the underground. With its proximity to the A/platz hub the hotel could not be described as out of the way although it is a quiet area.

The positive ones were not wrong! This is a fantastic hotel. It is new, trendy, spotlessly clean, with amazingly comfortable beds, modern bathroom (shower only). There was a kettle in the room with tea & coffee provided, a hairdryer, 30\" flat-screen TV and even an iron & ironing board in the wardrobe! PLUS for social lepers like ourselves, smoking rooms are available (big bonus!) The staff were wonderful-polite, cheery and very helpful. Breakfasts were superb. Hot buffet consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages & some little beef-burgers. There was a wide variety of fresh fruits, yoghurts, cereals, breads & rolls, fruit juices, jams, honey, marmalade, tea & coffee, hot chocolate, fruit & herbal teas, latte, cappuccino & espresso coffees. The ONLY slight drawback is the location. The hotel is in the east side of the city, around 10-15 minutes walk from Alexanderplatz. There are very few bars and restaurants near the hotel, BUT there is a fabulous little Argentinian (!) bar/bistro called \"Las Malvanas\" just around the corner. Turn left out of the hotel, take the first street on the left, and it is about 20-30 yards on your left. The food is very good & cheap-about 3 or 4 Euros for a large pizza or plate of pasta. I know there is a saying \"you can't please everyone\" but I really don't understand what some people expect from a hotel. In my opinion, any criticism about this hotel is unfair & unjustified!

As it happens, it's location is not an issue and in fact has its benefits. The hotel is located about 5-10 minutes to touristy Alexander Platz. However, the real benefit of its location is its proximity to the leafy suburbs of Prenzlouer Berg and the edge of Friedrichshain, which have a great collection of restaurants with some great food seemingly only discovered by the locales. Two recommendations: il Pane e le rose (Italian - try the ravioli) on Am Friedrichshain and Aznavourian (French) on the corner of Rykestrasse and Knaackstrasse both of which are about 15 mins walk from the hotel. The efficient metro and trams makes it easy to access any of Berin's sights but it's just as easy to walk to better discover the city. The hotel itself and its rooms are all reasonably new and modern. We took three rooms for our stay including one junior suite to give us more space with a toddler and pram. The junior suite was not much more expensive than the other rooms and the added space was great for all of us to sit around in the evenings. So worth it if you are travelling in a small group! The junior suite came with a stocked Nespresso coffee maker too, which was good. The other rooms could have been slightly larger but it was enough to take away from the rooms too much. The hotel also has a sauna & steam room beside the rooftop gym.

All in all it was ok, but considering the price we paid, we somehow expected more from the hotel. By the way: For those complaining about the high prices for breakfast: We found a nice caf\u00e9 just around the corner, where you get breakfast for some 5 \u20ac and free wireless internet (Melis Coffee, Corner Am Friedrichshain/Greifswalder Str.). You may want to check this one out.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville,KY", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "travelinmaven", "ReviewID": "UR63997507", "Content": "A wonderful hotel at a great price.

It is too small for 2 persons to share if staying more than one night. There is only one chair in the room!!! b) The location. It is at least 10 minutes walk from the nearest metro underground station which is located at Alexanderplatz. This is longer than you think when it is raining and especially when you arrive in the middle of a large square and do not know where the hotel is. Other points: 1. In the bathroom the washbasin is very modern and of unusual design but it leaves very little room to place your toiletries nearby if two of you are sharing. 2. Although there are tea and coffee making facilities in the room, they provide 1 sachet of coffee and one teabag of normal tea for a two person room!! 3. You have to telephone the reception for a code before you use the internet. Be careful they will give you the code for the premium internet service which is 17.80euro per day rather than the standard 11.80euro/day. The standard rate is more than adequate for most purposes. 4. The book describing the hotel services in the room says they serve breakfast in the room and you need to fill in the forms and hang them on the door. There were no such forms in our room and it would have been a challenge I would have liked to see. How do you serve breakfast for 2 persons in a room with one chair!! 5. On checking out, without asking, they charge your credit card in your own currency (in our case UK pounds) rather than euro. The result is that you pay 2 exchange rates. You only make this mistake once. You should always ask the credit card charge to be made in the local currency of the hotel or shop. Would I stay here again? If I was on my own with my own car, probably I would stay again. If I had to rely on public transport or was sharing the room, I would try and find another hotel nearer the town centre.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel for value, not great location and atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "ErikHof", "ReviewID": "UR61994950", "Content": "Good hotel for the price.
