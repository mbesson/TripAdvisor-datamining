My husband and I have been traveling for 11 months around the world and this is hands down the grossest place we have stayed. I cannot believe we are paying $170+ a night for a 1-star hotel (by US standards). Our room is on the fifth floor and it smells like mildew and sewer, the paint and wallpaper are peeling, the bathroom has scary black grout and broken tiles, and one of the pillows on the bed does not have a pillow case (after 5 nights!) and it is massively stained. The curtains have splattered blood, like a crime scene and the carpet is so dirty you cannot walk in bare feet. The TV is 12-inches and was made in 1990. Above this relic the ceiling is black with soot from some kind of electrical fire - are we going to die here? When I tried to put my diet coke in the mini fridge, the door to the fridge fell off and it took me 10 minutes to get it back on. The maid gave us dirty towels every day. The bed is so dirty we're worried about getting crabs. I've been told many times that Paris hotels are rougher than expected, but this is horrible - and it really makes you feel that Paris is a rip-off. The good parts?? The location is right near the Montparnasse/Bienvenue train station (exit #6 is Rue D'Odessa and the hotel is straight ahead) and there is free wireless internet in the lobby and in the rooms (with good signal). The neighborhood is not chic, but it's not bad either. There are a lot of cafes, bakeries and a nice supermarket within a 5 minute walk. Our room has the world's smallest balcony, which is good for letting out the sewer smell, but it is very noisy (lots of sirens!!!) on the street so you have to sleep with the window closed. I would strongly discourage anyone from staying here during the summer. The cheapest meal in Paris is located on the same block as the hotel: a lebanese restaurant where you can get a pita wrap, drink and backlava for 6 euros.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Masterton, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "LJTNZ", "ReviewID": "UR21197912", "Content": "This was our first trip to Paris...I searched for a long time to find something that wasn't completely over the top with their prices...the weekend we went to Paris most hotels were booked - i realised you really need to book in advance! This place was good value for money. The room was good, not very big but then no rooms in Paris are! Double bed was fine, bathroom was fine, power shower. We didn't have the breakfast so I can't comment on this. I guess the main point I wanted to make was that the location was good. Right across the road from a main tube stop which is on a couple of lines. Bicycles right outside too (highly recommend these!) - you just put your card details in, and so long as you return the bike (and you can do this at ANY bike stop anywhere in the city) it won't take money from your card. I think you need to return the bike by the end of that day. It's a fantastic way to see the city. In terms of location, you can walk to the Eiffel Tower in about 15-20 mins, lovely walk too. So it's really easy to get around Paris, much easier than I thought it would be. They had free internet downstairs (only the one computer but you can pretty much always get on it, and hey, it's free!) - People at the front desk were good - spoke English which was helpful as our french wasn't great! You are never in your hotel for long when you're in Paris, especially, if you are a first time visitor, you are out looking at what this incredible city has to offer. So if you need a cheap hotel in a good location, this is fine for that. If you are looking for a romantic get away in Paris, best to spend the money and go 5 star!", "Date": "October 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cOK ish\u201d", "Author": "TheIrishRovers", "ReviewID": "UR10186812", "Content": "good location for metro, and good variety of bars and restaurants on the square here, rooms slightly hostel'ish, though ours was on top floor and huge, bathroom good size and functional though decoration well out of date, an OK experience, though not a hotel you will remember over fondly, 2*", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portugal", "Title": "\u201cI liked staying at Berkley\u201d", "Author": "MiguelCR", "ReviewID": "UR6557211", "Content": "Like everyone said, the rooms are indeed small.

Lots of restaurants, and amusements near the hotel. The Montparnasse Tower, that is the tallest tower in Paris, and which has a magnificent view over the city, is really next to the hotel. Bathroom was very clean, and everyday the room was cleaned up. Bad things: Like I said, small rooms, but probably nothing you can do about it. And don't except that they speak english properly...

I moved to another hotel later in the week that was in the latin quarter and I actually preferred this hotel location in Monparnasse much better than the Latin Quarter.
