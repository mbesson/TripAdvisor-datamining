She was even worse as did not want to call the police and tried to say they were not guilty, as the door hadnt been forced. the truth is that probably somebody from the staff wasinvolved. We left the hotel (without getting any refund of money) and went to the Plice, that confirmed that homeless people is taken at the Igar.

Also my friend stayed there and when she woke up in the morning she was covered in at least 70 bites all over her body which she can only assume to be either bed bug bites or flea bites.
