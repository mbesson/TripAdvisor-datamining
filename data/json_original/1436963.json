No complaints about the location or the hotel itself. The only thing that bothered me was their breakfast policy. A hotel that claims to be a transit hotel should recognize that people have flights that leave early in the morning. Breakfast starts at 7 am, which for a lot of travellers is too late. They do provide a few snacks (pastries in cellophane wrappers) and tea and coffee, but when I asked if I could have some milk for the kids or some juice, they refused, saying that the waiter doesn't start till 7. Is it that difficult to have a pitcher of juice and milk out for people to have?

The location very close to Barajas Airport and free 24-hour transfer from and to the airport (reserve in advance!) together with very reasonable price makes this hotel convenient for the above mentioned categories of travellers. I really liked its comfort and design, and it\u2019s good value for money. Breakfast is optional and for 6 EUR is quite OK. There\u2019s also a bar and a restaurant at the hotel, as well as computers with printers at your disposal (at a charge). The facilities include efficient a/c, a fridge, a safe with a digital lock. The bed is comfortable, the curtains are thick (you can make it really dark in the room if you want to sleep at the daytime!), there\u2019s a good choice of toiletries. The windows are soundproof, the door is not, but if you don\u2019t have too noisy neighbours it\u2019s not a problem. The metro station (Barajas) is about 7 minutes on foot, the district is very quiet and safe, the metro is also safe so don\u2019t worry about coming back late. Remember that the way to the centre of Madrid takes about 35 minutes by metro (with 2 changes), about 50 minutes to Atocha (railway station) \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem too long, but for a comfortable exploration of the city and neighbouring towns this hotel is not the best option.

Room was very clean with air conditioning (easy to use!) ,mordern earthy colours and wooden floors. Bathroom had large walk-in shower, wc/bidet and there was plenty of towels.

I was looking for the main corridoor light switch for about 30 seconds when I exited the lift but then assumed that it was supposed to be like that. - The restaurant didn't open until 8.30pm and on the evening that we did venture down at about 8.45pm it was still in darkness and we were told that only bar meals were available. We ended up having to go out when all we wanted to do was really just chill after a hard dark. Overall, I would have rated the hotel as 4 instead of 3 had it not been for above gripes.
