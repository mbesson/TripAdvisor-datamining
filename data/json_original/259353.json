{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wonderful location Found this hotel on the internet.What we wanted was a quality beachside hotel with a feeling of exclusivity and we got just that.Interestingly, the postal district is Lloret De Mar but dont be put off. Lloret is not our cup of tea - too noisy, too busy, too English.The hotel Santa Marta is actually in acres of its own bay/grounds beween the resorts of LLoret and Blanes and what a truly wonderful location it is.The hotel is built on a steep wooded hillside (there is a free hotel buggy to take you up and down) overlooking the Santa Christina Bay.Public rooms and bedrooms were excellent with views to die for.The only criticism was food.The snack bar/beach restaurant on the beach was too basic, whilst the main hotel restaurant was too grand/expensive. Some middle ground would be appreciated.All in all through a wonderful find. (just dont tell too many people !!)", "Date": "Oct 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR941620890", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "pastyfaceCornwall"}, {"Content": "Comprehensive Review I found this Hotel by accident, it is situated between Blanes  Lloret De Mar, I would suggest that you need your own transport if you were staying here. Tucked away in a pine forest on a hill overlooking the Med with direct access to the 400 or so metre St Christina beach cut off at either end by rocky cliffs the only word to described it is WOW. All staff extremely helpful  polite, the rooms are tastefully decorated  well serviced, I think most rooms have a balcony overlooking the forest, beach  sea. Plenty of free parking for guests, free internet access, outdoor - pool, well manicured lawn, two tennis courts(with tennis instructor), jacuzzi, bar, dining area, toilets  sauna. Indoor - dining room, breakfast room, large lounge, function room for meetings, balcony area with glass barrier overlooking the forest, beach  sea. Room prices for me were direct as I had literally just walked in, they were (in euros) Twin 114, Double 230 ish, Suite 268 - I stayed in a Suite which had an entrance hall, bathroom, twin bedroom with balcony  a large double room with balcony, both rooms had flat screen tv's. The balcony had four chairs  a round patio type table. I have absolutley no criticism of this hotel !", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR735352514", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MrReview"}, {"Content": "Best beach ever My girlfriend and I just stayed here last week.This is a fabulous hotel with a stunning beach.If you don't want to pay the exhorbitant restaurant costs, there are two more on the beach with great prices.The beach is epic and the water was warm. I would stay here again if the dollar was stronger.Blanes is a great city to do your shopping at.", "Date": "Sep 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR712601580", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SanFranciscoDude"}, {"Content": "Bel endroit, h\u4e48tel un peu vieillot   showReview(19780146, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR176780338", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MOG83"}, {"Content": "servicio deficiente   showReview(18472377, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR886274679", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "viajero099"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d259353-r20877748-Santa_Marta_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "259353", "Price": "$262"}}
