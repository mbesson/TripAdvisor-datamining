All fine attributes of a great hotel. However, the room itself was very small (which was fine), but the bed was very small (I wouldn't recommend booking a single), the mattress was a little suspect, and it looked like they type of bed that you push up and pull down from the wall (a murphey bed).

Location is really good, in a very cozy little street with lots of boutiques, beautifully decorated for Christmas. We paid 90 euros per night excl breakfast, but the rooms are nothing exceptional. They are rather small with no place to sit or write if you need to. My husband had taken his laptop with him, and had to have it on his knees while working. Breakfast we got separately and it was much better than the overpriced breakfast (19 euros) from the buffet (i.e. buffet was totally B&B quality; basic). There were really scrooge with amenities though, no body lotion or soap, which makes me think if this was on purpose because of the \"low\" rate we paid. The girls at the reception are fab and very helpful. Blue Bar is good and service is efficient. They have a limited carte with cocktails but it is OK. I also took a hot chocolate, which turned out to be cacao with milk... In the neighborhood there are many nice bakeries for your breakfast and some upmarket restaurants. I personally like German cuisine and always go back to Zillermarkt around the corner for the Eisbein, a Berlin specialty. Careful: if you have a low rate they refuse to credit any air miles. Couple of other things that disappointed me: no aromatologiy perfumes in the corridors, furniture in the room is really not beautiful, and being very familiar with interior decoration it is also not what the hotel claims to be, warm water in the shower took some minutes to come, I did not try the spa treatments which were overpriced.

The hotel was highly recommended by the travel agent, who asked me to check out the website. The snaps on the site are very misleading & do not indicate the actual size of the room. The reception was OK & the lift was not very nice. The doors are glass & not very safe. The room itself was a shocker. It was like any hostel room anywhere else in Europe with an attached bathroom. The whole room was less than 100 sq ft. Easily the smallest hotel room I have stayed in. I am surprised at the many reviews about the spacious rooms, very misleading. We tried to change hotels the moment we saw the room & the hotel would not let us without charging the full day's stay. There was one bed (with wheels at one end) & an average mattress. There was a 14 inch CRT television (thought they were obsolete!) & a small minibar. Once I opened my bag, there was no place to move around the room. The room was extremely poorly lit & gloomy. The bathroom was about 25 sq ft & with extremely small area to shower with a grossly inadequate shower curtain which let all the water out. If this is a boutique hotel, i would much rather have the regular old hotels. Furniture, decor was also very tacky. 4 star is a gross over rating (even for Europe) I have stayed at many 3 stars in Paris which had larger rooms. (and that is really saying something) The Breakfast was good & the location was great. But 160 Euro per night was a ridiculous price to pay. At 80 Euro, it would be a great place to stay.

Despite my friend booking via the hotel website they lost his booking, and as such had what I would describe as \"run of house\" room for the first night. Was very pokey. Looks like all the rooms were furnished with the same type and amount of furniture, and in a room this small it made it quite cramped. To the hotel's credit they moved us to a bigger room for the following two nights, which was a cavern by comparison - this was fronting the road rather than down the long corridor that runs from the street to the back of the building. Rooms come with a bar fridge with free (!) drinks like coke and sparkling water. Fridge in the first room didn't work so well, but it was so cold outdoors I just put stuff on the window ledge to stay \"refrigerated\". There is a supermarket on the street one block west if you want more provisions. Breakfast which was included in the price was great. Heaps of food to chose from - cold cuts, cereals, fruits, eggs (cooked to your liking by the chef), toast, breads with a large variety of spreads, tea coffee and fruit juice. Was too easy to go nuts and skip lunch as a result. Definitely the best point of the hotel if you ask me. There is also a bar situated at the front of the hotel. S-bahn station (Savignyplatz) is about two blocks north over the Ku'damm, so location is quite good. There are also heaps of eating options located around the station, especially on Bleibtreustrasse just before the S-Bahn. Coming from Tegel you can either take the 109 bus which goes down the Ku'damm, or catch a cab for about EUR15.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBleibtreu - good base\u201d", "Author": "HRHLonodn", "ReviewID": "UR8090055", "Content": "Nice contemporary hotel in quiet but central location.

While designed with a modern sensibility the rooms were extremely small (I had a single with one twin bed - awful!). The lighting is too dim in the rooms and the bathrooms, while having very pretty tiling, lacked products and amenities other than one tube of hair/body wash. There is DSL available in the rooms but 5 euro for 2 hours (almost $10). The staff waivered between rigidly Germanic and somewhat nice, but no raves here. I'll say they were perfunctory in their job performance. Additionally the cost here is over $100 euro/night and definitely overpriced. It's also really only conveniently located to the main shopping street of high end stores - if you're not interested in that it's metro or taxis.
