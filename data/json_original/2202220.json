Since we were only going to be on Oahu for three nights and didn't plan on spending much time at the hotel I didn't want to spend a lot. I've stayed in Honolulu many times, am very familiar with the area. I ended up choosing the White Sands because of the price, amenities and locations, mainly because it has a small kitchenette in the room. The first thing I noticed was the friendliness of the check-in staff, particularly Jason. The service was fast and efficient, and the friendliness was genuine, not forced or phony. Jason seemed to go out of his way to make us feel welcome. Pluses: the room was older but clean. the outdoor area is very nice, pool and hot tub well maintained. My wife enjoyed lounging by the pool with some wine while I went scuba diving. (Center Ring Diving, check them out!) They have free WiFi, which the more expensive hotels charge for. Another plus, the location is fantastic, just a few hundred yards away from the International Marketplace, and about a 5 minute walk to the beach at Waikiki. Really just a couple of negatives: first, at least in our room, the AC was a small, old and tired window unit. We were there during a particularly warm week and the AC had a really tough time keeping up with it. Another downer: this is an older, lower priced hotel and it showed in the beds. They were on the hard side, it's time for new ones. Note: They have their own parking lot, but it is small. Call to reserve a spot when you book a room.

We booked two rooms with kitchenettes, we had one room with a kitchenette and the other with a fridge and a microwave- the two rooms did not warrant the same price and were not as described, luckily the rooms were reasonably closeby so shared keys and used the one kitchen, although not ideal. I had emailed the hotel before our arrival and told them it was a special trip for my Mum's birthday and requested rooms closeby with a nice view if possible. The rooms overlooked the car park and flats opposite- not my idea of a great view but then apart from looking out over the swimming pool there wasn't a nice view. The rooms were comfortable to sleep in although noise was an issue at night as doors constantly slammed and we could hear the traffic at night. We were woken up most mornings by the rubbish collection which came really early at about 5am, I sleep very deeply and it even woke me up. Not my idea of sleeping in paradise! The housekeepers came daily but the room was not clean when we arrived and was never actually cleaned! Seriously, there were bits of food on the floor not just under the sofa and bed but all over. We even found a sandal down the back of the sofa and a sock just on the floor behind a chair. The bathroom floor was disgusting especially by the toilet and there were weird stains on the walls which was really disgusting. We never felt clean in the rooms and couldn't walk round barefoot. The only way we knew the cleaners had been in the room was because our rubbish had been emptied and taken even if it wasn't put in the bin (that means it wasn't rubbish!)

We ended up hanging in our room much more than we anticipated because we could relax, have some drinks, and enjoy getting ready for the busy day. Our balcony over looked trees and the hot tub, which was nice. I loved having the kitchen in the room. We made breakfast every morning, which saved us some money. It is so close to shopping, bars/clubs, and the beach! It is definitely in a party area, so if you're looking for a secluded, romantic get away, you may want to look elsewhere. You can definitely still have a romantic time, but the area was best for those wanting to get out and go! The only downside was parking, but that is with any place in Waikiki.

The ticket machine in that lot was not working so I had to park in another hotel lot on the next block that cost $25 per night. $25 per night parking is pretty standard for Waikiki. I went to use the kitchenette and found that every dinner plate in the cupboard had old food stuck too it which was disgusting. I picked up a water glass from the cupboard which was also filthy. They provided a kitchen cloth and dish towel but no detergent to clean the dishes. I would be afraid to eat off anything in those cupboards. I kicked off my shoes when I entered the room which is the Hawaiian style. After a few minutes I looked down at my socks and they were black. The floors were also very dirty. I took a cloth and wiped it across the light fixture in the bathroom it it came back full of dirt. The place is very dirty and I would not stay there again. I gave it a poor rather than terrible rating because the location is not bad and the front desk staff is very nice and really does try to help. My advice is pay a little more and stay somewhere else.

When we arrived, I discovered that the parking lot consisted of about 8 parking spaces. There was no parking garage. Even with my small economy car, it was tough to maneuver through this tight parking lot. This task was made even more difficult by someone\u2019s long truck that was parked by the exit and hampered one\u2019s ability to get through the tight turn. For this, you pay an extra $20 per day. We accessed our rooms by walking down a hallway with filthy carpets. It wasn\u2019t a comforting first impression. Our \u201csuite\u201d came with two twin beds, a Hollywood-style daybed that doubles as a sofa, and a tiny kitchen. The beds must have had the cheapest mattresses the hotel could obtain, perched on wobbly metal frames. There was one small pillow on each bed. The scratchy blankets made me think longingly of my former Army barracks in basic training \u2013 the Army beds and blankets were more comfortable. My daughter pulled the blankets off one of the beds and slept on the daybed, as it had a slightly better mattress. The bathroom was none too clean \u2013 the floor could have used a good mopping with some strong cleaning fluid. The shower was about 30\u201d by 30\u201d in size. The kitchen consists of a microwave, a half-size refrigerator, a sink, and two burners. It\u2019s very tiny, but was adequate for preparing breakfast cereal and light meals. I would have appreciated it if the kitchen had been stocked with some salt and pepper. The first night I was there, I poured some unused lemonade down the sink and didn\u2019t notice that the sink stopper kept it from draining out of the sink. When I returned at the end of our first full day in Oahu, I noticed that the lemonade was still in the sink; the maids hadn\u2019t drained it or cleaned it. As an experiment, I deliberately left it there the second day. It didn\u2019t get cleaned then, either. There is a safe in the closet, which seemed like a good idea for security purposes, but you have to go to the lobby and obtain a key for $2/day for the privilege of using it. Better hotels have safes with combination locks that you can set yourself, and they don\u2019t charge you for their use. The lanai \u201cview\u201d was non-existent, and there are no sheer curtains. It\u2019s either reveal yourself to the world or have your room plunged into darkness by the drapes. The HVAC unit appeared to have a thermostat, but the A/C ran constantly, despite the setting. The wireless internet seemed to work adequately. The only reason that I ranked this hotel two stars is because one star is the minimum on TripAdvisor, and I\u2019ve stayed at two other motels in my lifetime that have been worse. Since the locks and deadbolts worked, I didn\u2019t feel overly worried about my safety, and at least the maids had made an attempt to clean the unit before our arrival. And the air conditioning worked, so we didn\u2019t roast. I have to admit that the hotel was surprisingly un-noisy for its location in a busy urban section of Waikiki.

We were a bit apprehensive after booking it online with Hotwire.com, but took a risk. The hotel is about a half block away from the Ala Wai canal and about 3 blocks from the beach, in the opposite direction. It's exactly adjacent to the Ilima Hotel, for reference (the Ilima seems better known in case you need pick-ups/drop-offs, etc.). The block itself is a bit run down, but only that. We always felt perfectly safe (and, for that matter, felt so everywhere in Waikiki and greater Honolulu). The location allows you to walk pretty much everywhere you'd care to go in Waikiki and is very close to major bus stops if you're using transit to get around. As you'll read elsewhere, the hotel is a collection of three, three-storey buildings, none with elevator. It seemed to us that the elderly guests were all placed in ground-floor rooms. This is a hotel in serious need of investment and renovation. The hallway on the third floor of the main building (where we stayed) had carpet that bordered on nauseating, in terms of its cleanliness and advanced age. The room was a fair bit better, but still very aged and dated. The furniture appeared to have been selected from thrift shops and garage sales, although the bed was comfortable and in good condition. The kitchenette consisted of a two-burner range, sink, min-fridge (large enough for two people's use), microwave (very clean) and various utensils and dishes. Our bathroom appeared original to the building's construction, but the plumbing worked very well. Good strong shower, good water pressure in the sink and throne. I noted only one multi-legged visitor during our stay, who confined himself to the bathroom and came and went very quickly (and about which I didn't tell my wife until this very moment). There's a nice pool and, well-hidden behind it, a jacuzzi pool. The whole area was quiet and lightly-used during our stay. It closes at 9 pm. Wi-fi, at least in our room, was so spotty as to be almost useless, but the signal in the lobby and pool area is roaring strong. The lobby itself has a rack of brochures, pamphlets and the ubiquitous \"what-to-do\" magazines. They often contain a variety of useful coupons. It seemed to us that the hotel is used as a student residence, as we saw a lot of a young woman, in business dress and with a clipboard, greeting and escorting arriving young guests to their rooms. If those guests are indeed students, they were quiet and unobtrusive. The hotel staff themselves are uniformly pleasant and helpful. We were unsuccessful in bending their arms to extend our check-out time beyond an extra hour, but they were happy to give us towels and let us lie by the pool until it was time to leave for the airport. We paid about $500 for our 5-night stay, which seems reasonable on the whole. We likely wouldn't choose to stay there again but don't recommend against it as a choice for others. Just do remember you're likely not paying very much and shouldn't expect a lot either. Do ask for a pool-view room; the \"city-view\" ones overlook the dingy and depressing parking lot.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alasla", "Title": "\u201cOwnership changes and now called White Sands.

Never saw a bug - No street noise - Large lanai Cons: - Older hotel - No elevator (but not a problem since we were on the 2nd floor) - Smoke detector chirped in the hallway like it needed batteries replaced.

We took Robert's shuttle from the airport to the hotel (drop off at Ilima which is next door to the White Sands) and walked or took the Bus everywhere.

Unless you are staying at the Celebrity for free \u2026 and even then...don\u2019t even think about it. I am at a loss as to why so many people give this place a decent rating. It\u2019s run down and in serious need of a small, controlled fire. You can easily find other properties in Waikiki for the same price. Still not convinced? Read on. Before I go any further, in agreement with some of the other reviews, I have to say that the staff here are great. The desk staff are generally happy and helpful and the room staff keep the rooms clean..and that is no small task given the condition of the things. So\u2026The Celebrity Resort is one of those quintessential 1950s-era block motels that you really want to like. The pics on their website show the d\u00e9cor and the prices (starting at $79/night for a studio) clue you into the fact that this place is not high-end and that\u2019s fine. Honolulu is full of over-priced tower hotels so finding a small, cool motel in Waikiki would be great. However, the Celebrity is not it. The website offers the following quote.. \u201cSituated amongst the hustle and bustle of metropolis Waikiki, the resort maintains the ambiance of Hawaii as it used to be 40 years ago - where the surf, sun and sea lull you into a tropical euphoria.\u201d Sounds great. You\u2019re thinking Ernest Hemingway\u2019s Hawaii and a lush plantation resort on the ocean, right? Ok, let me translate that into plain, brutally honest English for you. \u201cSet back on a dirty street within walking distance of a bunch of crappy souvenir stores and cheap bars, but nowhere near close enough to hear or see the suff the resort, which has not been updated in 40 years \u2013offers noise, odors and rundown interiors which send you into a catatonic state.\u201d We stayed in room 327 and 327a. These two rooms, a studio with kitchenette and a single hotel room have an adjoining door and are combined to make a 1 bedroom/ 2 bath suite though there is nothing sweet about it. Rooms 321-335 (odd numbers) on this side of the property face the street and they are both loud and not at all private. The garbage trucks (plural\u2026 I counted three) start about 6am and then it\u2019s non-stop noise well into the night. However, if you\u2019re into being an exhibitionist and fool enough to stay here\u2026these rooms are perfect as no less than 100 apartments across the street have a clear view directly into these rooms and on the patios. The beds and the furnishing in the rooms (at least 327 and 327a) are bad, thread-bare and stained. The bathrooms are outdated and the tile in the showers is cracked and perma-stained. The water pressure is quite good so there\u2019s something positive. Both rooms have a separate AC unit to keep the place cool if you need to chill for a bit and they are loud enough to block out the traffic noise. The kitchenette in the studio has a coffee pot, microwave, toaster oven, two burner stove top and a small mini-fridge. There are glasses, plates, knives and flatware. Not great stuff but it does the job if you want to stay in and cook something simple. The common areas of the hotel are a little better but still outdated and generally borderline junk. Yes, there is a pool in the center courtyard and if you have small children they will think it\u2019s great. The beach is about a 3-5 minute walk away and you end up beach front at the Royal Hawaiian. The front desk at the Celebrity will give you towels, beach mats, etc. Just ask. I like to stay at a variety of places and I generally prefer to steer clear of the big name hotel chains as I traveled for business for a good 10 years and stayed in them too much. I like to find smaller, more hands-on hotels and motels that offer something out of the norm. But again, this place is not it. It\u2019s just plain bad. Do your homework. If you want to stay in Waikiki there are a number of other properties in the same price range that have invested in updating and offer good quality interiors and furnishings.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cOur Fav\u201d", "Author": "myhavaii", "ReviewID": "UR27463234", "Content": "We stayed at the Celebrity in March for 8 days.

The rooms were average, but clean and spacious. We've stayed in other hotels in the area, that were half the size, but cost more.

We were in the market for a Waikiki hotel that was budget-friendly and centrally located. We had also decided that since we were traveling so far, for such a short period of time, we were going to spend as much time out and about as we could - we didn't intend to spend a lot of time in a hotel room. Essentially, we were looking for a decent place to sleep and a safe place to store our things. We were met at the front desk by Aaron and Joemar. I asked if they had a room on the courtyard side available. Aaron said they had one, but it was a smoking room. He offered to take me to see it before finalizing our transaction. I was afraid it was going to have a stale smoky smell, but much to my surprise, it was fine - no trace of smoke, and truthfully, I don't recall even having seen an ashtray in the room. We have nothing to complain about our stay there. The front desk staff was friendly, the poolside pancake breakfast was fun, the concierge service was a plus - I can't remember the young lady's name, I want to say it was Kealia - I'm so sorry I can't remember the spelling - but she was so sweet, and so helpful in getting us tickets for a sunset catamaran cruise, and tickets for Pearl Harbor. They have a small hut where they store pool toys and boogie boards - guests are welcome to take those boogie boards over to Waikiki Beach. On the Sunday we were there, we decided we were going to explore the beaches on the eastern coast, and in Kailua, we bought 2 boogie boards of our own. Since we knew we wouldn't be able to bring them back on the plane, we left them as a thank you to the staff for the awesome time we had there, and also in the hopes that other guests would have as much fun boogie boarding as we did. We only had a car for 3 days of our trip, parking at the resort was unavailable, but parking garages are nearby, albeit rather expensive, and with time limits. One morning, my boyfriend was up at 5:00 AM in order to move the car to a different location. If you don't need a car, don't get one - public transportation is reliable, efficient and inexpensive. If you're expecting the Ritz, you're going to be disappointed and I recommend you keep going, but, if you're looking for a safe, clean, reasonably priced place to stay, where the staff greets you by name, please try Celebrity Resorts.

The bed was quite comfortable although it may need to be changed soon as it is starting to sag towards the middle. The bathrooms are small but clean and shower area tiny.

Low rise, not fancy, fewer people, inviting courtyard and pool area, friendly staff are all plusses. The secret to this place seems to be getting a room on the inner courtyard, not on the periphery. We booked a n/s 1 bdr for 2 adults/2 kids. There are smoking rooms/floors as well as non-smoking, but the inner courtyard area is non-smoking. Smokers have an area provided in the parking lot. Service: We checked in late, so there wasn't much available except a room facing Nohonani St. Staff was very friendly, helpful and efficient. Thank you to Judy, Marie, Joemar, Brian, Jocelyn and the always-smiling Aaron! The staff were happy to book shuttles, give dining advice, etc. Late check-out was provided, and other travellers were able to use common areas until their very late departure. Most of the guests were friendly and courteous, although we encountered two self-centred jet-lagged parents who let their toddler scream loudly on the lanai at 3:30 am. The security person was already out there when I opened the balcony door. I tried to get their attention by leaning over and waving and yelling, but said oblivious parent was too busy watching TV to notice some stranger near their kid on the balcony. The security lady ended up knocking on their door and asked them to respect the quiet hours rule. Room: The 1 bdr was large, but we were disappointed that it wasn't a courtyard/pool view room. Although I asked daily about changing, it was a busy week. Facing the street, it wasn't terribly private, but it was bright if you opened the curtains. 2 queen sofabeds in the living area, so both kids got their own bed. The bedroom's queen bed was comfortable enough but seemed small. Loved the many extra pillows in the room! TVs in both the living area and bedroom, but limited TV channels. DVD player & DVDs can be rented at the front desk. The safe in the room was useful, although it will not hold a laptop computer. Air conditioning in each room was noisy, as were the garbage trucks that hit various buildings in the area. We counted 4 on Wed. (from 6 am on), and 1 each day except Sunday. The earliest one was at 5:36 am, and the driver was banging the dumpster around with vengeance. As a light sleeper I definitely needed earplugs, but the rest of the family was fine. Kitchenette: small beer fridge (used the crisper drawer for milk) with ice cube tray, 2 burner stove, microwave oven, toaster oven, cutlery (& steak knives!) and dishes. Coffee maker & filters provided, but it was more convenient and fun to have Kona and Vanilla Macnut coffee out by the pool (avail. 7-10 am). Salt & pepper provided; sugar and coffee whitener avail. at morning coffee. No dishwasher, only a dishrack. Bathrooms: the 1 bdr had 2 identical bathrooms on each side of the unit. Toilets flush loudly and run long. Shower pressure and temperature were great in the morning, although one afternoon the temp was only warm. The shower heads were really low at 5'4\", so at 5'6\" I had to bend my knees to wash my hair. Housekeeping: according to something I read at the hotel, Heavy housekeeping was done on Wed. & Sat., including changing sheets & washing dishes. We washed our own. Lite housekeeping involved making beds & changing towels on all other days. For some inexplicable reason, the maid never left extra shampoo or soap in either bathroom. We had one soap for the shower and sink area until I went downstairs to ask for more. Amenities: small, warm, deep swimming pool (4-7 ft). Pool and beach toys available in pool shack (air mattresses, tubes, boogie boards, beach chairs, umbrellas, beach mats, pails and shovels). Beach and pool towels are signed out at the front desk. Plenty of tables with umbrellas by the pool, although it gets very busy during the pancake breakfast on Thurs. morning. Lounge chairs by pool. Hot tub secluded in far part of courtyard, hidden by palm trees, plants, and waterfall. NY Pizza/cheesecake night is on Tuesdays. Internet access in lobby was useful for quick inquiries. Did not use the booking agent, but it seemed convenient to have that service available. Neighborhood: Within a block of the hotel on Kuhio, you can find fast food: Subway, Jack in the Box (all day breakfast), sushi, Pukadog, Starbucks, Fatty's Chinese, Denny's, McDonald's (2 blks west), St. Germain bakery with cheap, appealing sandwiches and pastries. More formal restaurants are within a few blocks. Shopping: ABC store (with booze), Payless shoes, pharmacy (one block east), Food Pantry (2 blocks east). The International Marketplace is within the block, full of cheap \"Let's make a deal\" souvenir merchandise and a small food court. Kalakaua, the action packed main drag is a quick 5 minutes away, and free entertainment abounds at night, including street performers, fancy stores and restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, CPK, etc). Kuhio Beach (Duke's statue) is the big main beach. Just north is the Ala Wai canal - good for a walk or run. We never felt unsafe, but then, we never stayed out very late, either. The hotel is secured after 8 pm, and key cards are a must. There is an exit at the back of the complex as well.

Before arriving I was a little nervous after reading some of the negative reviews but it didn't take long to feel right at home. These accommodations are by no means perfect but I'm giving it 5 stars because it was my experience that within just a few hours we were able to make this apartment-style hotel room a home away from home. Upon arriving we went to the front desk where Joemar and Aaron helped check us in. They were both incredibly helpful and friendly. In fact, I would say their smiles were contagious. We requested a room facing the pool area and were fortunate enough to get one. We ended up with a room overlooking the pond and spa which turned out to be perfect because it was a little more private and it was right next to the back entrance for easy in and out access. Before raving more about the good I think it's only fair to align any future expectations with the reality of a 2.5 star hotel. When we first walked into our room it's fair to say my roach motel fears didn't vanish immediately. It definitely had an unappealing musty smell. The bedroom floor had a huge iron burn on the carpet (it was literally the full size and shape of the bottom of an iron). Not once did we see any bugs of any kind inside our suite but one of our 7 mornings there we did see a single, but live, roach in the hallway. Housekeeping was pretty good but you should expect to do your own dishes (we left $3 on average for tip each day) and one of the 8 days we were there our bed looked made but the sheets under the comforter had not been touched and were in complete disarray. Now, you are probably asking yourself how I could possibly rate it a 5 after all that but let me explain. First off, never have I made myself so at home at any other hotel I've ever stayed in. By day 2 my friend and I had literally unpacked everything in our suitcases. Shirts and shorts were hanging in the 2 closets, our bathroom amenities were each stowed away in our own separate bathroom mirror cabinets. We stayed in one of the Bedroom Suites. It had a sitting room with two pullouts, a full kitchen, a bedroom and 2 full bathrooms. Since it was just the 2 of us we didn't really need the 2 bathrooms but it certainly ended up being convenient to have all the extra counter and storage space. Once the AC is running a while the smell goes away and you won't think about it again. Since we really did feel at home it didn't bother us when our dishes didn't get cleaned or the one time our sheets weren't perfect. My friend in particular is pretty anal when it comes to cleanliness and other than the initial smell and the partially made bed she had no complaints. The first night we got in we went to the grocery store down the road and filled up our fridge with sandwich stuff, eggs, yogurt, etc. Most of the days we'd get up early, eat breakfast, spend the day out and then come back to the room for dinner on the lanai and then spend the rest of the day walking Waikiki Beach or sitting by the pool. It was a very welcoming and relaxing place to return to after a long day of sightseeing and sunbathing. If we come back we'll definitely be looking up Celebrity Resorts Waikiki again.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel on a Crowded Island\u201d", "Author": "HawaiiRocks08", "ReviewID": "UR18521627", "Content": "Nice hotel for the money.

There is a small kitchenette which adequately served our needs: had a small refrigerator, microwave, cooktop and coffee maker. All rooms have some type of patio or balcony. Unfortunately we were assigned a room with no view so we did not use this feature. Request a room with a pool view. There are various brews of free coffee in the morning by the pool area where you can sit and relax and enjoy your coffee. Very limited parking accommodations even though you pay a daily fee to park (but this seems to be the norm and not the exception these days on Oahu). Once they run out of parking spaces at this hotel they have an agreement where you can use a hotel's parking garage across the street at a reduced fee but still higher than the fee that you pay to park in this hotel's lot. Even though we prepaid for this hotel, was charged an additional $3.99/day for a resort fee. I must say that the pool area is very nice, the hotel is located close to Kuhio Avenue (major shopping on this street; close to International Market), and not that far from the beach and the great public transportation that this island offers. The hotel has pizza parties and other activites that the hotel guests can participate in (for a fee). The absolute best thing about this hotel is the front desk staff....they were extremely kind, pleasant, professional and courteous all of the time! Although there is a desktop computer located across from the front desk that can be used by the hotel guests the front desk staff was able to provide directions and answer all questions.

She let us check the one that was available with a view, although she said it was smaller than what we were supposed to have. Then she let us check out the room we were supposed to get that had a view of the parking lot. We ended up going with the smaller room with a view as we didn't need the pullout sofa.

Amazing bakery & an ABC Store at the corner, larger Food Pantry (pricey but OK for short time) up the road, zillions of shops of all types within minutes' walk, including market stalls (beware predatory stallholders! if you act interested, they will pounce!). Walking distance to the beach, too. Only criticisms are: room security could be improved (in-room safe but no chain on door & only very basic door lock; and only 1 simple up/ down lock on sliding door to lanai).

Lots of great reviews though, so in my review I'll just focus on what stood out to me. The hotel has a 2 1/2 star rating I believe, and I'd say this is fairly accurate.

We booked this location for 4 nights on an RCI exchange. We stayed on the 3rd floor (Rm 306??). It was an efficiency unit. I must say that we were uncomfortable from the moment we checked into our room. We spent most of our time figuring out how not to spend any time in the room. First , the layout of the room: You open the door to the room. The headboard of the bed was right next to the door as you open it. About 3 steps later to the left is the bathoroom/closet. We came to be more horrified with this design when we actually utilized our bathroom. The bathroom has zero ventilation (if you get my drift)!!! No ventilation fan, no bathtub, just shower with shower curtain. Toilet is about 2 feet from the wet shower curtain. And your clothes share your bathroom space!! There is somewhat of a slatted door on the \"closet\". The other side of the room consisted of a sofa, kitchenette and balcony. There is air conditioniong. However, when you opened the balcony sliding door, the door bangs against the air conditioner. f you sit on the balcony, you get to listen to your and your neighbors' air conditioner. The kitchenette was nice, not in the bathroom. (Sorry, couldn't resist the humor). However the tightness of the room and the co-mingled space, literally makes you not want to deal with food in the room. The carpet was an old fashioned dark green color. It's ok when you first check-in, but as the hours go by, you notice that this color shows every grain of sand, every light colored speck, etc. Too tight of a space. Dated surroundings. Didn't feel that the room was clean. My husband misplaced his glasses. We still laugh at how horrified we were that they might have fallen under the bed. Neither of us wanted to check under or behind the bed. Luckily we found them before needing to do this. I'm sorry to say that we checked out of this hotel after 2 days. We're not hotel snobs. Our vacation just wasn't worth the hassle. I woke up both days thinking \"How can I spend as little time in this room today, as possible?\" Due to other positive reviews, which I relied on, my advice is to try get a \"good\" room. If that guarantee is not possible, I would not risk my vacation time being uncomfortable. Book something that you can be sure about. I didn't see any of the other rooms.

This is not a gold crown resort in RCI's books, but it's as good as one. Two strong points are: location and service. Long before I even set foot in the resort, I was impressed by the helpfulness of the staff. Judy ( front desk manager) and Marie were very patient with my questions, such as availability of wireless internet, rice cooker ( which was sitting on the dinner table when I first entered the room ) and arranging the same room as my RCI excahnge for those three add-on days, There is no surprise that one side of the building has better view than the other, and they were very nice in accomodating my request since it was made months in advance. During my stay, I met these two ladies plus Aaron and Joemar, who were all as pleasant and competent as previous posts ahd described. Aaron mentioned that he's been with the resort for only a few short years, and look forward to many more years of association. How often do you come across a front line worker saying that? It shows that these people are happy and take pride in their work. You just can't beat this location. I chose to use an internet cafe, and there's one just outside the back door, called Paradise Internet, on Nuhua St. It takes longer for me to get from my room to the front lobby of many big timeshare condos , such as Hilton Grand Vacation Club. For those who intend to do a fair bit of their own meal preparation, there's a decent grocery store two to three blocks away on Walina and Kuhio called the Food Pantry, which has most of what you need for a one week stay, and it's open almost all the time when I'm awake. Bus stops very conveniently located on Kuhio Ave half a block away. $20 for a visitor 4-day bus pass gets you virtually everywhere, so a car is really unnecessary unless you have a tight touring schedule and has little time to spare going from one site to another. The units have been renovated , as I noted new curtains and bedspreads. I tried hard to sniff but really cannot detect any trace of smoke. Wife is asthmatic and very sensitive to even the slightest hint of smoke. The unit itself is very clean, superior to that of Hilton grand Vacation Club. Last year, before I discovered Celebrity Resort, I stayed twice at the Ilima next door in a comparable one bedroom unit. It was nowhere as well kept, and 50% pricier. In 2007, we have stayed at Ritz-Carlton in Santiago, Four Seasons in Buenos Aires, Fairmont Banff Springs in Banff, Alberta, Chateau Lake Louise in Lake Louise, Alberta,( I have to add that the last three I got free upgrades to one bedroon suite, it's just been a lucky quarter of travelling) all arguably rated # 1 in their region, and yet I felt the most comfortable at Celebrity resort Wakiki.

What a wonderful suprise this hotel turned out to be! The ambience of the place is true Waikiki 60's style. From the minute you walk in the front door past the \"Welcome Home sign\" you know you are on to a winner. The lobby immeadiately transports you back in time with it's cane furniture, vintage Hawiian music and decor - all scrupulously clean.

The room was spacious and clean with all the amenitites you need to self service meals although with so many great eateries within walking distance who could be bothered! The maids did a great job of cleaning each day - including any dishes (which has not been our experience in other Oahu hotels in the area). One of the things I found interesting in previous TripAdvisor reviews stating the views were either great or terrible. This was easily explained once we arrived as half the rooms overlook the gorgeous coutyard with the pool, SPA and greenery and the other half overlook neighbouring alleys which are essentially the back of other shops and hotels. If you get the chance when booking definitely ask for a courtyard facing room. Ala the concierge was an absolute gem and arranged all our bookings in her friendly manner. It was lovely to meet her around the hotel over the next few days with her warm hello - she is a real asset to the hotel. It is worth checking the hotel price regularly in the days leading up to your stay as it varies depending on vacancy rate. We added on an extra night after we arrived and paid $89 for that night as it was close to the memorial day weekend. HIGHLIGHTS: a block to Waikiki beach, 2 minutes walk to Macy's, 1 minute walk to the International Market, bus stop on the corner, great pool, great SPA, lovely abience, scrupulously clean airconditioned rooms, friendly staff, car rental place literally across the street, CHEAP!

Pancake breakfest, pizza night etc. Don't miss out on this one!!", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sasakwa, OK", "Title": "\u201cHeaven On Earth\u201d", "Author": "bia592", "ReviewID": "UR6594124", "Content": "Celebrity Resorts Hotel in Waikiki, is outstanding. I read all of the reviews on Expedia, and I thought that this Hotel should have been ranked much higher. There is no elevator, which to my husband and I was not a big deal what so ever, but the staff was outstanding, and very helpful. The housekeeping service came everyday, if you wanted, and cleaned everything. Even any dishes that might have been left in the sink. We stayed 4 nights, and that was not nearly enough. We will be going back to Hawaii in December of this year, 2007, and guess where we are staying, yep, you guessed it. Celebrity Resorts. In fact, we are going to talk to them about a time share.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cAwesome !\u201d", "Author": "lbd14", "ReviewID": "UR6512150", "Content": "Absolutely beautiful! The staff are exceptional ! Greg is the perfect host and the hotel staff were so helpful and so down to earth they made our stay The lobby was like old Hawaii and the pool was perfect with privacy from the busy streets. Central location to the beach and shopping! Activities are planned if you want to join in or not. I highly recommend joining in it was alot of fun! Kids loved it too and felt very safe in their surroundings. Rooms are very clean and comfortable! Loved it and would defineatly come back and stay with the folks who call you family while you are at your home away from home.

The room was HUGE (we got the suite, which is two rooms with a door in between) this room was way too big for just the two of us but it was still very nice and I couldn't believe what we got for the price, such a bargain. Everything was clean and tidy. About two blocks to Waikiki and lots of restaurants, shops and a nice little grocery store close by. We had a wonderful stay. On the last day checkout was at 11am and our plane didnt leave until the evening, they held our baggage and let us use a room that afternoon to shower in after a day at the beach, it was a great help and a lot more comfortable than showering at the beach! The only negative thing I would mention is make sure you reserve your parking if you rent a car. It is $10 a day if you park at the hotel BUT if they are out of spaces (there aren't very many!!) you get sent across the road to another hotel parking space where it is $18 a day!!! We booked this trip very last minute however, so lack of parking could mostly have been our fault, just make sure you've got a spot if you need one.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cFeels like Home\u201d", "Author": "andrealv", "ReviewID": "UR5883570", "Content": "This was a small scale (3 story) hotel with not much of a view, but other than that, it was a great home away from home.

It appears to be a timeshare resort (signs mention guests and owners) and the guests we encountered usually seemed to be older couples. It was a nice quiet, comfortable place to stay with the little extras (like the kitchen) that make it a great deal for the price.

Our plane was departing saturday night, and it was great that the hotel has a baggage room so after we chek out we left our things there and went all day to the beach, and when we got back they even lend us a shower and towels. I really recomend this hotel, it\u00b4s in the center of waikiki, 1 block from shoping (international market place, waikiki shoping center, royal hawaiian), half block from all the restaurants, 2 blocks from the beach, and half block from the bus stop.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kenosha, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Gem\u201d", "Author": "Benefits", "ReviewID": "UR5800873", "Content": "Can't begin to explain how happy We were with our stay. This place is a hidden gem. Sure its not the four seasons, but for what we paid it certainly seemed like it. Stayed 4 nights in September over labor day weekend. Loved it. Right in the middle of everthing waikiki has to offer. Staff was great. Special thanks to Judy(manager), and Brian and Diana(front desk staff), they really made our stay pleasant. Nice grounds in the courtyard. Only negative I would say is the parking situation. It's tight. But thats waikiki. Since this was our first trip I now know that a car really isn't needed. Cab it and rent a car for maybe a day or two max. There are buses and trolleys everywhere but pretty much everthing can be reached on foot.
