The perfect service started when i arrived, they knew my name! More than that there was a spanish speaking receptionist waiting for me and even asked me if i preferred speaking spanish. I was given perfect information about the hotel then the city then i went to my room and it was great. The hotel is a bit far away the center but close to the Bosphorus area which is the best part of the city. I had dinner at the restaurant and it was really delicious, too.

Let me get it straight, the entire experience at Le Meriden Etiler was, BY FAR, above the one at the W Hotel (why on earth this Le Meriden is SPG 5 while W Hotel is SPG 6, this should definitely be the opposite !!). OK it os not in the historical part of the city but few minutes away by Taxi, it worth it. I regret I changed for the week-end. The Hotel is brand new and designed in a nice contemporary/modern style. The rooms are stylish, very well equipped and the view is just amazing (and I did not have a Bosphorus view), I was at the 22nd floor. I'm recommending to ask for the highest floor as possible. Access to the Spa, fitness center (latest techno) and the indoor swimming pool was included in the price of the room and I definitely recommend trying it, it is above standards ! Treatments are a little pricy but i've never seen any lower prices anywhere (except maybe in Thailand) The restaurant is also another great experience for a reasonable price (I'm from Paris where I would have pay 70% more for the same quality) : 1/the breakfast buffet is very high level (and I can tell you that I can compare it with many many others...including the poor one I experienced at the W Hotel Istanbul) 2/The menu for dinner is huge and everything seemed tasty. I went there two times and did not regret it at all (very good memories of their reinterpretation of turkish delights as hot starter) A bit annoying, though, to have to answer every 10 min if everything is OK. Don't leave that hotel without visiting the 34st floor and the view from the terrace where you'll definitely want to FaceTime/Skype your friends/family :) Globally, each time I had to ask for something, I had my request met in time. Two bemols : -> wireless access to the internet requires to get a code on a paper voucher (even in the public area where it is free) which is a little bit old school AND, even though I was not charged for it at the end, the catalog price is a surrealistic 19 EUR/day -> The hotel was not completely finished at the time I was there. Pay attention to this if you intend to sleep late during the week unless you like being woken up by hammering and drilling. I've been told they'll officially open on May 12", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for Relaxing and Daily Trips To Old City\u201d", "Author": "ichaudhri", "ReviewID": "UR127624256", "Content": "We chose this hotel for our trip to Istanbul from March 27th till 4th April. The Trip was paid through cash and SPG points. A brand new property with the amazing views of the Bosphorous sea. To our surprise the Front Office Manager Ali Kaymak was awaiting in front of the building to receive us. Management upgraded us to a Deleux ocean view room. The Guest relation Manager Elif Aydinligil and her team were attentive and personally called us or visited our room to make sure every thing was alright almost every day. Mr Ozan Guner and Ms Esgee from the concerge service were very prompt in booking our daily tours and transport. The Breakfast was Buffet on the 4th floor resturant very spacious and filled with variety of juices, local fruits, breads and cereals. It was little pricy but will keep you filled for a while. After 3 nights stay we were moved and up gradded to a mini suite. Thanks to the Management. We had few issues regarding the rooms itself. At 1.30AM the fire alarm started sounding, the door to the balcony did not close and the center table was shaking not stable. All the issues were resolved by one phone call to the customer service. I really praize the whole staff and the Management for the efficent and prompt service. I will definetly recommend to any body visiting Istanbul and me and my wife are again planning to travel to turkey in April 2013.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sausalito, California", "Title": "\u201cDon't Waste Your Time or Money!\u201d", "Author": "MissBabblicious", "ReviewID": "UR127544543", "Content": "I was in Istanbul for a week and since I am a travel agent, I booked 3 different hotels to get a feel for different types of hotels and different neighborhoods. Le Meridien was booked for the last 2 nights since it is farther away from the downtown area and it would be a great place for us to relax after a busy week. We were coming from The House Hotel Bosphorus and the manager had a friend who worked at Le Meridien so gave a heads up that we were coming. Although her friend greeted us and sent us up a bottle of wine, that was the only redeeming part of the stay. Before going to our room, we asked to exchange our dollars to liras. They said they did not have any bills. We then asked if we could change our 20 lira to smaller bills so we could tip but they also couldn't do that. A gentleman took us to our room and showed us everything which was very nice. Once settled in, we called about internet and they said we would need a passcode brought to us. We requested that along with a converter. 10 min after we called we wanted to go down to the whirlpool before we got to tired but had to wait for them to bring us our stuff. Next thing you know, we wake up to a knocking on our door 45 min later. And they forgot the passcode! I was too pissed at that point to complain and went down to the spa area. We got back to the room and decided to relax in front of the TV. None of the channels were working and when we called were told that they were experiencing a problem. Great, no TV, no internet. The next morning we called about the internet. You have the option to pay hourly or for 24 hours. Since both of us needed to work, we chose 24 hours which was about $25. We soon realized that the passcode is per person, not per room. If you both want to use the passcode, the person needs to log off the system before another person can log on using the passcode. Its ridiculous enough to pay $25 for internet but to not even allow both people in the room to use it is even more stupid in addition to having to have someone bring you a passcode. For a brand new hotel, it was very old school. We went down to the breakfast buffet which was not that good and a total rip off. I was ok with paying $35 for the buffet at the Swissotel because it was amazing and had everything you wanted. To pay $40 at this one which didn't have that big of a selection was extremely disappointing. Add another negative to the list. We went back to the room to finish up some work. My boyfriend was unable to log off the internet in order for me to log on. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. I emailed the manager at the House Hotel to see if she had any availability. She was booked but was able to get us a room with a discount (amazing considering it was Congress Week) at the House Hotel Nishantishi. We were packed up and ready to go in 10 min. When we went to check out, we asked for change for our bigger bills as we still wanted to tip the bellboy etc. Still no change. I went over to their cafe and was told the same. The guy checking me out never once asked me how my stay was or why I was checking out early. When we went out to get a cab, the bellman out there finally asked how our stay was. When I told him not good, he was very surprised that they front desk didn't ask why we were checking out early. At this point, I wasn't surprised. It went along with the rest of the stay. Being a travel agent and flagged as someone to take care of, I would've expected at least the normal 5 star service that Le Meridien is supposed to provide. Swissotel and the House Hotel upgraded me to amazing suites because I'm a travel agent. Both gave service that was beyond 5 star. I didn't even get 2 star service at Le Meridien. I would never return to this hotel again with all the other 5 star hotels in Istanbul that are also in walking distance of fun neighborhoods.

As a Gold SPG member, my room was upgraded to 'Bosphorus view' which had absolutely no view of the bosphorus whatsoever. The room design is perfect. The Staff are incredible, so caring and very well trained, but this did not prevent us to leave the hotel earlier than our original check out date.. We were on the 23rd floor which was a brand new floor and it was far from ready. One of our guests had to change rooms 3 times due to different problems! in the end they were moved to a beautiful executive suite which was worth it. The reason I'm giving only 2 stars in my review is the noise. The terrible, unbearable construction noise that didn't let us sleep after 9:30 am every day. They're still building parts of the hotel. I'm not the type of person to complain easily but this noise was horrifying, I'm surprised it hasnt been mentioned yet. Eventually I complained and the staff apologised and offered us spa treatments, I wasn't after compensation, I was on a family vacation and just wanted to rest, although this was a very nice gesture. In the end we checked out 4 days earlier and moved to a different hotel simply because none of us could sleep in. We were on a family leisure trip and had no reason to wake up early. Hopefully the management will take a look at this problem because as my title suggets it is such a shame, this hotel has so much potential, I have stayed in over ten 5 star hotels in Istanbul and in terms of rooms and comfort this is right at the top, hopefully once the hotel is fully functional and open in may this will be solved. Location wise, Etiler is a prime residential area, not too much to offer for tourists. It's not too far in terms of distance from major sights, malls etc but due to Istanbuls horrible traffic everything takes a long time to get to.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ukrayn", "Title": "\u201cnew hotel\u201d", "Author": "m\u00c4\u00b1lokun\u00c4\u00b1a k", "ReviewID": "UR126349232", "Content": "We were two couples .Locat\u00c4\u00b1on was ok.Breakfast was good.But there were only a few problem. someth\u00c4\u00b1ng bed and bathroom, already used half-empty shampoo bottles.Bad hygiene.housekeep\u00c4\u00b1ng wasnt speak engl\u00c4\u00b1sh.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "miami", "Title": "\u201cbrand-bew hotel. just opened, but too far from averything\u201d", "Author": "vazMiami", "ReviewID": "UR126175080", "Content": "the hotel is very nice, it opened a few days before my arrival (so I had to deal with elevator problems, etc) .
