It's a hostel, and not a bad one of it's kind. There are 2 buildings, the right one definitely more modern, and hotel like, the left one is old and a hostel, this is the one where the restaurant is located. We were three guys who shared the smallest room in the entire hostel, and it wasn't bad at all! - Granted, the shower was small, but supplied hot water! The toilet was in the hall, and it's really not that bad when there is a lock on it. We had a bidet in the room though. All rooms come equipped with a TV, which was quite a surprise to me. The location is incredibly central. It is in the middle of the gay district of Madrid, which is very visible when you walk around. Close to several metro stations and bus stops. Don't eat the food in the hotel restaurant, it's really not that nutritious, and very dull. It's not poisonous though. There is a Starbucks and a Dunkin' Donuts 30 meters away, eat there instead if you please...at least breakfast. There is a lot of street noise, but not any that kept me from sleeping like a rock! The reception does not speak English, but if you're just a little bit friendly and interested, and learn to say your room number in Spanish, they are incredibly friendly and helpful! The cleaning is really good! They actually make your beds every day, despite it being a hostel and not a hotel. They give you fresh towels, and the cleaning personel event went as far as to fold my clothes that was on the bed, one day! The hostel is really not as bad as it is being portrayed in these reviews. It's a hostel, so don't expect much, but don't discard it completely, it's cheap and really good value for money!", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Founex, Geneve, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat\u201d", "Author": "Letty R", "ReviewID": "UR122575665", "Content": "After reading all the reviews I was a little skeptical about the place. I went with my school and found it very nice. The people were nice and the service was good. Breakfast wasn't great so my friends and I ate at Starbucks at only (literally) 10 meters away. It is easily accessible by bus, only 10 minutes away from the bus stop. The rooms were clean, and the bathroom was too. We got EXCELLENT value for money. Sleep quality was fine, we didn't have trouble getting to sleep even if we were on the side of city. The location was amazing. Shops and food at only 1 or 2 minutes away! It was perfect for teenagers! It is also a very safe area.. except for pick pockets, you just have to be careful!

It is on a main street so not recommended if you're a light sleeper. The reception staff speak very little English so you will need a Spanish phrasebook. The rooms are small and the decor is not the newest, but at this price that is what you expect. A good bonus of this hotel is that there is a shower in the room, not down the hall as with most hotels of this class. The shower is pretty small though - be warned! One annoying thing was that when I was paying, the reception desk put the card through in UK pound sterling (i.e. using dynamic currency conversion). I asked to pay in Euro instead and the woman allegedly couldn't work the machine to make this happen, which I didn't really believe; DCC is a well-known tourist rip off. So pay in cash if you can.

The air conditioning was working but with no possibility to set it up for lower or higher degree, therefore was nice and cool during the day, but too cold on the night! It was impossible to sleep without it as the room got hot quickly. Breakfast was the same every day, just roll, butter and jam with coffee or tea.

Here's mine. I booked directly on their web-site for 31Euros/night. The hotel is very easy to reach by metro Tribunal, very central position. I have found the people very professionnal, sympathic, always ready to give indications. So the comments on rudeness did not apply, but, was it because I was speaking spanish all the time? Room is very basic but clean everyday and the shower is very small. Hairy guys and woman with long hair might have problems to rince :) I took once the breakfast (2.65Euros for bread rool and coffee): you will have more at supermarket. The street is noisy, this is a fact, even though there is in the room huge shutters, it is not enough to cover the noise's street. Publics services take the garbage around 1:00am so expect lot of noise and the Spaniards live in the streets, keep that in mind too. As others, the main problem is the regular group that comes in the hotel. Young Spaniards kids: they like to talk, they talk loud and for a long time. I was on 4th floor and there is an inner-stair between 3th and 4th floor so the voices were going up and nobody said something about that, it was almost normal. Poor people at 2nd floor! So, if you need a safe place, you can leave your room in peace and have fun in Madrid.

They thought we were checking out when we didn't tell them we were leaving. I had a table full of snacks and noticed that some of our items were placed outside the room with a few of my items missing. I asked them where my items were and they didn't know or couldn't tell me in English. A few minutes later after taking our things back into the room, my missing items appeared outside our room in a ziplock bag. I don't know why they did that. It was super loud at this location. Our room was right on the street and we could not sleep. The people who live in that location love to party. Broken glass could be heard, early in the morning, and people non-stop talked. The showers were incredibly small and leaked because the drains didn't work right. We had to soak up all the water that overflowed from the shower with the towels we were using to dry ourselves with.
