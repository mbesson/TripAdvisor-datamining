Never been to Europe before and my flight was set for in and out of Amsterdam cause it was the cheapest price around. Grabbed the train from the airport and it dropped me in the center of Amsterdam around 20 mins later. Arrived at Centraal and walked out and tried to orient myself as to where I was supposed to go. Luckily found a map out front and kind of just followed the crowd. A couple of minutes later found myself walking down the Damrak. Did my money exchange, walked around to see what was around, and then set out to find the hotel. Had a little bit of a hard time finding the numbers, but eventually got the hang of it...there was just so much signage to weed through. Finally found the hotel and went up the stairs to the reception area (that was a first for me, but is fairly typical in older buildings in Europe). The reception was basic and simple and old world decor. Lots of wood. My first impression was OK...maybe the rooms are a little better. So got my key and went to the room. Wow!! I don't know how they got a bed in there. As a matter of fact the door only opened half way before it hit the bed. There was a desk which I could use while sitting on the bed. The bed was worn down but not bad enough not to sleep in, which I was able to do for a grand total of probably 3 hours. There was a big window which I needed to have open because there was no AC, just a small desk fan. Of course, that let in all the noise from the surrounding pubs and restaurants. The neighbors were also rowdy. Made a mental note to bring along ear plugs next time. There was a small sink in the room and the bathroom was a common one shared by all on the floor. It was not certainly not what I expected but definitely an experience I'll remember. For the price, it had it's good and bad. Might even consider staying in the area, if not here, again knowing what I know now.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOne word - Perfect!\u201d", "Author": "ccfc2011", "ReviewID": "UR125550264", "Content": "I knew this hotel was going to be of a decent standard, as friends of mine had stayed here and enjoyed its many benefits. It's location is perfect I must say, a little noisy towards the end of the day but that's expected, and the windows do a good job of blocking out all the hustle and bussle. It's very close to all tourist attractions, cafes (weed kind), restaurants, shops, tour guides, etc. Everything is within walking distance, but if u are the kind who prefers to let others do the work for you, then I suggest the taxi bikes. You read it right it, a little carriage thing with a cover over it powered by sheer leg power :D It's great fun, and allows you to see Amsterdam from a different perspective; Amsterdam is incredibly busy on the streets so be alert all the time. Tourists stand out like a saw thumb! The owners were very nice and welcoming, with very attractive rates. I paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 for 2 nights for 2 people, you do the math! The room was perfect size for our intentions ;) The room was cleaned twice to a good standard, as well as clearing up our mess! The communal shower and toilet was sufficient, and served it's purpose.

Food and entertainment all around! I was at the SIbos event during the week and was staying at a premium hotel before switching to accommodate my own pocket. And you do pay for what you get! I shouldve booked earlier! Now, if you have large bags you may have to negotiate some crazy stairs which are in the back of the hotel. Attendants are nice and friendly. In my view, this is a great hotel if you are one of the weed smokers or out to get mildly wrecked. Definately not for the couples that want a peaceful sleep! The street in the back will keep you up or interfere with your sleep with the drunken bafoons shouting. Windows are not great. The first thing I noticed is the pungent smell of weed, eearrgh You may be woken up by the stoned giggling residents in the next room or rooms above... The stink of smoke is horrible. The smoke alarm is covered with plastic. Given people can smoke whatever they like in their rooms the fire hazard is greatly increased. hmmm, safe. There appears to be a mouse problem or at least there was...Mouse poison may be found in the wardrobe area. You may experience a sewage smell after rainfall, I believe this is normal. Just run the shower for 5 mins and the smell disappears. Something to do with the stangnant drainage water. The shower doesnt look upto much but is quite ok. Bed is really soft, probably broken. Very uncomfortable. Hoovers get turned on at 8.30am!!! All in all, this place is fine if you are drunk or too stoned to care. If you are in Amsterdam to party and/or smoke.. then this will be suitable for you.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cthe budget solution\u201d", "Author": "ketchup1981", "ReviewID": "UR68509674", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for one night in April due to the volcano ash cloud which delayed all the flights in that period. The hotel we had stayed in until that time tripled the prices over night as a result of the high demand for rooms in that period of time, with everyone stuck on the ground for what seemed then an indefinite period. We searched for a cheaper alternative, for one more night, as we were short on cash, having in mind that the following morning we had to take the bus back home, which was an extra cost. We went to Damrak Street, from hotel to hotel asking for the price for one room, and we found the cheapest room here, EUR60 for a shared facilities room (the hotel had rooms with private bathrooms too, but they were more expensive). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have breakfast, as we were leaving very early in the morning. The conditions were very basic, and the furniture rather old, but the room was clean enough and so were the shared toilet and shower. There was rat trap in the room, but fortunately it was empty :). However, I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen a more expensive room, with private bathroom, it is possible that it looks better than the one we stayed in, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. The stairs were narrow and pretty hard to climb, especially with luggage. There is no elevator. The staff was polite and helpful. Overall we put aside the drawbacks of this hotel bearing in mind the fact that it was the cheapest we could find in a time when all hotels increased their rates. For the moment, it was the solution to our problem. I would recommend this hotel for someone constrained by the budget; it is somehow an alternative to a hostel.

Although stairs are steep (yes, you get a workout), I found the accomodations satisfactory. I tried to pay with a credit card, and for some reason the 'machine wasn't working', which I found a bit ridiculous. So I had to pay cash. The room was clean as well as the small bath. The walls are paper thin - I don't think they are real walls! And someone tried to come into our room. I think it was a very drunk/stoned person who got confused. The mattresses were also very weird kind of springy, but comfortable enough. Also this review may sound negative, I did enjoy my stay there due to the cleanliness and the location.

A black gentleman came down for breakfast and said good morning. She completely ignored him and when he said hello again.
