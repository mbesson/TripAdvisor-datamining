The iving room was huge, witha nice LCD TV and dvd player and the master bedroom very spacious. I was quite surprised that it was so large and included a screened lanai. The living room was large enough for three people to play Kinect comfortably. The master bedroom, while spacious with a LCD TV, had a huge rainfall walk-in shower but I was somewhat disappointed that it had no jetted tub. The 2nd bd had a full and twin bed and althought not as large as the master, had its own bathroom and LCD TV. The beds were very comfortable and the full kitchen was stocked with anything that you'd need to cook. The villas themselves were in the back of the Marriott Trade Center which seemed odd for you could see all of the trucks unloading and loading and you drove in. But it had plenty to do with the its own pool, two jacuzzis, tennis and basketball courts, kids playground, bbq grills, shuffleboard, chessboard, game room and play area in the lobby. The pool, althought somewhat small and no bar, was very quiet each time we used it. I believe most people walk to the World Trade Center pool which was huge and only a very short walk from the villas. It is the largest free form pool in Orlando and had a restaurant, bar, waterfalls, kiddle play area and pool and a slide. We spent a day there and really enjoyed it. The only downside to the villas was that the free wireless internet didn't work the entire time we were there which wasn't good being that I needed to get some work done. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay, close to the theme parks, very clean, staff was very friendly and I'd definitely stay there again.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSabal Palm for quiet Orlando getaway\u201d", "Author": "bazinga55", "ReviewID": "UR126757580", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Marriott Sabal Palms and found the villa to be spacious, newly decorated and clean.

This newly renovated property is within 2 miles from the Disney entrance and close to shopping, attractions and most all highways. We are staying in a 2 bedroom villa which we find spacious, elegant, excellent floor plan and one of the most desirable properties we have stayed in. The decor is beautifully put together. The staff has been excellent! This resort has an excellent workout center, tennis/basketball courts, swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi and adjacent golf course all of which are maintain beautifully. If this isn't enough you can take an easy 5 min walk to the main property of World Marriott where you will find around 8-10 other pools, shopping, restaurants, bars, spa and bars, which can be accessed and used by Sable Palms occupants. I have stayed in many timeshare properties over the years and this is absolutely one of the best! It reminds me of an upscale property that you might find in the carribbean or Mexico with its' huge swimming pool with waterfalls and bars located poolside and above the falls overlooking the pool. The variety of the shops, restaurants, bars, spa facilities, activities from childrens, adults or family makes this a great find. Although we planned on attending the local tourist attractions upon arrival, we found the property so nice here we didn't leave, other than grocery shopping at one of the many stores located within a mile or two, until after the second day. With the close proximity to the Disney parks it made traveling to and from a breeze. Entry to this property is off World Drive so once you turn out you drive straight into the Disney World properties. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. For those that do not climb steps well I recommend the first floor. Our unit is one the top (2nd) floor and although there are several steps it is not a steep incline but could be a problem for one that has difficulty with steps. Units have full kitchen, full sized washer and dryer, living room, dining room, master bedroom with a phenomenal bathroom/shower (the likes I have never experienced in a rental), a very niced sized screened in patio area. The second bedroom has a full sized and a twin bed with an attached bathroom. Although we didn't use it or the pull-out sofa this unit could have slept 7.

The unit was clean and daily housekeeping services kept it that way. Originally we were assigned a 2nd floor unit overlooking the pool. It was noisy and less private so the front desk graciously switched to another overlooking the pond and fairways, Sitting on the balcony was then most pleasant. The entry road to Sabal Palms winds around the back of the Marriott World Center Hotel and is unattractive. But once there, the grounds are quite nice. The Sabal pool is somewhat plain, but you get use of all of the pools in the development. We spent a restful day at the huge main pool at the hotel.

Our villa had two bedrooms. The first room had two beds in it - it was pretty tight walking around the room. It connected to a bathroom that was nicely furnished. The master bedroom was very large and had a great bathroom with double sinks. The shower was huge, but I found ants in it twice.. I called the front desk after each time and they had someone come up to spray. They didn't seem surprised when I called to complain or apologize so I'm assuming they hear this complaint frequently. The kitchen was a nice size and fully stocked with everything that we needed and then some. There was also a dining room, living room, and screened in balcony with a table and chairs.It was very spacious, but everything was worn down. The rugs had slight stains on them, and the TV would work but you could tell that it was in desperate need of an upgrade. What bothered me the most this trip was the staff. While I didn't have many encounters with them, the ones that I did speak to had no customer service skills. I called room service daily to ask them to bring up extra towels and they never did. I also asked the front desk for a taxi service to use for the weekend and one they gave me was over priced and completely rude (don't use Metro Taxi). The Marriott World Center was a short walk away from Sabal Palms so we used their pools, and restaurants frequently. Everything in that building was lovely and it was a good alternative to the property we were staying at. There are also no shuttles to Disney from here which is pretty ridiculous since it is a short distance away from the parks.

You know what you are getting here, not hoping that you will receive a renovated room. This place is very relaxing. I requested a Villa close to the pool and on the bottom floor, and was granted both requests. The staff is very nice here. The unit looks over the golf course which is very relaxing and we saw the alligator and the girls loved this. There is a full size washer and dryer which is very nice but it is in the kitchen and very loud. The water has an odor while the clothes are washing. I added vinegar to the laundry load and this took care of that. I washed our towels instead of asking for new ones. The vinegar made them very soft. There is no separate bath in mbr if this matters to you. Shower is great! It is walk in , has 2 side sprays and a waterfall spray from above. It was very nice to wash two children at once when they were tired. The steps did worry me but they were not a problem. We would definitely come back here. Did not make full use of the World Centre because we just did not have the time The girls did kids night out and they loved that!. This gave the parents a little down time to just rest. The staff was very very nice. The pool is nice . It is small but it was only us and one other family in it. My daughter was playing with another child and he jumped into the pool and she followed. Be very careful, as the shallow side of the pool has 3 steps all the way accross,so jumping into the pool there is dangerous. Parking was shaded with trees, also a plus.

The room is spacious and modern with all the facilities you would expect from a Marriott vacation club resort. The hotel itself would be fine for most hotels, but having the World Centre on your door step makes it much more enjoyable, We used various facilities, particularly the pools and the basketball courts, for my son. If I was being picky then the 2aspects that I would change are: 1/ The check in time is 4.00pm, which I think could be 2.00pm. 2/ The room was only cleaned once a week by maid service. The rooms did not have maid service daily, however whenever we needed the towels, disshcloths, or nay items refreshed they were done in a very short time, and it was never an issue. As I said I am being a bit picky as overall the hotel was superb, with a fantastic location close to Disney, you can see Planet Holywood from the pool area. The World centre pools are 5mins walk and they are fantastic, especially the main pool and the spa pool ( for a relaxing environment). We used the BBQ unit outside the room on several occasions and it made a pleasant change from eating out or cooking inside. Some nice looking restaurants on site, but we did not eat in any of them, but we did eat in the food court, which was very reasonably priced for a 5* hotel.

Close by is also a Walmart and other off Disney property restaurants. The resort is part of the larger Marriott property, but has it's own check-in desk, pool, workout center. But you still have access to the huge pool area, workout center, restaurants, etc that are part of the Marriott hotel - which is huge. The hotel has restaurants, bar areas, an arcade, etc. It's pretty much setup for large conventions. There are also at least 2 pools, and a huge workout facility. The condo's are a bit of a tedious drive through the Marriott property to get to. A good trade-off for the long drive is that it is very quiet. Master bathroom is huge. The master bathroom, however, doesn't have a tub. It had a strange shower room configuration (I guess some people would like that?). Took us a while to figure out which knobs and dials turned on what in the shower. Second bedroom is smaller with a sliding door to the second bathroom. The facilities that are part of the condo are small and pretty plain. We didn't use any of these as those that were part of the hotel were much better. Only inconvenience we had was accessing the workout center that was part of the larger Marriott hotel. Even though the workout center was just next door to the condo's, the key were given wouldn't work for it. Because the condo check-in building was closed early in the morning, I had to walk a very long way twice early in the morning just to get a key to the workout center.

This resort is nestled behind the Marriott World Center so you have access to the wonderful pools and amenities there as well as the Sabal Palms pool and recreation area.

The updated kitchen was fully stocked with the wares one needs for a week. It was nice to have those kitchen conveniences as well as the washer and dryer. The beds were comfortable and we enjoyed the layout of the unit. Our only slight disappointment was the inability to get the master bedroom very dark at night. The shower has a wall of glass block which allows the porch lights to shine right in the room. I like a very dark room so that was not ideal for us but we were fine nonetheless. Also, we were on an upper level room (there are only 2 floors) and in our unit, there are 2 steps from the foyer to the living area as well as 2 steps from the master bath to the master bedroom.

Comfortable, serviceable, and quiet (pretty empty actually), but just OK overall. We would probably not stay at the Sabal Palms again. It was rather small for a 2-bedroom villa, and the age really showed. Mirror tiles on the living room wall...old furnishings...applicances in poor condition...plastic table surface on outside deck drooping so much (from the heat) that it looked like the top of a mushroom. Marriott is not investing any money into this resort to replace old fixtures; they just keep trying to repair them. Our dishwasher leaked, we called it in, the repair man came and knocked around on it for about 5 minutes (while it was running) and left. The next day it began leaking again in the exact same spot.

But we always end up returning to Sabal Palms because we like the privacy and set-up of the villas. Unlike other properties where the buildings are almost apartment like (several stories high, with outside hallways running the length of the buildings to access your room doors.......and consisting of LOTS OF NOISE), the Sabal Palms villas are two stories high and you have only one private entryway to your villa. We have always liked that feature. You have a beautiful pool and two hot tubs right there at the villas (and it's often near-empty.....we sometimes had it to ourselves!). You also have the huge pool to go to over at the World Center (walking distance from Sabal) and a REALLY gorgeous pool which sits right behind the huge World Center Pool (this is our favorite pool........it is just lovely, with palm trees in the middle, and a gigantic hot tub). After staying here 3 times, the negatives aren't many, but I do have to mention them. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do yourselves a favor and be sure to get an upstairs villa, if all possible!! This year, we were in a downstairs one, and the noise level from the upstairs neighbors was just unbearable. They had a small child who ran, jumped, pounded, banged on the floors, furniture.........it drove us to near insanity!! LOL We've stayed in the upstairs units before, and it's nothing but peace and quiet. The screened-in porch is quite lovely, but at times, you'll notice small rips or holes in the screens (nothing major).......those things should be repaired in a timely manner (last year we called about a rip in a screen, and the maintenance crew never came to repair it, so we were disappointed in that). As I've stated, there ARE more modern and fancy timeshare places in the Orlando area, but you can't beat Sable Palms for privacy and the beautiful swimming pools that you have access to. We'll definitely go back again.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "collingswood, nj", "Title": "\u201cReally enjoyed my stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "born2travel97", "ReviewID": "UR8500337", "Content": "My wife,three children, a couple of their friends and I stayed here for 9 days after a very long drive from jersey. When we originally booked the hotel online the pictures looked a little out dated but once we arrived and opened the door the place was very clean and spacious. We had a 2nd story condo with sliding doors in the living room and master bedroom that led to the screened balcony overlooking a beautiful golf course. The master bed room was huge and had its own shower and jacuzzi with everything working. The Kitchen was spacious and well equipped. This unit had a decent sized pool just outside but we enjoyed the much bigger pool just outside the main marriot tower .There is a Starbucks and a couple of restauraunts here also. We didn't eat there, their menus looked pricey. No sweat though there are plenty of other places to choose from nearby. Very close to Disney and outlet shopping areas.(less than 2 miles) We really enjoyed it. Our stay was very comfortable and yes we will stay here again.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucaramanga", "Title": "\u201cAwful house keeping.\u201d", "Author": "Unsatisfied_46", "ReviewID": "UR8029654", "Content": "We stayed there one week, Dec 17~24.

The main building is huge, and has Florida's largest pool. The grounds are gorgeous. There are several satellite properties on the grounds, and Sabal Palms is located in the back - not too far of a walk over to the main building. I was a little skeptical after some of the reviews, but our 2 bedroom- 2 bath villa was very nice. It was not new, but kept in good condition, and very clean. The staff is very nice. Very close to Disney, although this was just a trip for relaxing and not sight seeing for us. Sabal Palm's pool was never crowded, probably because most guests are at Disney during the day. It was like we had our own private pool. Our screened-in porch was spacious, and nice to sit on in the evening. The main Marriott Resort is something to see - food court and shops, beautiful lobby. Very impressive property overall with lovely scenery.
