We didn't golf so I can't comment on the course but it was probably good. Only two \"complaints\" (and they hardly qualify as complaints!): the little golf carts they use to service the units seem to buzz around the property incessantly and are quite noisy and they didn't bend the rules about the 4:00 check in time for anyone even though we all arrived that day for a 5:00 rehearsal and it would have been nice to be able to check in and not have to rush to get changed and run out the door.

I lived in the Phoenix area in the 1990's. My family hasn't returned there - together - in over 10 years. Boy, have things changed! My husband and I were searching for an affordable place, close to the city, that was \"family friendly (we have a six-year-old son).\" After researching private rentals, resorts (including the AZ Grand)....for what seemed to be an eternity....we found the Legacy. At first glance, I was concerned about how \"family friendly\" a golf resort would be, and I remember this area wasn't the best years ago...I searched and searched online and couldn't really find any \"totally bad\" reviews about this place - some people mentioned noise issues....some comments about rude staff....and the other biggie were complaints from singles or seniors about all the kids around the pool, resort, etc.. - THOSE reviews SOLD THE PLACE for us! I wanted a rental where our entire family could feel comfortable - including our child. He's not some out-of-control nutcase - but he does like to jump and swim in pools...and, sometimes, he can get excitedly loud....so I wasn't interested in staying somewhere that frowned upon children. After looking at hundreds of photos online (yes - the pool IS that awesome), video's, etc., we booked a one-bedroom suite. When we arrived, it was apparent the area had changed A LOT in a decade. The grounds and area surrounding the resort were beautiful and well-manicured! My allergies were actually going nuts from all the flowers and trees around the grounds. From the get-go, we were greeted by nothing but friendly, helpful staff. The concierge hit us with the \"time share\" pitch once - which we declined...and we weren't bothered with it again. Our request for a second floor unit was honored and we were located in Casita 6 - which was a bit away from the main check-in area and pool. I kind of liked that - honestly, the units close to the pool seemed too \"busy.\" If you are interested in solitude, I definitely wouldn't recommend staying in them (and they are more expensive). The pool opens at 7 a.m....complete with music and lots of boisterous, festive sun bathers. Casita 6 was the farthest from the main area....and it still was only about a five minute walk up to the pool and main, common areas. THE CONDO LAYOUT: Just an FYI - each building seems to house four one-bedroom units (two upstairs, two downstairs) and four jr. suites. If you rent a one-bedroom, your unit will be on either end of the building - sharing only one common wall (if you are on the bottom, you share the ceiling, too). The jr. suites are wedged in the middle....hence, if you get one of the jr's - especially on the lower floor - I could see how they could be rather noisy (all walls, except for the floor, are shared). SO, if you want a quieter experience?? Rent the one-bedroom, upstairs....or, at the very least, request a jr. on the top floor! Oh, and building 12 is the only \"smoking\" building - something to keep in mind if you smoke OR are allergic to smoke... The one-bedroom was beyond perfect! Over 800 sq. feet with a patio, full kitchen, dining room table, washer/dryer, stall shower AND HUGE Jacuzzi tub. Everything was neat and clean. The fold out couch accommodated our son perfectly....and the king-size bed in the bedroom was gigantic. We had some issue's with the Wi-Fi - the front staff was responsive and helpful...but I don't think the problem was on their end. I would recommend bringing a LAN cable to wire into the internet. Our room had one in it. Housekeeping came every day - including Easter! We called a couple times for extra towels and tp - the response was beyond speedy. Although I am not a golfer, the course looked gorgeous! They really take care in landscaping this place. The pool was the best I've seen at a resort...maybe ever (and I actually enjoyed hanging out there all day - anyone out there with kids knows what I'm talkin' about....you get tired of spending hours are the same-old, dull, square-tangular hotel pools...and the kids always wanna hit the pool). In addition to the main pool you see in the photos, there was a small, circular \"child\" pool (only 1.5 ft. deep)....it was about the size of a Jacuzzi. Speaking of Jacuzzi\u2019s - they have two: one for everyone and one for adults only (in a separate, quiet area). Pool also features a giant-sized chess set, ping-pong table, bar and grill area, towel service an lots of seating. FOR THOSE CONSIDERING THE AZ GRAND: About mid-week, we got word from the Legacy that the pool would be closed one day for maintenance. Of course, we were disappointed...however, the Legacy worked out an arrangement with the nearby AZ Grand Resort; guests could use their pool for the day. I was actually happy about this as we looked at the Grand as a possible place to stay (we were intrigued by the water park and reviews...however, the price was a bit out of our range and the room looked small....so we went with the Legacy). We showed up at the Sedona pool at the Grand....and we COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW DUMPY this place was in comparison to the Legacy!!! I was so happy I didn't shell out $$$big bucks to stay there. The Sedona pool was very small, we couldn't even find a place to sit....and outdated. We actually SNUCK INTO the Oasis water park (am I bad?) - and it reminded me of Disney World....just totally busy and hectic.....no seats....disgruntled staff....yeah, the Oasis water park looked neat - but you know what??? After an hour in the wave pool, my son found us and asked if we could go back \"home\" to the Legacy because he was tired of the place. I was shocked by the Grand - when I lived in Phoenix, it was known as the Pointe at South Mountain. If was a premier resort BACK THEN. Except for the water park - and the $$ fancier price - it still looks like The Pointe...only 20+ years older with no updates. I know they have added on in area's....but, for what they want a night?? I was less than impressed.... Let's see....what else..... They Legacy did have daily planned activities (crafts, hikes, games) - something for everyone. We didn't have a chance to attend any, though. There is also a playground, on-site restaurant, bb-que area, shuffle board and tennis. Lots of attractions nearby (Gallagher\u2019s has GREAT food. It's at the corner of 32nd and Baseline...travel through the Grand, up 48th St. and visit South Mountain Preserve for ALL LEVELS of desert hikes. The preserve is near the Pointe's/Grands golf course - you'd never even know it's there if you weren't looking for it....and there are miles and miles of serene trails. Another great attraction is the sunset \"steak run\" horseback ride through South Mountain. Even if you HATE horses, you have to try this. You saddle up and ride through the park at dusk, to a steakhouse. After dinner, you ride back through the park at night - you can't beat the views! And, the Desert Botanical Gardens and Papago Park are a must see....also, on the off chance you get a rainy day and need to go somewhere indoors with the kids, try Amazing Jakes (Google it - too much to list)). The only \"complaint\" I really had was one morning, the city of Phoenix turned off the water to our unit....which was a little inconvenient....but that's about it...and the water was back on within an hour or two. SO, if you are a family thinking this \"golf resort\" won't welcome your kids??? THINK AGAIN! BOOK IT!! It's an awesome value....so much so that I'll be returning in August (for a rate less than $80 a night for a one-bedroom?!?!?! GREAT!). IF you are a single or a senior looking for a quiet get-away?? The grounds and golf course are lovely. Just be aware that there are lots of kids staying at this place....you will be outnumbered :) If you're looking for complete solitude and are bothered by boisterous vacation-goers - you may wanna try Sedona, Sun City or Fountain Hills.... I will never stay anywhere else - my family would kill me!", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Littleton, CO", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay\u201d", "Author": "medako", "ReviewID": "UR127742204", "Content": "We needed a place as a \"home base\" for our stay in Arizona and this was a perfect choice.

The course was not crowded and had a mixture of those walking and using carts. We were disappointed that they would not let guests walk the course unless they were golfing. The resort is in a rather sparse neighbourhood without a lot of areas to walk so it would have been nice to walk the course at sunset. Having said that the ammenities of the resort were great.

The unit's themselves (we had a one bedroom unit) had a very nice layout with more than enough space. The bathroom and tub area were separate and the jacuzzi tub was a nice touch.

For starters, we were surprised to find this nice of a large resort on this side of Phoenix. We agree it being close to a lot of conveniences but did not see this much of an advantage between being located on the Northern side of Phoenix/Scottsdale. There is definitely a difference in the \u2018curb appeal\u2019 of surrounding neighborhoods! Our 1-bedroom unit turned out to be generously sized with many conveniences. D\u00e9cor is definitely more dated than other 4 star resorts we stayed in.

The food is standard bar bistro fare. We also ate at the Russler's Roost just up the mountain from the resort. That was an experience. Come hungery as servings are generous. As the name suggests it is primarily steaks, barbaque etc. Each of us had something different and all of it was excellent.

The rooms themselves have a few nice \"bonus\" entities: dishwasher with soap; kitchen stocked with dishes, blender and toaster; laundry (bring your own soap); coffee (single pot serving)) Other than dated linens, my only complaint about the room was the sound of the air conditioning unit: it's difficult to complain about the a/c because when it's 105, you're thankful you have it but still, it is VERY loud. and must run all night long. Other than that, the room is certainly not luxurious but for the price it's clean, has a nice shower/tub, multiple sinks, DVDs player. Now the not so good: The pool area. While the area itself is clean, it is severaly lacking in umbrellas or cabanas for shade. We just couldn't believe it. The only umbrellas are at the tables. They seriously need to add umbrella stands by every 4-5 chairs. Plus, they need to have the workers (who just sit there anyway) occassionally wet down the concrete. It was so hot, I fried the bottom of my feet just trying to get to the pool; unbelievably hot. The other pool complaint: there are no restrooms by the pool. you had to leave the area. Not very convenient; especially for families. Overall: the location is great.

We were pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the accommodations when we arrived for our stay. Location: Pretty close to the airport, about 10 minutes away. Very easy to find. When driving there, we felt a tad bit apprehensive because it looked like we were going to the middle of nowhere and there were some sketchy areas. But, once you get to the resort's entrance, it looks well placed and taken care of. Gas was close by, but I would not recommend going to the gas station that is closest to the resort. We were approached twice by people asking for money. Check in: Fast, painless, and pleasant customer service. We were very well-received and given info packets regarding the resort. No problems here. They do put a $100 hold on your card, which is returned after checkout when room is found to be ok. Hotel Room: To our surprise, it turned out to be a suite with a king sized bed! There was a sitting area (with couch, coffee table, breakfast table), studio kitchen (with sink, dishwasher, stovetop, coffee maker, fridge, cabinets stocked with dishware/cups), and washer/dryer. I am sure I am forgetting other things in the kitchen. The room/bathroom was impeccably clean; although when we were about to check out, when I went to wash out a cup in the sink, I removed the drying rack in the sink and saw large chunks of rotting food stuff underneath it. It looked like it had been there a long time. But, that was the ONLY issue with cleanliness. Not enough to make me write a bad review. The bed was pretty comfortable (more on the firm side). I would not rank it to be plush and comfy, where you feel you never want to leave the bed. The sheets, coverlet, and pillows were all in great condition. Pillows aren't super supportive, so if you are picky about your pillow being supportive, bring your own. The bathroom was spacious with a sliding door that separated the toilet/shower/sink from another sink. The water heated up in less than a couple of minutes. Warning: if you are a tall person (i.e. 6') the shower stall/bathtub could pose an issue for you getting into it. My fiance is 6\" and had to duck to get in the glass/metal door frame every time. Soaps provided are alright. Towels were great! The air conditioning worked very well and seemed to have no problem cooling down the room from the 100 degree heat. The TV was not a flatscreen, but it did have a DVD player, which is a good option to have for longer stays. Good assortment of channels (more than usual). Free internet is nice as well. Another warning: Wall are very, very thin! You could hear doors slamming/opening/shutting and loud families in other rooms. Overall the room for us was a 7.5/10 On-site Restaurant: Ate there for breakfast and dinner. Prices from breakfast average about $7-9 and dinner being over $12 for entrees. Not very impressive, but serves the purpose of giving you something to eat if you are not willing or too tired to travel to a restaurant off site. There's a little bit of everything, but it is all mediocre. Good selection of beers. Pool: Did not go, but was very busy! Checkout-easy and fast. Customer service was fantastic at this hotel. They even called and left messages to offer suggestions of what to do while staying at the resort and for deals/discounts at other resorts owned by the company.

Shaun at the front desk was maybe the nicest guy I have met in customer service in a long time. The folks at the golf course were great. I guess my only complaint was that tee times seemed to be on top of each other, or perhaps they tried to squeeze in a corporate contest, because we felt rushed by groups behind us and were waiting over 15 minutes at each hole for 12 guys in front of us by the time we got to the 12th hole. We gave up and went home, so we lost out on that. I wanted to complain to see if we could get some $$ back but my husband said it probably would not matter.

Our first was nine years ago for the Fiesta Bowl. On that occasion we had a one-bedroom King suite, and based on that stay, we chose The Legacy for our stay for the National Championship game. Although we had a King-Studio suite this stay, the room was just as comfortable. The washer and dryer in the room were an unexpected bonus, the mini-fridge was larger than expected, and the bathroom had two vanities, one inside the bathroom/shower area, and one in an alcove adjacent to the bathroom. The balcony was great, and even though we chose not to upgrade to the golf course view, it was still quiet and pretty. One medium-size criticism is the noise from the heater/ air conditioning unit. It was pretty noisy. A light sleeper will be woken up any time it turns on. The only nitpicky criticisms I have are these: The information on how to use the phones was outdated; the room guide and telephone both said to push the messages button to retrieve your messages, however, you actually had to dial a number that you could only find if you called the front desk and asked for it. The other super-nitpicky thing is the shower door arrangement. The glass doors had an knob on one door to slide it open from the inside, but if you opened that door, you stepped out between the toilet and the tub, not at the other end, where the actual exit is. As I said, those are really nitpicky things, and the location, near baseline, easy access to freeways but with a tucked away oasis feel to the resort more than made up for it. Staff was always friendly and helpful, rooms were very clean, and resort was well maintained. Quick tip: From car rental area of Sky Harbor, get to Sky Harbor Circle, and look for I-10 East/Tuscon.

First of all, it is close to the airport in a somewhat central location in terms of the valley. Its a quick drive from the airport, very close ASU and less than a mile from the interstate that can get you started on your way to anywhere in the valley. When you drive from the airport you go through some pretty rough areas and as you get close to the resort you begin to wonder if the resort photos were for real or not. Once you get to the resort you will see it is an impressive, well-maintained complex, just like in the photos on the various websites. I've stayed in both the small one-bedroom and large one-bedroom. I wouldn't stay in the smaller unit with more than 2 travelers. Its very nice, but definitely an efficiency apartment type set up - like a nice hotel room that has a kitchen. All the rooms I've ever stayed in have been very clean and comfortable. The pool area is also impressive with lots of chairs and lounges to hang out. They have two different hot tubs and a large heated pool. They have a pool side bar where you can order a drink and they can also get you food delivered from the restaurant. All of the pool staff I've dealt with have been very friendly and helpful - which is pretty much a standard for the resort as a whole. The golf course practice area is outstanding, you can work on whatever part of your game you want to with ample space. The golf course itself is a somewhat challenging track from the tips and very well maintained. For such a nice course, its never been crowded. I've always just walked up and never had a problem getting a round in. One negative aspect of the resort is that the fitness center has some out-dated equipment and is ALWAYS crowded. Fortunately, there is an Anytime Fitness right around the corner that you can get a short term membership too for pretty cheap that is a great set up for whatever type of fitness interests you have. Another potential problem is that parking spaces can be hard to come by if you return late at night. It also seemed like there were a lot of young kids in the main hot tub in the pool area when I went there which was awkward especially considering there is a perfectly good wading pool a short walk away. If you are looking to travel to the Phoenix area, want to stay at a resort with a kitchen, like to play golf and want a location convenient to all points of the valley then The Legacy is a great option.

Nice cozy informal place, with half price appetizers and Margaritas and well drinks from 4:00 til 6:00. The grill is located right by the golf course and had outdoor dining. If you don't eat during the happy hour the prices are a little on the high side. Hot dog on the course was $7.50 (including chips or cookie) a little pricey for my taste. The pool was very nice with a nice view of the surrounding mountains. They have a grill and bar there as well which is convenient. There are daiiy activities but we did not use. There are tennis courts, volleyball and shuffleboard courts. Easy access to the 10 to get most anywhere in the area. I highly recommend this resort for singles or families. If you're a time share owner, your golf rate is reduced by 20%. A larger discount for owners would be nice. The living room furniture in the unit was not very comfortable for watching tv.

Booked the hotel through hotwire, so it was a reasonable price. The grounds and facilities are decent enough, check-in was pretty smooth and there were no major complaints. However, the hotel is a fair distance away from the interstate. Keep that in mind if you're staying for just a night or passing through. If you're staying for a few days and playing golf, the proximity of the interstate probably isn't a big deal. In addition to being a distance away from the interstate, the place was a little difficult to locate, its behind some small farms, etc., and not in a place where you'd expect to find a hotel. Aside from the location, this place wasn't really anything special. The decor was a little dated and cheesy looking, and you can tell its a timeshare golf condo rather than a hotel room. We didn't use any of the kitchen facilities since we were just staying for a night. They were installing something in the room next to ours and there was some noise from drilling and hammering while we were staying there, which was fortunately not during hours when we were sleeping. Also our doorbell was randomly rang at 6 AM and no one was there when we got up and looked...since there isn't any real security and anyone can get on the grounds, we were a little suspcious of that. All in all, not terrible for a night's stay, but nothing special. I think it would be more appealing if you were staying a few nights or using the facility for a golf vacation, since its not too close to the interstate.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrie, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFabulous place to relax and play golf\u201d", "Author": "Nikedog999", "ReviewID": "UR81784852", "Content": "This was our second visit to the the Legacy Golf resort in Phoenix, Arizona.

In general, this is a nice resort with great people and we had a pretty good time! Arrived early at the resort...check-in was a bit slow but smooth. I got a bit terse initially 'cause I called a few times and requested a \"second floor unit;\" of course, we were given a ground floor unit. My husband and I were told to check back in an hour or so and we would be given an upper unit (which did happen). My husband and I stayed in Unit 1212 (I think)...first building, second level, unit 12...a great location. With a view of the parking lot (no biggie) our unit was clean, well-appointed, odor free, air-conditioned (temps in Phoenix reached 103 on 2 days), comfortable. While the inside of the units could DEFINITELY use a face lift (I think some of the units are undergoing renovations) and new furniture, our unit was alright. No flat screen t.v. (I don't watch t.v. but husband does, of course) but FREE direct line and wireless internet, a really appreciated touch! Small half fridge, electric burners, very limited counter space, limited cabinet space, small-ish kitchen sink, definitely okay as a partial kitchen. I wouldn't plan on cooking big meals in the kitchen 'cause it really is only a partial. Our bed and bed area were great! Bed-very comfortable, pillows-old, thinner foam (not so great but no biggie). Nice touch is the outer and inner sinks in the bathroom/shower area. Good closet space but limited dresser space (in studio we had the drawers of the t.v. armoire as dresser space). My husband sunned on our patio each morning. Air conditioner regulated without difficulty. Shower was great. Everything in room worked. No problems at all! Pool area was actually very nice! A LOT of kids and some rough-housing by teens but ample space and never a problem finding loungers even when arriving at 2:30 pm in the afternoon! Drinks by the pool bar were great! Food could be delivered upon request. Lots and lots of parking space! While the area around the Legacy is NOT the best part of Phoenix, my husband and I always felt safe returning late at night and walking from our car to our unit. The main highway to and from other parts of Phoenix and Arizona (Rte 10) is about a 10 minute ride down Baseline from this resort...convenient. However, the general area is not great and there is absolutely NOTHING within reasonable walking distance...so come prepared! Courtyards and property in general are very well kept, well-lit, gated...very pretty...do not miss the manicured ROSEMARY BUSHES that make the courtyards so fragrant!!!! Concierge gal, Helen was very very accommodating and welcoming. Set us up with a few perks after we agreed to attend the standard 90 minute timeshare presentation. Desk people were wonderful. Timeshare gal got testy with my husband and I over a minor misunderstanding. Overall, we were unleashed from the timeshare presentation much more easily than any others I have attended before...albeit we were practically thrown out-smile. Two BIG positives I MUST mention: Because DH & I missed our flight to Phoenix, we also missed our rental car date. Without an auto for two days (you REALLY need one at this resort), we ate at Trail's End Grill several times. While the food is just okay, the bartender, Tony and the waitstaff, Felicia COULD NOT HAVE BEEN NICER!!!! Husband and I had some FUN times at the Trail's End...great martinis, too! Tony & Felicia gave us TONS of useful information about Phoenix and the surrounding environs...very very helpful! Hugs all around when we left! Second thing...the front desk and housekeeping staff could NOT have been kinder, nicer and more accommodating! I realized I was without a shaver and I wanted to jump into the pool upon arrival. No problem-within 5 minutes of asking at the front desk, housekeeping arrived with several shavers and shaving cream. On another occasion, husband and I wanted more coffee-5 minutes, housekeeping was there with the coffee pods. I HAVE NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF RESPONSE AT A RESORT!!!! MY ONLY COMPLAINT...listening to the couple in the next unit having raunchy, dramatic sex morning and night (most days). WALLS ARE TRULY PAPER THIN because we not only heard them having sex but we could hear their conversations as if they were in the same room as my husband and I. This issue was a bit upsetting to me 'cause I really do not like listening to other people's conversations, let alone their sexual howls. I would not hesitate to recommend the Legacy Golf Resort to others. However, when I return to Phoenix (DH & I will 'cause we are hoping to semi-retire to Tucson someday soon), I will probably try another resort, just for variety!

As a timeshare resort, it's a step down from the Starwood and Marriott properties I already own. I don't golf and it's nowhere close to the things I would want to see here. However, it was better than some hotels I've stayed at and it was a very good value for the $52/night rate. The good: Property is large with nicely kept grounds and plenty of parking.

The not so good: Check-in lobby is underwhelming - small space, only one person checking people in at 6 pm. Have to get a parking pass from another person who pitches the timeshare tour. No room service. Not set up for business workers; small round table that doesn't leave much room for more than a laptop and the ice bucket.

Internet worked fine and was free so my husband and I were able to keep up with work committments that we just couldn't avoid. This resort is on a golf course that is known as being very nice according to area guides. We don't golf so can't attest to that. However, we did enjoy our view of the course with palm trees and mountains in the background. We especially enjoyed watching the golfing groups deal with the sand trap. It was quite entertaining to hear them banter with eachother. I did notice that many of the rooms do not overlook the course, so if a scenic view is important to you then keep that in mind. Also, our suite had older TVs(not flat screens). Was told that the TVs are in the process of being replaced with large flat screens. The ones we had worked well and I didn't miss a flat screen.

We were on a corner unit on the second floor so maybe that helped, but never heard anything from neighboring units and they were occupied. Loved the pool. Yes lots of little one by the kiddie pool, but if that is bothersome to you, there is plenty of area to get away from them and still enjoy the sun and water. The staff at the pool bar was wonderful. All were very friendly including the \"towel person\". They asked several times if we needed anything, and provided great service when we ordered drinks and food. The concierge, Joyce, was wonderful. She helped us choose a Grand Canyon Tour that matched what we were looking for and we were extremely happy with the service and our guide, Rich, was excellent. He informed us on everything from Navajo and natural history and to current events in Arizona. I can't possibly come up with enough superlatives to do him justice. We told Joyce we were interested in seeing Sedona and she recommended that we take a day trip on our own rather than pay for a tour. She outlined our route on a map, recommended the sights we wouldn't want to miss, areas to shop, and places to eat. We had such a wonderful day. She offered to help us get tickets to some of the Spring Training Games but we already had tickets for the 2 games we wanted to attend. We never did have the opportunity to eat at the resort's restaurant so can't comment on it or the retaurant staff specifically, but any other staff we dealt with were friendly, accomodating, and professional. There was a daily message on our phone asking us if we would be interested in attending the timeshare presentation. No calls that rang through, just the message. So I didn't feel pressured or even bothered. Just figured they were doing their jobs by asking if we were interested. We loved the Legacy, Phoenix, and Arizona.

Driving there from the airport, the neighborhood was a bit sketchy. But it seemed like once you hit a block from the entrance, it was a whole new neighborhood. Good location to drive to a grocery store, Wal-Mart, Target, restuarants, etc. We stayed in a Studio Suite, which I was told by my aunt that it was quite big compared to other resorts that they've stayed in. The first 2 nights our room was joined with my aunt and uncle who had the 1 bedroom suite, open the adjoining door and viola you have a \"2 bedroom suite\". My uncle reserved a room that was handicapped accessible, only problem was that the 1 bedroom that was their side had the jacuzzi tub (no shower at all) and our studio suite had the shower. It ended up working out ok but recommend that if you need handicap access or prefer a shower instead of a bath that you make sure you get it. The rooms were very clean and organized. We had a kitchenette which ok, just needed a little bit more counter space, the coffee maker, toaster, cutting board took it all up. Free internet was a bonus. We did play the golf course one time. Which was a beautiful course. Challenging and well maintained. We played it after it was just overseeded so the golf carts were only usable on the golf path. Couldn't take them out on the course, which was a bit time consuming, unless you hit the ball right next to the cart path. The grounds were absolutely beautiful and well taken care of. Not a blade of grass out of place. I only have a couple of complaints. First, we had a tee time set for 1:32pm. We went to check in at 1:00, said that we couldn't check in until 4:00pm. So, had to go through luggage and everything in the trunk of the car to get golf shoes, clothes, etc. Which made us late to our tee time. By the time we got to our golf cart ready to golf and drive to the first tee we were 15 minutes late. We got yelled at by the guy keeping everyone on track for their tee times. We pulled up and the first thing he says is, \"I've been looking for you for 15 minutes!!\" I wanted to say, well if we could've checked in and got dressed in a room and not out of a car we would be here on time, but I didn't. Second, we were on the first floor so we had people above us. The floors are paper thin, no joke. The first night I got woke up at 4:00am with someone running upstairs, sounded like a herd of elephants running, my aunt on the other side of the suite got woke up to it too. The third night the room right above us woke me up at 2:00am to the sound of a squeeking bed, use your imagination on what was going on. I heard it all. The fourth night got woke up at 5:30am to the same squeeking bed and sounds. All I could think of was, \"Do these people ever sleep???\" Third, the washing machine. Ours was a washer/dryer all in one. It's not a dryer, but a \"condensing dryer\". It doesn't dry your clothes, but rather spins them in somewhat heat, but not dry heat. They are still wet when you take them out. And the machine is loud!! Terribly loud. Also, there is no detergent, bleach or softener given to you. They had \"Palmolive\" dishwasing soap to which we had no dishwasher. I asked the maid service for detergent and she said that they didn't have any. I don't understand not having detergent if you offer a washing machine. I would stay here again knowing these things.

A very good friend of ours would be joining us a few days later in his own suite (not on hotwire). At the time we requested to be situated close to each other and of course, were told no problem. When we arrived in town we went a day early to make sure that we were still able to have our friend stay in the same block with us, again, told no problem. We realized when seeing the condos in real life that our friend would want to be close to the pool, if we could be guaranteed he would be placed there too, pay for the upgrade. Keeping in mind this was all the day before our actual check in. We decided to pay the upgrade but prior to doing so was promised our friend, who was travelling with us would be guaranteed a spot in the block with us. The next day upon arrival (told to come early) we were given a map and a choice of two suites, we chose, went back to the front desk where they handed us our card keys and told us if we had not heard from them by 3 o\u2019clock to go ahead and move in. We arrived a little after 3:00 and packed all of our suitcases and bags up the stairs to our suite, only to find the card keys we were given did not work. Myself and our two teenage girls stood watching our bags in 112 degree heat for almost an hour while my husband went back to the front desk, only to find we didn't exist and that room was given to someone else. Fortunately my husband remembered the name of the woman helping us, to no avail, she had left for the day. Finally, over an hour later, it was sorted out and we were allowed to move in. This ordeal was of great concern to us as it was obvious by the buzz in the line up at the front desk, that others were suffering from their promised rooms also been given away.We confirmed once again when our friend was due to arrive in a few days that he would be in the block with us, once again, we were told no problem. On our way back to the room we ensued a violent argument in the parking lot by a group of people that seemed to have hundreds with them overtaking the pool/parking lot/ and barbeque area, the noise from that party went on all night. The following night we entered the pool area, my husband was carrying a plastic cup and my son was carrying a can of soda. The attendant, who knew nothing about what was in the cup met us at the gates and rudely gestured for us to turn around and leave, he never asked what was in the cup, but being a highschool principal, my husband assumed bringing in soda/cup was against the rules and put it in the garbage. Once in the pool area, we realized almost every single party in there were drinking 'something' out of cups, bottles etc and the bar was closed so that couldn't be it. We pointed this out to the attendant who basically brushed it off as whatever he says goes. When my husband and son noticed that the ping pong paddles were being returned they asked to sign them out whereupon the attendant said no. It was 9:20pm and no where near closing time, finally, feeling very uncomfortable with his strange bullying we left. The next night there was a different attendant whom I spoke with as our girls were too nervous to go back to the pool. He said that the other guy was known to act inappropriately. Well, the inevitable occurred, our friend arrived, we went to check him in where he paid in full. He was given his card key in our block and told to come back after the room was cleaned at 3:00pm. After 3pm we helped him move his bags to the promised room to once again find the keys did not work..once again back to the front desk and once again told that they had no idea who gave the keys and there was no guarantees on being given a specific room. When we spoke with the manager to explain how we would never have paid for the upgrade to the block beside the pool had we not been promised our friend to be in the block we would have stayed over in the original room offered. When asked what we thought she should do, we said at least to be compensated for the upgrade we would never have sought, not being close to our friend and she decided everything we were promised about our stay had been given to us. There is actually many more smaller and petty complaints but these were just the main ones, It is safe to say we will not be back.

When I checked in for golf the next morning they said the discount did not apply because they had a discounted rate for the weekend. It is fine, but if you have to pay the same as anyone playing off the street then there is no discount for staying there so stop saying there is. The major disappointment was at the pool. The pool itself was fine but the staff working was not acceptable. The bar staff was ambivalent at best. I presented the discount card when first ordered and they said wait till I close out the tab. I did and didn't check the bill closely - my mistake. When I checked out at the end of the stay, I double checked the bill and found out that they had not taken the discount and to add insult to injury there is a 20% gratuity that is automatically added. There was no warning about the gratuity and they even have a tip jar out. That is unethical and unacceptable. The rest of the staff was not much better.

The rooms were spacious but dated (not a big deal for us), the grounds as immaculate as the course, parking, yes it was a challenge after coming back from dinner out we had to park a short distance away, so what, you get to walk your dinner off and it's a beautiful evening, I could think of worst things. The Angels of Anaheim where there during our stay and that was a huge bonus for our boys. The pool is nice but would have been nicer if they had a quiet pool, they certainly have the room there and it was quite a zoo with all the kids. They did have a pool bar and music.

She offered us a 1 bedroom right then that was available , or we could wait until 4:00pm for a golf course view. We chose to check-in right then. We were very happy with our condo. It was furnished nicely , very clean , huge 2 person jacuzzi tub in the bathroom , full size refrigerator and appliances and a lovely view. The washer and dryer are always appreciated , as was the free internet service for my laptop in the condo. We were on the second floor [ all casitas have 2 floors ], a short walk from the tennis courts , bbq's , shuffleboard and clubhouse and pool. They have golf carts to take you to the clubhouse and back if you are not up for the walk. There are not elevators , so if you don't want to climb stairs , request a bottom floor. We preferred the top floor because the bottom floor patios are open to the lawn areas , and didn't mind the stairs at all. We had a slight problem with the maid coming at 9am to clean and we told her to come back at 11:00am after we left for the day. She didn't come back , but when we called housekeeping they brought clean towels and removed our garbage. Not a big deal. We had massages one morning at the spa [ which isn't really a \"spa\" ] and they were the best massages we've ever had !! Fabulous !! Marilyn and Michelle are excellent. The restaurant was good on the 1 day we had lunch there. You can eat inside or out on the patio overlooking the golf course. Large portions. We really enjoyed the pool area with the bar , chess , ping pong and jacuzzi. The view was beautiful from the pool and from our condo. We got a phone call each morning [ but the phone didn't ring to disturb us , it just lit up our MESSAGE light ] inviting us to a time share presentation , activities for the day and the weather. Not a problem , since we told them when we arrived that we were not interested in a presentation on this trip. They didn't bother us again . There are quite a few stores and strip malls a mile away on Baseline. Fry's grocery store , Target , Wal-Mart , fast foods , drug stores. Very convenient. There is a lot of parking , but when the resort is sold out , you may have to park a short distance from your room , rather than right in front of your entrance.

We had a large kitchen with separate eating area, a small living room area, a very large master suite with nice large master bath. In addition, we had a separate bedroom with two beds, small bathroom and kitchenette. We had two laundry areas and two patios looking out on the golf course. The bathroom had marble vanities and the master bath had a jetted tub. It was not the Ritz, but it was very nice. The grounds were well kept and the flowers and mountain views were lovely. I was sursprised at how very big the resort is. The work out room is nice. The golf shop has much to offer. The pool is fine. It is large and there are many chairs along with a bar. It was always almost empty. The tennis courts are very nice. There is a cute children's area with jungle play set, etc. The cons: The resort is located close to the airport and very close to a dangerous part of town. Driving to the resort from the airport, you pass neighborhoods surrounded by barbed wire. While getting gas at a nearby gas station, we felt frightened of the drunks hanging out front. I did not feel safe when I left the resort for a run or walk. In the opposite direction of the hotel, you find Walmart, Target and strip malls. There is nothing charming about this location. You do not want to leave the confines of this resort in any way. If however, you are a business traveler, a golfer, or looking for a spot to stay on your way somewhere else, this is a very nice resort in and of itself.

They could only eat the food sold in the pool area. There are lots of good restaurants within driving distance from the Legacy and also Scottsdale was fun to visit and not a far drive. I think we will definitely return to the Legacy but would make sure we didn't get room 10113 again.

There is only one restaurant with limited operating hours, and when our large party (10) arrived one evening for dinner about an hour before closing, we were absolutely assured (without us asking!) by the bartender that there was no way he would serve after the 9pm closing time! 9pm, on a Friday night, for a party of 10 (and others already dining)! Not to mention it took a long time to receive our cocktails and 4 of the 8 ordered were incorrect... The pool bar (serving food as well) closed several hours before the sun went down and the crowd diminished. No pool toys or rafts are allowed in the pool, and the \"Pool Nazi\" made sure you did not bring ANY beverages to the pool area, and hounded you with a copy of the written rules until you left or he took your beverages. The pools was very well maintained, plenty of lounge chairs and towels. The rooms (1-bedroom and 2-bedroom suites) were very well appointed, very clean and well-maintained. They had very good appliances, including a large refrigerator/freezer. The golf course was in very good condition, a good challenge, with free club rental and a very low rate for guests.

In comparison to other resorts in the \"Valley of the Sun\" I find that their golf course, accommodations, ammenities, and staff represent the Valley's best golf resort value by far. The golf course is kept in superb shape even in the heat of summer. The course is challenging, but a fair test for golfers of any ability. The practice facilities are extensive. The golf shop has a great selection of golf apparel, and you get a 25% discount just for filling out a questionaire. Swimming pool, restaurant, tennis, sand volleyball, hot tub, are also on property. Each morning guests have announcements on voice mail of planned activities available for that day. A one bedroom condo, will provide you with everything you need for a short or extended stay. Washer, drier, complete kitchens, stereo, 2 TV's, double vanity sink, jetted tub, separate room with standing shower and another single vanity sink, dishwasher, balcony, and dining area. Even the studios have dishwashers, washers, driers, fridge, sink, microwave, and 2 burner range. The area around the Legacy has restaurants at Arizona Mills Mall, movie theaters, and other attractions close by. Finally, I have found the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff to be all that a guest could ask for. Carol who has taken my reservations, to the girls at the registration check in desk, to Louie and Joe who are starters on the course, to Moto, one of the cart guys, to Nick Zell who has given me a lesson or two, to Chris, the head pro, to Chris Morrow in time share sales -- There are others, I just don't know all their names. The impression I get is that their friendliness is sincere. They come across as real people, being nice because that is the way they are, rather than the robotic types that \"serve\" you because they are paid to do so at other resorts I have visited.

The Manager, Ryan, confirmed that the concession to the restaurant and the pool bar had been sold to different parties effective Jan 2006.

The food is also resonably priced ~ 7 bucks for a egg/sausage sandwich with a side of potatoes. Aunt Chilada restaurant on north of resort on Baseline road is great and great prices. Go to Dobbins lookout on South Mountain....breath taking. **Warning, not intended for those affraid of heights, the drive up the mountain is pretty scary..just dont look down.

The resort is very spread out and has really nice rooms. We were booked into a one bedroom in the 9 block, called Casitas. So we had about a 4 minute walk to the main building/golf pro shop. We didn't mind the walk, unless we were booked for golfing, we drove ourselves up to the Bag drop area. For those who do not want to walk far, book yourself in Casitas 1 or 2. #6 is the furthest away. The room was spacious and all of the amenities we expected, although we couldn't find a remote for the 2nd television, but we didn't call to complain, oh and the pepper shaker was empty, otherwise beautiful room. My brother slept on the pullout out couch and said it wasn't very comfortable, so we thought about going to Target to get a bed pad for $50, but never got around to it. Our king bed was ok, definitely not a HIlton or Westin type. One complaint is the location. Not close to any night life for us 30 year olds. We had to drive about 20 minutes to Old Tempe for the nightlife, and wanted the serious nightclubs, but they were 30-35 minutes away , so we never actually made it up there as one of us always had to stay sober. Phoenix and Old Tempe is awesome - it's always Happy Hour! 4-7 and then again 9-close at a lot of pubs including Uno and Great Expectations. The Conceirge desk was very helpful. If you want to go to the Casino, the conceirge desk has tickets for a free limo ride to take you there and back, as long as you agree to stay for 3 hours. Golfing was great with our ownership rate of 25%. And 25% off at the spa too! If you're not an owner, I'm sure there would be incentives to go for a tour. We drove up to the other property owned by Legacy, which is called Orange Tree and it's got a really pretty golf course, and it's more expensive. The rooms are right on the golf course, so not as private as Legacy. Legacy is a good location for privacy and it's on the edge of an Industrial area. The pool is horseshoe shaped and has 2 hottubs that were lovely after a day of golfing! We also went to the Phoenix Coyote game - bought tickets at the box office for the cheap seats $15, and after the 1st period moved down to better seats. Good cheap entertainment! Also drove Tuscon and on the way took a detour to the Biosphere 2, which was cool if you're into science and saw the facility where 6 people lived under a glass dome for 2 years. Also drove to the Grand Canyon - it took 3.5 hours - we went on the American Thanksgiving, so the roads were dead. Mapquest says it supposed to take 4.5 hours, so you be the judge. The drive was worth it!! Gorgeous scenery and don't forget to drive to Sedona! That's only 2 hours from Phoenix and totally awesome for scenery and hiking.

I had a studio, which was spacious with a king size bed, sitting area with sofa and two armchairs, and a full kitchen (sink, half size fridge, coffee maker, toaster, stove with two burners, washing machine, dishes, glasses, pots and pans, utensils, don't remember if there's a microwave). The unit also has a stacked washer/dryer which was very handy. They provide soap for the dishwasher and also to handwash dishes, but for some reason no soap for the washer/dryer but no biggie. The room was clean and seemed relatively new; no dirt, peeling wallpaper, or other visible signs of wear. There is housekeeping service every day, as in a regular hotel. Parking is outside each unit. The grounds are very well kept. Check-in was smooth. The staff at the registration desk is young and somewhat less polished than the five star resorts, but they were friendly and efficient. I had a problem with the high speed internet connection in my room ($9.95 for 24 hours) and they moved me to another room right away at my request, instead of sending someone to fiddle with the wires. The main building also houses the golf pro shop, restaurant and spa/gym. I tried each of these. The pro shop is well stocked and well run. The golf course was in good shape and well maintained; it scores 4.5 stars in Golf Digest, which is as high as any golf course in the Phoenix area. It's not a fancy course but I enjoyed my round, especially at the twilight rate of $25 (for guests, and $29 for nonguests) which starts at noon. Yes, it's hot, but you have to expect that if you go to Phoenix in June. I had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. It's good, basic food, like you would expect in a clubhouse. A little pricey for what you get, but not outrageous, and the service was very good. No complaints there. I didn't use the spa services but did use the gym, which was reasonably well equipped with two treadmills, bicycles, weights and so on. The swimming pool is next to the main building and is popular with families, though I did not use it. The resort is about ten minutes south of the airport. As others have noted, you pass through a couple of spotty neighborhoods on the way there and you may want to think twice about stopping at the nearby gas stations late at night because of the people who hang out there. But the resort itself is fine and there are security guards driving around the parking lots all the time. I felt very safe. There are a couple of shopping malls only five minutes away by car (in another direction) and the resort is centrally located for access to other golf courses, restaurants and so on. I think the positives of the resort's location outweighs the negatives. All-in-all, the Legacy is a great place to stay without the expensive frills. The summer rates are amazing and you can book directly through their website. I highly recommend this place.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Wa", "Title": "\u201cNice place good value\u201d", "Author": "wtravweler", "ReviewID": "UR5055660", "Content": "Had a business trip to Phoenix and decided on the Legacy as I thought I could get a round of golf in before and after business.

Stayed in a studio and it was pretty well furnished. Nice deck with a partial view of one of the fairways. Had breakfast at the club house and it was good and reasonable. Also a very nice pool area.

First problem was the directions they have on their web site as I was coming from the airport, where the rental car location has NO relevance to the directions. Life became better as I checked in w/ a smooth check-in, nice concierge who went out of her way to solicit me on any needs I mayhave for dinner. Recommended Rustler Roost, a nice wine bar/organic restaurant next door or a new sports bar, Gallaghers about 1/2 mile away. Room was nice and big w/ sitting area, and marble bathroom. Bonus was refrigerator, microwave, small stove and DW. Nice patio w/ 2 deck chairs where I had a beer on each nite. On-site restaurant is really just a golf bar, however, had a free (corporate card) breakfast there both morning and it was top notch. Even had a chance to play golf one nite @5:15pm tee-off, clubs were complimentary as I was staying on-site and they only charged me for 9 holes and threw in a cart. Very nice course and knowledgeable golf employees. Not yet, a top notch resort but w/ a better on-site restaurant, a bit better on-site experience they could achieve in a couple of years.

The unit was actually a one bedroom apartment with an adjoining studio apartment. Both were very spacious and spotlessly clean. The boys used their studio basically to sleep/wash-up and hang out although it had a kitchenette, terrace and washer/dryer. The one bedroom has a huge living room/dining room/kitchen (fully equipped) with a washer/dryer/dishwasher etc. All detergents etc are supplied so if you go hiking in nearby South Mountain State Park, you can wash your clothing afterwards. The one bedroom bathroom is enourmous - soaking jacuzzi (although no jets for the back), marble shower, toilet (duh) and three sinks. Studio bathroom is pretty standard. One bedroom has two TVs, DVD and VCR plus internet for a fee. All staff was very helpful - whatever we needed, they gave us, promptly and with a smile. Food in the clubhouse was fine - nothing special but most golf courses aren't. Pool area was nicely kept, clean and with a grill house/bar. The fitness room was huge and well equipped - better than most four star hotels actually (I travel a lot for business). I had a massage after a daylong hike and it was done quite well by a CMT. I would strongly recommend that you request a top floor quiet room with a view (either golf course or mountains); we did a few weeks in advance and called to reconfirm. We were very happy with the accommodations. The South Phoenix neighborhood is basic (not scary as some have written but certain not strolling material). If you need to go to the drugstore, Starbuck, supermarket, there are several in the immediately area. The resort grounds are spacious enough if you feel the need for a peaceful after dinner walk. Literally just up the road (32nd St.), a 5 minute walk, is The Farm at South Mountain, an internationally reknown \"Slow Food\" organic restaurant. Coincidentally, it was featured in USA Today as one of 10 top picks in the country while we were there. It is open for breakfast, lunch, happy hour and dinner. Best place to eat downtown is Wild Thaiger on the 2600 block of Central Ave (just past the Heard Museum) - outstanding Thai food - better than in LA or NYC. Overall, I would certainly stay at the Legacy again.

The grounds are nicely landscaped. Overall all the makings of a good destination. What lets this place down is the approach taken to guests. This is a resort where half the accomodation is owned and half rented to guests. It feels like guests were an after thought with a tiny, low decor lobby and staff who are pleasant but missing the training and poise of a good resort. If you want a big suite (make sure you get a corner room)with good basic decor this place is good. Don't expect lot's of frills (the restaurant is basically a golf snack bar). The neighbourhood is not the best but nothing most of us can't handle just not the upscale feel of Scottsdale for example. Don't expect to find neighbourhood restaurants above McDonalds or IHOP. Value was good with the old story \"you get what you pay for\". Good rooms, no frills. If you really are looking for a resort with full service go elsewhere.

Played the course twice, it's excellent, but the bunkers are punishing! The cost to use the range, $15, was unbelievable, what value! Free to use chipping and putting - fantastic! If I had to mention a negative, the choice from the restaurant menu is slightly limited although the food and service is excellent.

The bathroom is big and has 2 sinks, which made it easier to get ready in the morning. The decoration is mexican inspired. Very comfortable and spacious. The downside was the paper-thin walls.

The service at the restaurant is indeed terrible. There was a baseball game on that night, so there was alot of fighting and shouting (diamond backs vs boston). If you are looking for a quiet place, this isn't the place. The food was, thank God, great! We didn't play the golf there as it was too expensive.

My room had a cricket that chirped all night long and ants that came in and had to be removed. They asked me if I wanted to move rooms, but who wants to move all of their things when you've settled in? The complex does not have enough convenient parking when the hotel is full. The rooms are very nicely decorated and mostly clean, but my bedspread was not clean, it still had popcorn bits on it from the previous guests. I wonder if hotels ever clean the bedspreads very often anyway. The patios are nice and the option of a washer/dryer is wonderful if you're planning on staying long. The towels are nice and so are the toiletries, very nice bathroom. They even give you dish soap and dishwasher soap to use. They're not stingy with the amenities, but they want it to be as nice as possible so you will think about their time share option. They do not try to sell this to you, which is really nice.
