Size of the rooms are very good for Paris standards and all have outside space (either a balcony or terrace) Great in the summer with a glass of wine and a view of the Eiffel tower now the negative: the rooms (and we stayed in 5 different ones) ALL need major work, we're talking ugly big stains on the carpets, chairs that have ripped covers (in one of the rooms out of 4 chairs only one was relatively ok with just a side rip!!!) The sofa beds in some of the studio rooms have a very thin and old mattress that left for a very very uncomfortable nights sleep, very noisy and badly insulated from traffic noise, Most of the doors and windows don't close very well which makes it drafty - hate to imagine staying here in winter The service:hm..... well they are friendly and they do speak English which is rare in paris hotels of this standard but........ you do feel that they are doing you a HUGE favour by letting you stay in their rooms, and I overheard them giving the price over the phone in French (I think they did not realise I speak fluent french) which was hugely reduced to the rate we were offered as foreigners, (they charged the repeat client the guy was speaking on the phone with 85 Euro!!!) Anyhow if that is the hotel policy then I suggest they do not do reservations at the front desk at the same time as they have clients checking in. The rooms were badly cleaned and the rubbish was never removed ( we later discovered in fact there is a note in the room asking you to take your own rubbish out, even in other Apart-hotels we've stayed in we have never had to do that!!) In the weekend the place is like a ghost town you have a very nice front desk guy who unfortunately only works in the weekend for a couple of hours in the morning but at other times the front entrance is closed and there is NO ONE to ask or speak to for help, which is a bit worrying as they have a note on the lift saying no more than 2 people (even though the lift says up to 400KG) it made us wonder what happens if the lift gets stuck in the weekend when the hotel is closed and there are no staff??? so we always took the stairs, or worst if there is a fire??? Overall bad service, bad quality, cleaning leaves a lot to be desired (had stained sheets in most beds - I guess they were washed but the stains stayed, and threadbare towels they really should invest in new linens) Stay here if you want a big room (i assume coming to paris staying indoors is not really a priority) or if you need to stay in the area otherwise we highly suggest you find somewhere else until this hotel cleans up it's act and realises it's not still so great as perhaps it once was. we will not be coming back and would not recommend it to our friends", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cOk hotel\u201d", "Author": "Prasad N", "ReviewID": "UR118087051", "Content": "Stayed here last week for two days.

It was about a 15 min. walk to the Eiffel Tower. * The small kitchenette was useful. * We stayed on the 4th floor. The view of the Eiffel Tower, that we were promised, can only be seen while hanging over the balcony. * The bed is extremely hard...seroiusly, I've slept on floors and in tents that were much more comfortable.

You are expected to clean the room and take out your own trash before you check out or your charged 25 euros. * The TV turns on and off by itself. * The shower in the bathroom only has a half door, so the entire bathroom gets soaked when you take a shower. The towels are small...more like hand towels and there are no wash cloths. There is water damage and the walls are peeling badly. * The walls are paper thin, so not only can you hear your neighbors, you can smell what their cooking as well...not always pleasant. * The room is small, but from what I've read, it's large compared to other hotel rooms in Paris.

My mum and I had organised a shuttle from the airport and unfortunately had used a booking agent who hadn't passed on payment details to the driver. On arriving at the hotel the reception staff were superb and helped allowing me to use the internet on the reception desk to get confirmation and payment details. We had two superior studios located on the 4th and 5th floor (rooms 403 and 503), both had a view of the Eiffel Tower from the balcony. The rooms were clean and basically furnished. It was great to have a fridge (for keeping our wine chilled). The lift is small, one person plus case, or two people in total, a bit slow, but I tended to walk up the stairs, so it wasn't an issue. I needed reception again and this time a different receptionist, allowed me to use the bosses office for the internet, again she went out of her way to help. Something to note though is that the reception is closed between 12-2pm, so if you are arriving or leaving around this time, I suggest you have a drink/lunch at the bistro on the corner, its very good, especially the smoked salmon and gorgonzola pizza...... Its about a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, about a 5 min walk to two different metro stations, so very handy to get around. We did a few tours: City Tour/Trip on the Seine/Lunch at the Eiffel Tower - This was good as the Seine trip could be taken any time not just on the day of the tour. Lunch at the Eiffel Tower was better than expected, but they did keep topping up my wine glass. The City Tour was a bit of a disappointment as it was a closed double decker and you didn't feel as close to the city as you would have done on an open topped bus. Da Vinci Code Walking Tour - this was fab, we found details in our hotel, it was \u20ac20 and they meet at 10.30 outside the Ritz. It took about 2 hours and was easy walking, the guide was American and he explained a lot more than we expected on the tour. It was well worth the money. Moulin Rouge - This was exceptional, we had dinner and the show with 1/2 bottle of champagne included each. Additional bottles cost \u20ac50, but hey, you only do it once. It was a lot better than I expected and definately worth doing. Montmatre and Sacre Coeur - get there early to avoid the crowds. There is a little train that takes you on a short tour, it costs \u20ac5 and worth it. Travels down Montmatre to where the Moulin Rouge is and back again. Louvre - We just went in one wing (Denon), this is where Mona Lisa, Madonna of the Rocks, Venus di Milo are. We took the audio guides for the Da Vinci Code at \u20ac10 and it is \u20ac9.50 to get in - we were in about an hour and a half. On the Friday night we went to a very different restaurant called: Nos Ancetre Les Gaulois on the Isle St Louis. It had an all inclusive menu at \u20ac39 which included a massive basket of salads and vegetables, meats cooked on the fire, cheese board, dessert and all you could drink red wine from the barrel... plus a singer who came round to the tables... It was a fun night and it is heartily recommended. Montpanasse Tower is worth a trip up, \u20ac9.50 to get to the top of the tower, go early to avoid queues, 56th floor is inside, two more flights of stairs get you to the outside viewing area... Fabulous views from the top. Last thing Metro Tickets - buy 10 at a time for \u20ac11.50, one ticket does a journey within Paris from beginning to end, even if you change Metros, you can also use them on the fenicular to get up to Monmatre and on the standard buses. We ended up buying two sets of 10, plus 4 extra. The single tickets cost \u20ac1.50 each. We were there 5 days and found this to be the cheapest/best option. All in all fab trib, great little studios, good location.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, QC", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Zolo13", "ReviewID": "UR8134047", "Content": "Stayed there from july 5 to 14.

During our stay we faced some problems that made us not to want to visit again Citea Tour Eiffel: 1. The last day of our stay, we asked from the receptionist at 7.45 a.m. to call us a taxi for the train station. She told my husband that she could do so 15 minutes before the time we wanted the taxi. At 8.00 she called us saying that she couldn't find a taxi. As a result, we missed the train. 2. The room is nice, not big enough but ok. The bathroom is very small. 3. The towels were dirty, with black marks on them. When we asked from the receptionist to change them she told us that we had to wait 7 days. 4. The air-conditioning system did not work efficiently, so the room was still warm. 5. The safety box did not work even after the technician came and \"fixed\" it. When we asked the receptionist to open it with her key, she refused telling us that we had to wait one and a half hour to come, because she was alone, even though we had to leave earlier. 6. There was no soundproof in the room. As a result every single morning we woke up from the doors opened and closed at the hallway and from the noises from the street.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNice and large room\u201d", "Author": "CH_Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR4988696", "Content": "Well located, 10 minutes from the Eiffel tower, 5 minutes from the Dupleix metro station.

But beware, according to the emergency map posted in the room, only two rooms on each floor are so confortable, the two others seems to be minuscule (this seems to be confirmed by the review posted by an other traveler). So be sure to book a \"superior\" room and not the standard one. I paid \u20ac70/night for it (special week-end rate). One negative point is on the accoustic isolation between the rooms, you can easily ear some noise from the other rooms (coming through the ventilation circuit, I think) if your neighbors are talking a little bit too loudly.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Adagio Access Paris Tour Eiffel Saint Charles", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d578345-Reviews-Adagio_Access_Paris_Tour_Eiffel_Saint_Charles-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$107 - $180*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">43 rue Saint Charles</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">15th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75015</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> (Formerly Citea Tour Eiffel)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514775", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/66/70/66705e992dd1868939dced84e51d41f24large.jpg"}}
