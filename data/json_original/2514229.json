I found it difficult to get back to sleep and consequently had to miss the first few hours of my course the following day. Electrical faults do happen, but it would have been nice to apologise to guests (including me!) on their check-out - this didn't happen. The room was also slightly cold as the radiator hadn't been bled in a while.

The breakfast room is also very cosy and charming. The views of the garden was quite relaxing as well. In terms of location, Cartwright Gardens can be easily reached from the Russell Square tube station, or Euston, or Kings' Cross. Along Marchmont Street, the very modernised Brunswick Centre has loads of dining and shopping options. In all, I think one would be better off spending a little more and staying at any of the adjacent hotels or at Tavistock or Russell Squares.", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cCrescent Hotel Oct 2008\u201d", "Author": "btgm", "ReviewID": "UR21147220", "Content": "We stayed in the Crescent Hotel for 2 weeks in Oct 2008. I was travelling with my 10 year old daughter. Overall, we found the hotel to be very good for our needs. I had originally planned to only stay for 9 days but then got some extra time off so we extended our stay. I booked the initial reservation on the website. I changed the reservation once because I had booked an extra day, and they cancelled it with no problems over the internet. Later, I called them about extending the stay. They were very helpful on the phone and there was no problem with extending our stay. The hotel is on a quiet street with a small park in front of it with tennis courts. The tennis courts were 2.50/hr and I think you had to go to an office somewhere to reserve them but we didn't do that. The hotel says they will loan racquets and balls with a deposit, but we did not do that. It is about 5 minutes walk to the Russell Square tube station straight up Marchmont St and then a left onto Cartwright Gardens. It is also about a 5 minute walk to Coram's Fields, which is a big playground that my daughter loved, we went almost every day. When we were there, it was open 9A-6P. It is also very close to the Brunswick outdoor shopping mall which has a Waitrose for groceries and several restaurants and an ATM. There are also several pubs and cafes on Marchmont St. It was about a 10 min walk to the British Museum and we passed some other restaurants on the way there. There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms, but you can get ice and water for free from reception and they also have a list of drinks you can buy from reception but we never got anything but water. There are several convenience stores (don't know what those are called in the UK) between the tube and the hotel, two of which were open 24 hours. I had requested a twin room, but this was not availble for our first night after the extension, so we were put in room 1 which had a double and a twin bed for the same price. (I'm using US bed sizes, which I think are different from UK sizes.) The room was very clean, down 1 flight of stairs, and had an ensuite shower, sink, and toilet. That room had a closet with an extra blanket in it. Both rooms had tea making facilities. Rm 1 looked out on the street but was below ground with the window opening onto a sort of large window well area with stairs up to the street which were gated off. After the first night, we returned our keys, packed our bags, and the hotel staff moved the bags to our new room for us while we were out. Our 2nd room was room 19, which had 2 twin beds, a wardrobe, and a desk. It was up one flight of maybe 15 steps. This window opened onto a small courtyard belonging to the hotel, which felt more secure to me, but we did have problems with smoke coming in the windows if we left them open as the courtyard is where guests are permitted to smoke (the inside of the hotel is all nonsmoking.) This was not really a problem for us as it was not hot enough to need the windows open, but I could see it being a problem in the summer. Perhaps a higher room overlooking the courtyard would be better, as we were only one flight up. The beds were reasonably comfortable, as good as I would expect from a hotel in the US. The room was smaller than in a US hotel, but was large enough for us, even if we came back early just to hang out. The ensuite facilities in room 19 consisted of a room with a shower stall and sink and a separate room with a toilet, both off a small hallway inside the room door but before another fire door leading to the actual bedroom (the lock was on what I am calling the room door.) They seemed reasonably clean. Part way through our stay, I noticed mildew forming on the shower curtain, but a few days later the curtain was either washed or changed. I kept forgetting to mention it to staff, so it might have been washed earlier if I had said something. There was always enough hot water. The shower curtain had a tendency to blow into the shower, so I anchored it with our shampoo bottles when showering. Water tended to get out of the shower onto the floor as the shower curtain was a little bit short. The drainage in the shower was a little slow, so you would end up with about 1/2 inch of water in the shower when you were done. The shower stall seemed adequate size, but might be tight for a large person. The shower could either be used overhead or by hand, I mainly used it by hand as the water pressure was adequate but not great. My daughter used it overhead with no problems, though. You are given a key to the hotel main door and a key to your room, so I always felt secure. There is a lounge with couches and a computer for free internet access which was usually available when I wanted it, although sometimes there would be another guest using it. The breakfast room is in the basement, although there is a window. I also looked at one of the shared bathrooms, which had 2 toilets and a full bathtub. It looked clean but we did not use it. For breakfast, there is self serve juice and cereal (4 kinds I think, but we didn't eat any). Then you can have made to order eggs (fried, poached, scrambled, or boiled), bacon, sausage, mushrooms, beans, tomatoes, brown or white toast, and tea or coffee. I think you could also have porridge but we didn't. My daughter said the poached eggs were really good. I had scrambled which were also good. The breakfast was very filling, and several days I just had tea and toast as it was a little too much breakfast for me. We never asked for extra food, so I don't know if you could get more if you wanted. They did offer us extra toast one day. Overall, I felt this to be an excellent hotel for the price (we paid 89.10 pounds a night, which was a 10% discount for staying over a week). It is not a luxury hotel, but if you want a clean, safe place to stay with a good breakfast, I would highly recommend it. My daughter is already planning a return trip and wants to stay in the same hotel.", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "shabbona", "Title": "\u201cworth a visit\u201d", "Author": "msjude", "ReviewID": "UR20449407", "Content": "i spent a total of 10 nights at the Crescent, in August and September of 2008, and on the whole was very satisfied. It's a 2-star hotel, about 75 pounds a night for a single with bath. The rooms were very clean. I was relieved to see my first room was spacious enough, and had a big window onto a small courtyard. Everything was adequate, there was a kettle for making coffee or tea, and a small tv. The bed was comfortable. A week later I stayed again for two nights. They didn't have a room with bath available, and the single room they put me in was very small, at 50 pounds per night. The next night I was moved to a larger room with bath, but when I saw a mouse, I moved back to the smaller room. The women at the front desk were nice, but didn't have a lot of knowledge about tourist-type questions. The breakfast was very good - you can get a full English breakfast with eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, tomato, toast, and there were cereals and fruits on the sideboard. Just down the block is an excellent fish and chips restaurant called North Sea Fish, just across Marchmont on Leigh Street. There are other restaurants and pubs and grocery stores all within two or three blocks, and the Russell Square Tube is about four blocks down Marchmont. Also, you can catch many buses at Russell Square, about five blocks away, including the Big Bus Tour, which I would recommend. London is so big, the tour takes about four hours. You can get on and off as you please. One note of warning. Never, EVER, attempt, under any circumstances, in this life or the next, to drive in London. We rented a car to go to Devon for a week - and it was entirely possible that we could have spent that whole week just trying to navigate out of London. Every two blocks, the road names change, you encounter a roundabout with indecipherable signs, and don't know where the heck to turn off! It's a nightmare. It would be far better to take a train or bus out of London and rent a car from another town.

It is about a 5 minute walk from both Euston and St Pancras and is set in a rather pretty tree lined crescent. I arrived about 12.30 and having read on the website that it was ok to leave luggage on your arrival and departure dates thought I would just leave my bag. But I received a very warm welcome and was told my room was ready. However two minutes later I was informed 'ooops no it isn't' but \"we have another one that is ready if you are happy to stay on the third floor.\" My single en suite room contained a double and a single bed! I was very happy to spread out with all that space. The third floor was quite a trek up and there is no lift, but it was a lovely room. There is a dressing table/desk, a fan (a godsend in London!), tv on a unit and more than adequate tea/coffee/hot chocolate supplies. Irons, hairdryers, dressing gowns are all available from reception. I was given a room key and a front door key. There are tennis courts and gardens available opposite for guest use. There is a lounge with a computer with free internet access. Breakfast was plentiful and rather nice. Usually in London I am very distrustful of little independent hotels and stay in one of the chains where I know what to expect - but this room that was booked for me was a very pleasant unexpected surprise and I will certainly be staying here again. One last point is that although the hotel was full the noise was minimal - and I slept with the windows open and still the noise was minimal even from outside.", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I could have ever expected\u201d", "Author": "rnetzley", "ReviewID": "UR18319427", "Content": "The Crescent was one of the hotels suggested by a conference I attended at the University of London.

I've been travelling to London for over 3 decades now and know only too well that in this price range one often ends up in absolutely *horrible* places. The Crescent is a jewel--clean, pleasant, friendly, lovely street, great location. They could charge much more than they do, but I hope they won't start doing so! London hotel rooms tend to be TINY by American standards, and the Crescent is no exception to that rule, but my room was immaculate and tidy, and very nicely furnished. There were complimentary shampoo and soap in the room, which is unusual in this price-range. I opted for the basic single, which meant sharing a bathroom, and I was a little nervous about that, but the bathroom was excellent; the shower was much larger than is standard in London hotels, which means it was about the size of an average American shower stall, and it was also immaculately clean with plentiful hot water. (I never had to wait to use the bathroom, which I suppose was mainly just luck.) The hotel provides a very comfortable, large terry-cloth bathrobe, which really helps when you're sharing a bath -- they take a deposit that's refunded when you return the robe, which seemed a very reasonable system to me. The breakfast was very tasty and filling, and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The young man who was on duty when I checked in carried my extremely heavy suitcase up to my room for me and did not even wait long enough for me to give him a tip. My request for a first-floor room (i.e., American 2nd-floor) was honored, which also pleased me. Another nice touch was that there was a small electric fan in the room; I did not need it, but in July or August that could be really helpful.

All in all, a good budget hotel in one of the most expensive cities in the world. I paid 49 pounds per night for a single, with shower and sink in the room, toilet down the hall. Room \"compact\" with little storage other than a wardrobe and desk with 4 shallow drawers. Noise was rarely a problem, as the hotel is on a crescent and the traffic is mostly on the main road which is 100 yards away. In the crescent is a park with tennis courts. On a warm Saturday night there was a lot of partying in the park, otherwise peaceful. Room fairly clean, as were bathrooms. Good full English breakfast (eggs, bacon sausage, beens, tomato, as well as hot and cold cereal, orange juice, yogurt, fruit) included. Hotel people generally helpful. I arrived at 11 PM, tired. Man at the desk brought my bag up to the room, did not wait for a tip. As I was on the fourth floor (American, 3rd floor European), and the last flight of stairs was steep and narrow, I was appreciative. What not to like? They advertised Internet access in the room, which they provide with a plug in cord that apparently runs on a wireless signal. Well, there is insufficient signal on the top floor. They do provide free a computer in the lounge, which unfortunately was broken for the first few days of my stay.. They did not charge me for the wireless cord, since it did not work. Since private Internet access is quite important to me, was a big problem. I had e-mailed before arrival and asked for a lower floor room. I never heard back and did not follow up (my mistake), so of course I ended up on the top floor. Since I'm an older traveler, a nuisance but still a problem. Overall, if you want basic economical, clean, convenient accomodations fairly close to Underground and in central London, this is a good choice.
