The neighbourhood supports a range of choices for eating and drinking, from late-nighters to early shifters. Do not miss the breakfast on the hotel's terrace; a nice view of an old temple and occasionally pigeons walking over the roof, makes it a cool waking up. Average breakfast quality. Ask for an espresso by the personnel, as it is not offered directly at the buffet. The only drawback is that the connection to the city centre takes some time, with a bus connection, roughly 40' during night (the scarcity of the itineraries included in the duration) or on days with heavy traffic load. But once you reach the closest metro station (Ottaviano), you are already near sightseeing sites.

If you don't like soccer crowds, don't plan on walking outside the night of a game. My major complaint about the hotel is that I asked them to call a taxi to take me to the airport. Their \"taxi\" was a limo service, not a real taxi. While the hotel said the trip would cost about 40 euros, once inside the care the driver said 55 euros, fixed. About 15 minutes into the trip to the airport, on the highway, with a fair amount of traffic, the driver started texting continuously. I asked him to stop, and was sworn at up and down, and even threatened that \"Americans like me disappear in Italy\". It was very upsetting. I found out later the hotel contracted with the limo service, and I obviously can't help wonder if the limo service was connected with organized crime. No company name on the receipt!

Traveled with a group of 20 and reserved 10 rooms. We all agree that the hotel was above average. Many rooms having a balcony. Breakfast was plentiful, and served on the roof resturant starting at 0730 hrs. It is air conditioned with an elevator. Four floors. The staff were very friendly and spoke english. In fact during one evening one of the hotel clerks went out with four of our young adult children. The hotel is located outside of center Rome. You will have to be an intrepid adventurer to get around. Not a bad thing if you want to be a traveier and not a tourist. What better way to get an idea of the culture than to stay where the locals live and eat. Many of the staff at the local resturants near the hotel had a difficult time understanding us. I would suggest that if this concerns you, that you eat in center Rome where english is spoken almost everywhere. There are a few ways to get into the center and main train station, Termini. Besides the rail, this is the local transportaion hub. The Metro lines converge here as well as the departure point for local buses. There are cabs as well as tourist sightseeing buses. There is a bus stop two small blocks from the hotel. One will take you directly (last stop) to the Vatician. Another bus will take you to the Mancini bus depot, for a bus or tram transfer. Or if you so incline you can walk across the bridge also two blocks from the hotel, and continue four blocks to Mancini bus depot. Direct bus to Termini. Another way, which is quicker, is to go to Mancini and catch the number 2 tram to the last stop and catch the Metro to all points. Just some advice. The bridge is the local hang out for the \"young\" crowd during the evenings. It is packed from one end to the other. Not a safety issue at all. My young adult kids and friends that came along with us, made some local friends and hung out there. All are polite, and welcomed the Americans. My point is that while we did not so much mind the walk across the bridge to Manicini in the morning as we started out our many sightseeing adventures, the evening was very tiredsome. We needed to take the bus from Manicini to the hotel. Another advice. Purchase the Metro pass. With so many transfers from bus to Metro to Tram during the week we were there, it was a great investment. Saved a lot of time and money. During our last day we, as a group, got on a bus, and there were three inspectors checking all passes. Also be aware to expect rudness from the general public while on the public transportation system. It was not because we were tourists, they did not know, but because they were always in a rush to get in and grab a seat.

We used the limousine service to and from the airport. The cost was 70 euros as there were four of us travelling. This seemed a little expensive but the driver was courteous and punctual. It certainly saved a lot of hassle. We used the tram and buses to get around the City. The No 2 tram was ideal to take you into the City to the Plazza del Popola. We also used the No 32 bus to the Vatican and the 271 to the Colesseum. We paid 11 euros each for the bus/tram/metro ticket for 3 days. This was excellent value. We pre-booked a guide to take us around the Vatican City and this was a really worthwhile experience. The hotel is about 20 minutes out of Rome City Centre.

We had some difficulty finding the hotel after an adventure on public transport from the airport, a taxi from the city centre might be best for the initial trip. The room was a reasonable size and very clean. The area is a little off the beaten track but this makes it quiet at night. We felt safe throughout our stay. Breakfast was ok, not great, not bad, typically continental. The staff were helpful and we were able to leave our cases in the hotel during our final day after we had checked out. There were a few local bars which were very reasonably priced compared with the city centre. One by the Milvio bridge provided snacks (practically meals!) free of charge with your drinks - great if you are on a budget! Rome has good public transport, mainly trams and buses. We would walk 5 minutes across the Milvio Bridge each morning and catch a tram into the centre from where we would explore by foot. For us the morning journey in and evening return were part of the experience but if you are less mobile go for a location closer to the city centre. It would take about 25 minutes from leaving the hotel on foot to arriving in the heart of the city. This is great if you want to spend all day and the evening enjoying this fantastic city as we did. If you want to spend time in the hotel or go back to a base during the day another location would be better. Overall we were very happy with the hotel; safe, clean and good value but we would probably stay in a different area next time, closer to the centre. There would be a price to pay of course.

Can highly recommend the Hotel Farnesina at Ponte Milivio. We had booked the hotel's limousine service which cost 55 Euros one way from Ciampino airport. The driver was there to meet us when we got off the plane despite a 45 minute delay from Glasgow. The journey only took 30 minutes. On arrival at the hotel the staff were very friendly and helpful. There was no language barrier and the check-in was quick. The room was very clean and modern, very boutique style. Facilities were excellent, air-conditioning, telephone, mini-bar, TV, and hairdryer, power shower, nice clean fluffy white towels. The view from the room was of the church which is a landmark in the area. Breakfast was served from 7.30am-9.30am and was the usual continental style. However one bonus was the delicious cafe lattes and the view from the rooftop terrace. The area surrounding the hotel was lovely. Lots of great restaurants, bars and ice-cream shops. Plenty of authentic Italian atmosphere. Getting into the centre of Rome was no problem either. Get a ticket from the local newstands for the bus/metro it costs 1 Euro and this lasts for 75 minutes. Catch a No 32 bus the last stop takes you straight to the Vatican or get off at Ottaviano which is the nearest metro station from there you catch the underground train to Spagna (three stops down from Ottaviano) which lets you off near the Spanish steps or go on further to Barberini (four stops from Ottaviano) which is near the Trevi Fountain and Via Veneto for the Hard Rock Cafe. All the major sites are of walking distance once you are in the centre. Must say the Vatican was the highlight of our first trip to Rome. You must see the Basilica, Sistine Chapel and climb to the top of the Cupola (Vatican Dome) the view is awesome. However you must be quite fit even if you do take the lift up part of it. The open top bus tour is great value at 26 Euros they even stop at the Bocca Della Verita (mouth of truth) made famous in the film Roman holiday with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck which is a must too!", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cMisleading and untrustworthy\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3555058", "Content": "Not impressed.

Flight arrived in at 9pm, and we had to then fight our way through a queue to get an airport bus to the Terminal Station. The bus journey took about 30mins. At Terminal Station, we struggled to find a taxi that would take us to the hotel, due to it being \"too far away\". We eventually found someone willing to take us, not a licensed taxi though! He was a star and it cost us 30 euros to get to the hotel. At nearly 10pm we just wanted to get to the hotel! Hotel was set off the road, you wouldn't notice the entrance. The room was quite small but very clean. Staff very friendly and apologised when we asked where our taxi was - they had booked the taxi so it wasn't their fault! Quiet location, no noise, in a residential area. Not central - but okay when you get the hang of the transport. No 32 bus was great - bus stops on the main road, near the bridge. Approx 20mins on bus to Metro Ottaviano (line A) to take you into Rome. Take the 32 bus to the last stop, and you are right at the Vatican - so very handy for that! There did not appear to be any room service available, and the breakfasts were okay - nothing fancy - cereals, hard bread rolls, croissants and cheese and ham. We ate locally and there were a number of restaurants near to the Hotel. The hotel staff recommended one only 5 mins away and it was fantastic, excellent food and the staff were great in translating the menu for us. There is a lot of walking about involved - so be prepared! Oh, and there was a great local market at the square selling all sorts of fish, veggies, clothing - it was good to wander around with the locals buying and selling - this was on the Saturday morning. Tip - Vatican museums are free to get in on the last sunday of the month - it was mobbed and we didn't get in, even though we got there early (9am) - the queue was unbelievable!

Breakfast (included) is acceptable if a bit unexcting - although it is a proper buffet, so if you like bread rolls and cornflakes then you can eat your fill! The one criticism I can think of would be the distance from the centre of Rome. It's about half an hour by bus (no 32) and metro (Line A, Ottaviano station) from the Termini station, including a 5-minute walk to the bus-stop. There is also not an abundance of restaurants (apart from a very good Chinese!) within easy walking distance, so if you want to eat at a different restaurant each night then you will have to get to one of the larger squares - eg. Piazza Flaminio, a 15 minute tram ride (no 2) and 5 minute walk - or into the centre to eat. Note also that use of the excellent internet connection (RJ45 into a local Windows DHCP network and ISDN/ADSL line) is subject to a 5 euro per night charge which is not mentioned in the literature.
