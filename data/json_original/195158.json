The room was also extremely small, there was no room for 3 of our small trolley bags.

We asked whether the spot right outside the hotel main entrance was a parking spot or not and he completely had no idea. Moreover, we found it strange that the reception takes the full payment of the hotel room the moment you checked in! First time I came across such a practice! The only redeeming quality about this hotel is the cleanliness of the hotel room and the ensuite toilet.

We (my wife, 2 children 3 and 10 yrs old and me) had to wait for more than 30 minutes before the room got available. When we entered the room it smelled like somebody had used a toilet spray very heavily for hours. So, we had to open the window (there is no air-conditioning in the room). This was very dangerous with a 3 yrs old child, because the window was not secured and we were at level 5 (room 501). When opening the window my wife inhaled something awful. The first impression of the room was that it is much too small to for 4 persons. Because we were staying only for the weekend we left our luggage and went for sightseeing London.

He came half an hour later and was not able to identify what animals it was (language barrier maybe?). We asked for a solution, but he could give us one. He told us that he has to leave and hand it over to his colleague, the night porter. I went for a smoke, outside the hotel and an Irish man came to me and he told me that he had heard my story at the reception and told me that they have left the hotel the night before for the same reason. They were back at the hotel to claim their money back, but the story they heard that only the manager could do that. There was no sign of a manager at the hotel.

I asked for the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s telephone number; he refused to give me that number. The other man told me that these animals are so-called bed-bugs.

One of the parties that was staying for longer than one night had alternative accommodation provided. The rest was left in the same boat as us. We found reasonable accommodation at one of the Hiltonhotels mainly due to how late we was booking, however half the day had been wasted due to a mistake on the Duke of Leinster's behalf. One month later I was contacted by the Duke of Leinster's booking team claiming they had no recod of my party staying on the date I had booked and no cancellation.Thefore, they would be debiting my account with the price of the room!!!

Got into the room and it was small but adequate on first glance. Got changed and headed out for some sights and a meal. We arrived back about 11pm and had a shower and settled down to watch tv. About half hour later we saw some bugs on the bed and put them out the window, no problems as it was a warm night. Anyway half hour later there were more bugs on the bed and lifted the pillow and there were about 20 something, we then lifted the mattress and it was infested! NO WAY WERE WE STAYING THE NIGHT IN THIS ROOM so my girlfriend went to reception to ask for another room. The man called Arash on reception said there were no rooms and there was nothing he could do, so my girlfriend came back. I went down myself and took a bug with me and the guy on reception basically said there was nothing he could do and the manager wont answer his phone. I said I would like a refund and we would go elsewhere even though it was 1am we couldnt stay as it was literally infested. He just said he couldn't and didn't seem bothered at all,didn't even have a look and the manager was not contactable and nobody was in charge?!

Location: while this is close to two Tube stations, it is not easy to find. The street is a residential street of Georgian architecture where a number of the previous residences have been converted into hotels. The easiest approach is from the Queensway station, but no one tells you that. Directions we received from the front desk over the phone while standing at the Bayswater station took us way out of the way. It took a Bobby to send us to the correct place. We arrived very tired (from a very long walk of being lost), and the front desk was friendly and helpful. The elevator is frighteningly small. The steps are much easier. The corridors are less than 2.5 feet wide and very noisy with no natural light. The rooms have been created from subdividing the original flats. Our room was not much larger than the full sized bed. There was a window that was part of a bay window looking out over the main street. The division left just 1/3 of the original window with a shelf constructed beside it for the placement of a tea pot, etc, with a small \"bar\" refrigerator underneath. Immediately beside it was a wardrobe so you could barely find room to get to the window. There is not air conditioning, so the window being open is important. But it won't stay open without putting a book or something in the hinge. It does not help that there was scaffolding outside the window -- making it less than safe to leave it open. The television sits on top of the wardrobe, but frankly you are better off to open the wardrobe, remove the fan from within, put the TV into the wardrobe and the fan atop it. Otherwise you have no air. The shower is so small that a woman cannot shave her legs in there. The toilet is about impossible to get to flush. Breakfast had been paid for by our travel agency's fees, but it was not served at a time we could eat it since our tours began from Buckingham Palace Rd and we had to take the tube to get there. The evening staff did not know how to ask the kitchen staff to arrange for a take-away, and the morning staff told us to ask the evening staff. So we did not get the breakfast we had paid for. WiFi is available. That is the one plus of this location: we did not get charged for the WiFi service. Overall, this is an ok place if you're stuck, but I will not stay here again.

Lastly, when we asked the front desk to call us a cab, only too late did we discover that the young lady working the front desk called one of her friends to pick us up in a van! We didn't realize until we got in that there was no meter and the driver had no idea how to get us to our destination (Soho) and eventually just dropped us off and told us to walk... after charging 20 pounds UK. I could deal with the tiny room, 12\" tv screen, dirty walls, shaky/scary elevator, noisy neighbors, etc. but the above was too much.

Pleased with the maid service too :-) I have to say how excellent the breakfast service is! We weren't expecting too much but was very impressed. Its only a small room approx 6/7 tables but staff were very friendly here. You can have mini boxs of cereal, bread rolls, toast, jams, fruit, youghurt and various croissants - very nice! There is tea/coffee/milk/orange juice. Was lovely :-) The location of the hotel is good - close to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations. We only really used the hotel as a base to see Sister Act (which is brilliant!) and Phantom of the opera. Its also good to visit Westfields Shopping Centre which is at white city tube station on the circle line. Upon check out (11am) the gentleman on reception was friendly - we used the luggage room too which is good.

On arrival at the Hotel i was informed they had 2 bookings for myself one from london nights and the other from the hotels booking agency which i think are called crystal, the receptionist then informed me i would have to pay for one additional night due to the error. I expalined the situation and asked to speak to the manager whom i was told would be available in the morning, i also explained they had all my contact details including my mobile and email and that if their was any confusion over the booking why had'nt clarification been sought? I was unable to speak to the manager for my whole trip as they were unavailable. I checked out on thursday and nothing further was mentioned.

We received a substantial discount booking on line. We arrived using the London Underground, the closest station being Bayswater. The hotel is a pleasant 10 minute walk from Bayswater, through the popular shopping district of Queensway. The reception staff were polite, well dressed and the reception was spotless. The receptionist was helpful and we were given the option to change our room for another if not acceptable. We used the lift (tiny - use the stairs if claustrophobic!) and got to our 4th floor room, with a nice view onto Leinster Terrace/Gardens. The room was spotlessly clean, if a little compact, with a clean if slightly shabby en-suite shower room/toilet. The room contained a mini-bar, which proved useful for use as a fridge. Please note that the hotel is NOT licenced for alcohol, so the mini-bar only contained water and soft drinks. Tea and coffee making facilities were provided but we didn't get round to using them!

There was an excellent selection and was well worth the money. The breakfast staff were also excellent. One evening, we booked a taxi through reception. The taxi turned up promptly and turned out to be a chauffeur driven 'S' class Merecedes with full cream leather and blacke out windows. Prices were also comparable to 'black cab' charges, so I recommend booking taxis at the hotel if at all possible. The chauffeur was polite and referred to me as 'Sir', which was a nice touch. On check-out, we were alllowed to leave our luggae in a safe place for the remainder of the day at no extra charge. The hotel staff were polite and attentive throughout our stay.

The best part of this hotel is the location. It's located in Bayswater, close to a variety of restaurants, souvenir shops, and there's an indoor mall closeby. It's also close to Notting Hill, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. The subway stop is within walking distance from the hotel, and there are a couple of city tour bus stops nearby so it was easy to catch the double decker city bus tours. This was my 2nd visit to London. When we last time, we previously stayed in Earl's Court, and between the 2 locations, the Bayswater location was the better one. For our stay at the Duke of Leinster, we booked a triple room. Probably not a good idea, as the room was very small. My small office here at work is bigger compared to our room itself. The bathroom space was also very small. Not much closet space. We were given a room on the 6th floor. As we visited London end of Sept, the weather felt like the first weeks of Dec in California, and you get a nice/cool breeze when you leave your windows open. The only thing each late night, you do hear some yelling outside (probably by people leaving the bars) if you leave your windows open. It doesn't have any A/C, so it probably would be very hot to stay during the summer as the previous reviewers noted. The Elevator was very small. If you had suitcases, only 1 person at a time can fit inside, even though we were all thin. As you were taken up, you can hear screeching sounds. You get used to it, but the first flight up could be a little scary being inside a small and old elevator. Breakfast was good for a light meal before heading out to explore London. The staff though were all very friendly. None of them were British, I believe they were Eastern European, but they were all great and helpful. The only problem one morning, a bunch of drunken guys for some reason had access to our room and opened our door. Luckily the 2nd lock was working so they couldn't really get in. We reported this to the front desk immediately and it was all taken care of and we were given new keys right away. For a while though, I had doubts with security of our hotel room, but everything was okay after that incident. In my opinion, it was a good 2 star budget hotel, which we paid about $140/night for the triple room. It was a good base for our 3 nights in London.

The bathroom was actually bigger than we expected it to be, especially in comparison with the room size, but of course the shower stall is tiny.

My rates did not include any breakfast, but I could partake of Continental for 5 GBP or Full English for 7.5 GBP tacked onto the bill at the end of my stay. That was wonderful.

Both times, I was very pleased with the hotel. It's in a good situation near Kensington Gardens, yet convenient for public transport. The rooms were both small, but well organised and very clean. The shower rooms were good. The single room was on the ground floor and a little noisier than upstairs. In August, the hotel was very warm, but we had an electric fan in the room. Buffet breakfast was good and the breakfast room pleasant. The staff were all very nice and helpful on both visits. The cost was very competitive (I used a reliable website booking service). I'd certainly stay there again for good value for money and good conditions.", "Date": "October 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa fe, new mexico", "Title": "\u201cbeyond my expectations\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4066022", "Content": "My daughter and I just returned form an eight night stay at the Duke of Leinster hotel. After much internet reaserch, I decided on this hotel mainly because of the wonderful reviews that I read in trip advisor. The hotel truly lived up to what was written about it; in fact it more than exceeded my expectations. My daughter and I were warmly greeted by the staff when we arrived at 8:00am. They took our luggage, directed us to a coffee shop and had our room ready in 1/2 hour, which was greatly appreciated after our long flight. Throughout our stay, every member of the staff that we encountered greeted us with a smile and was very helpful. We had a twin room on the fifth floor (#506) which was rather spacioius and extremely clean and quiet. The bath was also spotless and had great hot water and strong water pressure. It was also very convenient to have a mini safe in our room. The neighborhood was very pleasant and felt safe to walk around in. The park is only two blocks away which was great for jogging and walking. It's a short walk to the subway and thus very convenient to get around London.

It was spotless and rather big, extremely quiet and had wonderful mattresses (beds can be pushed together). No view except of small private backyards but the room was bright enough through a big window. Rather small bathroom but with new facilities and absolutely immaculate; high ceiling, window (natural light) and great shower (for both temperature and water pressure). The 2-person elevator is obviously small since it was added to an old mansion; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pleasant alternative to walk down the spacious staircase and enjoy the original architecture of the house.

Breakfast is from 7 to 10 am on weekdays and from 7:30 to 10:30 on Sundays. Usage of the luggage room was systematically offered before checking in and for the rest of the day after checking out. Excellent service, and very friendly 24 hour staff. Good location near Circle line and busy Queensway, in a clean peaceful neighborhood.

I had a single room that i booked over the internet via the hotels direct web site, i found this cheaper than other methods. Included was a fab breakfast, boiled eggs, toast, juice, tea / coffee and the like. you could upgrade to a cooked breakfast for an extra 2pound. i had a small problem that was fixed by moving me to another room without any complications. Basically, the heating system was just being started up and noises were coming through my heater, so they happily moved me. This was great because i ended up with a larger single room. If travelling by yourself ask for room 504. This room as with all rooms had been recently refurbished, great, new but small bathroom, tv, tea /coffee making facitilies, mini bar hair dryer, room safe etc. Across the road was an internet cafe, camera shop, 2 grocery stores (small) and a couple of restaurants, mainly the area had some better hotels and some residential accomodation as well. The area was very safe to walk around even at night. The nearest tube was about 5mins away but Hyde Park was even closer. Would certainly stay here again. More like a 4 star than three, doesn't have a restaurant although not needed.
