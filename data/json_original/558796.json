It is also a tricky 12-14 minutes' walk -- with luggage -- from the main rail station (Venezia Sta. Lucia). Get the route and directions from Google Maps. NOTE that it's a long hike getting your luggage up and over the Scalzi Bridge across the Grand Canal, just past the rail station. 10 minutes walk to Rialto (if you don't dawdle, which is almost impossible), and another 10 min. to San Marco. 15 minutes to the Frari Church, and a few minutes more to the Scuola di San Rocco (spectacular, but you gotta love Tintoretto, or it's not worth it).

Make a reservation at Al Ponte Mocenigo as soon as you decide to go to Venice. It is a small hotel and fills up quickly. 2. Go to www.veniceconnected.com and buy a Vaparetto Pass. You can buy them online at a 25% discount. You hand your receipt in to any ticket booth and they give you a pass. The pass makes staying at Al Ponte Mocenigo even more convenient. We found this by accident, but it is legitimate and saves you a few dollars. 3. Go to www.veniceurbanadventures.com and book the Cichette tour with Cecilia for the first night you arrive. It leaves from directly across the Grand Canal from Al Ponte Mocenigo and is a wonderful and delicious way to learn your way around Venice. You can read the reviews for the tour on TA. 4. The map that Sandro and Walter give you has the main walking routes in Venice highlighted in yellow. These routes are very helpful for getting around. I agree that Al Ponte Mocenigo should be at 3 star hotel. Our room, Annex 44, was as nice as any room in a 5 star hotel, and probably larger! The staff could not have been nicer. The fresh baked croissants were wonderful. I also agree with the comments about the firm bedding, but we found that in a number of hotels in Italy. Before arriving we were concerned about the hotel location in Santa Croce. After a couple of days we learned the shortcuts and how close the hotel is to almost everything. If you get a Vaparetto pass you think nothing of jumping on to cross the Canal to get to Cannaregio and a number of good restaurants. A 3 or 4 stop trip takes you to the Rialto Bridge, which is a 5 minute walk from St. Marks Square (look on the map for Mercerie dell Orologio). This route is much faster than taking the Vaparetto to St. Marks, which can take 40 minutes from San Stae. There are also a number of good restaurants near the hotel. We enjoyed Al Ponte del Megio, a short walk from the hotel. La Zucca gets very good reviews, but book early, as we could not get in during our visit. Sandro and Walter were very help with recommendations and reservations.

Maybe because of the high ceilings, but even when we left the heat/light on for the entire day, it never quite warmed up. So every night we had to use 2 extra blankets we found in the wardrobe. This heat issue was problemtic for us, as we stayed in Venice in late November - and after walking around the city all day, we were craving some warmth of the room when we got back. Another thing was bare floors - there are no carpeting at all, and no rugs. That would be fine if the floor was wooden, but Al Ponte has stone floors - and they are cold. So even in the evening when you're in your pijamas, you had to keep your shoes on (no slippers were provided).

The breakfast was fantastic, with fresh croissants and coffee delivered to your table exactly how you like it. Walter and Sandro were such lovely hosts, really friendly and knowledgeable. On your next trip to Venice you MUST stay here, it truly is a hidden gem. I spent hours looking on TA for a place to stay - save yourself the effort and stay here you will not regret it.

The room was full of charm and architecture. I also decided to go for the private transfer and Sandro and Walter were very helpful when I asked about arranging this when we landed. Having arrived by water taxi we were guided from the water stop to the hotel (the water level was particularly low so we could not go directly to the door, although this is normally an option). We were a little bit perturbed by the entrance in a small dark alleyway but once inside we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault it. It turns out we were actually guided to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcback door\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, rather than the pretty main entrance into a courtyard, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be put off if you end up at the back door!

Only downside was the breakfast. Cereals and fruit juice were fine, as was the fresh fruit, but not being one for pastries (not keen on croissants), the choice was limited. It would have been nice to have had a selection of bread other than the small white rolls and maybe some cold meats / cheeses (although the Italian version of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDairylea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was an option). I'm not one for the traditional full English so was glad not to see that. As for Venice itself; what an amazing place. We are not really into sightseeing and walking but we spend two full days walking around (there is no need to use the water buses) getting lost at will and each new square we came into brought something new. The Jewish district was nice and quiet, with a few restaurants alongside the water (although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat there). Eating out was excellent. It's as expensive as you want to make it. Our evening meals varied from 45 to 105 euros (the latter was special for the wife's 40th - excellent meal at Vecio Fritolin). We also ate twice at Muro Pizza - a very place that does excellent food and wonderful beer (not your common everyday stuff). Be warned - it gets very busy even slightly out of season.

Some looked a little run down and I would not have relished going out in the morning straight into the hustle and bustle and commercialism of the Grand Canal. The location of Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is perfect, on the edge of the tourist area and in the traditional and very beautiful and peaceful residential area where you will see the real Venice.

Here you will find wonderful little typically local places to eat, far nicer and much cheaper than in the tourist areas.Very easy to get to from the airport (you will be emailed many travel options when you book.

Walter and Sandro were great to work with since we preponed our trip, but with the opening of the new annexe they were able to accomodate us. Directions they provide are spot on. It's less than a minute from the San Stae stop - which is the 3rd stop on the aliguana orange line from the ariport. Get off the boat and walk straight ahead and take the first left down a very very very narrow alley.. if you look high up on the wall leading to the alley the sign says the hotel name. Hotel is a few steps down. We used the map they provided and walked everywhere. It was awesome. Walter is warm and friendly and showed us an easy way to walk to Santa lucia train station. Bed is firm but great for bad backs and we loved it. The bathroom is huge, but shower stall pretty small...think NYC shower stalls. Room has a safe which was great. Room also has a phone which is good if you buy a calling card. Note: You may have to work with staff a little bit to figure out how to use the phone with the phone cards since I read a review here with some instructions, but the ones we used for room 41 were different. Staff mentioned they were another setup. Additional information: 1. Location is great - quiet and peaceful but close to everything. We were there 2 nights 3 days, and never used the vaporetto - walked everywhere. The rialto bridge is completely different at night. We love the tourist stuff, but it was amazing to also be able to get away from it and just wander the quiet areas. No cars so the peace was wonderful. We did do a gondola ride. There is one right by the hotel. We took ours from close to the rialto bridge and they offer you 3 prices - 80 euro for short ride; 100 euro for traditional ride ; 125 euro for long ride. 2. It's very hard to find a tabachi store that sells phone cards - we walked into several before finding one but it was worth it. Most no longer sell stamps. We ended up going to the post office - when you enter the post office take a ticket at the door (if you just want stamps take one with the envelope sign). They then call your number - different number ranges for different things. Move pretty quickly though. 3. Either carry a bottle with you (you won't need to buy water at the ariport once you cross security) or hold on to one that you buy. You can refill in Venice and Rome and the many public drinking water places. We drink a lot of water so this was great. Also public toilets are 1.5 euros. If you drink a lot you will need these. Carry change - there's a change machine but if you're a lady then the line just gets longer while you try to get change. 4. There is a bakery quiet close to the hotel - forget the name but they ended up being a chain - it's great for lunches.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki, Greece", "Title": "\u201cIt was an amazing stay\u201d", "Author": "greg_salonica", "ReviewID": "UR118402384", "Content": "This a very beautiful,small,charming hotel!People are doing great job there,all of them..We booked a double superior with canal view but when we arrived we were informed that there was was a problem with the previous guests there,so for 1 night we had to stay in another room.This didn't bother us at all as we felt very welcomed.Our first room(no 8 i think) was big and very beautiful decorated with big bathroom.No view but who cares??For the rest 3 nights we moved to our \"original\" room(no 5) facing the small canal.It was slightly smaller(i'm not 100% sure though) but again very clean and well decorated.We even had a small balcony with 2 chairs(although little uncomfortable) where we were siiting enjoying the views.Breakfast was served in the courtyard(weather wise) and we enjoyed it every single day.All in all,it was a great experience and can highly recommend it!This is a very popular hotel indeed and you may have to book months in advance to get a room!", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Loved It!\u201d", "Author": "JenniJuniper", "ReviewID": "UR118332403", "Content": "All the rave reviews are true.

I made the decision to opt for the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo. I have to say... it was the best decision I made. In walking through Venice, and going to major tourist attractions.. the sheer volume of numbers of tourists took my breath away. I could see the places were beautiful, but I just didnt enjoy it. becuase there was simply sooo many people. Hotel Al Ponte was miles away from the action, one reason why I didnt want to stay there, however, in hindsight, when I say how crowded Venice was.. the fact it was on the opposite side of the Grand Canal made for some beautiful and fantastic memories. The walk from the hotel around Venice takes you thru the quieter alleys, and more scenics parts wihtout the tourists. local little pizza bars, little parks, gorgeous areas. 100 mtrs up from the hotel is a church that sits on the Grand Canal. At 5.30 in the morning, I went for a walk, up to the church, sat there.. and watched Venice wake up. Commercial gondola's deliverying their goods, the sun rising up and over the grand Canal, the lights going out.. and the city waking up. What a treat. and all this a stones throw from this hotel. My room was beautiful. quant, well equiped, the service fantastic.. but it was the sincerity and the honesty in which the owners and their staff handle the guest.. you can tell they know what they have.. they treasure it.. and they want you to see what they see. It was wonderful. My room looked over the courtyard.. which was delightful.. two entrances to the hotel, one, over bridges and up the walkway thru the beautiful door.. the other via gondola to the water doors... its brilliant. This place is.. what Venice is truelly about.. not the overly commercial crowded Venice you see on TV.. but the romantic, gorgeous, historic little city.. that is a gem.. and this is the place to see it from. This city is a great place to walk around. so much to see, so much to do.. you get whiplash from looking at so much... and the great thing is.. if you get lost.. sit down.. have a coffee or get a drink.. and just watch... but a must.. you must try the nougat.. oh my gosh.....

Everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly - Walter even gave us a recommendation for dinner (Antiche Carampane) and made reservations for us. Breakfast at the hotel was light, but delicious! When you sit down outside the ladies take your drink order & bring you apricot pastries & bread/cheese, and you can also go inside the breakfast room to choose more pastries, cereals & fruits. A great way to start the day! The area surrounding the hotel is quiet but full of things to do (I highly recommend getting dinner at Muro, just around the corner)! My husband & I walked everywhere on the island, only taking a boat from the airport when we arrived and to the train station when we left. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up for it, I recommend it! The atmosphere around St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square & Rialto Bridge is very touristy and crowded, but just steps away it is quiet but just as interesting.

Would recomend Alilaguna from the airport, a bit dearer than bus and vaperetto but easier as you get a seat and no change with heavy cases. We arrived after 2 weeks camping via vaperetto from Punta Sabioni as recomended by the owners. If you ask them a question they give you very good information and options. It's tucked away down a very (very) narrow passage straight behind San Stae church, there is a sign but its small and about 10ft up the wall. Just get off and walk straight forward and take the first possible left, yes down there! The greeting refelcted our overall final impression of this B&B, warm and very human. We arrived somewhat fatigued due to San Stae stop being closed (first time in 7 years) and having to walk from 2 stops further up with 2 big cases. We were offered water and time to cool down by a very polite lady cleaning the reception area. One of the owners checked us in and helped with our cases to the room. He also gave the kids a business card each and told them that if we get lost or have a problem while we are out and about to ask someone to phone and he will help, nice touch. The room (no.10) was ready and set up with the 2 extra beds for the kids and everything explained. I keep refering to Al ponte as a B&B which I think is the best description, the room however is definately 'hotel' standard and 4 star standard. Tastefully and sympathetically decorated, as is the whole building, using expensive fixtures and fittings the room forms part of the 'Venetian' expeirence. Air-con, TV, mini-bar, hairdryer, power bath and spotless throughout, it is obvious a great deal of care and attention to detail as been used on this building. Breakfast is as everyone says in their reviews a great start to your day served quitely but very pleasantly by the ladies that I assume then go on to clean afterwards. If you want something you don't see ask and they will try their best to find something for you. We found the San Stae area to be a great area to stop in, far enough away from the summer madness of St Marks and the Rialto but close enough to walk, 10 mins to the Rialto and a furthe r10 mins walk to St Marks, all sgned and easy to follow. Would highly recomend a little restaurant just outside the passage called Osteria Mocenigo and the ice cream shop 50 yds past. Once again just ask and you'll be given great advise on where to eat. This is a B&B due it's lack of 'hotel' facilities, the ability to have a drink at night or a snack outside of breakfast would have been useful for us. However, as a B&B it is 5 star and exudes a warm human atmosphere while maintaining a professionaly run establishment. Our stay in Venice was significantly flavoured by our stay at 'Al Ponte' and I wouldn't hesitate in recomending this place without reservation.

I booked online through the hotel website, and found it really easy to use, no nonsense, and very informative. There was a minor mixup with the room I'd booked, and I was notified straightaway by email from the hotel owners. They were very apologetic and we actually ended being put in a superior room as this was the only one left (and at the same rate as the initial booking) - I thought this was great service. The hotel is very easy to find using the instructions they provide. Literally a 2 minute walk from the San Stae vaporetto stop. It's situated in a picture-postcard location, on the edge of a small canal, with the main hotel built around a small courtyard. The building and location really is lovely, and the area is very quiet indeed - very little noise from boats, and not much in the way of tourists in the area either. That said, it's less than a 10 minute walk to Rialto, and about the same in the opposite direction to the train station. Indeed, if you're exploring the city as a whole then this hotel is more or less ideally located right in the physical centre of the islands. We really enjoyed exploring the area and walking right around the islands to all the different areas. Whilst waiting to check in we were offered complimentary coffee and had a little chat with one of the hotel owners. We were then shown to our room in the building across the canal. The hotel consists of the 'main' part, centered around the courtyard, and a building directly across the canal, where they also have a number of rooms. The rooms really are terrific - huge floorspace, high-ceilings, with lovely traditional style furniture and furnishings, rugs, and a sofa in the room too. Felt quite cosy despite the enormous size! Our room had two large windows looking across the canal to the main hotel building, and was lovely and airy. The bathroom was equally cavernous, very well fitted out, and both the bathroom and bedroom were impeccably clean. I did find the bed a little hard at first, however this didn't really detract from the stay. Breakfast is in the courtyard area and it was really nice sitting there in the sunshine, enjoying the pastries, coffee and fruit that's served. The offering is quite simple, however, as with the rest of the hotel, it really surpasses itself for a 2* hotel - simple, fresh and delicious. We spent some time asking various touristy questions of the owners on reception on various days and they were extremely friendly and happy to help at all times. Nothing was too much trouble and we were very much made to feel at home. I gather from other guests we spoke to that this was also the case for them. We were recommended several reasonable restaurants serving very good food in the immediate area, and there are loads more in the more 'touristy' areas, all of which are within easy walking distance. As with the rest of the experience, checkout was a breeze - zero fuss. We stayed here due to the ratings on TripAdvisor, and I have to say it fully met expectations on all fronts - I really wouldn't stay anywhere else if I came back. As a 2* hotel it abviously doesn't offer the full range of room service, restaurant etc., however as a simple, comfortable, elegant, authentic, good value and welcoming place to stay it exceeded all our expectations.

We have stayed at Venice before, and the room was bigger than we expected. But without a door sill, which means that noise insulation is a little bit questionable. This was not a problem for us - thanks to an elderly couple who stayed at the next room, but it could have been otherwise... The view was just a brick wall, so there was no point to open the curtains. Another, minor thing was that there was no place to put shampoo/shower gel bottles in the shower except the floor, but that is easy to fix. Other reviewers have appraised the breakfast, and although I have travelled in Italy many times, and I am familiar with the standard ... I really, really would prefer having something a little bit healthier than sweet croissant / pastry.

The service/hospitality was more like that of a B&B. Each morning they serve breakfast in a courtyard which is made up of delicious croissants, bread, cereal, fruit, coffee, and fresh juices. Our rooms were spacious and comfortable with plenty of space to spread out our luggage. Our room was very elegant, with hardwood floors and chandeliers. The bathroom was nice & big for an European hotel and included a tub/shower combo. Note that there is not a lift/elevator. They did carry our bags up to our room for us, which was much appreciated. They do have rooms available on the first floor, which worked out well since my mom had a cast on her foot. After we checked out and were walking toward the taxi station, one of the staff chased me down because I left a bag in the breakfast area. It just shows how great the staff is!

Residing in a quiet residential area of Venice it is a delightfully decorated, clean and a very friendly place to return to at the end of a busy day exploring this amazing city. The Hotel has a delightfully peaceful courtyard where a breakfast of pastries, breads, fruit, yoghurt, fruit juices and tea, coffee or hot chocolate are served each morning between 8am and 10am and served with a smile and a happy chat each morning. All the staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and nothing was too much to ask for. Good service costs nothing and the hotel has it by the bucket load. My wife and I stayed in Room #8, a larger room decorated in vibrant reds and gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with lovely dark wooden flooring, high ceiling and fantastic Murano glass chandelier. Had a large bed (two singles joined together) that was slightly hard for the first night but this is a personal thought and not derogatory of the hotel by any means. Bathroom is also large and decorated to a high standard as well. Immaculately clean and tidy each day. On a map the Hotel may look to be away from the main tourist hot spots but it is not. Ten to fifteen minutes walk puts you at the Rialto Bridge and twenty to twenty-five minutes walk or water bus ride puts you into St. Marks Square. The water bus stop is ideally positioned approximately 2 minutes from both of the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entrances with directions are on the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website to find the main entrance from the water bus stop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not difficult to find at all. To get the you can take a water taxi which are private James Bond-esque beautiful craft that can take you directly to your hotel for 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5 persons but they are 100EUR. Alternatively and more affordable is the Alilaguna Water Bus from Marco Polo airport into Venice. At 25EUR return the Alilaguna line \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Linea Arancio\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd serves the St. Stae water bus stop which is approximately 4 stops or 50 minutes from Marco Polo airport, which also serves the #1 and N ACTV water bus lines, and is next to the hotel. To eat nearby I can also recommend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Osteria Antico Giardinetto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A small restaurant run by a husband and wife which is very near to the hotel. Go straight out of the hotel and over the bridge, go over two further bridges, then take first right and then second left. It is a lovely and small place with an open air enclosed court yard to eat alfresco. Food is superb, service slow but are you in a rush?

I can see why after our stay but I'm not quite sure I'd say it's the best place I'd ever stayed. Still very nice and if you can afford it you won't be disappointed. It's a lovely hotel. We had a Supreme Room \"Red Room\" which was large by European Standards. The bed was comfortable, mini bar was nice to have, and the bathroom was large and modern. The furniture was nice... but the blood red walls were something else! :-) The internet was the most reliable we encountered in our hotels in Italy. Worked very well! This hotel's popularity means they can charge much higher prices and people will pay. It is not cheap to stay here. It was nice not to have to put down a deposit for a room. Again - with this hotel's popularity if you cancel at the last minute they will most likely be able to re-sell the room. If you can afford this hotel - go for it! We walked to the hotel from the train station. Very easy to do in 10-15 minutes. The vaporetto station near the hotel is nice too and convenient. I love that you are not in the tourist center and more in a residential area of venice. St. Mark's is nice - but go once and avoid it the rest of the time! The rialto is a quick walk... but for a nice meal head south of Campo Santa Margherita and San Barnaba and have a meal at Al Casin Dei Nobili. It is nice that the hotel offers a free breakfast but it is very minimal and basic. The housekeepers will wait on you at breakfast. They are all friendly and nice but there simply isn't enough breakfast tables if all the guests come down at once... especially when it rains and you can't sit outside which happened twice while we were there. It was hard for the 2 housekeepers to continually bring out drinks to people while clearing tables and making sure the juice and cereals stayed stocked. In fact, of all the hotels we went to in Italy - this hotel had the most basic breakfast... cereal in individual pre-packages (corn puffs)... and then 2 croissants and 2 bread rolls for each table... plus yogurts and bananas and jam and those sorts of things. It was nice to have but I must say that I've heard people rave about the croissants (including some of my neighbors who stayed at this hotel a few years ago) and they were not that great in early June of 2011. Filled with a sugary apricot center... not a homemade flake apart croissant as some of the other reviewers mentioned. Twice we were served ones that were stale. That's really the biggest fault I could find with this hotel - and that is getting really nit-picky. While I am not sure if this hotel deserves to be the number one in all of venice... I can say that the men who run the hotel (walter & sandro) and the other men who work at the desk are all nice and friendly and will help with anything. They give you an excellent map at check-in and can help with anything if you need it. We didn't think dinner reservations were needed in Venice if you got to a place before 8PM but if you want, they can make them for you. It's a nice small hotel with nice male staff. Gay Friendly. Very Venetian. We would stay here again in the future - and we'd still sit through the same basic breakfast. It is free after all.

It is not in the main touristic destinations, so it is much quieter than other places, yet you can reach them in 5 minutes. It is just 1 minute walking from the Grand Canal. This means you cannot have a sight of the Grand Canal from your room. But if you walk a couple of meters you get to it. Rooms are excellent. They are really charming and cozy. The prices are very low for Venice, but you get an extraordinary hotel and room for what you pay. Plus, the breakfast is extraordinary, served by a really nice staff.

About eighty metres from San Stae and all on the level. Accommodation also serves only to please. We were allocated room in annex - no 31 on top floor.

The water taxi takes around 30 mins. from the airport and if you use a taxi company called ATPV ( their desk is in front of the exit from the luggage claim area), they know the hotel and will take you right to the hotel's water door (some companies will refuse to go down the narrow waterway). The journey will cost around 100 Euros although we paid 140 Euros as there were 8 of us. Our room was a family room, which slept two adults and two children. It was a good size and decorated in an authentic Venitian style. There were two other adult couples in our group and their rooms were also beautiful. My favourite was the green room with a four poster bed and a balcony that overlooks the small courtyard - stunning! Breakfast is basic but enough to fill your stomach. You can expect warm bread rolls, croissants filled with jam, a few cereals, fresh fruit, and some fruit juices. You are also offered a wide range of delicious tea/coffees - the lattes are delicious. We did all the obvious sight seeing i.e. Marco's Square etc. but we also took a public water taxi to the beach (Lido) and had a lovely couple of hours there. I would also recommend visiting Burano (one of the little islands surrounding Venice and famous for its lace). It's very quaint and there are lots of little shops to visit. Murano (famous for glass) is OK but we preferred Burano. It's well worth investing in a public travel pass when you arrive. It means you can hop on and off the water taxis and works out much cheaper than paying for each individual journey. You can get these passes from any Tabac.

This is an off-the-tourist- track hotel with an annex around the corner, where we stayed. The place exuded charm and the owners man the desk much of the time. The other people who worked the desk were also helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast ladies were kind and welcoming and greeted us each morning with a basket of rolls and fruit-filled warm croissants which were heavenly There was a spread of fruit, cereals, yogurts, etc. and made-to-order cappuccinos. Our room was large and lovely and the bathroom was ultra modern. We stayed for 6 nights, and the weather was perfect, in the 60's and sunny every day. We chose to see one sight a day and then we explored the area around that particular sight on foot. The first day I had booked the Secret Itinerary Tour of the Doges Palace in St. Mark's Square. This tour was great because it led about 15 people to the secret rooms of the palace that aren't opened to the public. The next day we went to the Jewish Ghetto and toured the synagogues, which was also very interesting. We walked to all of these places and never felt the need to take a vaporetto, although the vaporetto stop is right near the hotel. We discovered side alleys and interesting streets. There were always signs directing us to the main areas. If we got too far off the beaten path, we just had to walk a little further and we'd find a sign to Rialto Bridge or St. Mark's. Then we knew how to get back to our hotel. One day we walked to the Peggy Guggenheim Museum which is awesome. I planned our walk so that we would hit many of the beautiful campos. Then we walked the Zattere, which runs along virtually the entire southern shore of the Dorsoduro district of Venice. Around 2 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock we would stop for lunch, several days at Il Muro, near the hotel. We loved the lively square near the hotel, Campo San Giacomo. There were children playing, old people in wheelchairs or sitting on benches and people with dogs. There were cafes all around the square. We had a leisurely, unhassled visit in a beautiful city. We saw most of those same sights in 3 days 6 years ago, but never strolled around the different areas of the city. Instead, we rushed from one place to another.

Donatello even played our bartender when we just needed to get off our feet and another gentlemen quickly addressed a hot water issue. Ceilings are very pretty with the old wood beams. Garden is pretty although wet/cold and did not use for sitting but used it as entrance. Cons - a bit hard to find when roaming around by foot, hardest beds of our trip (3 hotels) making all our backs sore, rooms 1-4 on first floor are directly in the lobby so noisy when people checking in or chatting with front desk, you will hear every phone ring, etc. If staying, would ask for 2nd floor or perhaps annex which we did not see but a couple at breakfast told us it was close by. This is a nice location, off the beaten path of St Marks and a short vapretto route from bus, which took us from Marco Polo airport. It is lovely to walk through the various narrow alleys to find places even without knowing where you are going. Everything is within walking distance, although we took vapretto one time to make sure we were at our reserved spots on time for Clock Tower and Secret Itineraries of Doge's palace. The hotel does not reserve for you, so do it in advance. Both were great. Suggestion for hotel - move check-in to current breakfast counter, create a slider door of current breakfast area, so when people are checking in or wanting to have a glass of wine, they are not interrupting the guests. Then use the current check in area for additional tables for breakfast, which would be an issue for late sleepers in rooms 1-4, but better than hearing noise all night long.

Once we got back and found that our lock was jammed so someone from the front desk came straight away to help with it. We were also able to check out the night before (at 11pm) as we were leaving early the next day. - Location: I think this is the best part about the hotel.

The night staff, Oliver was very helpful and made sure that our breakfast was prepared a bit earlier the morning we left.

We booked on the basis of the TripAdvisor reviews. The hotel was difficult to find on foot. We arrived in the middle of the day and the weather was fine so not too much of a problem. In bad weather or rain, an alternative (water bus) to get you in the vicinity may be a better option. It is about a 20 minute brisk walk to St. Mark's which everything revolves around. Saying that it is a pleasent walk during the day and atmospheric at night. Venice (I think) is generally quite safe so although some of the dim alleys may look intimidating, do not be put off. There are not many places to eat and drink before you get to the Rialto area (10 minute walk) which was a shame. There is a water bus stop (Vaparetto) just outside the hotel although we did not often use it due to price and we liked to walk towards the centre. The price was good for Venice. Very reasonable. The rooms were very clean and the service provided was great. Beds a little firm for my liking but we slept well. Free wi-fi internet was available throughout the hotel. I big plus for me! One critisism was the breakfast which I thought lacked a little. After reading the reviews on this, I was left feeling a little let down. There was a good selection but it wasthe same every day and a little bit boring (again, in my opinion). If you don't mind a walk, this hotel will be great. Could be considered a little bit far for somebody who doesn't like a 20+ minute walk to get to the main attractions. We shared a bottle of wine on the last night in the courtyard area which was beautiful (even in winter). In the summer it would be fantasic. The drinks prices were extremely good (Bottle of prosecco for 10 euro!).

Firstly - if you are coming to Venise for the first time - this is how you get to the hotel: Ryanair flight arrived into Traviso (15km from Venice) In the baggage collection go to the ATVO machine and get a bus ticket for a return to Venice (cost 9 euro return) Go outside and get on the ATVO bus - there are people to guide you - very easy. The buses are there to meet the flights so they are always outside. The journey took us 40 mins there (and 1 hr return). Get off the bus at the last stop which is the bus station called Piazzale Romo. From here walk towards the water (opposite the bus station) to the Vaporetto stop (water taxi). Get a ticket at the machine - you only need to get a single ticket each (6.5 euros) and now mostly importantly you need to validate it by passing the ticket front of the validation machine. Get on the vapertto - route 1 and stay on this for about 10 mins. Get off at the 4th stop - called \"San Stae\". To get to the hotel - walk straight from the vaperetto stop for about 40 metres and take the first allayway (very very narrow) behind the church and the hotel is half way along. Hotel itself is lovely, warm and friendly. We stayed in room 21 which is in the same building as the hotel but via a different entrance. Room was extremley well decorated and furnished, with a separate lounge area. My only complaints about the room was that it was very hot as we couldn't turn off the radiator in the bathroom and the pillows were rock hard - I had to use the cushions inside. You can't really leave the windows open as it is very noisy when anyone walks past because the streets are so narrow everything is louder, there were still mosquitos around in November and the flood siren went off around 4am each morning. Breakfast was a selection of: cereals, rolls, an apricot crossant, biscuits, fruit, juices and a hot drink of your choice. Perfect to set you up for the day. Reception is very helpful - providing directions and a very good map to get around. You can walk everywhere in Venise and we walked back to Piazzale Roma on the way back to get our bus to the airport - takes about 20 mins. Ps. if you are going in the November a lot of people were wearing welly boots as the streets are often flooded in the morning. However - they do put raised platform walkways everywhere too!

Having just arrived from our upscale accommodations in Rome, Florence & Tuscany and not yet having become acclimated to this most unusual city we were taken aback when the desk clerk said he would help us carry our bags up two flights of stairs to our room. The centuries old, plaster, rock & brick walls had character but it all seemed so, so unimpressive. The wooden banister on each partial flight was sturdy and the last finial was not secured and rotated as I held on and made my final turn with one of luggage in the other hand and two small bags on my shoulder. The room was small and as I let the suitcase slip out of my hand, I looked at my wife and thought, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a mistake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she was okay. I looked at the deep green, upholstered walls, the Murano glass lighting fixture hanging proportionately amid the wooden, ceiling beams and the very nice, heavily draped, wooden double paned windows that opened past the shutters and looked out at the tasteful apartments across the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Aside from the bed and side tables, there was just enough room for a little foyer-type table and ladder back chair that would serve as a mini-desk and luggage stand. Did I mention that it also held a small, flat panel TV? Being an unsophisticated, man, I still cannot understand why European hotels waste precious bathroom space with a bidet. I suppose it is for the women when they are-a-pean. The shower in the bathtub with a half-tub enclosure and large sink were sparkling clean and the towel warmer was very helpful\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6to heat the bathroom on the chilly mornings. Two women who I believe doubled as chambermaids served breakfast and the croissants were by far the best we had in Italy.

Unlike Paris, we did not see one Starbucks in the five cities we visited in Italy. My expectation was a grander hotel right on the Grand Canal and near to one of the major attractions. After a day or so, I realized that we were very well located, no more than 150 feet from the Vaporetto (water bus) stop, which made it very accessible. There was a very nice restaurant across the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a hand-written menu and a lot of charm. We easily walked to piazzas no more than a few blocks in either direction; one, only steps away had the necessary tobacconist, all the gelatto you could ever ask for and a lovely restaurant with wonderful service and outstanding Zuppa di Pesce which was not even one of their signature dishes. In the other direction and a few more turns away, Giacomo dell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Orio was much larger and even had a supermarket. Al Ponte Mocenigo did not end up being a disappointment at all.

Every morning during our six day stay, I would smell those treats baking below our room at precisely 7:10 AM. It was the best alarm clock ever. Beyond that-- LOCATION: Quiet, yet accessible. After a long day sight-seeing in busy Venice, it was a relief to return to our peaceful street and hotel. The restaurants in the area are more reasonably priced since you're off the beaten path a little (ask the hotel for recommendations) but you're still a stone's throw away from the Vaporetto. We found it extremely easy to find the hotel from the Vaporetto stop. Also, if you get tired of navigating Venice's maze-like street, you can just hop on a Vaporetto. I'd recommend getting a Vaporetto pass, by the way--so much easier and a better value than buying tickets individually. ROOM: We stayed in the junior suite that overlooks the little courtyard. What a lovely, spacious room! The bath provided a wonderful way to unwind in the evenings. And mornings. The bed was slightly firmer than we are used to, but we still slept fine. The hairdryer could have been more powerful, but that is a minor complaint. The internet worked great, and you can get it renewed for as many sessions as you want for free. BREAKFAST: Need I mention the croissants again? The best I've ever had. Made to order espresso drinks. (No problem getting decaf i you need it.) I also enjoyed the bowl of fresh cut fruit each morning. Lots of other yummy stuff, too. CHECK-IN: We were able to check in early and also were offered an espresso drink upon arrival. Make good use of the friendly owners for suggestions and advice about Venice. And we got a nice discount for paying with cash at the end of our stay. My OWN VENICE TIPS: Instead of counting streets when walking around Venice, we got less lost if we counted bridges instead. We also found it easier to remember how to walk to the Rialto Bridge using landmarks instead of worrying about street names. Also, get tickets for the Clock Tower. Fabulous.

The rates are quite reasonable compared to other Venetian hotels and the location is good if you tend to do a walking tour of the whole city. It is about a 15 to 20 minute walk from the train station and about a half hour walk away from San Marcos Square. The vaparetto ride from the train station to the hotel initially seemed like a rip-off as the hotel is only the third stop (San Stae) from the train station on vaparetto number one (5 minute ride) as we paid 13 Euro for two people. The hotel is only a few minutes from San Stae station which is a good marker on being able to locate the hotel. After checking in, we were informed that our vaparetto ticket was good for one hour after from the time that it was stamped so we hopped back onto the vaparetto and made our way to San Marcos Square. It was a little confusing at first to realize that you needed to buzz in so that the receptionist could remotely open the gate. All entrances have cameras so that they can buzz you in. Although it is a 2 star hotel, it was better than the other 4 star hotels that we stayed at during our trip so I feel that this hotel is more worthy of a 4 star designation. We stayed in a double superior room which seemed to be quite new and had nice decor. We arrived very early in the morning at 8 am but they tried their best to get us into our room as fast as possible and we managed to check in at 11 am. The receptionist even helped us with our luggage to our room and once we got there on the other side of the building, we were treated to a beautiful room with an 11 foot ceiling. The washroom was very clean and in new condition. The two men that we met at the reception desk spoke excellent English and were extremely helpful and friendly. Wifi is available for three hours but you are allowed to ask for additional time if required. The phone system was complicated to understand as you had to dial 9 to inform front desk to connect your phone to an outside line. Once you were connected, you then dialed 0 and had to wait for a ready tone to dial your number. It was tough to locate a tobbaco shop which provided calling cards but it was well worth it. Our 5 Euro calling card was good for three hours to North America. One complaint that I might have is that you could hear noisy neighbours. The breakfast was one of the best on our 3 week trip throughout Europe and should not be missed. This hotel deserves the top rating available and I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Its is easily reachable (50 yards) from the San Stae vaporetto stop by going to the right of the San Stae church and then taking the first left into a very narrow alley. These directions were sent in advance by the hotel and meant luggage did not have to be dragged over bridges etc. We found several very good restaurantsand cafes in Santa Croce, which were recommended by the hotel and even a well stocked supermarket. All within only a few minutes walk, much quieter and less expensive than those in the more touristy areas of Venice which appeared to be very busy during July.

The staff was there to great us and made us feel at home right away. Our room was a decent size and we were quite content with our arrangements. My single bed was a little squeaky but after being up for 37 hours, I slept just fine... Our first order of business was to eat so Walter directed us to a place just a few steps away. The food was very good but the servers were a little unfriendly, no conversation or smiles, just a \"prego?\" Again the food was good and we did eat here a second time. There is a better place near the local mini market about 5 minutes away. Get directions to the market and as you pass over the 2nd bridge, it's just off to the right... the smells coming from the place were out of this world. The girls called the place \"2 sniffs up\" as the aromas were addicting. We walked by 2x just to smell the food. Ate here 2x as well. The first time I had lasagna, the second time was the chicken cutlet that was to die for. The location of the hotel is away from the main square but only takes about 15 minutes to walk over to the Rialto Bridge and then on to St. Marks Square. Or you can walk out of the hotel and jump on the water bus and just cruise the Grand Canal. We did that the second night we were there and took it to the end of the line, got a gelato and then strolled back at 10pm, feeling completely safe the whole time. The views from the Canal at sunset were awesome! If you are there for more the 2 days, get a 3 day water bus ticket. Nobody ever checks for it but if you do get caught without one, you have to buy the ticket and pay a fine... it was worth the $11 euro. If you want a place that's away from the touristy areas but close enough to walk to (everything in Venice is close enough to walk to) this is a great place to stay. As for the buffet, the croissants were the best I've ever had but the rest of the breakfast is just cereal and fruit but the staff was very helpful and friendly.

Walter, Sandro, and the entire hotel staff provide outstanding customer service and will go out of their way to make your stay quite enjoyable. The hotel itself is a gem. Old Venice charm and in a great location right off the San Stae vaporetto stop. The hotel is about 50 yards straight up from the stop, hang a left down the first tight little alley you see (there is a small sign that points the way). No dragging bags all over the Venice bridges. The hotel is in a residential area away from all the noise and tourists of the San Marco area but still only a short walk away. The Rialto Bridge is about a 10 minute walk and San Marco Square is about another 10 minutes from there. We stayed in Room #5 with the balcony overlooking the small canal outside the main entrance. The balcony was especially nice for enjoying the cool evenings with some wine. The room was always kept immaculate by the staff and the size was more than adequate. There was a computer with internet access right outside our door on the 2nd floor for guests to use. The front desk will provide you with a logon and password at check-in. We always looked forward to the morning continental breakfast in the courtyard. The lovely ladies who make the breakfast make sure everything is set up and make the most delicious jam-filled croissants. There is plenty of juices, fruit, cereal, rolls, and made to order coffee, cappuccinos, espressos, tea or hot chocolate. The breakfast will keep you full for quite awhile why you explore all the sites. There is so much to see and do in Venice, just get a map (one is provided at the front desk) and go out exploring. There are formalized tours that will take you to Murano and Burano but it was just as easy getting there on your own. Walter and Sandro will be happy to tell you which vaporettos to get on. The Venice Jazz Festival was going on while we were there so we spent an enjoyable evening at the Nora Jones concert in the Piazza San Marco. Here are a few my tips: Get the Venice Travel Card at the airport (or train station) for however long you're going to stay. It is the best bargain going as you will use the vaporetto quite a bit to get around the canal. Check out the Bacarro Jazz Restaurant & Bar for happy hour 2 for 1 drinks (4-7 PM), they make excellent bellinis and have pretty good pizza too. Stay away from Harry's Bar, snooty servers and they have a dress code (no shorts). Two of our favorite restaurants were the La Zucca and Osteria Antico Giardinetto, just minutes from the hotel. Check out the Hard Rock Cafe if you want some good old American food. The servers we had were fun (Bea and Mattia) Bring those inexpensive clear rain ponchos in case you get caught in a down pour. Umbrellas are dangerous in crowded areas as we saw several people get hit in the face due to inconsiderate people not caring who they ran into. Get to the San Marco Basilica early because the lines get long quickly with the cruise ship day-trippers. Get lost, that's half the fun of exploring this majestic city.

The location is superb \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a few stops past the train and bus station on the #1 vaporetto line. St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square is a pleasant 20-30 minute walk away. Or, connect through other vaporetto lines to access all parts of the city or the outlying islands. We stayed in the annex (room no. 34) and found the room very clean, comfortable and fairly spacious (especially for Venice). The bathroom was well-lighted, with all modern appliances. Access to the main hotel through the adjoining street was easy and convenient. Our room was quiet, as it faced away from the street. Breakfast is served in a delightful courtyard, which may be accessed through the hotel lobby or via a separate door from the canal side. The coffee and food are excellent (especially the croissants as noted in other reviews), and the service is attentive without being intrusive. Breakfast at the hotel is a great way to start one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day! Finally, a word about the overall service at Hotel Al Ponte Moncenigo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c outstanding! The front desk staff was so very helpful to us, recommending a particular opera production to us (Musica a Palazzo, which turned out to be fabulous) and giving us advice and directions to view the Giro de Italia bike race in nearby Mestre. They also made a (successful) recommendation as to where a digital camera battery might be recharged, as I had lost the charging unit on our trip. (for the record, camera stores will often perform this service; the recommended shop charged me 5 Euro to recharge a completely-dead digital camera battery). As many others have remarked on this website, Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is an outstanding hotel, combining location, accommodations, service and value to give their guests a Venetian memory that they will treasure for years to come \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or until they return!

What a satisfyingly great place. My husband and I was touring Europe for our 10Th wedding anniversary. We flew into Munich, stayed in Salzburg, also Vienna, and Venice, then back up to Munich. Our actual anniversary was at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo. It was very easy to find, even for our first trip to Venice. Venice is actually very easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. And finding this place was very easy. Venice is charming anyway, but walking up to that private bridge, ringing the bell for the courtyard and walking in the lighted entry is spirit stirring. I think our room was the least expensive one, but it was still very comfortable and elegant. The courtyard has statues and tables with chairs and is very pleasant. Inside is the long front desk and a small kitchenette at the far end where they make the morning coffee. All very nice and well decorated. Our room was the only one on the ground floor (I think) and our floor to ceiling window/sliding door was just above the courtyard out side. This didn't bother us or lower the quality of the room AT ALL. Our room was well appointed with satins, silks, and soft sheets. The armoire looked like an antique, it was beautiful. The bathroom had a huge, deep bathtub, which is rare in Europe. And there was marble and tile everywhere. You can tell they have put alot of effort in keeping with the quality of the hotel. There was plenty of room and to spare. I noticed a very old exposed beam over our bed and asked the owner about it. He said it is original to the house from the 1300s. We slept very soundly and well in the bed and all of our comforts were met. We don't not once hear the other guests (and we were told the hotel was booked) even when they were coming down for breakfast. The breakfast in the morning was especially perfect. It is a year later, and I can still taste the cappuccinos and these pastries that were as light as air,but had a surprising taste of raspberry jam inside. In nice weather they serve breakfast outside in the courtyard and every morning that's where we were. White table clothes, spring flowers, cool breezes with hot cappuccino, and my husbands face made this some of the happiest days of my life. The staff were SO accommodating and very friendly. They recommended a great restaurant down the way that had the best steamed muscles. The hotel is well situated in Venice and we got to and from anywhere quickly and with ease. Turns out it was owned by one of the doges before he was elected. Part of the house has been turned into a museum about him. All in all our stay here was amazing.

Although at the pricier end of the scale it is a beautiful Venetian hotel with friendly, helpful staff. The room was large and spotless. The towels were changed daily and toiletries topped up daily too! (Always a bonus!!) There is plenty of storage space and a safe is also provided. The rooms were quiet and the bed was large and comfortable. The hairdryer provided is almost like a hose which fires out hot air, but served its purpose!! Breakfast is included the price and you have a fairly good selection; croissants, bread, cereal, yoghurts etc served by the friendly staff. The reception staff were helpful and chatty and made us feel right at home. They were very accommodating - looking after our bags on the last day. The hotel provides a map of Venice, internet access and there are various books around about Venice. The hotel is located in a quieter area which we liked - I imagine in the summer it would be good to get away from the crowds. It is 2 mins walk from the San Stae stop regularly served by the No 1 Vaporetto. Realistically you can walk to the hotel from the bus station, but until you have familiarised yourself with Venice it is probably easier to get the no 1 and walk around the corner. We arrived on the vaporetto and walked back to the bus station when we left. It is ideally located to get around Venice - I think we covered everywhere in 2 days!! Easy city to walk around - it's very small and you start to recognise the small streets pretty quickly. There are many restaurants and shops around the small streets of the hotel and these are slightly cheaper than in the touristy areas but just as good - if not better. We ate in the restaurant around the corner and the recommended vegetarian restaurant both of which were fab - with amazing food, great service - one restaurant owner translating the entire menu for us!! - and no separate 'tourist' prices. The cake shops are also well worth a visit!!! We had one day walking and one day boating - which was necessary after the day walking and we are both pretty fit - loads of sights to see and we just wandered around and followed our noses - impossible to get properly lost as the place is so small and you just follow the signs for tourist attractions. All in all we had a great time and stayed in a great hotel - would stay there again and would thoroughly recommend it if you can afford to splash out.

Staff were pleasant & helpful, always happy to spend time giving advice. We agree whole-heartedly with the other good reviews re this Hotel on Trip Advisor so I will use this space to give some advice to people who, like us, have never been to Venice before. It really is a beautiful city - absolutely unique and we will definitely be back . When we arrived, we went out to explore near the hotel and immediately became lost amongst the virtual maze of narrow alleyways that make up Venice . We found it all rather alarming initially as wandering around in narrow alleyways totally goes against all personal safety advice normally given to holidaymakers. HOWEVER, having decided to return to the hotel I picked up a copy of \"Italy For Dummies\" in the lobby and was so glad I spent an hour reading the section on Venice or I don't think I'd have left the hotel again !! Apparently, Venice is virtually crime free (apart from pick pockets) and getting lost in the maze of narrow streets and alleyways is all part of the fun. As long as you keep an eye open for \"Al Vaporetto\" signs (found on corners of some buildings) you can always make your way back to the Grand Canal where the Vaporettos (water buses) can be found. The hotel is literally a stone's throw from the San Stae Vaporetto Stop so you should find your way back to base without any problem. After we realised this basic fact there was no stopping us and we were happy to wander round the maze of streets in all the historical areas of Venice, jumping on and off Vaporettos at different stops along the Grand Canal. I'm not really into shopping while on holiday but felt totally different in Venice as the shops are just amazing. Fantastic choice of handmade jewellery, wood carvings, Murano glass wear and all manner of crafts with prices to suit every pocket .

Charm, charm charm--staff room, servers, rooms etc...all great. Courtyard where breakfast is served is really nice. This hotel is far away from tourist areas (not so far you can't walk to them in 5 min) this is a totally quiet residential area, and wandering and finding shops, restaurants and piazzas where families are gathered is charming and much more interesting than the crowded tourist areas (of course you want to see the tourist sights, but this hotel lets you leave the crowds behind).

The bathroom has a big shower with a towel warmer- so nice! One window overlooks the courtyard. We would wake up to the smell of the fruit filled croissants every morning.

I turned to TripAdvisor, and it delivered! We compared several hotels and chose Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo over the others. We booked via email with ease, securing a very good rate for Venice that included breakfast. For anyone who wants to sleep a family of four together, you know how hard it is in Venice especially. Look no further! We arrived by vaporetto and rolled our luggage to the back entrance, which is traditional Venice: hidden, close, and just big enough. It really is only 30 meters from the boat stop! Sandro greeted us warmly, checked us in, and took us into the annex to our room with two large windows that overlooked a pretty garden and streamed in moonlight when I opened the curtains during the night. The construction and furnishings are new, the decor classically styled. Our room had a lovely green theme that matches one of the rooms in the Doge's Palace- my children were thrilled at that discovery! In addition to the queen bed, there were two single beds lined up in our room with just enough room for all of us. The room is on par with any major city sizewise- (compact) but these rooms featured beautiful wall coverings, tall ceilings, wooden beams, and murano chandeliers, which equals comfort and luxury at a high level. I was worried about the location being too close to the train station and too far from the attractions we wanted to visit- but it turned out to be ideal and central to the whole city. A five minute walk from the Rialto Bridge, the hotel is literally right next to a wonderful museum, the Palazzo Mocenigo, which is worth a visit for the architecture, costumes, furniture, and paintings, and was a free attraction on our tickets to the Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palace. Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo has easy to access all the parts of the city, either by foot or boat. We elected to get 72-hour vaporetto passes and utilized them frequently to tour the city. It is a great bargain. In the past I have always used a water taxi to return to Marco Polo airport traditionally, but not this time at the steep price of 100 Euros. We traveled by bus for ten Euros instead. In addition to a lovely breakfast served in a quiet, quaint environment with great service, I'd be remiss to not thank the additional staff. In addition to Sandro and Walter, the other gentlemen who manned the front desk also knew the vaporetto and bus schedules off the top off their heads, suggested wonderful local restaurants, gave us easy routes to travel, and provided many other details we have not found from 5-star hotel concierges. The waitresses in the morning promptly brought us second cappuccinos, and were the same staff who cleaned the rooms with quiet finesse and perfection. They seem to be long-term employees who are treated by management with the same kindness afforded to guests. It's a rare thing to find a wonderful hotel that treats you better than family, with all the touches of a luxurious home, in a private setting. I can't wait to return. I agree with several previous reviews that claim this hotel is under-rated. It truly deserves four to four and a half stars. We had excellent service on many levels, enjoyed great comfort, and loved the luxury of the room, furnishings, and bathroom. I am telling everyone I know who visits Venice about this hotel, because the great prices can't last forever. Perhaps they are much higher during Carnevale, but we had an excellent value, and we could not have enjoyed the hotel any more.

Once at the hotel its a five minute walk back to the Rialto and 20 minutes to St Marks when its quiet. Leave visiting the Rialto and St Marks until after 4pm when all the day trippers have left. The Doge Palace is very quiet at this time and is much more enjoyable. Use you visit to get off the tourist routes and head towards Academia , its a very pleasant enjoyable stroll through some lovely piazzas.

We had pre-booked from New Zealand after having read the positive reviews in Tripadvisor and our emails were responded to promptly. On arrival at Santa Lucia station, we bought a 48-hour ACTV tourist travel card for 28 euros each, which was far cheaper than buying the standard one-way fare of 6.50 euros per person. From here, it was a short vaporetto ride (#1) down the Grand Canal to San Stae (third stop). On arrival and unknowingly, we chose the more difficult route to the hotel (difficult in the sense that we were lugging two relatively heavy cases). From the vaporetto stop, we walked left in front of the church, crossed the bridge (with its steps), then turning right, walked about 30 meters along Fondamenta Rimpetto to the private bridge (more steps) that leads to the hotel entrance with its stunning little courtyard. The easier way, for those with luggage, is to walk straight ahead from the vaporetto stop, then take the first calle left and ring the bell at Number 1984/b, the hotel's secondary entrance. Sandro welcomed us warmly, then took us around to the Annex (a new addition, but decorated in the same style as the main hotel) just around the corner. To gain entry later on, you ring the bell, which is connected to reception and they check your identity visually before opening that door; a very secure system.Our room was up two short flights of stairs, next to a small lobby with a bureau, on top of which were travel books and other reading materials. The room was spacious, having a high stud with exposed beams, a large Murano chandelier and olive-green fabric walls.The only drawback was that the room was slightly underlit, even with the side lamps on. The bathroom, in green and gold marble, and tile, could only be described as well-appointed luxury. Breakfasts (described in detail elsewhere) were always a treat with great cappucino served by the friendly and attentive female staff in a pleasant courtyard with its columns, pedestals, statues and floral arrangements. After having walked and/or taken the vaporetto to Piazza San Marco, we were so pleased to have chosen this hotel as a base; no hassle with luggage on a crowded vaporetto and no traipsing over cobblestones in the Piazza SM, struggling with luggage through crowds of sightseers, which unfortunately was too common a sight. Another advantage of the hotel's position was that it was close to the Cannaregio area with a great Billa supermarket, wine bars and restaurants. To get there, we crossed the canal to the next vaporetto stop (Vap.#1 in direction of San Marco) to Ca'd'Oro, then walking straight ahead to Strada Nova, turned left there, and along over a bridge to the supermarket (on the right at Cannaregio 3659) with its freshly baked bread rolls, meats, cheeses, cheap beers and other provisions. The hotel has details of recommended restaurants etc. From San Stae we took the Vap.#1 to nearby San Toma for the two great, not-to-missed 'art treasuries,' the Basilica Santa Maria dei Frari and the Scuola Grande di San Rocco. Also within walking distance are the wonderful Rialto fish, fruit and vegetable markets and the iconic and very crowded Rialto Bridge. Finally, we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, based on our own experience there.

We were immediately made to feel very welcome. The gentleman on the desk took our bags around the corner to the Annex where our room was. And what a lovely room. Spacious bedroom with a separate smaller room where the wardrobes were and also a second TV. There was also a divan which could be made into an extra bed.

You cannot enter any part of the Hotel until you press a buzzer at the particular door (either to the Annex or to the main part of the Hotel).

We had to travel to the airport when we departed. After considering the various transport options, we decided to book a water taxi from San Stae to the airport because of our very heavy bags and the difficulty of boarding a busy vaporetta with them.

No problems, Walter arranged for the water taxi to take us part of the way then we were taken by a hire car directly to the airport at no extra cost. It was worth it.

Walk to the right rear side of the church, and there is an alley (3 1/2 feet wide) on your left with a sign up on the wall for the hotel. Walk down the alley 50 feet, and you are there. If you stay at the Annex (we stayed in Room 31 there, quite nice. but up several flights of stairs at the top floor), you don't go down the alley, but keep going and the door to the annex (part of the row buildings) is on the left. Your choice in the annex, is a room overlooking the busy walkway from the boat, or a back room overlooking a garden. We liked hearing the people walking by and looking down the walk toward the water/landing. Room was nice size, very good shower , air control, and the firm beds we like- pillow was a little too firm, but a minor complaint. All the people we dealt with at the desk were friendly, and helpful- they have very nice maps of the city and made reservations for us (even before we arrived, for dinners). The meal at La Zucca (around the corner near the gelateria!!!) was excellent, and very reasonable. We also ate near the Rialto area at Osteria Alle Testiere, a small, friendly, very good food and expensive restaurant. I had read good things about La Vedova (Osteria Ca'D'oro)- don't believe it- it was very limited in the menu, acceptable food at a modest price, but nothing worth seeking out. Most pizzas we had in our Italy stay were very good (even in the tourist areas), and had the thin crispy crust, not the thicker crust that most pizza parlors have in the U.S. Most pastas were also excellent and appeared \"homemade\". The bread was, by and large, terrible (the bread at La Zucca was good and the best we had in Italy, and we went to several cities after Venice). The gelati was good no matter where we bought it, and is cheaper, by and large, than U.S ice cream cone charges. By the way, all restaurants charged a cover charge (for bread, etc.) but that means you do not have to tip more than a euro or two in addition. House wines are also very cheap (sometimes same price as a coke) and often you can buy a carafe of 1/2 or full liter for under 10 euros. Venice is very walkable, and we did not use a boat/gondola other than coming with luggage, and leaving with luggage. The boat system provides for buying a ticket, or multi-day pass, then validating it at a machine before you get on. Nobody ever checked to see if we had tickets (we had bought the specific trip ticket- I think 6 euros each), so if you want to take a chance, you might get away with it. From the airport, as others mention, you take an inexpensive bus to the western edge of the city, and get the boat from there. There is very good signage on the sides of buildings for the main areas (Rialto, etc.) and it is fun negotiating these very narrow alleys that pass for main pedestrian throughways. Shops selling glass and masks are everywhere, so don't buy until you've had some time to compare prices and items- prices do vary for the same things, depending on the location of the shop. Be prepared for crowds, and a long wait to get into St. Marks, but people watching is enjoyable. We were able, between 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to literally make the circular walk from across the other side of the canal near the Jewish section, clockwise past Rialto to St. Marks, eat lunch, and down to the Peggy Guggenheim Museum (a wonderful and unexpected number of enjoyable modern garden scultures and Yoko Ono's wish tree, among other installations) and back up to the hotel- you just need good walking shoes. There are a number of restaurants that do not take Visa/Mastercard, so bring/get cash with you. The city felt very safe, even late at night, so feel free to stroll.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery clean hotel with good service\u201d", "Author": "GNTLondon", "ReviewID": "UR32512105", "Content": "I have recently returned from a visit to Venice with my husband for our wedding anniversary.

The stay preceeded a 7 night cruise leaving from Venice. Took a water taxi from Marco Polo airport straight to the \"water door\" at the hotel. Expensive (95 Euros one way) but most convenient after long travel day from the US. Slightly less pricey alternatives are there, but with lots of luggage, the savings didn't justify the hassle. A room was ready so we were checked in around Noon and off to explore Venice a bit before we crashed and burned from travel fatigue. This 10 room hotel was converted from a large single family home about 4-5 years ago. Our room had a 2 large windows and was on the canal side. We had to lean out a bit to look down to see the canal, but we were out exploring most of the time, so the view didn't matter much to us. The room was large enough (king sized bed, loveseat, small table with 2 chairs, a large armoire, and a small refrig/minibar. Floors were a nice hardwood. We thought the walls were wallpapered, but they were treated with a hanging fabric. Very cool and classy. Our bathroom was bigger and more modern than I expected. As I recall, there are 5 rooms on each of the 2 stories. We were upstairs, which seemed better than the rooms on the main floor which opened right onto the lobby and small coffee/bar area. The place is very secure with a locked gate out the canalside door, and a locked door if you leave on the street side (wow, what a narrow alley leading to this door!! Barely wider then my shoulders.) Someone is at the desk all the time. You'll get valuable exploring tips from any of them (Co-owners Sandro and Walter, or Donatello, or the night man who's name escapes me at the moment.) I can't say enough about the entire staff including the ladies who staff the morning breakfast bar area.

Breakfast was great- the outdoor courtyard was lovely and the food was excellent. I loved the filled croissants and the cappuccino. The only real con we had were that for one, the bed was really hard and slightly uncomfortable for us. It didn't stop us from zonking out each night, however. The location was both a pro and a con. Pro- it was a little out of the way so you do get a little bit more of a taste of \"real\" Venice, as opposed to the crowds upon crowds at St. Marks and Rialto. Plus La Zucca was right around the corner (suggested by the front desk) and I had the best lasagna of my life. The hotel is right down from a vaporetto stop, so it was easy to get on and off, as long as you take the slow #1 boat. Con- I usually prefer to be a little closer to the action. Most of the time I prefer to walk to get to things, and a walk to Rialto was probably 15 minutes at the height of the crowds, St. Marks was probably 20 minutes. Venice is a maze, so it was sometimes a little stressful getting back to the hotel, especially at night when the alleys and streets are more deserted. I think next time I might want to try a hotel closer to the main sights. One other thing- if you can, go out for a walk around late at night. We went out for a last-ditch effort to get in a gondola ride after the rain stopped on our last night at almost midnight. The streets were deserted.

It was utterly beautiful and surprising, especially when I got my backside groped on a Vaporetto, a bonus at my age \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 :o) I read and researched so many hotels via Trip Advisor and finally decided on Al Ponte Mocenigo and am very glad I did. All the photos portray the hotel exactly as it is and everyone is right, it was positively lovely, spotlessly clean and the staff brilliant. It's incredibly easy to find, get off Vaporetto stop San Stae, walk straight ahead and look up a little to your left. Yes the sign is a wee bit small but that just adds to the fun of it all. The alley way is one person wide, brilliant and the hotel is next to a home that provides singing lessons. Quite amusing to listen to the warblings of would be singers, but don't worry it was not at all disturbing in any way. We had room 9, the red room. In the photos it looks a wee bit overwhelming but in reality it's grand. When I lay to sleep I felt like I was in a castle with the extremely high and can I just add here, very clean ceiling, with its wooden beams. Very lovely. Will say also, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any views in No. 9, but who needs them with all of Venice to explore. My only real gripe, the beds. My friend and I shared a room and when one is use to a king size bed, to suddenly find you are down to a wee 3 footer, if that. Oh my.. once or twice I nearly rolled right off. The floors are all wibbly, wobbly in the old buildings as well and my bed on a wee slant. It was interesting to say the least, but I learnt to sleep uphill, so all was good in the end. One thing I didn't read about in any of the reviews, so I will add it here. Is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSwaying\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. After travelling about a bit on water, you suddenly find yourself in bed, on the wibbly, wobbly floor, trying to sleep and suddenly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all moving, bit like tripping I guess without the drugs\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Brilliant!!! (Joking!!!) :o) But no, I found it really got to me and by my last day I was stood in a shop thinking is it me moving or the shop, most bizarre. It even stayed with me for a day or two when I got back home. So for anyone without sea legs, be warned. Anyway, back to the hotel. It is simply lovely and delightful, oldie worldy and veritably Venice. Dishy Sandro greeted us when we arrived and was warm and friendly with good English. It was quiet and cosy and he helped us with our luggage and explained the room and breakfast and helped with directions and restaurants and just about anything else I am sure. He was most accommodating however, when I, like a donkey forgot to reset my clock and we promptly arrived for breakfast at what I thought was 9.30am but was in fact 10.30am. The shocked looked on my face was obvious and the lovely ladies who do breakfast, got everything out again to feed us. Sandro laughed but probably thought, what strange people these English are. Donatello another lovely person was also very chatty and helpful, as was everyone else, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get all their names. I truly would recommend this hotel. Granted different people can have different experiences, but for us it was quiet, clean and lovely. The staff were so lovely (did I say that already) and it showed they enjoyed working there. The ladies that do breakfast were like your favourite Aunty who spoilt you. Oh and their Hot Chocolate is very yummy. So if like me you dither with decisions\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, just go. Take your very best comfy walking shoes and get exploring. Oh and two more things, learn some Italian. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on them speaking English. I learnt some basics, very easy, but every time I did ask \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcparla inglese?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I was greeted with umm small, not much\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Do some research into restaurants, everything is very expensive in Venice but we found some good restaurants and one not so good. And lastly (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you tell I fell in love with Venice) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stick to the tourist areas, wander, go and explore around every corner there is a new view and pretty courtyard, beautiful, romantic buildings and friendly people. Oh and on wash day you walk down tiny lanes with the smell of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcComfort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the air. If like us you are staying a few days, venture out of Venice too.

I am not exaggerating when I say that this place really does live up to the positive reviews it has received on this site - it is an absolute godsend! I have stayed in Venice before and I know that price and quality usually don't go together - in the case of Il Ponte Mocenigo, however, you get MORE than you pay for. The hotel owners are EXTREMELY friendly and helpful, speak excellent English, appreciate and anticipate what visitors to Venice may need (help with finding places, providing guide books, an umbrella, wellies for the frequent acqua alta conditions, maps, advice on where to eat, what to do, what parts to visit, general local knowledge etc.) and make your stay as comfortable as possible. This was our experience anyway and we weren't in the slightest bit disappointed. One complaint I have read on here about Il Ponte Mocenigo is the extent of the breakfast they offer. All I can say is that it is perfectly adequate for Italy and especially for Venice. They offered exactly what you would normally expect in Italy, or indeed in most southern European countries. In any case, for the price, it was fine. The hotel is a little tricky to find at first, though once you get your bearings, you will find it easily. It is no more than a few minutes' walk from the San Stae vaporetto stop, which is conveniently on the vaporetto route number 1 which plies the Grand Canal from Piazza San Marco to Piazzale Roma and back again. It's very useful to get to basically all the important places in central Venice. The area around the hotel is more typically Venetian than around San Marco because it is not a tourist hotspot, meaning that the prices of bars, restaurants and shops are lower than in other places and the atmosphere is a bit more authentic than elsewhere. We would recommend a retaurant on Salizada San Stae (the road behind the hotel, where the vaporetto stop is) called Osteria Mocenigo (not associated with the hotel - the name Mocenigo is derived from the Palazzo Mocenigo, next to the hotel). The food was excellent and the prices were very reasonable - around 20-30 euros per head including a bottle of house red, which was fine. You can get cheaper, but beware of the quality at many places. I really have nothing negative to say about the hotel myself, it was wonderful. The bed was comfortable, the rooms were warm, they had satellite TV (not that you will spend much time in the room anyway, there is too much to see in Venice!), the rooms were fully and newly renovated with modern bathrooms as well.

Walter and Sandro and all their staff are very friendly and you do feel welcomed immediately. We stayed in the new building on the 2nd floor, and apart from the climb with the heavy suitacases, it was a lovely room with ample space. No view to speak of but that wasn't a problem. Free wireless service and breakfast included. The breakfast spread wasn't huge but whatever there was, it was excellent and there's always a ready smile from the staff. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here and I'll not hesitate to be back the next time I'm in Venice. This should be a 5-star B&B.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood stay but could have been better\u201d", "Author": "kokamura", "ReviewID": "UR24239314", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Al Ponte Mocengio for three nights in their renovated annex and enjoyed our time there. Good points: 1. Very friendly staff, particularly Carlito who was on at night and was incredibly helpful and made us feel right at home and also the ladies who served breakfast in the morning. 2. Our room was nice and big for the price, with very traditional Venetian decoration. 3. We appreciated little details like the stacks of guidebooks and also the umbrellas by the door that were left out for guests to use - we needed the umbrella while we were there. 4. The hotel is located in a quieter area but the main attractions are still walkable, which would probably be good during the busy tourist season. It was also easy to get to from the airport. Bad points: 1. Bed were very, very hard. I like firm beds but this one was just too hard for me. I had to shift a number of times in the night as my sides would get sore. My husband said he slept fine. 2. Limited hot water. On our first day the hot water ran out after I had a bath so that my husband had to wait to have a shower and it was still just warm. 3. The breakfast is mediocre. They could make a bit more of an effort with it. The warm croissants were nice but the cheese is of the processed triangle kind and the rolls the cheapy white kind. To be honest though it did keep us going for the morning. 4. No Turkish bath. This was broken while we were there and the owner admitted that it had been like that for a while and they didn't know how to fix it. It's a pity as we were looking forward to it (we love saunas), especially after reading about it on their website. In fact it was one of our main reasons for choosing the hotel.

I was offered a superior double for single occupancy, at a rate of 115 euros a night including breakfast, internet and taxes. It seemed like a great deal to me and I was not mistaken. The hotel itself is just beautiful; my room had the highest ceiling stud I have ever slept under (18 ft? 20?) and the room walls were covered in scarlet silk, with beautiful murano glass lampshades and chandelier. The bed was, as is normal in europe, twins pushed together, but was very comfortable non the less. the bathroom is marble clad, with toilet and bidet, shower and bath. Basic toiletries (soap, shampoo, shower cap, shoe shine buff) were provided but I had my own so I did not mind the lack of shower gel etc. My room was over the tiny narrow back alley, so nice and quiet. Even though it was freezing outside, my room was too hot - and this with the heating turned completely off. I slept with the window open each night, and with an extra blanket on the bed to keep my shoulders warm, was very comfortable. Location wise, the hotel is a 2 minute walk from the S. Stae vaparetto stop; IGNORE the directions on the hotel website; they had me drag my heavy case over two bridges and up and down the accompanying stairs to go to the front entrance, when there was absolutely no need to do so. I can not understand why the hotel puts this down as its directions. Instead, go to the back door by walking straight ahead from the vaparetto stop about 50 mts, and take the first (and only) narrow alleyway on the left; there is a hotel plaque on the wall as you come to the alley. the back door is down the alleyway by the canal - there is another sign and a door bell. no stairs, no bridges, could not be quicker or easier. Located in Santa Croce, there are fabulous restaurants just moments away (try to get a booking for La Zucca and don't miss the pumpkin flan - it was amazing!) and a mini supermarket on the square just up from La Zucca. It takes about 30 minutes by Vaparetto to San Marco Piazza, and about 10 minutes in the other direction to the train station and the piazza where the buses to the airport arrive and depart. Breakfast is served downstairs from 8 - 10 and is the standard continental breakfast. there are a couple of types of boxed cereal, yoghurt and milk, with a bowl of fresh fruit. 3 different juices, and some baskets of the sweet biscuits that seem popular in italy . on the table are placed two small rolls and a sweet croissant (filled with some sort of fruit paste), with soft cheese segments and butter. coffee or tea of your choice. all served with a smile by the very polite staff. Walter, the owner, is an absolute credit to his profession. He went out of way to correct my rookie mistakes (getting me a dining reservation at the last moment, giving fantastic touring advice) and not making fun of me for my excessive internet usage (I was on my own so keeping in contact at night was important to me).

Despite booking early, we found that our only option here was to stay in the annex., which was a newer addition, a one minute walk away. We had stayed in the Dorsoduro/Accademia area previously (probably still our favourite), but wanted to get a different angle on Venice by staying elsewhere and this location proved to be very good also. Upon arrival, the evening front desk manager helped us with our bags and showed us to the annex. It had its own security entrance with a speaker system to identify ourselves to the main reception desk, so we could gain access. This was good, as security was my main concern when you are \"off-site\". The building was tastefully renovated and the room was large for Venice, set up as a small suite with a sitting room and a separate bed room and bathroom. Wireless internet was provided, which was extremely handy for phoning home. The room decor was olive green and gold and felt very comfortable. The bathroom was similarly clean and fresh. I guess the only downside to our arrangement was that we found it slightly odd to arrive at the hotel proper in the mornings for breakfast. However we were made welcome by the owners and the restaurant girls, who were great fun. The setting in the small courtyard off the canal was probably the best part of breakfast. The attentiveness of the guys at the reception counter was excellent. When I had managed to mess up the room safe and locked it open - don't ask me how - they fixed it for us quickly with no fuss. I can't fault the hotel. It delivered a good quality accommodation for our 4 nights, at a good price and in a good location. We liked it.

We selected this hotel based on the Trip Advisor reviews and we were not dissapointed. We made our reservations in July for our November trip and could only secure a room in the annex at that point. This however was not in any way a disadvantage. Our little suite in the annex was charming and spotlessly clean. This 14th century building has been beautifully upgraded by Walter and Sandro. You will absolutely feel the charm and beauty of ancient Venice and still have every modern convienence. Breakfast was wonderful and made even better because the service staff was always smiling and friendly. Our bed was one of the most comfortable that we experienced during our 16 days in Italy. The bathroom looked brand new and we could tell that the hotel staff makes cleanliness a very high priority. It was such a pleasure to open the beautiful windows in each room of the suite. The windows overlooked a lovely little calle that has the feel of a true nieghborhood. We felt very secure at the hotel. Access to the annex is monitered by camera from the main hotel lobby. Our room was also equipped with a safe and a flat screen tv. The location is terrific. All of the major tourist sights can easily be reached on foot but if you want a vaporetto or water taxi the stop is a one minute walk from the hotel. There were several good places to eat close by and we found that the staff was happy to give reccomendations. The day of our departure was marred by a nationwide transportation strike. Not to worry... Walter gave us a warning a day prior and we went to the train station to make a reservation on one of two trains that were still going to run. He even offered to call our hotel in Florence to let them know that our arrival would be delayed until evening.

Unfortunately, the weather in Venice was colder than we had anticipated (mostly in the 20-25 F range with the wind chill), which put limitations on the amount of walking we could comfortably accomplish. We spent two nights at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo. Good stuff: Booking was done directly with the hotel via email and they were very timely in their responses. Hotel staff was helpful and spoke English, but not overly forthcoming. Breakfast, albeit small Continental, was enough to get us going in the morning (yogurt, cereals, and fruit); the cappuccino was delicious. We stayed in Room 5 upstairs which was clean, roomy, and even had a little balcony (although it was much too cold to enjoy it). As others mentioned, the hotel was in a quiet neighborhood and very close to the San Stae valporetto. Not so good stuff: The room was a bit stuffy; the bed was very hard, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any shampoo when we showered in the morning (guess we should have checked before jumping into the tub!). Was not made aware of the internet access. Although the average price listed in Trip Advisor is around $170 USD per night, we paid about 50% more. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve previously stayed at other Venice hotels right on the canal for less than this within the last 2 years. So, I thought this was a bit pricier than originally anticipated. Also, since it was a little off the beaten track, it took awhile to get to the sites or walk (brrrr, cold) to the good restaurants. (There is a restaurant within 5 minutes from the hotel, but the food is just OK.) Bottom line? In general, I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again. However, I would try to negotiate a better price and try to go when the weather is a bit warmer (for sure). Other restaurant tips? Used Rick Steves' Venice book and ate at the Salad & Juice Bar Oasis 2000 tucked away around the Bridge of Sighs/St. Mark's Square area. The ravioli, spagetti pomodoro, and salad was fantastic and reasonably priced (for the area). We also tried the Trattoria Ca'd'Oro (about 100 yeards straight from the Ca'd'Oro vaporetta stop) because it was relatively close to the hotel (one vaporetto stop from San Stae), but the food was only mediocre at best.

At check-out, we were being charged a higher rate than the rate originally quoted to us. Luckily, we had a copy of the e-mail that confirmed the rate. It was a bit uncomfortable asking them to honor the rate that we were quoted, but they honored it anyway. Apparently, their computer system crashed and lost some of their e-mails that provided this information. Had we not brought copies of the e-mail, we would have paid a higher rate. Despite this problem, I would not hesitate staying at this property again. You can feel that the people here genuinely care about their guests and they understand the true meaning of \"customer service\". They will do everything that they can to make their guests happy, thus, making it a highly rated hotel on tripadvisor.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london SW", "Title": "\u201cWould recommend this hotel to anyone\u201d", "Author": "mum48londonSW", "ReviewID": "UR22414727", "Content": "Would recommend this hotel to anyone.

This was one of the most comfortable and most romantic hotels I stayed at during my trip to Europe. Completely intimate and charming, i was just blown away at the level of service, quality and helpfulness of the staff. It definately met my high standards. Al Ponte is away from the hustle and bustle and completely walkeable to the main tourist area (10mins). Upon arrival the hotel gives you a great \"useful\" map to get you everywhere. The hotel was so venetian, with great homey charm. The beds were firm and and the washroom was really clean and updated. Tons of books on Venice are provided by the hotel to use at your discretion however, everywhere you go in Venice is walkable, and definately worth getting lost in. Useful tips on getting to the hotel as we sure had trouble: If you are flying into an Airport (we flew into Treviso with RyanAir), as soon as you get out of arrivals, walk to the right and find the ACTV booth. Buy return shuttle tickets to Venice and also purchase a one time use boat/Vaporetto ticket unless you plan to buy a one day pass if you dont wish to walk so much. the Bus is right outside the airport so no need to fret. The bus ride is approximately 1 hour and is the last stop of the ride. When you get of the bus, remember the stop indicator \"D2\". This is where you will wait for your return. ACTV also gives you a great schedule that coincides with your flight location and tells you which bus time to take. As soon as you get off the bus, walk straight ahead veering towards the water. You will see a big clear bus shelter but for boats instead, like a doc. It will read Piazzolo de Roma, excuse the spelling. This will be in Black wording with a Yellow background. Owned by ACTV, this is the boat you will need to take. NOTE: ACTV has two two lines: 1 or 2. Make sure you take boat 1 and get off at the San Stae stop which is 4 stops from the start. We asked an ACTV representative and they told us to get off at the first stop, big mistake. Even our personal GPS couldn't help us with this one. So remember boat 1, San Stae. As soon you get off the boat walk straight. The directions of the hotel say there is a bridge one the left....YOU MUST look hard enough to see this tiny tiny black metal crossover...looks spooky but they are currently doing construction overhead. Cross the tiny bridge adn follow down the path on the right, keep going straight and follow instructions/directions the hotel gives you on their site. you will see a bridge to the entrance of the hotel. It has a gated door and if you arrive early you will see ppl eating breakfast. NOTE: to gain entrance you much look for the Lion Head and press this mouth to push the buzzer to get in. This is their entrance. Unless you are stupid like me and my boyfriend and stood there staring at the ppl eating wondering what to do. We ended up going thru the back entrance down this narrow creepy yet soon to be \"normal\" alley way. If you go thru the back, push the door as soon as you hear a click. Once your in your home free. Btw, their free breakast outside on the terrace is marvelous. Great garden and just simple comfort. Couldn't ask for more. We had room #8. Loved it and felt like it really was the epitome of what Venice stood for. Also, no need to take the boat to main stop to get to shuttle bus, you can walk it in 15 mins flat no problem. Equipped with the map the hotel gives you, just go adn get lost. It ended up being so much fun trying to figure out where you were in this city....and if u get frustrated...just look around and remind yourself your in Venice. Do no fall victim to tourist trap restaurants in the St. Marks sq. - expensive, instead go eat elsewhere and then go back to see the orchestras place ....very romantic. Gondolas were quite expensive, about $80Euros for two ppl, 4 kilometers...approximately 25 mins. Worth it if thats what you want, we just talked down the river from the rialto, found an empty dock and sat there watching the sun go down adn the ppl on the gondolas go by....thats my cup of tea.

The bedroom was large, with a small lounge off of it which had a table and 2 chairs and a day bed with a roll out bed underneath - allowing 4 to stay comfortably. The bathroom was lovely. We had a bath and shower attached. Both the bedroom and lounge had TVs and we had a fridge. The hairdryer, however, was not very powerful. We also had a tiny balcony off the lounge - just enough room to stand. We looked out to the street, just up from the Grand Canal. The location was very quiet, but you were not far from the canal, water bus, restaurants or sights. Breakfast was taken in the main hotel, only about a 50m walk around the outside of the hotel. We ate in the courtyard - though a little chilly, so dine with a jumper and scarf. Delicious couisants, cereals, rolls, jams, fruit, yoghurt, coffee, tea and juice - plenty of all.The staff were happy and very helpful.

The entire staff is genuinely friendly and welcoming and everyone I had contact with spoke fluent English. I stayed in Room #22 in the Annex and it was wonderful. The room was excellent size, especially for Venice, and had been recently renovated with quality furnishings and taste. The bathroom was superb with an ample-sized shower stall, beautiful marble walls, and modern fixtures. The bed and pillows were firm --- which I greatly prefer --- and provided a wonderful night's sleep. The neighborhood is also quiet in the late evening so that sleeping soundly is not a problem. Breakfast was fine with yogurt, fresh fruit, juices, cereals, etc., and someone who would serve a fresh jam-filled croissant and rolls, then take your request for coffee, capuccino, etc. Weather permitting, there is a nice outdoor courtyard off of the breakfast room as well.

For example, you can hop on the #1 Vaporetto and get a fabulous cruise of the canal all the way down to San Marco (St Mark's) Square. Or you can go the other direction for about four stops and arrive at the train station or the Plazza Roma bus terminal (to the airport). The Ca D' Oro stop is the next stop to San Stae on the line -- then you have only a 10 minute walk north to the dock for the Murano / Burano vaporetto. Vaporetto passes can be bought at the Rialto Bridge stop, which is only a short 10-15 minute walk away.

It didn't work initially due to room location so they PROVIDED an Ethernet cable and a power outlet converter so I could wire straight in. What a welcome bonus. So many hotels in Europe say they offer High Speed Internet but when you get there you find out it's often not free (closer to $30 per day) and often only in common areas. The courtyard. Very quaint, clean and quiet. Pigeon free. Don't laugh, in Venice this is an accomplishment. The food is rather pedestrian for breakfast, but the staff is wonderful, friendly and attentive. The owners. They are happy to converse at length with the guests and give well considered advice on what to see, where to park, and just as important, what NOT to do or where not to get ripped off. The staff. The entire staff takes their lead from the owners in making every effort allowed to ensure that those who stay feel fully taken care of. This is true of both the day and the night staff. No drop in quality of care. The temperature. Finally, in Europe, some place willing to cool a room to a crisp refreshing feel. After a day walking venice in 85 degree heat and 80 percent humidity - nothing line a nice chilly room to cool down. Reminded me of home! The cleanliness. Spotless. Everything. 'Nuff said. The price.

As mentioned so many times the owners, Walter and Sandro, were very welcoming, helpful and thoroughly charming. The hotel is hidden away but, armed with my tripadvisor advice, we spotted the small sign at the end of the tiny alley which leads to it! Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable - we were in room 23 on the lowest floor in the Annex. The only slight issue we had was that the room was pretty dark with not much natural light but it wasn't a problem. We had a slight problem on arriving in Venice where, after getting the ATVO bus to Piazzale Roma, we were then told that the ACTV boat service was closed due to a regatta that day - I'm not sure how often this happens but we ended up having to walk to the hotel as it's not accessible by car ! Not good in the midday sun - I would strongly recommend that you obtain a good streetmap before you go - if we hadn't had this we may still be searching for the hotel now ! We ate at some excellent restaurants - Muro, which is literally two minutes from the hotel and is a bright buzzy and trendy place with excellent food; also Il Vagon, which is over the Rialto bridge (about 20 mins walk). It's in a lovely location on a bridge by one of the canals and is a peaceful haven within the buzzing Rialto area. Venice was, as expected, extremely busy so we took in the main sights on Sunday and Monday, and then headed out to Murano and Burano for the Tuesday, loving Burano so much that we went back there on the Wednesday! They really are worth seeing with tiny cafes and, in the case of Burano, a really pretty place with brightly coloured houses and tiny canals filled with fishing boats. We would definitely recommend getting an ACTV pass if you are going to be doing much travelling. We got a 3 day pass on the Monday morning (31 euro which currently equates to about \u00c2\u00a325) and so it even covered our return journey to Piazzale Roma on our way to the airport. We found the vaporetto system really easy to use and a very welcome respite for tired feet - it also helped of course that the hotel is only yards from the St Stae stop!

If we ever go back to Venice we will definitely stay at Al Ponte Mocenigo and if we manage to hear that amazing voice again, I will not hesitate to knock on the door and pay my respects with a \"Brava!\"", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon U.K.", "Title": "\u201cSorry Folks , Another good review\u201d", "Author": "Startrekers", "ReviewID": "UR14275273", "Content": "My wife and I have just spent four nights at al ponte mocenigo , we stayed in the annex which is in the same building but about a 50 mtr walk to the hotel for breakfast, Umberellas are supplied if it is wet, The hotel is clean and well looked after by very nice people.

I hardly write reviews but feel I have to add to the already excellent reviews this hotel has. I normally stay in 4 star hotels and booked this because of the reviews on trip advisor. It is my person opinion but this is well worth a 4 star (I know hotels are based on a number of things e.g. what they offer etc). I simply have no negative comments about this hotel. The location is excellent, close to a water bus stop, good restaurants surround it. The courtyard is romantic and beautiful. The room d\u00c3\u00a9cor is wonderful and you feel special as soon as you arrive. The staff go out of their way to assist you. The breakfast is excellent; we had big breakfasts and found they kept us full until dinner. This is also the first place I have stayed at that they have: Not charged for breakfast in your room Not asked what you have used in the mini bar nor checked prior to checkout Actually reduced the rate on check out (we got a discount of 6% but they kindly knocked off 6 extra euros!) We stayed in the small double room, the smallest in the hotel but it was not a problem. After all you are not in Venice for the hotel room! To be honest when we return we will chose this room again because it suited our needs and the price was excellent. We had a double bed, Flat screen TV, Table & Chair, Mini bar, shower (not bath) and wardrobe. I really hope that the hotel remains as wonderful and charming as it is today and favours the more reasonable rates which made me pick it in the first place. This hotel really is value for money and to be honest, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell them but I would have paid double!

It is described quite correctly as a 'cosy bolthole offering value for money', however, there is much more besides for anyone searching for comfort and a little bit of venetian charm. This really is a little gem and definitely made our trip to Venice. It is very easy to get to, only 2/3 stops from Piazzale de Roma to San Stae on Vaporetto 1 and then a 1 min walk to the door of the hotel. We stayed in the triple room on the first floor which was comfortable, spacious and decorated in a simple though almost Palazzo grandeur. The bathroom was warm, roomy, very clean and had a bath and shower. We both slept very well during our 3 nights. Breakfast is simple but yummy - warm croissants, yoghurt, cereal, some fresh fruit, bread rolls, toast and lots of jams etc. Breakfast is served downstairs in the hall way and upstairs on the first floor outside the bedrooms. Its fine if you are downstairs but sitting upstairs on the landing was a little odd. In summer it must be delightful though as everyone eats in the little courtyard at the front. In terms of location I thought it was ideal - close to the centre (10 mins to the Rialto bridge and about a 15/20 min walk to San Marco) and yet far enough away to escape the crowds when you had had enough sight seeing for one day. We walked everywhere only using the Vaporetto to get to the hotel and on our last day to get to Santa Maggiore. I am over six months pregnant and still walking wasn't a problem, nothing is very far and if it is, there are plenty of places to stop and have a drink and rest. We considered getting a 72 hr vaporetto ticket but were glad we didn't. Really not necessary. The hotel staff were excellent in every way - no problem booking with very prompt responses by email, really helpful with restaurant recommendations and bookings and always ready to chat about Venice and the sights. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. We didn't do gondolas, operas, vivaldi but we did do Florians for tea on our last day and it was a real treat. After a day of sight seeing in rather cold weather it was lovely to walk inside this buzzy tea room full of old world charm.

Breakfast daily is a joy - with great coffee (I even skipped my usual cup of tea to have some of that coffee) and a great mix of croissants, bread, yoghurts, fruit and cereals to accommodate all tastes. Walter and Sandro have amassed a lot of Venice travel books over their time at the hotel and they will willingly let you borrow them during your stay. If you do book, try to book direct through their website (or by email) as you will get better rates than through the booking agents I have found (http://www.alpontemocenigo.com) In truth the reason we book here is because we love the place, we know what we are getting, and the service and welcome is great every day, without fail.

Both our rooms were adjacent to the lobby--very roomy with large bathrooms--I think intended to be wheelchair-accessible. All the doors and and bathroom fixtures could accommodate a wheelchair. Guests can reach the hotel itself from the San Stae vaporetto stop without going over a bridge. Even though we were right off the lobby, we were not troubled by noise--the room doors are extra thick. The main part of the hotel has just ten rooms. After two nights, we were switched to the new annex of four more recently-added rooms in the same building. While one must go outside the hotel and around the corner to reach the annex, it was still very convenient. The street door to the annex and hallway is monitored via camera by the hotel desk. Our rooms here were similarly appointed, though the bathrooms were smaller. The annex is one floor up a short flight of stairs. My friends were very impressed with the hotel. It was cloudy and rainy for our entire five-day visit, but the kind helpfulness of Walter, Sandro, and their staff brightened each day, making it an even more memorable visit to Venice.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cA little gem!!\u201d", "Author": "Latic1", "ReviewID": "UR11218414", "Content": "What a treasure this hotel is - perfect location which is within easy walking distance of everything, good restaurants nearby, quiet - in fact, just perfect.

Venice is a very easy city to get around in but if you needed help, Walter and Sandro were always there to help you.

But when we struck out in the other direction we found wonderful neighborhoods to explore. The nearby Campo San Giacomo Dell'Orio -- with its benches, bars and restaurants, along with the beautiful old chiesa -- was a place we returned to many times. [Go a bit further and you'll find gelateria Alaska, with its unusual flavors, reggae music and very friendly proprietor Carlo.] Walter and Sandro gave us a bunch of eating recommendations and the ones we tried were all very good. One had a pesce mixto takeaway -- a big paper cone full of small fried fish, zucchini and a square of polenta -- for 8 Euros. We were thrilled not to have to go through the long-winded and expensive sit-down meal for a change and rated that as our #1 bargain; and with the poor state of the US $ bargains were hard to come by. We took our fish cones back to the hotel courtyard, cracked a bottle of wine and thoroughly enjoyed our meal before heading off in search of dessert. Our original room was dark and my wife felt claustrophobic, but Sandro was graciously able to move us to a larger and brighter one. The ENTIRE staff was delightful to deal with. Since the hotel offered a 6% discount for cash, we hit the Bancomat every day to store up Euros (which were able to stash securely in our in-room safe).

Sandro, Walter and the rest of the staff are wonderful and run a great hotel. It is located in a quiet neighborhood, close to a vaperetto stop and just off the grand canal. It is a reasonable walk to activities around the Rialto Bridge (5 to 10 min) and St. Mark's Square (10 to 15 min). We enjoyed the short walk from all of the crowds of Venice to the quiet of the hotel - it felt like we were on vacation from all of the touristy-ness of Venice. The staff had excellent maps of Venice along with great recommendations for dinner. They were most helpful with reservations. Also, Sandro went out of his way to help us confirm our hotel reservation in the next city that we visited. The service from the staff was top notch. The hotel was renovated quite recently (within the last 3 or 4 years) and it is in very nice shape. Breakfast is in a beautiful courtyard and is a typical European breakfast. Hot coffee or tea are served along with fruit, cold cereals, yogurt, rolls and jams. It was a great way to start our day. We stayed in a standard room for one night (140 euros) and a superior room for two nights (160 euros). The difference between the rooms is the room size and the view or lack of a view. I felt that the superior room was definately worth the extra cost for a bit of a view and the extra room. If possible, I would recommend room #5 (with a balcony), with room #6 being a second choice. Ask about the room views as you book your room. The bathrooms were big enough, but we're talking about European bathrooms. The bed was comfortable and we had all that we needed in the room. I would recommend this hotel for the staff, the location, the rooms and the relative value (for Venice). I would recommend against this room if you feel a need to be located close to the Rialto Bridge or St. Mark's Square (after trying to convince you to enjoy the walk and stay away from the traffic).

By taking this route, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have no steps to climb or bridges to cross, which is particularly helpful when dragging your baggage. Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo has been beautifully restored. In August 2007, we stayed in a double superior room (E145) our first night there (the only room available), decorated in Venetian red. The room was spacious; the bathroom was luxurious; and the beds were very comfortable. Our second night at Al Ponte, we stayed in double room (E130) on first floor room to the right of the desk. My husband and I both loved this room. It was very spacious and quiet and of course, easy to access (no stairs to climb). I loved waking up in the morning to the sounds of fisherman starting their boats outside our window. I knew Venice was waking up. The hotel serves a lovely breakfast outside (weather permitting). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so comfortable and relaxing on their outdoor patio, that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to stay awhile and just enjoy a great cup of coffee. You can access the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wireless Internet for a fee, so if being *wired* on your vacation is important \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got that covered. Do note that the walls in your room are thick, so you may not be able to access the Internet in your room (which was our experience). Instead, you may need to take your laptop to the first floor lobby or patio to surf the web. (I opted to unplug and enjoy our stay in Venice). Walter and all of his staff are lovely people. Clearly, they love their hotel and enjoy helping travelers experience the magic of Venice. The staff was very helpful in providing us directions to our destinations, using Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3,000 alleys. Walter gave us a small fold-up map which you will find in a basket on the check-in desk, which is priceless. While we had had read that Venice is a tourist city, the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo introduced to us to a lovely side of Venice, full of beauty and charm. The hotel made our stay a joy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something not to be missed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thankful for all the TripAdvisor members, who recommended this treasure.

We will take quiet over a view any day and the quiet surrounding neighborhood made this a peaceful place to stay. -Our room surpassed our expectations. Nicely furnished in period style, comfortable bed, plenty of storage space and a modern bathroom with a shower with solid water pressure. -Breakfast in the courtyard was fantastic. The quality of the food was excellent; there was a nice variety of cereal, yogurt, fruit, rolls and the apricot filled croissants.

That was the small back entrance for the hotel - but also the most convenient one. Ten seconds later, we were amazed by our choice - for which we will always be greatful to TripAdvisor.com. The detailed discription of the hotel you can find in the other reviews - they are all true. But we couldn't help saying one thing to the people from Al Ponte Mocenigo: don't ever change! Knowing that a hotel like that can exist makes travelling a better and more encouraging experience.

For a beautifully decorated, conveniently located, friendly excellent value hotel this is ideal. Perhaps if you are only in Venice for one night and want canal views, see all the sights in one day and need a range of big hotel facilities then I guess you may prefer stay close to St Marks Sq. But if like us you don't want to be surrounded by hoards of tourists day and night, and are happy to walk around and explore a lot of the city then this is a perfect place to stay, still handy for the vaporetto stop and a chance to see the rest of Venice too. All the rooms are beautifully decorated with lovely fabrics and wall coverings and spotlessly clean bathrooms. Couldn't hear sounds of any other guests inside the hotel even though it was fully booked except when we saw others at breakfast. The only sounds from outside were a couple of people who lived in the same alley leaving for work in the morning and when a dog gave a quick bark! We stayed in the large RED suite upstairs (Room 9). Impressive room but unfortunately there is little daylight from outside because of the narrow alleyway so you mostly need a light on even during the day, but was 'cosy' in the evening. The lovely housekeeping lady kindly let us glimpse through the doors of some other rooms upstairs when she was cleaning so thought I would give you a quick summary based on what we saw and from visitors photos already on this website. Hope I have remembered correctly but best to check with Walter and Sandro if you want something specific): Room 10 - Large green suite on website-overlooks courtyard. Room 9 - Large Red suite - small windows onto alleyway Room 8- (didn't see inside) windows overlook alleyway Room 7 - Small but very pretty gold room - overlooks alleyway Room 6 - Green room overlooks little canal at the side of the hotel Room 5 - Green room + balcony overlooking canal (and think also overlooks the courtyard?) Downstairs room 4 is the gold? room overlooking the courtyard ( ut is next to the breakfast area). If we stay at the hotel again then would prefer a room with more daylight such as 5/10 or go for the gold decor in 7/4. Other useful bits: Do book La Zucca in advance - it was already full 2 of the nights we were there so we missed out. The hotel has good 'credit card' sized fold-up Venice maps at reception.

Booking that specific room was no problem at all. We immediately received the booking confirmation. Getting to the hotel is pretty easy if you arrive at Marco Polo Airport. There are several possibilities to get to Venice from that location. We took the ALILAGUNA boat service to join in the special atmosphere aligned with water-governed cities like Venice. Approaching Venice via Murano, Lido and San Marco is worth a try. We enjoyed it very much. Even though changing to the vaporetto at San Marco we arrived pretty early at Al Ponte Mocenigo. There should not be any problem to find the hotel taking the vaporetto and departing at St. Stae. Even though we were a bit early, it was no hassle to Walter giving us access to our requested room, which already had been cleaned. The room itself was lovely furnished and spotlessly clean with an immaculate bathroom.

We most certainly weren't disappointed and this hotel more than lived up to our expectations. We stayed in the junior suite, Room no 10, with a little balcony overlooking the charming little courtyard. The room was very spacious with a huge four posted bed, sitting area and wardrobe and the bathroom too was huge with beautiful fittings and a very powerful shower. Walter and Sandro made us very welcome indeed and it was nice chatting to them during our stay - they are very friendly and very helfpul. As previous reviewers have commented, the breakfasts were lovely and the smell of warm croissants and coffee in the mornings were so yummy! My only negative comment would be that the bed was very firm and the pillows too but that is just personal and everyone is different. The room was spotlessly clean and toiletries were provided in the bathroom which was a nice touch. We found the hotel easy to find on arrival at Marco Polo - once through the baggage hall turn left in the arrival halls and you will see the ticket windows on the left hand side - we bought tickets for the blue ATVO bus at Euro 3 to Piazzale Roma - leave the terminal building and the bus stop is just outside on the right -you can even buy tickets from a machine there and from the bus conductor - make sure you validate them in the little yellow box before getting on the bus. The journey takes about 20 mins to the bus station. There is was a little more confusing as either we missed the signs or there weren't any! Anyway, make your way to the left of the bus station area and there are some ticket offices. We bought tickets for the no 1 vaporetto at Euro 6 each. Make your way from the ticket office to the right, over a little bridge and down onto the canal front. The stop for no 1 is to the left. Once at San Stae the hotel is just 30 metres from the stop and the directions provided by the hotel were very accurate. We enjoyed being in a quiet part of town after all the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas at Rialto Bridge and St Marks Square. The hotel is very conveniently located for walking to the bridge, about 10 minutes looking at the shops along the way! On Sunday everywhere was just heaving with tourists and it was quite a fight to find our way through them over the bridge and into St Marks Square. It was just wonderful though to see so many in costume for the carnival and the atmosphere was so happy - those dressed up were only too willing to be photographed and were terribly patient with all the tourists. Just fascinating to sit and watch them in St Marks Square. There are coffee shops all over the place with varying prices for a cappuccino - necessary stops for a toilet too at times! We had a nice pizza one lunchtime at Il Nono which is very close to the hotel and one evening had a delicious meal at Bistrot de Venise - pretty expensive but excellent food with a very comprehensive menu and we really enjoyed it. We ate a couple of times at restaurants on the canal by the Rialto Bridge - the food was Ok, the service very good but we felt they catered just for the tourists which is hardly surprising. As my husband wasn't well when we came to leave, we splashed out on a water taxi from the San Stae stop back to the airport at a fixed cost of Euros 90 - well worth it and something totally different - it took 20 minutes but there is quite a long walk from the boat to the terminal building.

This is all explained on the directions section on the hotel web site - very easy and there are even signs posted for the hotel once you get off the vaparetto so you can't get lost. 2. vaparetto - buy a value pass for 1 day or 3 or how ever long you are staying, as it gets expensive! We bought the orange venice card and got into lots of museums, churches, the casino and all the vaparetto rides we could use for 3 days. 3. hotel - our room (10) was gorgeous and immaculate! You can hear footstep noise from room above (no carpets on these traditional Venetian floors!), as well as the downstairs buzzer, but we did not find it too disturbing. Bathroom was also great - very clear and modern. A little terrace overlooking the courtyard was charming! 4. breakfast - warm rolls, fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee, cereals...all served in the little side lobby - delicious! 5. the area - the hotel is in a charming residential area and so convenient to the vaparetto - a great combo! You'll get lost a little, but that is part of the fun! 6. little extras - free use of lap top, no charge for a one-time soda from the minibar or to use the phone for an 800 call, guidebooks all around the hotel to borrow, and wonderful advice both pre-trip and during the trip from Walter and Sandro - thank you both so much!! 7. recommendations - bellinis at Harry's bar - expensive but really fun; a visit to St Giorgio Maggiore Island - really cool and a great view from the tower for only 3 euros; dinner at Fischerreria Toscana (sp?) off Rialto - great food!; souvenier glass- reasonable and so prettyl; Frari Church - great art in its original setting; and the Doge's Palace for history! Worth skipping are the modern museum (Ca Pesaro right near the hotel) and the Correr Museum. The city is small and you can really see most everything in 2-3 days if you stay on the main island.

I booked a standard double on the ground floor of the hotel (I think there are about four rooms on this floor). The room itself was quite spacious (room for a desk, dresser, full couch, and large queen bed with headboard canopy) and well-decorated; the bathroom extremely large for European standards. Water pressure and temperature in the shower (no bath) was perfect. Oddly, my bed (two twin mattresses pushed together in traditional style) was a bit uneven. Luckily, I was on my own and could choose which firmness I preferred! A warning about the ground floor rooms - you are right off of the main lobby, near the back door (which allows guests in via an audible buzzer), and next to the tiny breakfast area. My room (#3) was just outside the breakfast nook; in the mornings you could hear the occasional clank of china and silverware and loudly chatting guests. (This didn't bother me, since I was awake and up by 07.30/08.00 when breakfast preparations began, but don't book any of these rooms if you're a light sleeper.) My particular room also did not have much sunlight, which did not bother me as I spent all daylight hours sightseeing. They do have, I believe, upper rooms overlooking the canal. (Definitely book well ahead of time, even in the off-season). As promised by all other reviewers, the hotel is charming with a great location in Santa Croce. It is less than a minute's walk to the San Stae vaporetto stop, which is serviced by the #1ACTV vaporetto (also the \"N\" service at night). (A note to first-time visitors: the #1 zigzags to stops on both sides of the canal which makes it extremely useful!). With all of the walking you will be doing, the hotel's courtyard is a nice quiet place to seek refuge and read up on your next bit of sightseeing or to write postcards. Another bonus of the hotel's location is how QUIET it is in the evenings and the mornings. I did not hear any delivery boats or working boats going up and down the small canal by the hotel. (Many other sestieres had boats zooming up and down with deliveries starting 06.00 in the morning.) The hotel breakfast service is from 8.00-10.00 which, although limited, is an easy way to get a quick coffee, pastries (very good and large brioches), cereals, biscuits, yogurts, and fruit (these are less than impressive - perhaps the time of year). The rooms also did provide a small mini-fridge stocked with water and soft drinks at very reasonable prices. Both Walter and Sandro (as well as the nightdesk man, Giancarlo) were friendly, helpful, and patient . The value was unbelievable (e90/nt for single guest), especially off-season.

This hotel is a gem and is an incredible value for the money. We stayed in a junior suite in late May while we were in town for a wedding (Euros 165/night).

We were only able to get one evening at this hotel, and even then I think it was because someone happened to cancel one night at the \"last minute\" in March.

The rooms are beautiful--ours had a sort of taffeta-like green wall paper, matching canopy bed, and matching painted wardrobe. All beautifully done in terms of decor. The rooms, including the bathrooms, are immaculate. You could eat off the floors in this hotel. I wish my house were this clean!

Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is on a tiny canal (where the water doesn't seem to move very much--if you get what I mean) and the alleyways around the hotel are fairly tight and dark. It's perfectly safe, but is a contrast to our experience at the Dorosduro which is much more spacious and breezy due to the large Guidecca canal.

Nearby there are a number of good restaurants, cheaper than those close to the main attractions. We went with the hotels recommendations are were not dissapoionted.

We knew that our windows faced a very narrow alley (I imagine we would have loved a room with a balcony overlooking the small canal nearby or any room with a bit of a view). I liked the spacious, modern bathroom. I found it a bit strange that we had to turn in our keys before going out. The breakfast, served in the courtyard, was nice. We particularly enjoyed the apricot jam fileld cornetti. Contrary to some other reviewers, I did not find the hotel to be as conveniently located. Throughout our two-day (and three-night) stay in Venice, we almost always found ourselves too far away from the hotel to stop by and change or have a glass of wine in the courtyard. By this point in our vacation, we have seen enough churches and art, and just wanted to wander through Venice, and spend time on Piazza San Marco. Next time, I think we'll try for a property that's a bit closer to the center.

Our only regret was that we did not have time to stay and enjoy the hospitality longer!", "Date": "April 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with wonderful hosts\u201d", "Author": "jamtam", "ReviewID": "UR4972632", "Content": "We absolutely loved the hotel. We had one of the suites for two nights and it was beautiful. Very close to the water bus stop which made it perfect to reach all the sights. The courtyard garden is so pretty, too bad the weather was not good. We did not have the opporunity to enjoy our breakfast outside. The staff and owners were very helpful.
