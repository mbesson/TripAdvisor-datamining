The room (No247) was spacious, clean and worth the money, \u00c2\u00a3105pn. My only negative was the price of the breakfast, 63 euros per morning.

There were a pair of ear plugs next to the bed which raised an eyebrow but the noise from outside was ok....this isn't the cotswolds afterall. Another reason we chose this price hotel is because we had a 5 yr old with us so we wanted to guarantee a certain standard of fellow guest, had we have been on our own then we'd have risked it elsewhere probably.

The scrambled eggs on the buffet were overcooked the cheese on the platters looked hard around the edges and looked like processed Kraft cheese slices. Coffee you have to help yourself from a coffee machine. In a 5 star hotel your tea or coffee should really be served to you, or brought in coffee or tea pots pots. I ended being up and down like a brides nightey. I did not notice they had cereal until i was leaving as this was located on a separate small table at one side of the room.

Having the combined directional senses of an orange we were pleased to see the hotel from the train as we pulled into Amsterdam's main railway station. The reception area was most impressive, the staff courteous and helpful. 5-star all the way. Then we found our room. And that's where things go 3-star. Alerted by previous reviews, we'd asked for a quiet room and we got it. Perfect. It was clean too, and the bed was comfy, but it was so, well, tired. It would be an exageration to say we spent our evenings waiting for the valves to warm up on the TV but the last time I saw such an aged device was on the Antiques Roadshow. So why does this review give a score of 5/5? Because we paid peanuts for our stay, because the location is brilliant, because the room provided us with exactly what we wanted and because the staff couldn't be faulted. We ate in the hotel only once and that was for breakfast. We'd heard it was a tad pricey but we thought it might be something mindblowing. It wasn't. It was a let down so we ate out after that.

We arrived at 6am in the morning after a long flight and were given our room after a swift check in which was lovely because we were very tired. It was nicely appointed with a bed/lounge room, bathroom and a little kitchenette which is good. They provide bathrobes and toiletries which smell divine but not kitchen essentials like a washing up cloth nor dishwashing liquid. But there is a supermarket just down the little street so that wasnt a problem. Also bizarrely for a hotel only an initial toilet roll, when you use that you have to purchase your own in the apartments! The heating was too hot (typical of all European hotels in winter) but we turned it off and you can open the window up which lets in air which is good. The street is noisy until well into the night but the hotel provides earplugs which are welcome! A great selection of tv channels to be had and the wonderful Dutch habit of showing the programs in the language they were written in (so a lot of English ones) and then they subtitle the Dutch in which is great if you want to watch something other than BBC news which at some many hotels seems to be the only English channel on offer. So thanks for that Dutch tv! The hotel will do laundry for you (at a cost) or there is a small laundrette around the corner if you want to do your own. You are just across the road from the Central Station and five minutes walk from the Dam Square both of which are handy but only one street away from the Red Light District and very central to several Coffee Shops and Pubs so be aware that its a noisy location with a lot of people always about.

They will help you with tours or directions or simply tell you about the city's history if that's what you want. They will lend you an umbrella if it's raining as well which is handy. We would stay here again because we like apartment living when we go overseas and this fits the bill nicely.

There is now another phrase, to take into consideration, known as talk the walk. This they do splendidly.One question thgey continually say to checking in guests, would you like a quiet room, or a room over the traffic. Guess the answer of the guest, more fool them. Knowledge is wonderful in hindsight. Once out of the elevator, going to the rooms, you enter a different world, a world set back some 30 years in creature comforts, old and used. The beds are worn out old spring mattresses, sagging from use, bring some string to secure your body, or you will play rollover; the carpets are dusty and worn, windows dirty, curtains probably never seen a wash, air condition guaranteed to blow dust.The pillows are all of duck feathers, birds long time migrated, and are DNA lump remains. The televisions are 1970`s large box style. Please continue, the best is yet to come. Now for breakfast, the charge is 23 Euros. What do you receive, well, simply put, no waiter service, you take your own coffee from a machine, and help yourself to a limited buffet, very limited at that. If you are a vegetarian, or dont eat pork, but love your eggs in the morning, the Hotel has a non brainer for you. The eggs, all fried or scrambled are kept in a large bowl, with an open pull lid, divided into 2 sections. You guessed it, bacon steaming one side with pork sausages and eggs the other. Close the lid, you get smoky porky bacon eggs fit for a vegetarian, with the steam passing and dripping fat over the eggs. Question, is this, or not a no brainer, and for a 5 star hotel?? Want to complainm, go find someone. Now, later in the day, you fancy a beer. So, in the rear of the foyer is a bar. The barman will take a glass stick it over a soapy wash brush, turn it over still with soap suds in and put the draught beer in, the soap suds are free, they just dont care. Fancy the Health Club, they charge 12.50 for a day pass, located in the basement, forget it. Location superb, 5 minutes to the cente and Railway.

After booking another hotel and finding out there were 2 with the same name and the one I had picked was not a good one, I decided as it was our 1st Wedding Anniversary to spend a little more to ensure a good stay. On arrival, was very impressed with the monochrome foyer and the grand piano, just wish I could have plucked up the courage to play it (it did say you could). Staff excellent and very helpful, allowed us to check in 3 plus hours early and free tea and coffee was on offer in the foyer while we waited for our room to become available. As we were leaving on Sunday they offer you a late check out of 5pm free of charge (think it was called something like easy Sunday?). This was a great bonus with a late afternoon flight, so meant we could enjoy the whole day and not be turfed out at about 11am as other hotels do. Our room was lovely and big with the nice touches a hotel of this quality should bring, dressing gown, slippers, toiletries and tea and coffee making facilities. Also there was an iron, ironing board and hairdryer. T.V. with quite a few english speaking channels. We did not eat here, so cannot comment on this, but I really have no complaints at all, it really made our stay in Amsterdam very enjoyable. The location was really fantastic, we walked everywhere, no need even for a tram, very near to the train station. Getting a train from the airport was so easy and cost around 4 euros each way. So much to see and do in Amsterdam, we could not possibly do in 3 days, but Anne Frank's house was a must see, very surreal and kind of haunting. Loads of places to eat and drink and we had fabulous weather so sat outside most of the time. Food and drink expensive, around 30 euros for lunch for 2, however there is burger king/macdonalds etc for cheap bites to eat. For a pint of heineken was 5.50 euros, which I thought was expensive. I would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone, they made our Anniversary truly special, I am not sure we would have said the same if we had stayed in the first hotel I had booked, just so glad I changed the booking to the Barbizon Palace.

The hotel is situated opposite Central Station making it very easy to travel to from the airport and easy to get cheap trams to wherever in the city, although you could also walk. Bring comfortable shoes for the cobbled streets and mind the bikes - they're everywhere! Our room was on the 1st floor and was on two levels - the bathroom was on your left when you entered the room and the bedroom was on a upper level, reached by stairs. Our room had a view of the road and we were worried that it would be too noisy in the evening, especially on a Friday. Reception said that would swap us into an internal room if desired. We decided to wait and see. In the end there was some noise, but we were so tired after all the walking we slept like the dead. Very nice people in the Reception, by the way. Lovely complimentary orange juice there too. We liked the complimentary tea/coffee available for you in the room with a kettle. On pair of slippers and an ironing board are also supplied. No bathrobes. There is an in-room safe and nice touches such as a book \"bedtime stories\" which has various stories written by well known authors. Also complimentary toiletries are left for you in the bathroom - shower gel, soaps, moisturiser, tissues, toothbrush. We checked on Tripadvisor re breakfast and decided not to eat in the hotel on the first morning - big mistake. Only a few shops were open at 10 o'c when we went out looking and we ended up having waffles and scones for breakfast. Next day we stayed in the hotel. It's well worth paying the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19 each for a very delicious breakfast. You won't need lunch after it. You can also leave you luggage when checking out and come back on your way to Central Station - very handy.

My husband had commented that it was very low - (even low for me and I'm only 4'11\") - when I looked at the base it was a collection of metalwork like you'd find on a sofa-bed. To make matters worse, the headboard was a couple of broken pieces of board covered in crappy carpet - revealing the cables and piston things that controlled the lowering of the bed, It was also very small!!! \"Never mind\" we thought, it's only for one night (even though I'm thinking of how much we paid for this 5* room) ..........it turned out to be one very very very long night!

We had intially intended to stay just the one night and anticipated arriving late morning, however as the traffic was good we arrived at 3am. We called the hotel enroute and were assured that there was plenty of room. What annoyed me a little was being charged a full nights accomodation despite what was effectively an early check in. Nevertheless, the hotel exceeded my expections in almost every department. My room (Room 7) was spacious and comfortable. It was on the ground floor and on two levels. It looked out onto the canal and neighbouring bars. This looked lovely during the day but was quite noisy at night. The room was clean with plenty of towels and a few complimentary lotions and potions. I would have expected more for a five star hotel though. There was plenty of storage space and the bed was very comfortable indeed. The only let down was the TV. For the size of room it was too small and the picture quality was poor. The selection of channels was also quite poor and none of the pay per view channels worked. Despite this, I was quite impressed with my room and found it much larger than other hotels offer in Amsterdam. The staff at the hotel are fairly good. All speak good English and all are willing to help out where appropriate. I ate lunch in the restaurant on the Sunday and found the food to be delicious and fair in price. The selection of food was quite poor though. On the whole I was very impressed with this hotel and would certainly visit again if the price is right.

If I had known, I probably wouldn't have reserved it going by the reviews and pictures here on Tripadvisor. My experience is similar to other travellers - average, and probably wouldn't stay here again despite the location, which was nice (almost directly opposite the Central Station). Check-in was fine; receptionist couldn't be considered warm, but efficient and competent enough. I asked for a quiet room after reading some reviews about noise, and got one of the rooms on the 4th floor facing the inside of the building. Free internet was present at only the lobby. For internet in rooms, 24-hours costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.70. Corridors was long but that can't be helped as that was the layout of the hotel. However, they could change the carpets and lighting so it wouldn't look so dated and tired. Upon entering the room, it was spacious and clean looking. Room wasn't so energy efficient, despite the hotel mentioning it had some environmental green policy, as the electricity in the room was not controlled by the key card as most modern hotels are. Lights remained on as long as you didn't turn it off. Furniture was very dated, and not even a flat screen TV. The furniture quality was neither of high standards. The cupboard had creaky squeaking doors and you had to open the adjacent sliding door before you could open the first one as they don't slide over each other. Very frustrating. Carpet also looked very old and dirty; I didn't want to walk barefooted on it. Bed was a little on the soft side, and wasn't a particularly thick mattress either. There was a small piece of paper on each pillow wishing you 'good night'; quite redundant. The room temperature was on the high side, which was fine for winter but could imagine unbearable during summer. Despite turning the temperature right down to the lowest, it wasn't particularly cooling, while the air vent became louder. Toilet was spacious and clean; toiletries were fine. I forgot my toothpaste and appreciated that there was some provided. No complaints about the toilet whatsoever. My biggest irritation was no doubt the ironing board, as I was traveling for business and had to iron my shirts. The board was lopsided and very difficult to iron on. The padding on the board had also came off. I certainly did not expect to find this in a 5-star hotel! All in all, I think this is a fine hotel to stay in if it had been a 3 or 4 star hotel with lower prices. But given the 5-star label and the price, this was indeed a below average experience I had, given the fact I have stayed in many 5-star hotels and this was by far the worst. I think the hotel should seriously consider re-investing some of its profits to upgrading the hotel.

It was getting late and I was hungry, so I thought I would order some room service bite. The menu was deformed, from long use and what appears to be a beer spill.

We found that restaurants here were more reasonably priced (perhaps it's because it's near the Red Light District and the Chinatown part of Amsterdam) than other, more tony areas of Amsterdam. There is also an Alber Hejn supermarket nearby in Nieuwmarkt, which is about a 7 or 8 muinute walk from the hotel. Great place to get drinks and snacks and food at much cheaper prices than at the overpriced restaurants and cafes in Amersterdam.

It really is time for a refurbishment. The wadrobes in the room were a joke and could not be shut properly. The complimentary coffee and tea was a \"bad\", for a hotel that claims to be a 5 star establisment, I think they can provide better quality stuff. 3. You have to pay to use the gym.

I was able to reserve the property for an incredible bargain price of 50 euros a night through PL. So, as with many other reviews I have made on Trip Advisor, my satisfaction with the stay is somewhat related to the price paid. Of interest, I visited the Tourist Center upon arrival and discovered a last minute reservation at the NH would have set me back over 500, yes 500, euros a night! Check in was an easy and fluid process. There were no issues with the PL reservation, and I was able to check in around 1:30 pm in the afternoon although usual check in time is 3:00 pm. I requested a room on the second floor which was honored. In fact, the front staff mentioned that typically the rooms with a view are loud at night although they have inside rooms that are much more quiet. With that being said, the staff member also mentioned the louder rooms tend to be nicer. So, having brought earplugs (which would have been provided if requested), I opted for the \"nicer\" room. I stayed in room 247 which is interesting as it includes a small flight of about five stairs for access. No big deal to me, but obviously if you cannot climb any stairs, that could have been a problem. Oh, I do have to mention, as several others have, that the elevator system requires you to insert your room key to activate it. That would normally be fine except that there system is very sensitive. From time to time, I would have to insert and remove the room key up to 20 times before it would actually activate the elevator. Room for improvement concerning that issue! The room was reasonably spacious. If I had to guess it was probably around 280 square feet or so. The bed was very, very comfortable and the pillows were great. There were other pillow options available in the closet if needed. There was an unremarkable television on a dresser. The television included about 30 stations including several BBC options. There was a closet set into the wall and included a safe. Of note, I left the safe open by accident after I left the room one day. Although there was obvious cash, passport, and electronics there, it was all there when I got back after the room had been cleaned by the maid. I appreciate that they have trustworthy staff at the NH Barbizon! The room has a nice bathroom with a tub/shower combo. Relatively spacious and included all the usual amenities. The room did overlook some of the nearby bar scene. Honestly, I rarely heard anything from outside and ended up not needing the earplugs at night. The windows obviously had an extra sound dampening pane installed. The location is almost ideal. It is a very quick walk from the Centraal Railway Station. You can see the hotel immediately as you walk out of the station. It is directly to the right of the Church of St. Nicholas which is an even bigger and more obvious landmark if you need one. I was able to walk everywhere from the hotel even making my way to Vondelpark one day. So, I could not ask for any better as far as location. I did not try either of the two restaurant options at the hotel. There is an Albert Heijn market about a 5 to 10 minute walk away which allowed me to stock my room with some of my favorites (Orangina, stroopwaffles, and cheeses). I do have to mention that people do need to understand the Dutch system for hotel stars might be a little different than those you might be used to. In many countries around the world, stars are simply an indication of the amenities provided. They do not have anything to do with the quality or size of a room. So, in Holland, the NH Barbizon gets 5 stars as it includes 2 restaurants, an elevator, 24 hour room service, parking, etc. If you understand that stars in Holland do not necessarily equate with quality, your stay will be much less frustrating. I would give an American equivalent of 4 stars for the NH Barbizon. There is certainly room for improvement, however, the stay was entirely comfortable and I would not hesitate to stay there again on a future visit especially if a PL deal could be obtained.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201c4ish* star hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "intrepidlady", "ReviewID": "UR34126621", "Content": "I stayed in the hotel for one night last weekend. The location of the hotel is fantastic especially if you're arriving by train. You can see the hotel from the station so no fussing around with maps and dragging your bags in the wrong direction. Check in staff were nice, polite and helpful. There was a concierge but he made no attempt to take our bags (2 ladies lugging a bag each would surely register the interest of the concierge?!?). Our room wasn't ready so we left our bags in the luggage room and came back later. First things, if you're in Amsterdam for some hassle free sightseeing you could hardly pick a better hotel for location. You could easily come and go throughout the day. We got the key card to our room that evening and the helpful man behind reception told us that checkout was 5pm on a Sunday which we definitely appreciated as we had to get a train at 7pm. The hotel except for the front of house areas are very jaded and dated. However our room was clean and full of all the things you expect from a hotel - tea and coffee facilities, extra pillows, blankets, mini bar, tv, toiletries. I noticed that my quilt cover had two cigarette holes in it which I thought was a bit odd. Surely it should've been thrown out and not used again. We were on 3rd floor over looking a busy road and it was consistently noisy all night. I usually bring ear plugs when staying in a city hotel but this time I forgot and so got very little sleep but the hotel can't be blamed for that. Lots of city hotels suffer from the same problem. Breakfast was included in our room rate and it was good with lots of choice of pastries, salad, meats and cheeses, eggs, bacon etc. There was an automatic hot drinks vending machine for tea and coffee and no-one comes around to ask you what you would like to drink. I would definitely expect a fresh brew in a 5* hotel. All in all, I would consider staying here again but only if I got a good room deal. It isn't a 5* but may be an old 4* at a push.

We spent 2 nights, and on Sundays they let you check out as late as 5pm. Getting here from Schipol airport is a breeze. There is a regular train every several minutes and it is 3 stops to Central Station. From there, you'll have a short walk (5 min max). You will see it from the station when you exit. As you walk out, it is on the left. The distance is short, but you'll have to cross several trolley tracks regardless of which way you decide to go. If you are bringing lots of luggage, it could be a bit trying. The staff is outstanding. Great service. We had read mixed reviews, but one had mentioned to get a 'room on the second floor with a high ceiling.' We did and it was very nice. The high ceiling was the result of having to step down about 4-5 steps almost immediately upon entering the room. The bathroom was on the top level, and the rest of the room was on the bottom of the split level. The view was very nice, we could look out of our window and see a canal and across was Molly Malone's. We chose to sleep with the windows open, so we could hear people laughing all through the night. What a nice place! We found the beds very comfy, the pillows were nice, but square. Didn't ask to change them, we just used those. The bedding is split into two, like a his & hers. I didn't especially like it, but the Mrs. really did. She claims that I tend to hog the covers, so it worked out great for her. The linens and towels were of good quality and the provided soap & shampoo were better than usual. The AC didn't really crank, but it was cool out so we were fine. We like the room to be cooler than most people prefer. The location was ideal for us, close to everything especially the train station. One of the better places to rent bikes (you have to bike while there, and be sure to ring the brrrrrring brrrrrrrring bell) is at the train station. Very reasonable. The hotel is just outside of the red-light district, but you could stay there and never even know it. The elevator requires you to use your room key on the way up, so if you are in it and the doors shut and it doesn't move, eventually you'll figure it out. Not sure that I'd give it 5 stars, but am sure that I'd return without hesitation. Shop around, don't pay retail, and you'll like it all the more. Hotwire worked good for us. One final note about the location.......in Amsterdam, many of the roads are unprounceable and often change names from corner to corner. Although frustrating, maps are almost useless. Not sure if there is even a straight road of any significant distance, all the roads seem winding. Plus, sometimes for sundry reasons you may find yourself with less than normal mental agility from time to time. But with it being near the Central Train station, all you have to do is to ask anyone which way to the train station and you can find your way back to your hotel.

It seemed it in this hotel anyway as we hardly saw any other guests during our stay. First impressions are good, the hotel looks nice from the outside and sits around 2 mins walk away from the central station. This was ideal for us and the reason for booking this hotel in the first place. Infact after arriving at Schipol airport its around a 20 minute train journey (3 or 4 stops) into Amsterdam Central and is very easy to get tickets/find platforms etc. Most Dutch seem to speak better english than the english do. The area directly across from Central Station is unfortunately a large building site, as are a few other parts of the city, although once you move one street back from these areas the charm of Amsterdam shines through. Once in the hotel we were checked in and able to access our room at mid-day. The service was swift and polite. The reception/lounge area that lies around the entrance is tastefully decorated and provides nice, well lit and quiet surroundings....directly in contrast to the area around the hotel. The rooms, as stated in many other reviews are better than average, but not 5 star. Neither I or my girlfriend could have any complaints other than to say that rooms which overlook the road/central station may experience the odd loud traffic noise, even into late evening...again, this is to be expected and certainly did not bother us too much. Also as mentioned previously, the hotel is close to the red light district. This may not be to some people's tastes, but the more open minded should definately take a look around, especially during the daytime when there are locals and tourists in the area (and not just old men). For those who want to be close to any nightlife, I would suggest that this is not the hotel for you. There are more restaurants and bars around Liedseplein Square than anywhere else in Amsterdam. This hotel is around 5-10 minutes by tram to Liedseplein, with tram stops straight outside central station. Finally I would suggest that people try and eat outside of the hotel as it is generally of a good standard (breakfast) but a little pricey. The cafe at the end of the street is 30 seconds walk away and although not in the same setting as the hotel restaurant serves just as good food. All tastes and pallets are cetered for in town, so I would reccommend heading out for evening meal. Altogether a good hotel, close to the station but a little out of the way from nightlife and certain tourist attractions", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "bcsrule", "ReviewID": "UR22062156", "Content": "I loved this hotel.

We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights (Saturday - Tuesday). It is based in an ideal location for first time visitors as the hotel is located just over the road from Centraal Station and easy to find. The reception area is lovely. It had a modern feel to it and looked great. All of the staff are so helpful and this includes the maid! We arrived early at 12noon and we're able to check in which was a bonus. Unfortunately the room was very average (435). The bed was small, decor ok and the bathroom pretty poor. For the price we paid I really was expecting more. Our bed was less than comfortable. The tea and coffee facilities weren't that great (for a five star I expected more) and the bathroom needed completely redoing. Don't get me wrong, it was clean but the extractor didn't work, the bathroom sink did not drain properly, the grouting was mouldy and the hairdryer was less than powerful! Luckily we didn't spend to much time in the hotel. We didn't eat in the restaurant for two reasons. One being that it looked so cold, empty and lifeless and two, the price of their meals. Amsterdam has loads of options for evening dining so it surprises me that they ever have visitors in there. It's also a huge shame that their breakfast isn't included in the price of the room. I think this would benefit them hugely and is something they should really think about. With all due respect, who is going to pay 22 euros for a breakfast when you can get one just outside the hotel for less than half price - it just doesn't make sense! The bar is lovely and the barman (sorry, I forgot his name) was second to none. The location for the hotel is great to initially find it but once we'd explored Amsterdam we could think of loads of other areas we'd have rather stayed. The problem with this hotel is that it is on the border of the red light district and is quite noisy. Don't get me wrong, the red light district is something to definitely see but do you want to be in the midst of it when trying to find a romantic place to eat - NO! Would I stay here again? Absolutely not. The hotel came to a lot more than we expected and it is not a 5 star hotel by any means.

Room was nice, the usual minibar ironing board everything was there, good and quiet a/c. Cons: bathtub is REALLY small. Elevator with the keycard in first to go up is a bit annoying. Important: this hotel is on the corner of the Zeedijk, the street that ends at the redlight district. Its in the busiest area of Amsterdam. If you want a QUIET hotel, book something further away from the center, cause esp during the weekens its crowded on the streets.

Considering we stayed at the NH Barbizon Palace over the New Year period we expected the service to be understandably lacking, however we were pleasantly surprised and found the service to be excellent. We ordered two meals by room service, one on New Year's Eve around 2am in the morning(!) and despite one item not being on the menu the chef was kind enough to make it for us. The other meal was breakfast on New Year's Day which was lovely to eat in bed after celebrating the night before. The food was very good on both occasions although I admit it was expensive for what is was. Likewise with the mini-bar however you do have to remember that the hotel is a five star and their prices reflect that. The room was beautiful and spacious - comfortable king sized bed, large television, business / living area with desk and plenty of storage. Tea / coffee supplies were topped up daily and room cleaned regularly (again surprising considering our nights of stay). Marble bathroom was fantastic, well equipped with a large bath and separate large shower, the complimentary toiletries were wonderful too! (a variety of freebies...so nice you actually want to take them home). We didn't experience much noise during our stay even though Amsterdam and the hotel were very busy - we only ever heard a few stray fireworks and bell ringing from the nearby church (which didn't bother me).

The hotel was very secure - you needed to use your swipe card to activate the lift.

Thankfully I noticed this before we left the desk to go to our room. Otherwise - I'm sure there would have been problems so make sure you take 2 copies of your booking print out.

However, I was given a room over looking the main road on the second floor. Whilst the view was great - the traffic noise wasn't! They don't have sound proofed windows so make sure you ask for a room that's high up! In summary - this hotel was not what I expect from a 5* standard. Location was superb and the room exceptionally clean. The hotel has some original features too from its ancient times as a palace. However, the traffic noise was a big issue for me.

Guidebooks describe the place like this: One of the oldest bars in Amsterdam, housed in the only remaining 15th-century home, heavily decorated with old toys and advertising materials. The name means 'In the Monkey', which refers to the time this was a sailors lodging house. When someone couldn't pay his bill he supposedly brought back a monkey on the next trip. What the above doesn't mention is that there is a dutch saying which translates roughly to mean \"you've been at the monkey's\" denoting bad luck. The monkeys left as payment had fleas...so tenants at the house were always scratching....Also this was a place that press gangs looking for sailors would turn up and shanghai drunken revellers who would wake up the next day on a ship heading to the Dutch East Indies...... Its worth a look. Its the first bar on the left if you exit the hotel from the front and hang a left at the corner. Less than 10 meters away! Warning: The old guy behind the bar can be a bit grumpy.

In Amsterdam you can smell pot while walking down the street. There are many restaurants nearby and they run the gamut from inexpensive to very expensive.

So, there is no need to worry about being right in the center of town. Also, I found this location to be too loud and too close to the sketchy areas of town. Laundry: Dry cleaning is prompt. Laundry -- be careful what you send. They ruined something of mine. Billing problems: First, another person with whom I work and myself had a problem with calling cards. I used a calling card and she used her credit card to make calls from the phone. We both expected to be charged the 3.5 Euros for making a call. However, we did not expect to be billed for the entire duration of the call. The hotel could not explain what had happened accurately. I complained and finally half of the charges were removed. Additionally, someone from our group had problems with the mini bar. If you take something out to look at it, after a few seconds a charge for that item is included on your bill. There is no notice of this that any of us noticed. She questioned her bill as well and they finally removed part of the charge. I would be careful and keep track of your charges if you are coming here. Staff: The front desk was not overly pleasant (which they should be if this is a five star hotel).

After a lot of research we decided on the Barbizon Palace and I'm glad we did! The location is perfect. Right across the street from Central Station, the tourist info center and the canal taxi pickup. The day we arrived it was raining and very cold. We arrived at 7am so our room was not ready. The hotel staff was very gracious and found us a room by noon even though check in wasn't until 3pm. We were on the 4th floor facing Central Station. The room was very nice. It included a safe (no charge) and mini bar. Be aware that if you choose to use the mini bar in this hotel you will pay through the nose. We went to the convenience store 2 doors down from the hotel to buy our drinks, munchies, etc... and kept ice in the room. If you remove anything from the fridge to place your items in there (even if you don't eat/drink it) you will be charged so be advised. There is an excellent sandwich shop on the corner as well that sells a real cup of coffee (Americans like BIG coffees which were hard to find) as well as excellent deli sandwiches. The price was right too. This hotel offers currency conversion, a buffet breakfast that was included with price of the room, and excellent concierge service. It is a beautiful hotel that sits among some of the oldest buildings in Amsterdam. When you walk out the front door and turn to your left you are about 20 steps away from the Red Light District. We considered the Grand Kransnapolsky and were very glad we didn't stay there because it sits right on the Dam in the middle of the Red Light District and looked pretty scary at night. Lots of drunk, high, shady looking people. We didn't see any of that around our hotel. It took us a couple of days to figure out the phones there. Buy a 5 Euro phone card (ours was green with what looked like a computer chip in the end) and use the green phones by Central Station. To some this may seem like a no brainer but we were ripped off by a salesperson that told us we needed a card we did not (20 Euros worth!) and ended up bringing it home as a souviner! Beware! You don't need more than 5 Euros at a time. We called the states several times and only had to buy 2 of them for the entire 2 weeks. Be sure the use the trams-they take you everywhere and save your feet. We bought the Amsterdam Pass and it saved us some money. It also included a canal cruise that was awesome! You can purchase day trips at the tourist center outside of Central Station and they were worth every penny. Much cheaper to buy them there. We were glad we didn't purchase them ahead of time with the package. Exchange your currency there, not in the US or you get robbed. We took 100 Euros that we got in the US and used our ATM cards after we got there. We carried no more than 50 Euros on us at a time. Watch out for the people selling things in the flea markets. Check your change! They tried to rip us off 3 times by giving us currency from other countries. Great deals though! You can't help but notice they see Americans as an easy mark. Be Aware! The museums are fantastic and not to be missed. We found the society there as a whole to be facinating and very open minded. We met a lot of nice people and we met some not so nice people but that happens no matter where you go. Ladies, you will wish you had taken an empty suitcase when you see the prices of the designer clothing, shoes and handbags! I could not believe how cheap. I bought 2 pair of leather boots for 50 Euros each that would have easily been over $200 in the US. Great selection, great prices. If you want to bring home cheese, forget it. Best to just ship it home and don't even try to bring it on the plane. We saw a lot of people held up at customs because of cheese and chocolate. They say if it's sealed in tin or foil there are no problems but from what we saw, I wouldn't risk it-mail it home.

We will be going back to Amsterdam soon and will without hesitation be staying in this fabulous hotel.", "Date": "August 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "bojomania", "ReviewID": "UR3701252", "Content": "We stayed here the weekend of July 9th 2005. I was not very happy. We were supossed to stay at the NH Krasnapolsky however they were overbooked and sent us to the Barbizon Palace. The reason we booked the Krasnapolsky was to be away from the central station and the construction work and to be away from the red light district but ended up there since the Barbizon is across from the station and a small road next to it leads to the Red Light District. Our booking was also messed up, they had us in a smaller room than requested, service was less than par and the price in my opinion far to high for the quality of the hotel. We paid 198 euro/night for a very small room that needed some work. We also couldn't check in until 5PM, 3 hours past the normal check in time b/c of all the disorganization. Perhaps I am most disapointed since we didn't choose the Barbizon but were forced to stay there since the hotel had overbooked guests. To make up for it they offered us a drink at the bar....water or a soft drink (no alcohol....)and a gift, a cheap looking toiletry bag....for a hotel that claims it is 5 stars, it was a pretty sad gift. I won't be staying at an NH hotel again, my experience was extremely disapointing.", "Date": "July 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGood Clean Hotel in a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3637901", "Content": "First, it is important to remember that 5 star in the US and 5 star in Amsterdam mean 2 very different things. That said, this hotel is an excellent value for the location, and has an even better staff. Our room (1 King Bed on the 3rd floor) was a converted loft space, complete with exposed beams and the old hoisting wheel in the ceiling. Three large windows looked out to the neighboring street where restuarants and bars abound. The bathroom was clean and basic, with towels refreshed nightly. The room had a smallish feel to it, but handled our clothes and luggage just fine. There was one small chair and table. This was not a room to spend a significant time lounging about in. The hotel staff is impressive. Friendly, knowledgable, and more than accomodating. The concierge was excellent - giving hnest and candid feedback about restuarants and activites we were considering. Every request made of staff was filled promptly and with a smile. The hotel is across from the Central Train Station and just borders the Red Light District. You are about a 10 minute walk from both Dam Square and the Jordaan - about a 25 minute walk to the Leidesplein. The tram system, centrally located across the street at the train station, makes getting around the city both easy on the feet and quick - if you don't want to walk. We will definitely stay there again. We spent 3 nights in very comfortable surroundings - but don't anticipate 5 star elegance a la the Ritz in NY - you simply will not find it here.", "Date": "July 5, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Barbizon Palace", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d189397-Reviews-NH_Barbizon_Palace-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$158 - $354*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Prins Hendrikkade 59-72</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1012 AD</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> (Formerly Golden Tulip Barbizon Palace)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "189397", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/32/d3/32d3df79c1577d5f85eab02fdc3fede97large.jpg"}}
