Breakfast was excellent - loads to choose from: hots were great from soft/hard boiled eggs to sausages, bacon, beans, scrambled eggs, to pastries, to colds including: fresh fruits to cereals to eco friendly brekkie (if you wished). The only issue for some people, seemed to be that although there would be tables free, they would hover over one that had the remnants of the previous diner until they caught the eye of a staff member (poor show). The bar was good, if a little laid back. We ate at the restaurant on our third night, then a further 2 times, as it was much to our liking! We did venture out to sample a bit of Germany, but found it had mostly gone \"West\" (Mexican, Indian, Chinese.. you get the drift). Front-of-house staff at the hotel were very helpful & as per, multi-lingual. We didn't get the chance, but the hotel also let out bikes for 4 hours FREE of charge (Berlin being so flat, it makes it fairly effortless to get around) so well done on that one folks!! All in all, a very peaceful time in this hotel & though it does get a LOT of tour buses & business meetings, I would consider staying at another Scandic elsewhere, if this one is anything to go by.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leer, Germany", "Title": "\u201cShame about the breakfast service!\u201d", "Author": "Reise-Profi", "ReviewID": "UR128271032", "Content": "The hotel has a very good located a few minutes from the Potsdam Place in the city center of Berlin.

No matter when you arrive between 07:30 and 09:30h the place is so crowded that you have difficulty to find a place. The breakfast buffet themselves is OK and offers everything what you want and its filled up quickly. BUT the real problem is that the tables will be cleaned badly. In 45 minutes nearly no service cleaned the tables and when one of the unexperienced (I think outsourced) waiters comes, they took a few things and they're gone. The coffee pots didn't hanve handles so when filled with coffee you wasn't able to hold them? I think none of the management tried to have breakfast here?

We arrived at the Hotel at around 11am and we went to go to check in, they told us that the room was ready and was told beacuse it was my Birthday they had upgraded us to a superior room and they gave us a complimentary Mini Bar including alcohol and soft drinks, they also give you a map of Berlin showing where everything is. We then went to our Room on the 7th floor, there are 8 floors in this Hotel. The lifts are really cool and they have birds tweeting in them, The Corridors are really nice and bright with loads of mirrors everywhere. The Room was outstanding, It was very spacious with a large bathroom and the most comfortable bed ive ever slept in, It also has a large floor to ceiling window which opens with great views of Potsdamer Platz, The only negative i had about the king bed was that there was 2 duvet covers one for each person but this might be part of the scandinavian way,There is also a large desk and HD TV, The wardrobe is very large with loads of space, I have stayed in many Hotel rooms in the past and this has to be one of the best ive stayed in. The Breakfast which is on floor 3 which was included in our room rate was also one of the best that i had seen, The Breakfast Room was huge with loads of seating, So no problem whatever time you turn up for breakfast and it is also served at a great time from 6:30-11am so great for the late risers like ourselves,There is around 10 different stations, one for hot breakfast items, one for cold meats,one for pastries,one for fruit etc and loads of stations for coffee and orange juice it is handled really well with loads of staff on hand and all the food is kept fresh and replenished. On the same floor as the Breakfast room there is a huge bar and restaurant and a outdoor terrace which overlooks Potzdamer Platz which is great in the evening for a drink before going out or a late drink before bed. The Hotel is in a fantastic location with Mendelssohn-Bertholdy Park U-Bahn Station right next door to the Hotel which can get you to most places in the City of Berlin and surrounding areas but if you like to walk, Potsdamer Platz is a 5-10 minute walk from the Hotel with loads of Restaurants,Bars,Sony Centre etc So this Hotel has a very modern theme to it with great staff throughout, and has a fantastic breakfast so when we are in Berlin again we will stop here.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "Cathy41_11", "ReviewID": "UR127884901", "Content": "Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

It's walking distance to the client that I need to visit. As well it's walking distance to quite a few restaurants, some key Tourist destinations such as Potsdamer Platz itself, the Brandenburg Gate, Tiergarten, Reichstag, Jewish Memorial and Check Point Charlie. As other reviewer have mentioned, the Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park\u200e U-bahn station is right next door to help you get to any other destinations and the Taxi fare from Tegel Airport is usually about \u20ac22 including tip. Also near by are the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden mall that includes fast food outlets, a pharmacy, an electronics store and an Aldi (discount grocery store) among other stores. The rooms are very clean and European/IKEA-ish in design. This suits me quite well but I understand why many North Americans express concern over the Bathroom door - it's a sliding glass panel that is mostly mirrored to the outside. However, as mentioned, when there's more light in the bathroom than in the surrounding room outside, it's not quite as private as many would prefer. Also as many have mentioned, if you want shampoo (separate from the wall mounted dispenser of wash soap) bring your own - or visit the nearby mall. Also, by my 2nd visit I started traveling with a shower scrubbie (actually a Skin Towel from the Body Shop in the Arkaden mall). This a new hotel, about a year old and has flat screen LCD TVs with HD programming but other than the news in the morning I didn't use it much. Note that the room environmental controls are operated through the TV although I not convinced that they actually work. It takes the input of the room temperature I wanted but I never noticed that there was ever any corresponding change. I guess the good news is that the environmental system wasn't loud like I've experienced in some other places - especially those with the outside wall mounted systems with the loud blowers. During my stays I used the Hotel Gym, it's smallish - about three rooms with the adjoining walls removed and has free weights as well as a couple of tread mills, a stationary bike and an elliptical machine. Note that the programing for the machines is in German. For those that want a more extensive work out the Hotel now has arrangement for a fairly inexpensive day pass with the gym that just opened next door. The hotel has bicycles for guest use, I had one for 4-hours - the maximum 'free' borrowing interval. It gave me the freedom to explore the Tiergarten more extensively and cycle out to the Fernsehturm (Soviet era TV tower) and Alexanderplatz all during the same 4-hour period. It's a nice benefit and a great alternative way to tour the city. Much also has been said about the breakfast buffet. As many have said there is an extensive variety of cold meats, cheese, fruit, cereals, breads and juices. As well there are scrambled and boiled eggs as well as bacon and sausages. One thing to note is that the Hotel seems popular with bus tours on weekends and the buffet can get busy on Saturdays - it's entertaining to watch seniors surreptitiously making sandwiches for lunch and secluding them in their pockets. After a week, it is possible to get tired of the buffet however it was included in my room rate so not taking advantage seemed a waste. I'm happy with the beds, no sagging and the right firmness. I would, however, like the night stand to be a bit larger. It gets very crowded once I have my glasses, blackberry and and watch on it. Oh yes, the 'clock' in the room is built into the TV. As well, the wake up alarm is also set up via and uses the TV. One last minor oddity, there are two banks of elevators with a hallway separating them and each bank has its own call buttons. So, if you're in a hurry, you need to push the buttons on both. Also about the elevators, it's both nice security feature and sometimes a bother that you need your room keycard to enable the elevator to select guest rooms. Lastly, I find the tweeting bird sounds played in the elevators a bit precious however others like it - it is an improvement over 'elevator muzak' but I'd be find with no sound track at all. Overall, I'm very happy with my stays at the Scandic Potsdamer Platz and will continue to choose it when visiting Berlin.

I also noticed that the hotel offers bicycles that guests can borrow free of charge. The hotel was extremely quiet most of the time, except on one evening when a Turkish wedding party took place in one of the conference rooms. I could hear the loud music quite clearly in my 5th-floor room, and it went on until 3 a.m. at least. A colleague of mine was in a room just above the conference room and had to talk to the hotel manager to get moved to another floor. Needless to say, a little more soundproofing and more understanding from hotel staff wouldn't be a bad idea in such circumstances. While not technically on the Postdamer Platz, it is very close to it, on a quiet side street. I found the location very convenient, as it is a short walk from various tourist attractions, the U-Bahn and various coffee shops and restaurants, and not very far from the airport either.

There is a great tea and coffee selection, as well as juices, a full english breakfast as well as different varieties of breads, croissants, cold meats, yogurts, cheese etc... However, I cannot fathom the imagination of the architect who designed these rooms. As mentioned in other reviews, the see through bathroom door is a big issue. The door is supposed to be a one way mirror I think, but there is more light in the bathroom than in the hotel room, which results in door becoming see through from the outside. I can't imagine many people are comfortable with this, my son and his friend sharing a twin room were not, especially to the Anglo-American audience. Even for some couples I can imagine this would create an issue. Who wants a full view of their partner sitting on the toilet? Another issue we were confused with was Scandic's idea of a twin room, which is essentially a double bed with two duvets on it. My room on the 7th floor looked across one of the courtyards, but was nestled in the corner. Unfortunately, this meant I could see straight into the room next to mine.

Postdamer Platz - 5 minutes walk (once there, try the Maoa restaurant for an amazing cooking experience). Lidl supermarket nearby (cross the metro station and the street behind the hotel).

But if the light is switched off in the room and on in the bathroom, the mirror become a simple glass and the person in the bathroom can be perfectly seen while sitting on the toilet or showering.

I have stayed at other Scandics and was very confident about going here. We had a horrific travel experience on the day we arrived - all our own fault! We arrived at hotel stressed and foot-sore. There was a queue at reception and for our whole time there that seemed to be case. It's a pity there isn't extra reception staff available when queues form. Check-in was painless! We got to our room without any problems. Had a few problems trying to use wi-fi -all my own, but would have to say found reception unhelpful when I rang for help, one even hung up on me after answering my question - without waiting to see if it had worked. I finally started again from scratch and realised my own mistake. Room was comfortable, beds very much so. We had been given choice of shower or bath and took shower. Not sure if that meant we got a twin room instead. We weren't asked our preference on beds. I know there are some doubles at hotel as well. Shower was really lovely, nice and powerful and always hot. The bathroom does have a see-through door, but it's not a huge issue - our bathroom door faced a wall. Breakfast was great. One of the mornings it was very busy, but we learned what times were better. Lovely bright breakfast room and lots of room to wander arond buffet areas and make choices - even at it's busiest. The lifts were always prompt - soemthing which I was surprised at in a hotel of its size! We loved having the train stop right next door - although it was closed for renovation on our last 2 days. We ate at the hotel 2 nights. I have to add that we very rarely eat at hotels when away, but we were so tired from our days' walking that we just couldn't summon the energy to go out again. First night was great, couldn't fault anything. 2nd night was just a disaster. There was a party of 12 in and the staff just couldn't seem to cope. We waited ages just to get a table with staff passing us back and forth and not even looking at us. We finally stepped in front of one as \"Excuse me\" wasn't working and he looked surprised that we were even asking and just didn't sit down! So we sat down and he brought us over menus. We ordered - not a huge delay here. We got our starters, but no cutlery. No way could we get anyone's attention, and when we finally got someone to turn our way, it was with a really sharp \"be with you in a minute\" - practically snarling at us for daring to ask for something! He did nothing and we got exactly the same reaction from the next person we managed to stop. Then finally, we got our cutlery. We ate our starter and after another delay our mains arrived. The food was really good, but trying to get another drink was a nightmare and seeing numerous waiters rushing past us to serve the party of 12 got increasingly aggravating! We nearly failed to get the bill and at one stage were considering getting up to walk out to attract their attention. As we asked for the bill, we also ordered 2 cognacs - the bill arrived after a good wait with the cognacs on it, but no cognac. We must have waited at least another 5 minutes and our waiter appeared over with a beer - on the house for my husband. Our cognacs were actually on the counter at this stage and still not with us - even after we pointing out to him we were waiting for them. Overall the experience was spoilt for us by atrocious service and obvious frustation from the staff when we tried to get service. Needless to say, we didn't leave a tip - I just hope the party of 12 left enough of one to make up for the other diners - I know we weren't the only ones having problems! Checkout as we left was equally painless.

If you\u2019re already familiar with this great city layout, you know these are probably the prime \u201cmust-see\u201d places. If you are tending to cover the city by walk like we did \u2013 about 12-15Km per day - the Potsdamer Platz is exactly at the center of Berlin between West & East. If you choose to venture to the West side of the city for the entire day or the East side in the other day, then the back and forth walks are just perfect as far as the distances, given that the Eastern center is the Alexander Platz and the Western center is the Zoo area. Same idea goes with North and South. Need the S / U Bahns or bus? Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park station is just next door and the busses (Inc. 100 & 200) are at the Potsdamer Platz. A near by Mall is a must? No problem! The great Arkaden shopping center with all the goodies inside out is a 3 Min. away\u2026 2 \u2013 The Room - can\u2019t be better! The mattress is firm in the right level, great pillow and blanket, the right place to spend the night after a long day. The Scandinavian \u201cminimal/functional style\u201d makes the room feel even larger and it\u2019s not a small room. Very clean and tidy and when you open the Led TV you know this hotel has a smashing Eurovision song contest hit, specially made about the hotel (even if it claims that it\u2019s not a hotel\u2026 :-) 3 \u2013 The Breakfast \u2013 WoW, this is a breakfast that might hold you up until late afternoon!

The location is also good, a very short walk to Potzdamer Platz. However, the service level is not what you expect from a four-star hotel. They provide soap in the shower and next to the sink but no \"proper\" shampoo, no conditioner and no body lotion - things most female business travellers expect. Also, there is no full-length mirror in the room - the only mirror is placed over the sink. As the sink is rather wide and large (an otherwise nice feature), it was difficult to get close enough to the mirror to put on make-up. They had air conditioning, but it did not work very well. When the air conditioning was set to the minimum temperature of 21 degrees C, the room temperature remained at 26 degrees, which made the room rather hot and uncomfortable. It says on the website that the hotel has a minibar in the room, but this is not true. The hotel has a small empty fridge in the room. If you want any drinks or snacks, you need to go down to reception to buy them. And they will not let you charge drinks and snacks to your room - you have to pay right away at the front desk. I found this incredibly annoying, as I now have to give my accountant lots of small receipts instead of one large for the whole stay. It also meant that I spent a lot in cash rather than charging it to my card, and as most frequent travellers know, it is more expensive to make cash withdrawals than to pay with your card. I ordered breakfast in my room one morning. In addition to having to pay twice for my breakfast (they charged it in full instead of adding a service fee to my pre-paid breakfast) the cleaner did not remove the breakfast tray when cleaning the room. It was still there when I got back to the hotel late at night. I found this very odd, particularly since it was so hot in the room - the food looked particularly shriveled and disgusting after a whole day in 26 degrees heat.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "French in the UK", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for money !\u201d", "Author": "KitKatLP", "ReviewID": "UR114595685", "Content": "The Scandic Hotel offers a very good value for money considering its very convenient location regarding Potsdamer Platz and considering the nearby competition.

That's right. From the airport you can go to the hotel for 2.30 \u20ac since the airport is in AB public transportation area. However, if you arrive late, I advice to take a taxi because Potsdammer Platz is such a big and empty place, you'll hardly find someone to help you finding the hotel which is in a secondary side street. Once you check-in ask for the closest Ubahn station, which is just beside. I've read that check in is straightforward and fast and I can confirm that. Which is very good after a long trip. Receptionist are just as nice as you can expect. We asked for a signed document (for our company) on check out, and they delivered without any hesitation. Hope you know what I mean, they are not bureaucratic and doing best effort, and we appreciate that. The rooms are not really big, they are just OK, the bed is fine, comfortable pillows, flat screens from which you set the aircon (which was off one of 4 days). I had a small problem with the lights which you can't turn on and off from wherever you want if you're in bed and you forgot to turn the hall's light off you have to go back up to the door to do. The hotel is playing \"ecology\" card. So tips for the soap: pull up the plastic cover to get more soap. In the shower press the button to have more pressure. There are no teeth past, brush, shaving stuff, so bring your own. Bring your iron as well because theirs doesn't heat at all. I had no problem with bathroom door as it is not transparent. Breakfast: just basic and classical, not really rich: some cheese and salade, eggs, fruits etc. but fine enough. I appreciated the expresso machine. Lunch was not much different from breakfast and in my opinion was not rich at all. I liked : a soup every day, the fruits and the cakes. Salads were not really various.

Travelled together with my husband & two children aged 1 and 4.Managed to get a great deal on hotels.com for a family / superior room which included a sofa bed for my son and a cot for the little one. The room was a standard size, but roomy enough for all 4 of us, luggage and pushchair. It was very clean and was 'made' each day. The bathroom came complete with bath tub and shower extra towels for us all which doesn't always happen when travelling with children. The staff were fantastic, very attentive, friendly and willing to go the extra mile. We tried the childrens menu designed by Jamie Oliver in the Bar / eay dine restaurant and was very impressed. The kids also loved the little play room they have next to the bar area so you can enjoy a beer / coffee after a long day of sight seeing. After booking our stay then reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor i was a littl eworried, but rest assured the standard of service, rooms and design are more than a standard hotel and lives up to it's 4 star status. Location - the u-bahn station postdamer platz is a 5 minute walk or the station ' ......' is actually in the same building as the hotel so is literally 1 minute walk (don't worry you can't hear any noise from either the u-bahn or roads outside). It's very centrally located and you can take breakfast in any one of the nice cafe's in the sony centre or on the surrounding roads. We arrived by car and found it with no problem. Parking was expensive, but hey it's the city centre. We didn't try the breakfast as we agree with some of the other reviewers 20 euros is a little steep, instead taking a coffee and a pastry from any one of the coffee shops in Postdamer Platz. You can also join the hop on hop off site seeing buses from postdamer platz so a great location if your only in town for a couple of days.

The check in and check out were very rapid. Service of the hotel personnel was good. Breakfast was great with lots of selection. The room was spacious and designed in a very modern style. However, there were several drawbacks to the design: 1. The bathroom/toilet was closed with a sliding door. This door was semi-transparent which made it unpleasant to use to toilet with other people present in the room. In addition, when going into the toilet at night, the light penetrated the glass and could wake up other people in the room. 2. The bathroom sink had no shelves or surfaces next to it. So it was impossible to place toothbrushes or towels or anything else close to it. 3. Only soap was provided (no shampoo or body lotion or anything else). In addition, it was almost impossible to extract the soap from it's container. 4. The design of the bathroom was very pretty but there was no separation on the floor between the shower and the rest of the bath. That caused all the water from the shower to spill into the room and wet the whole floor.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Various", "Title": "\u201cNot for an asthmatic or those who do want not to become one\u201d", "Author": "Jatador", "ReviewID": "UR89858886", "Content": "I guess there was something forgotten when the hotel became built - in trems of aircon or ventilation.

We first found them when they were a part of the Hilton family and we had some really good reward stays. We were so happy with the chain that we went out of our way to stay there on several trips to Sweden. We were really looking forward to our stay at the brand new Scandic in Berlin. It is really easy to get there by public transportation. The U-bahn literally goes through the hotel building and the station is steps away. We never noticed any noise or vibration from the trains. Our room was ready when we arrived at 11 from the airport. Check-in was quick and easy and the desk clerk explained breakfast and how to use the key cards. It was a good thing that she did because there was absolutely no written information in the room. At first glance the room was fine. We had a small sofa that might have pulled out to accommodate a third person and our room overlooked a small park. The bathroom was a different story. The sliding glass door to it was one way glass. Depending upon the lighting in and out of the bathroom, the occupant either had a mirror and was fully visible to those outside the room or could see out and no one could see in. It was not an issue for us but could have been for others. There was also a green glass window that allowed light from the bathroom to shine into the sleeping area. This was fine in the day time but lit up the bedroom when it was dark. It could be a real problem if you are light sensitive. Using the bathroom was not much better. The soap dispensers, great for the environment, were very difficult to use. I do not know if this was a design flaw or that they were nearly empty. The water pressure in the shower was pitiful and, in fact, there seemed to be a better flow in the sink. Things did not improve when we went to leave the room. The safe was locked and there were no instructions on how to use it. There was no Do Not Disturb sign to put on our door. And when we actually went out the room door, it did not shut automatically or completely. We always had to stop and pull the door shut. We had a nice buffet dinner in the restaurant for 18 Euros. There was a wide variety of food with something for every taste. The desserts were especially fun since there were tiny portions of lots of different things. The Scandic breakfast is one of the high points of the hotel. \"Breakfast is always included\" is boldly printed on their website. Between the time we reserved the room and our stay, there is now an asterisk by it that says hotels in Germany are not included. It was included for us based on the date of our reservation but others were paying 20 Euro for it. That was a lot of money for the breakfast. It was extensive but not well labeled. The breakfast room was quite busy but tables were quickly cleaned. There was one other memorable thing about our stay. Every time we walked out of room, we were surrounded by the annoying sound of chirping birds. I wish they had spent that money for more practical things that would have made our stay more comfortable.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cSorry Scandic \u2013 det er ikke godt nok (not good enough)!!\u201d", "Author": "Rednavillo", "ReviewID": "UR85339898", "Content": "We stayed at the Scandic Berlin Potsdamer Platz during a weekend. The hotel is located 10-15 minutes walk from the Bahnhof Potsdamer Platz. It was quite obvious that the front desk staff was recently hired, a bit unsurtain of procedures upon check in, though we were greeted with a very warm and friendly smile by a dark haired guy - speaking good English (not very common in Germany)! Our superior room, filled with dust bunnies, faced the Potzdamer Platz, i.o.w. facing the BVG and Pfizer building. We were told that the only thing differentiating a superior room from a normal room is the \"beautiful view\" and also that there were beverages inside the mini bar in the superior room. We would recommend a normal room. Use the money you save on a visit to a Blockhouse restaurant or a visit to KaDeWe. Surprisingly, the Scandic hotel restaurant was too expensive, which is not the case in Sweden or Denmark. The Thai waiter in the restaurant was extremely service minded though! His colleagues not so much. While the Thai waiter was really busy other guests had to find a table themselves and it then took ages before another German waiter found the guests and there was no shortage of waiters. The superior room had extremely poor sound isolation! We heard intoxicated guests in the corridor at 3 AM and other disturbing sounds. This is really annoying when you just want to get a good nights sleep yourself! When calling the front desk a lady promised to look into the possibility of giving us another room and she promised to get back to us. After quite some time we went down to the front desk as no call had been received. The short blond German lady said: \"Oh, it was me....I forgot you...sorry, I shall see...\" and she looked very bothered. I asked if we still could have the \"beautiful view\" and if not, if we perhaps could pay for an upgrade to a larger room at the very end of the corridor? An upgrade was probably not possible to make according to the lady. The lady informed us that she would go and speak to her \u201cboss\" and away she went. Very surprised we remained in the lobby by the front desk to see which solution the hotel could offer us. When the lady came back she looked even more bothered and informed us that the hotel could offer us another room. I asked again regarding the upgrade, if this could not be made in any way? The lady got really ill-tempered and shouted: \"AS I TOLD YOU - NO\" and snorted at me!! It ended up with us getting a room key card and going up to the room. In the hallway we could see that the room was just next to an elevator (very noisy). We went down to the front desk again and I asked another lady at the front desk to see the front desk manager. \"Why??\" she replied. Because now I have a complaint I said. At the end of a long discussion, the front desk manager managed to get us another superior room, also filled with dust bunnies, and she blamed the language barrier when I told her about the blond little lady that snorted at me!! This was no language barrier, this was a bad example of a lady that should not work within the service industry!! Fortunate enough the hotel had other very service minded young people at the front desk. Another thing we noticed the following morning was the terrible noise in the breakfast lounge!! This was killing us in the morning. Not very pleasant! This is really something the hotel needs to do something about! All in all, I think we will chose another hotel next time we visit the beautiful city of Berlin, a hotel with a better sound proofing in the rooms, a less noisy breakfast lounge and perhaps not so many \"language barriers\".
