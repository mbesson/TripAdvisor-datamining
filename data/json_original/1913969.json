We asked the manager to come and see it, he point blank refused. The third room we were offered, after over 2 hours of asking for our money back and being refused,Unfortunately we had prepaid with Agoda, we were given an average room at the front of the Hotel, It was fairly noisy, dirty carpets, had an ants nest behind the bed headboard,we still had ants in our clothes when we arrived home, but the bathroom was clean and the complimentary breakfast basic but good and location were the only thing going for this (Hotel) it should really be Backpackers. and that would be a compliment. Receptionist /Manager should be shot he was the worst Hospitality employee I have ever come across, for the rest of the time we were there he ignored us completely.

We checked in on Saturday afternoon, process was quite fast but like what some reviews stated do not feel welcome by the receptionist (a man), no eye contact and no smile. It's not actually a big deal, the problem is, while we are going up to 3rd floor, the minute we stepped out from the lift we heard noise and saw rubbish, ladder, paint brush in front of the lift door. It was a Saturday plus The receptionist did not even bother to inform us during check in. Hotel is not elder-friendly, lift spoiled on Sunday morning and my mother needs to go down by the staircase from 3rd floor. The lift wasn't working until we came back from lunch. An aunty with wheelchair have to wait at the small lobby in front of the lift... Breakfast is simple, hard boiled egg, coffee, toast with strawberry jam and butter, no other choices. There is a yellow warning sign with wet floor and a wet cloth in front of the entrance everyday, Nobody seems to bother to fix it. It is dangerous and not presentable for a boutique hotel.

Rooms' design were more of a boutique style, its different and looks much better. Even the dining area for the breakfast was good. 5. Free internet access and also if you dont have a laptop, you can use the 2 computers in the dining area to browse Cons: 1. Rooms are a bit small for people who are tall and not much space inside the room and also there's no wardrobe to keep your clothes 2. There's no common restroom in the hotel. if you checkout at 12.00 pm on your last day and come back to get your luggage and want to change your clothes, there's no restroom.

Should have stayed with the Saff. I regretted this place from the moment I checked in. The receptionist was surly and charged my stay up front, which should have been a signal to me. Now that I've paid the three nights, I'm less likely to change hotels. When we got to our room it smelled mouldy and was hot. There are only two power points and they are used by the lamp and kettle. So I have to unplug these to use my laptop, charge a phone or iron. I complained about all these things and a smiling attendant showed me another room - exactly like this one but reversed layout. But there's barely enough room to turn around so it's something like a Laurel and Hardy comedy skit to iron - particularly with the equipment they gave me. When I asked for an iron I was told there is a $10 dollar deposit for the iron and board. I doubt they cost that much, and what am I going to do - steal it? I had to fight the board to get it to stand above knee height. And the iron has no steam. Haven;t seen one of those in 30 years or more. I was tempted to go out and buy one, and a power strip to give me power points. The attendant must have felt for me as she waived the deposit. Still I think I'd be doing them a favour to break it. The shower is a small capsule so small that my elbows bang the sides when shampooing. And the closet has all of four hangers in it. With our luggage and the ironing board up it's an obstacle course in here. I've been here all of 5 hours and it keeps getting worse. Please let these days pass quickly.

The location is the only selling point, in the heart of Chinatown near the MRT and a short walk to Maxwell Street Food Centre. And at least it offers free WiFi in-room. But that's about it. For all guests, the bed was the most uncomfortable I can remember in a hotel in a long time and the linens weren't as clean as you'd expect. The smoke detector features a green light that shows it's working but also illuminates the room when all the other lights are off and shines right in your eyes as you try to sleep. I've never slept so poorly in a hotel. Business travelers will also note that, at least in my room, the seat at the desk didn't have a back -- it was really an upholstered bench -- and plugs for a laptop and various chargers are few and far between. The decor of the public areas looks like an attempt at boutique-style redecoration gone horribly wrong. This continues in the rooms, where the effect of a nicely renovated bathroom is undermined by a natty carpet; an attempt at antique-ish furniture doesn't compensate for an armoire too small to be usable for hanging suits; and an attempt at a suave upholstered Victorian headboard ends up looking more like what you'd expect in a bordello because it's shabby.

Not much complain about the size though, because it's Singapore after all. The location was great. The night market is just downstairs. The street full of Chinese food is just 3 minutes away. The nearest elevator to MRT in Smith street is about 5-minutes walk. The famous bak-hwa shops were in walking-distance as well so it was very easy to buy souvenirs and food just before we leave Singapore. The free wi-fi is a bit strange. I can connect alright, but it disconnected itself after a while. Sometimes I can connect but it doesn't work (I don't know why but it doesn't assign me a DNS address). I had to retry and reconnect about 30 times each time I want to check my mail. The problem I had was the air conditioner. There was water dropping from the air conditioner to our bed. I complained and they checked it, but they said that it cannot be fixed, and there are no other available rooms. So they moved the bed a bit so that the water won't drop on the bed. However, they didn't change the sheet on that day, so my mom had to sleep with her head on the wet part of the sheet.

Anyway since the hotels in Singapore as quiet pricey and you most likely don't go there to hang out too much in your hotel room i think this hotel is quiet a good deal. The price is considered cheap by Singaporean standards and the location is not bad at all. You have less than 5 minutes walking distance to the Chinatown MRT station and you only need to cross 1 small road which has traffic. The MRT in Singapore is very convenient and reliable and you are just a few stations away from famous Orchard road (however need transit) where hotel prices are likely to be the double of Santa Grand. Chinatown itself was a bit disappointing as it seems to die completely around 10-11pm, nightlife there seemed almost non-existent. The hotel has a cafe/restaurant on the second floor (Yum Cha) I can definitely recommend this hotel if you dont mind the small room and taking the MRT to all the interesting spots in Singapore.
