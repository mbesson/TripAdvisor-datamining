{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect for a short getaway in Tokyo Just got back from a 4 days trip in Tokyo.We stayed at the Sakura Fleur Aoyama Hotel who was booked by a friend who lives in Tokyo.I completely agree with all the reviews. It is a perfect hotel for a short stay in Tokyo if you don't want all the extra luxuries that a 5* hotel would offer.The staff is efficient, friendly and, most important can speak good English.The rooms are small as expected in any hotel this category in Tokyo but they are really very clean! This hotel is mostly targeting women travelers so the decor is a bit on the feminine side.The location is perfect and from there you can easily walk to Shibuya, Aoyama and Harajuku. If you are not on a tight budget, I would definitely recommend you take a taxi to go to Daikanyama rather than the subway or train, as it is only 5 minutes away. It would cost you about 900Yen but will save your time and energy for all the great shopping you can do there. You can easily get to the Sakura Fleur Aoyama Hotel from Narita airport by taking the Friendly Limousine bus. It will leave you at the Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel. From there you can either walk 10 minutes or take a taxi if you want to avoid the exhausting walk on the overpass with your luggage. I kind of liked the breakfast at the coco merry cafe, the hotel restaurant. It was light, but good. There are also plenty of restaurants and cafes in the area such as a few Starbucks and a Veloce cafe next door. For my next trip to Tokyo, I will definitely go back to this hotel!", "Date": "Sep 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR928209548", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Acryl"}, {"Content": "So good and impressive with kind staffs It takes approx. 10 minutes from Shibuya station.You can access the station from Narita Airport by Narita Express.There is a pedestrian crossing bridge w/o elevator. So, you will have to make your carrier up and down. Except for it, you can enjoy this hotel.Water pressure is very good and this hotel supplies a bottle of water a day. If they do not give you, you can ask for it. This water is very helpful especially when it is hot and humid in summer.They also supply 1set of disposable cosmetic samples including essence lotion, essence emulsion, body, milky wash and cleansing oil on your bed every day. It gives us another happiness. :) One day, elevator was under repair, so we had to go up to our room using stairs. Terrible! Recommend lower floors due to this.The best point is that staffs in hotel are so intelligent, polite and kind, which covers some small weak point of this hotel. I am missing them and they are so impressive. Will take consideration into this hotel when visiting Tokyo again.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR128866903", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KKANG"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel       Front view and overpass", "Date": "Jan 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR916448777", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tunaAnkara"}, {"Content": "Great hotel I stayed in Tokyo by myself for a few nights having never been there before. This hotel was really well located and the staff were very welcoming and helpful.

Very friendly staff. (It was raining so hard that my umbrella broke -- I told the desk staff, and a clerk chased me down the sidewalk to offer his umbrella!) Conveniently located - a ten minute walk in either direction puts you at a train station or subway stop. You are five minutes from wonderful coffee, gourmet food, and funky ramen shops. Other reviewers have mentioned the water provided. Even better, my room had a mini-fridge and a little electric kettle. Stock up on drinks at the convenience store next door.There is even a floor designated for female guests only.I'm planning another trip, and I'm planning to stay here again.", "Date": "Dec 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR937093378", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "WarmSocks"}, {"Content": "Sakura Fleur Aoyama is Fine!
