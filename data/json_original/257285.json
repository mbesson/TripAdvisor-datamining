The Broadway University Motor Inn is in a good location within walking distance to Glebe cafes, Broadway Shopping Centre, Sydney CBD and of course, the University of Sydney. Front rooms facing Parramatta Road suffer from noisy traffic. The rooms themselves are basic. My TV didn't work too well. Having said that, I would consider staying there again, because it has an extremely good room rate, available on the internet. I also had the luxury of off street parking for my car at no extra cost.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR253702962", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "melb_aus"}, {"Content": "Three sleepless nights.... The Broadway University Motor Inn 3* rating is incorrect as it can only be 1* at best. The place is run down but its location provides a captive market. Guests must endure box like rooms with no ventilation and inadequate and very noisy old air conditioners. Our television did not work. The hot water taps were reversed with scalding water. The advertised 2pm check in became 3pm as room not available. Two tea cups with just one saucer and one spoon provided. The front door opened oddly outwards in a twin arrangement rather like a horse stable, that defied proper security. That sort of says it all - we were treated like animals. I have stayed at many places in many cities around the world and so am concerned that star ratings not be used to give false impressions of establishments that are not deserved.", "Date": "Feb 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR293164957", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Perisphere"}, {"Content": "Cheap but ok for the money We stayed here for 3 nights. We got a very cheap deal (AU$78 per night) through a lastminute website.The place is a bit tired and in need of a refurb, but generally clean and tidy. We had a front facing room, which wasn't as noisy as we expected, in fact the in-room air conditioner was louder than the traffic.The room had an odd musty smell about it when we first arrived, but this seemed to diminish during the stay - perhaps the room hadn't been used for a few days before we arrived.The room was large with ensuite and basic but clean.The free car parking was a real bonus, and there are plenty of buses to the city right outside.We didn't try the continental breakfast on offer for $5, but found a couple of good little cafe's not far away doing cooked breakfast for only a couple of dollars more.", "Date": "Feb 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR464850380", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Vanian"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d257285-r21555271-Broadway_University_Motor_Inn-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "257285", "Price": "$87"}}
