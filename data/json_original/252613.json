{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Look somewhere else... I know it is a cheap hotel, but almost everything in Mexico is.The hotel is rather shaby and service non existent. Bathrooms dont even have a shower bottom or enclosure (so you literally wash on the toilet floor).It was freezing cold and there was no heater (neither air conditioning/fan if you go during the summer). We asked for some blankets and they said that bedding room was closed and no one could be given. When asked to get one from an empty room we were also told that they couldnt do that, so we had to sleep fully clothed.There are plenty of hotels in the area, so Im sure it wont be difficult to find a better place", "Date": "Dec 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR236526819", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Victortilla"}, {"Content": "Not bad for the price. Good Location For a budget traveller is not bad. Was actually very cheap. Its about a block from Paseo de la Reforma and the Alemeda Central. 15-20 minute walk to the Zocalo. Near the Metro as well. Overall the experience was good. But I do not recommned staying on the 2nd floor over the bar/restaurant. They have Kareoke nights and you don't want to be in the room over the bar on those nights. Try to stay in a 3rd or 4th floor room. They have a lock box behind the counter at the hotel and also held our bags for 3 days in a bag storage area on the 1st floor while we went to Puebla. They said we could leave our heavier luggage there till we returned from Puebla. That was a big help! The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were fine. Nothing great, but it was fine for me and my dad. The staff was helpful as well. Don't expect a great view though and no Cable TV. Not much to see from outside the window anyway.Overall was a good experience.. Can't beat the price and location. But remember, you're not getting a luxury hotel.", "Date": "Feb 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR350683492", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "35th_Street_Hitman"}, {"Content": "Great!!!
