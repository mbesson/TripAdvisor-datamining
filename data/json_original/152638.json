First, when we called ahead to find out if parking was available, we spoke to a woman answering the phone who told us that parking was available at a low price. When we arrived, however, they told us that no parking was available, (and we thus had to spend almost half of the hotel rate on parking in a nearby site). They also denied that any women worked at the front desk or answered the phone, although the following morning there in fact was a woman answering the phone. In addition, they were very rude to us. In spite of the fact that we were obviously a couple, they gave us a room with two single beds, and although we immediately asked to change, and had been in the room only one minute, they sent someone to inspect the room before we could get another room. The room we ended up with was in poor condition, the bed was just two single beds pushed together, and the curtains were damaged so the light came into the room and we slept very poorly. The location of this hotel is excellent, there is some beautiful features in the lobby and stairs, and we enjoyed breakfast at the rooftop restaurant, but with the extra money we spent on parking we could have stayed at any of the many other hotels in the same neighborhood for a higher price, and even hotels that cost half as much have rooms in better condition.

This is unquestionably a once great hotel fallen on more difficult times. The entire facility feels faded, old, and out of date. The rooms are comfortable enough, but hardly top notch. The beds are some of the firmest (read: hardest) I've ever slept on in my life. However, I find that good for my back, so I don't mind. The bathrooms are old, and in need of modernization. Nevertheless, there is something about this hotel I love, and it's not just the incredibly good location on pedestrian-friendly Calle Madero, right on the Zocolo in the center of Mexico D.F. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful to me. The facility, while aged, retains much of its original beauty. Plus, the price is right: this is a very economical place to stay.

Our room had an insanely noisy neighbor, so the front desk moved us to a more secluded room which was tiny but had huge closets.

Hotel itself has been built 1937 or something. That creates facilities like bathroom basin has separate taps for cold and hot water. Also very big safety issue is that there is only one(1) exit out of the floors. So in case fire in staircase/elevator lobby (same), then you are stuck to room, but it is pure stone, so less danger. Room is nice, but all rooms facing Zocalo aka Plaza de la Constituci\u00c3\u00b3n (Constitution Square) are adjacent rooms. Also door safety chains were broken or missing. Apart from \"historical\" issues (separate taps etc) baseboards were not all well placed and some interesting wiring... Generally rooms are very clean, except the carpeting has not been cleaned (ever?). Amenities/services: Room service is available, but no price list available. I had to look for Guest Directory book.

The included breakfast was a full hot breakfast with more food than you can possibly eat. The included internet was reasonably fast, though prone to occasional connection drops. One warning, though. If you are looking for a quiet place to sleep in, then this (or any other hotel around the Zocalo), is not for you. The Zocalo is a lively place prone to everything from beating Aztec drums, to cars to thousands of people. The atmosphere makes it special, but it also makes it noisy.

The coffee that they serve at breakfast is often lukewarm, at best, but we found a very simple solution: simply tell your waiter that you want cafe \"muy caliente\" - in which case they will generally bring you piping hot coffee. The breakfast buffet is superb, and the steaks for dinner are also excellent quality (even if very thing by American steak house standards). The margaritas were varied, but we found a solution to this problem as well: we snuck our own tequila into them, and added lime which they served at the table anyway. The 7th floor terrace restaurant is the place to be for both breakfast as well as dinner. This hotel really oozes with charm. The stairways, the atrium, the lobby, and the views out the window and over the balcony of the terrace restaurant really cannot be beat.

The pyramids are fantastic and must be seen, but the tour from the hotel is an absolute rip-off: they basically drove us around for half the day and made us wait in junky tourist shops, and then gave us only 60 minutes within which to tour the pyramids, which could easily be a 3 hour visit to enjoy it fully.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cMajestic mediocre\u201d", "Author": "travelingirl008", "ReviewID": "UR18244168", "Content": "I stayed here with my mom and niece for three nights and pretty much agree with the previous reviewers.

He was very nostalgic about the experience. Sadly, I can't share his enthusiasm. The hotel was built in 1937, and time has not been kind to it. The lobby and atrium areas are attractive, as are the hallways with lovely Talavera tile embellishments, but the guest rooms and bathrooms are in dire need of a major renovation. They are shabby and dreary. One of the draperies in my room was hanging precariously. Hot water might or might not be available in the antiquated bathroom. The toilet might or might not flush (although the man with the plunger arrived promptly and solved the problem). The maid might or might not have remembered to place the promised coffee maker in the room, the in-room safe was broken, the clock blinked relentlessly, and the wiring is positively scary. The word \"firetrap\" kept floating to the surface of my mind, impinging on what little sleep I was able to get on the \"cement slab\" they called a bed, and what sounded either like construction noise or the vigorous activities of poltergeists in the next room didn't add to my feeling of delicious serentiy, especially when the noise continued far into the night. The Terrace Restaurant about which my British friend had spoken so tenderly has a spectacular view of the Zocalo, but that was all there was to recommend it. The food was mediocre, the service was poor and the prices were high. Despite the indifferent service in the dining room, the people at the reception desk and the bellhops who doubled as elevator operators were very pleasant indeed. I won't complain about the general noise as other reviewers have. Mexico City is the largest city in the world, and the Zocalo is one of the biggest squares extant, (second only to Red Square in Moscow, I seem to recall) so no reasonable person would expect it to be as quiet as an undiscovered tomb. A huge number of people congregate in the area around the incredibly beautiful Cathedral and they make a lot of noise. The traffic is non-stop and noisy. The are always sirens. Mysteriously, the Cathedral bells ring, but not when one would expect them to, and at 8:30 AM they begin a very interesting series of \"responsive rings\", seven chimes each from what I guess is each of the bells in the two towers. The Cathedral has a great many bells, but it's a very big cathedral. The Mexican people are intensely patriotic, and there is a large gathering for the raising and lowering the gigantic flag (big enough to carpet Rhode Island) in great ceremonial style at 8:00 AM and again at 6:00 PM in the center of the Zocalo. The ceremony includes a band with plenty of drums and trumpets, soldiers, and military policemen. After the lowering of the flag in the evening, a group of Indians takes over the noise production duties and they drum the same rhythmic pattern far, far into the night. All this being said, I knew the Majestic would include plenty of ambiant \"city\" noise, just not construction workers or poltergeists. The hotel has an incredible view on the side facing the Zocalo, and the location is ideal for on-foot exploration of an endless number of fascinating places such as the Cathedral on the north side of the square and the National Palace directly across the square from the hotel which houses spectacular murals by Diego Rivera. About a block north of the National Palace are the ongoing excavations of an ancient Aztec temple, called Templo Mejor. The lovely museum, Palacio de Bellas Artes, is an easy walk about a mile north of the square. The area around the Cathedral presents an unforgettable shopping adventure for almost anything you can imagine. To compensate for the dreadful food at the Majestic, \"fine dining\" in the periphery of the Cathedral is a joyous adventure for the pushcart gourmet, and I loved every wonderful bite of everything I bought there. Another plus of eating near the Cathedral is the opportunity to observe a great number of fascinating people going about their daily lives. On my next visit to Mexico City, I intend to stay at the Hotel Catedral, which is a couple of blocks away because I love the central location, but sadly, I've enjoyed just about as much of the Majestic as I can stand.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "las vegas", "Title": "\u201ca dump\u201d", "Author": "frankhill58", "ReviewID": "UR8610030", "Content": "tthis place is a dumb yes it is old and nice from the design----but the elevator is not working from the last time i was there--------I did not mind the noise due to sleeping pills I take but they charged me 5usdollars for 15 min on the computor the food on the roof was crap and the service stank. if i was not wacked out on sleeping pils I could not have slept and i was charged 125 a nite and found the same room was at 70 a nite if you got it at the booth at the airport say away from the dump frank", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cLocation: that's it!\u201d", "Author": "mkabell", "ReviewID": "UR8183698", "Content": "Location, location, location\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6!

The staff was for the most part helpful. All tours had to be paid for in cash and not visa (eventhough there was a credit card terminal clearly present in plain sight). The elevator has to be run by staff due to the age and we had many times we could not get anyone to bring elevator to our floor (the 6th floor, arrghh!!!), so we had to make the trip up or down the flights of stairs. We had to move to a hotel that was about 6 blocks away when we were unable to get the last night there and it was a relief having airconditioning, working elevators, no noise and about 1/2 the cost!!!

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you enjoy noise! All shops, restarants in the area close early, so not much to do in the evening.

Then from 0600 demonstrations against the Mayor in the nearby palace commence, with guys ranting into rock concert strength microphones. Next the cathedral starts chiming from around 0830.

We spent New Years eve first on the roof, than in our room watching the incredible action on the Zocalo. Our room had a balcony, but was very small with a low low railing. It was a straight drop of a 100' plus so we kept the doors open, bu did not venture on it. I see that another reviewer belayed the lack of dining in the area. We did not find this true. Our number one find was Cicero Centenario, a 5 star eatery in a old colonial mansion just a few blocks away. Several different groups of musicians strolled through the various dining rooms. The food & service could not be better. Our bill for a 5 course dinner (my wife had 3 glasses of vino) with tip was $38.00 US. Best value I have ever found in Mecico.

Second, it's well staffed, well run, efficient, and relatively friendly (for a big city hotel, in particular). It provides personalized attention if you need it, and the staff leaves you alone if that's what you want. The rooms are good value (not surprisingly, negotiable rates, especially during this New Depression). We were most recently there in June 2003.

Come admire the lobby, enjoy the view from the restaurant, but stay somewhere else where you can get a better value for your money. My review is admittedly colored by the following: It was quite warm during our visit, prompting us to leave our window open all night.
