This was a good location for us - just north of the airport, on the beach, good restaurants within walking distance, free parking and easy access to the highways, and shopping nearby (grocery & Walgreens). Be aware that all studios are not the same - price or decor and amenities. There are many owners to rent from depending on the length of stay, etc. -- we found our studio through a recommendation on Trip Advisor - www.esjtowers.net Chana Cohen Vacation Rentals ESJ Towers by Owner - was friendly, had good rates and we stayed in a great unit - Studio #8 with a beautiful view, tile floors. The first night we were disappointed and stayed in a unit that had lots of problems with leaks, dirty tub, sticky doors, outdated decor and appliances and was on the airport side with lots of noise when we left the sliding door open at night - which Chana said they would be fixing. Chana switched us to Studio #8 on the other side of the building overlooking the pool and beach -- no airport noise, tile floors, updated TV and better decor and clean. Friends only stayed for 2 nights and reserved their studio suites through ESJTowers.com - and their rooms had stained carpets, were on the noisy side and had little view. They did get a free breakfast include with their room rate. When you reserve through an individual owner, breakfast is not included and you usually have to pay a $50+ cleaning fee -- so the more nights at the lower room rate the better. ESJ suites vary in price as well as quality, still a great value compared to the other hotels in the area. Right next to El San Juan Resort & Hotel with casino and fancy restaurants.

In the lobby, it's like any other hotel-quiet with nice serene music, etc. However, when we got to our room, it smelled like a musty sour mop and we were stuck with it because there weren't other rooms available. I asked the employees at the front desk if they were aware of this smell on hotel's floor and in the rooms.They said that they were not. I asked if something could be done about it and long story short, spraying air freshner was not an effective solution. The carpet has visible stains in it on every floor & the dank musty smell is in the carpets. The ONLY floor that smelled good was the penthouse floor. The rest of us were on our own. Strike Two: Our laundry got stolen out of their washing facilities (to include underwear) and no one could vouch for what happened. There are no security cameras for your safety in the parking garage-that's where the laundry facilities are-and the front desk clerk said something odd to us like \"you are the only ones doing laundry today.\"When we bought washing tokens from the front desk. You do the math... Strike Three: The coupons that the hotel gives you are not the best recommendations for food or activities. We were expecting to spend money so that was not our issue. We asked for a restaurant with really good Puerto Rican cuisine. The restaurant that is within walking distance from the hotel on the opposite side of the street serves Cuban cuisine. Total disappointment..... Go to Native Sauce & Raices (by Old San Juan) for much better food. Hopefully, you take heed to this posting. This IS NOT A LUXURY HOTEL. If you don't care about the amenities, then this might be for you. However, if you want to have a complete and wonderful relaxing experience, stay somewhere else-like the resort that we went to in Guanica. We came across this location because we were given a week's stay at the ESJ Towers as an anniversary present. This location was chosen because it is very close to the hotel and the beach. Booking reservations here took away from the enjoyable experience as I HATED coming back to this dirty place every night. I did not want to even take a shower in this place. Let alone have sex in a room that smells like a sour mop? If you do, then the ESJ Towers are for you! Everything that we wanted to do was about 45 minutes away. This was not an issue for us as one of the things that we wanted to do was drive around the island. So, driving to a hotel that was not on the beach did not matter because THE ENTIRE ISLAND IS A BEACH and we only needed to have easy access to the airport for two occasions-coming & going....

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not bad but it is a little quirky and very quiet. We stayed on a timeshare exchange for one week in a one bedroom. The lobby is dim and mostly deserted. They have a card room and a billiard room that are nearly always empty. There is also a small store with an eclectic assortment of items. But for real shopping, there is a supermarket a few blocks away called Pueblo with everything you may want from a supermarket, open 24-7, and a Walgreens up the street. They also have a restaurant open for breakfast and lunch, which we did not try. Our room was reasonably clean and everything worked. We had a full kitchen with basic cookware and a dishwasher and a washer/dryer. No soap is provided for anything. There is no maid service, not even a mid-week check. To get fresh towels you have to take your old ones down to the fitness center desk in the basement garage and exchange them. They are all counted and accounted for. You can also get soap and Kleenex and TP, but strangely no shampoo. No shampoo for you, two is all you get. I asked why and was just told they have never had it. You can also get beach towels there and rent beach chairs for $2.00, they also have umbrellas and better chairs for rent on the beach for more. The internet access is also outdated. You can pay $12/day for wireless or $0.35/minute at two computers in the lobby. Hotels today should realize that internet access is a basic service and should be free. But if you have an AT&T data plan you will be fine. To get to the beach you have to go through Checkpoint Charlie and register with the guard, who gives you an orange bracelet to identify you. Then you are on the public beach, which is a good beach. There is a ski jet for hire business, along with a group sailboat that can carry group of 8-12 folks. A disc jockey played music from the neighboring El San Juan Resorts & Casino (salsa and enjoyable current hits) and they let me use their bathroom and outdoor shower situated near their pool. (I guess they know where we are from our bracelets). A BBQ grill business offered hot dogs and hamburgers with potato sticks and drinks right there on the beach. It was quite relaxing pleasant and everything you may want at your disposal. Just bring money\u00e2\u20ac\u201d the food was reasonable. ESJ has an adequate pool and hot tub. Unfortunately, it closes at 6 PM. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lights out and everybody out of the pool at 6. The only activity we saw poolside was Bingo. The average age of the members and guests here is senior with few younger, no children were seen. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the theme here, dim, dated, quiet and set in its ways. The staff was polite and helpful. Some of them have been here for many years and I did detect a slight undercurrent of guest-itis, that condition of long-time service workers who start to think that if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the damned guests, their job would be sweet. We had a car and guest parking is on the very bowels of the underground garage and no charge for parking. We were invited to a little time-share welcome party at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Happy Apple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, their little reception place. The drinks and food were good and surprisingly there is virtually no sales pressure here. The Isla Verde location is very good. It is next to the El San Juan Towers, a real resort and casino that is absolutely unrelated. When our GPS said we had arrived, we turned in there but were told to go to the next little street where there is a guard shack. They have a lot of security. In brief, this is not a bad place to stay and is a good base of operations for exploring the San Juan area. They have a concierge that is there all the time.

They must try and keep the light bill low by only using the bare minimal lighting throughout the place as looking down the hallway on my floor was like peering down an alley at night on Bourbon Street in the French quarter: dim. The carpet on all the floors smelled like they had'nt been cleaned in years and I've slept on better beds at Holiday Inns.

I personally rented from other owners before and yet none of them made me feel as if I was welcomed or at home. For me and my drunk rads the 15th floor was a gorgeous site.

So anyone who placed a negative comment : well lets just say maybe you need to spend your time on Condado beach or Old San Juan with ridiculous prices. Otherwise my only negativity will be the 7pm curfew of the pool and beach. I personally love to swim in the pool at night when the tides at the beach are too high. So on this round I never had the chance to swim @ the pool but the beach all you have to do walk on the public street to go the entrance of the beach. Again we loved this trip and the easy convience of restraunts, bars, clubs, and family attraction . Everything was pretty close to being perfect.

It is right on the beach, close to the highway, and close to food & entertainment. The parking is underground, so your car can cool down fast in this wicked tropical heat. We did notice that the way you are treated depends on how you came to stay at ESJ. We were staying someone's timeshare, and while the staff was polite and helpful, they were not in a hurry to make our stay comfortable. It took 4 hours to get a roll-a-way bed that we asked for a month in advance. We asked for more shampoo and were told 'no.' But, we felt safe the entire time, took advantage of the beach, and tried to roll with the punches and make our stay at ESJ Towers as pleasant as possible. Our biggest complaint: the beach access & pool close at 7pm. I have never in my life heard of a beach hotel that closed their beach access, but this is ESJ.

Unless you are able to make immediate, effective changes, simply, take a deep breath and make the best out of your current situation. Letting anxiety get the best of you will certainly derail your vacation in the Island of Enchantment. Puerto Rico is a beautiful place with lots to offer; but you must be in the right mind set to enjoy it to the fullest. We do not own a time share and do not know who Interval might be (records at ESJ Towers indicated Interval for our reservations). We are members of the Grand Bliss (Mayan Group) and through the GB; we obtained reservations through our membership with HSI. However, ESJ Towers classified us as timeshare owners and rendered us ineligible for maid services. But that was not a problem with us because we can be flexible and can adapt on a moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notice. We can make up a bed and we could get the necessary articles for the room by just walking to level B-1 any time within operating hours. My wife and I were on a 21-day vacation that included the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Florida. Our reservations at the ESJ Towers were sort of odd. We booked two weeks in a Studio unit at ESJ Towers 19-26 May and May 27 through June 3. We accepted those terms. Because of previous commitments at the Dominican Republic we arrived on May 21 and again, because of commitments in Florida we departed on June 2. Although we arrived two days late and departed one day early; the ESJ Towers was unwilling to let us stay on the 26th of May and avoid a break in our two reservations without purchasing a 1-night stay. So conceivably, ESJ Towers rented the three nights that we did not use. We chose to find accommodations elsewhere for that one night in the same area. The Hilton family of hotels came to our rescue for the night. We had read several reviews of ESJ Towers ranging from 1-star to even up to 4-stars; and some people at trip advisor dare to rate it higher. I would rate the entire facility perhaps at the 1.5 or 2-star levels. Definitely ESJ Towers is not better than that. But what do I know? Now, the staff, security, parking, laundry facility, and on site store are superb. The facility and units are aged and the furnishings need updating. Maintenance of the facility in terms of decor and repairs is lacking. Perhaps, removing the carpets and installing tiles throughout the facility would probably make the place smell much better. The air is musty at times and uncomfortable to a degree; but it is not unhealthful and your body will get used to it after a day or so. We stayed at a studio unit on the 6th floor nearest the El San Juan Hotel and Casino (south end). The unit was located at the closest point to the loading and unloading dock of the casino. The noise level emanating from the dock and the loud music from the next door casino were unbearable and running very late at night. It was not easy to get a good night sleep in that studio unit. The second week, we requested to be moved to a room as far from the next door casino as possible. Again, we got the 6th floor across the hall and nearest the elevator (about one third of the hall from the south end). We no longer heard the noise from the dock or the music from the casino. Better noise level but a bit worse unit. Both studio units we occupied (and, if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not mistaken, probably all units) feature an air conditioning unit that sits on the balcony. That alone, renders the balcony useless because of the heat emanating from the AC unit. Of course, you can turn off the AC while you are at the balcony; but you should not have to do that. A little thought in the design would have eliminated that problem.

The property is in a prime location, however it is not being maintained. Their focus is on low cost, and because of that, the quality of the resort is severely lacking. We have owned at various locations for over 25 years and of all the places we have been, I would rank this one as the least satisfying of all of them. The decor of the lobby, bar and restaurant at ESJ Towers is stuck in the 70's. They do not seem to be interested in upgrading the decor at all. The room we occupied was severely lacking in cleanliness and decor. The bathroom has black mold around the shower and tub area and the bathtub is cracked by the drain. The shower curtain has mold on it and when I asked repeatedly if we could have a new shower curtain I was told that no, we were in a timeshare unit and that was not covered or available. When I asked a maid if I could have another roll of toilet paper I was told she was not supposed to give me one, but I had to go to the front desk to get one. She gave me one anyway, but only after I had gone to the front desk and asked for one and was told to get it from housekeeping. When we checked in we were told we would get maid service after 1 week. We asked for it at the one week mark and were told we did not get maid service and that if we wanted it, it would be a 35$ charge. After 6 phone calls and finally talking to the the manager, we were given maid service begrudgingly and one day late. It was ridiculous having to go through all of that. The locks for the rooms was another huge issue for us. To get the slider key to work, you had to sit there and run the card up and down over 10 times. We complained over and over about this and all they did was to reprogram the existing keys.There were a couple of times that they gave us \"new\" keys, which upon observing how they do the new keys was disconcerting. They reuse the old keys that are turned in and do not use brand new un-programmed keys to make new ones. The location of our unit was less than desirable. We faced the driveway and were subject to listening to delivery trucks and taxi calls at all hours. We also faced a housing development where we had a less than lovely view of a sea of air conditioning units on top of roofs and the less than delightful sound of 3 dogs that would not shut up. From the balcony of the unit we could see a sliver of the Atlantic ocean over the top of the AC sea. Paint is peeling on the ceiling in the unit as well as on the balcony. There are also cracks in the exterior wall on the balcony. Stock plastic chairs of the Wa-lmart variety are what we have on the balcony to sit on.

I was on the 12th floor and the view was priceless, unfortunately, this ends the good news for ESJ.

I had read the most recent reviews of the hotel on this site and they were generally positive. Well since coming back I've been reading the bad reviews and I'd have to say those are the truth. Check in went smoothly enough, but when we saw the room it was the beginning of a downward turn that continued throughout the stay. Our safe and a light in the room were broken...I called to complain, was told there would be someone from mainenance up shortly. No one ever came. Well unless you count several days later when maintenance staff showed up and said the people below us were complaining of a water leak, so they came in and out of the room for the next 45 minutes to repeatedly flush our toilet. As previously stated in some of the reviews, you have to walk through the stuffy, humid garage to get to the gym, where you'll be visiting often...Not to work out but to request everything from towels to toilet paper to garbage bags. If the rooms were nicer or there was more to do I could let the fact that the hotel does nothing to treat you as a guest slide. But since they have no positive contact with you it just kills your mood on your trip. And then on top of all that, we apparently had bed bugs. I didn't initially realize what these mysterious bites were, until I counted the bites on my legs and feet and they numbered over 80! Now while the hotel does have some nicer rooms than the studios timeshare guests are given, there are many other hotels on Isla Verde that don't require you to be your own maid, walk through a parking garage to get to the beach access with Fort Knox like security and assigned hours (if you plan on staying on the beach past 7PM enjoy the 7 block walk around to the hotel entrance), terrible restaurant, no activities, no free wi-fi, ...Really, stay anywhere else.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Hill, Florida", "Title": "\u201cEsj is a wonderful beachfront hotel , so close to the airport. the prices was reasonable.\u201d", "Author": "4tiguero", "ReviewID": "UR103657256", "Content": "Esj towers was so conveniently located to the airport and the casinos.

I have to say, that we had very few complaints. The condo we stayed in had been renovated so there was newer tile, furniture, appliances and a flat screen tv. The living area was open and airy with 2 sofas and a small table. There was also an area for meals and a small kitchen with most of what you needed. The bathroom was okay. The shower curtain hooks kept falling off the rod, the water pressure was low and the drain was partly clogged. That was the real drawback to the place. We really liked having a washer/dryer and did several loads while there. You can hang your non-dryables in the large, walk-in closet and they are dry by the next day. If you don't like noise, this may not be the building/condo for you. The airport is very close so you can hear the jets frequently fly by. Also, the a/c unit is very loud both inside next to the dining table and on the balcony. We weren't there most of the time, so we could tolerate it. The bedroom was quite spacious and nicely decorated. The bed was very squeaky however, and the pillows were lumpy. Again, something you could tolerate for just a week. Maybe not for a longer stay! The facilities of the building were easy to access. The pool area was nice and easily accessible and you were given 2 towels each time. Getting to the beach wasn;t so bad- you had to go through the underground garage- the fitness center handed out towels for the beach. Using the security cards was a bit of a pain but I guess there is a need. The lobby is outdated, as everyone says. My husband and I were thinking it would make sense to move the little mini market to a space in the lobby as there is a lot of wasted space. We liked that you could use computers but you had to pay by credit card. One of the hotels best features is the concierge desk. We had Jasmin and Tina book many excursions for us and they gave us good recommendations for transportation, meals etc. They provided us with excellent service! It is also wonderful having the security at the front of the building because they call you a cab when needed. The location of the hotel was very convenient. there were many restaurants, clubs, a pharmacy, grocery store and bus stops nearby. It was great to shop at Pueblo for breakfast and lunch items.

We are experienced travelers and having been to San Juan before knew exactly what to expect. The hotel/timeshare is a clean decent facility that is very outdated but still fine.

Our hotel room was fine, it had a king bed and a nice balcony with pool and partial ocean views (Room 365). While the hotel is dated, it really is in decent shape. The included breakfast was pretty good, as were the daily free drinks at the pool bar. The crowd is a mix of hotel guests, timeshare owners and their families. My only real issue with this property is that all the security procedures can be a pain in the butt. You have to use your room key to access the pool and you need to get a bracelet if you want to sit on the beach and re-enter the property. While all of the security personnel are very nice and professional, I am not sure why they are all needed? The area seems very safe and nice with a lot of families and retirees around. The pool is open from 9:00am to 7:00pm and then it is locked up, a little strange for a resort destination.

For less than the price of a hotel in the area I was able to stay here in a fully furnished 1 bedroom apartment. The location couldn't be any better for both families and people like myself who were just there on the island to get away from everything the cold northeast had to offer. I rented from Chana Cohen, who lives in the tower as well, about 6 floors down from the apartment I rented (the 15th). The space was comfortable with full kitchen (utensils, pots, pans & dishware provided), dishwasher, washer & dryer unit, pullout sofa, two TVs (one in the living room, one in the bedroom), the bedroom was also large with a HUGE walk in closet where there was a cote just in case I had any extra extra visitors. As I mentioned the area is great, the locals are nice and it feels quite safe. There are plenty of restaurants and activities located within walking distance of ESJ Towers - Chilis, Outback Steakhouse, A Fantastic Taco Bar, and a little local gem called Ceviche House. Not to mention the fact that there are multiple casinos just as close. There is a grocery store located just a few blocks away so I was able to save up on cash and cook in-house whenever I wanted. Isla Verde is close to pretty much everything the first time PR Visitior would walk. We rode the bus to Old San Juan (cost 75 cents each way) and didn't feel any sort of danger EVER. And while we had to rent a car to get to El Yunque, it was only about 45 minutes away, and a very nice ride. Going to Culebra was also just a a matter of driving to the western side of the island (about an hour and 15 minutes) and getting on the ferry (get there early it tends to sell out fast). So the location was spot on. ESJ is literally ON the beach. About 6 minutes from the airport- costs 10 dollars and a buck a bag via taxie to an from ESJ. The beach, pool, spa, and gym are all gated so you don't have to worry about your safety. Renting from Chana meant I was provided with a parking spot in the on site garage which is also located IN the building, so it was a HUGE plus when I rented a car (walked about 10 minutes to enterprise). While I didn't have a car, I was able to use the bus, but if that's not an option for you, ESJ has many Security persons on premise, at least 2 posted in front of the lobby who will be happy to call a taxie for you (they park at and next to ESJ)- they take about 2-5 minutes to get there.

Many chain restaurants, local restaurants & casinos just outside the front door. 24 hour supermarket (Pueblo) and drug store (Walgreens) just 1 1/2 blokcs away. The hotel lobby is a bit 1970's but since we didn't spend alot of time sitting in the lobby it did not effect our enjoyment of the resort. Studio Room: Our studio room was very comfortable with a kitchen including coffe maker, toaster, microwave, all pots, pans, dishes etc, and a full size fridge with built in ice maker (very handy). Room had a huge closet, dining table , flat screen TV and all the regular furnishing you would find in any hotel. The towels are a little rough, but we survived. As we were hotel guests (not timeshare) so we received maid service daily. She even did our dishes everyday. One complaint you see over and over again is that the air conditioning unit is located on the balcony. Yes, it's a bit of a nuisance when you are on the balcony (noisy), but can be shut off to enjoy a quiter balcony experince. Smoking policy: The entire resort (inside & outside) is non-smoking. Smoking is only permited on balconies and an ashtray is provided. Food & Beverage: Happy Apple Restaurant is open for breakfast & lunch only. Our rate included a full American buffet breakfast. Good variety of food, however it is basically the same everyday. It is up to you to decide whether to have eggs today & waffles tomorrow. If you want to have it all everyday you may get bored of the selection. If you want something not on the buffet (like 2 eggs over easy) just ask and it will made fresh for you free of charge. Service was excellent! We did not have lunch at the restaurant. The bar \"Mano-A-Mano\" is alittle overpriced and the service was terrible most of the time. The resort did however provide us with a few free cocktails. Other Services: The Fitness Center is small, but does have a fairly good variety of equipment. I never had to wait as it was never crowed. Seperate mens & womens saunas are operational between 5-7pm daily. Beach chairs can be rented at the fitness center for $2 and they are yours for the whole day. You can return them to go shoping & pick them back up in the afternoon for more beach time if you like. Towels are also available free of charge for the beach as well as at the pool. The pool deck has a huge amount of available loungers. A guest laudnry is available for your use. A wash or dry is $2 & tokens are purchased from the front desk. Resort Fee/Internet: As of June 2010 the $10 Resort Fee is no longer charged to hotel guests. This only affects Wi-Fi Service. It is no longer included and if you wish internet access it is 12.98 a day thru AT&T. Weekly packages are available. The reosrt does have 2 computers in the business center where you can access the internet for 35 cents a minute. Miscellaneous: Prior to our trip I read many comments regarding \"having to walk through a dark parkade to get to the beach\" ~ it is true the fitness center is located in the parkade & so is the beach access door, but it is far from a dark, scary place. If you use the North Tower elevators, you are just steps away from the access door. While this resort is by no means a \"Hilton\", it was very comfortable, the service was great and the resort takes great care with security to ensure only those who should be there, are there.

We picked this hotel due to the convenience of their kitchen facility and larger rooms. The staff was friendly, very courteous and helpful. The room was quite clean & ready upon our arrival. We stayed in the North Tower on the 6th floor. We had partial view of the ocean, as well as a balcony. The hotel was located on the beach which was great and they had various water sports for rental right there. They also rented lounge chairs for $2 for the day. This was really helpful since we visited various beaches (Luquillo, Patillas, etc) during our stay there. The pool was huge and had a nice setup. There was also a billiards room, card room & bar located in the lobby. The location was great since it was not too far from getting on the major highways to get to various tourist sites. Different restaurants as well as 2 different Walgreen's were within walking distance, which was a big plus. Although we rented a car, we took a bus to to see El Morro fortress and to spend time in Old San Juan for the day. The bus stop was no more than a block or two from hotel. The only thing I did not like about this hotel was the small restaurant they had in the lobby. It did not offer much of a food selection and we felt it was overpriced for what they had to offer. Also, on our 2nd day the headboard on top of my bed fell and upon complaining to management, they offered to change our room. Since we had so much of our stuff set up already in the room, we opted instead for free internet access for the remainder of our stay.

(The hotel & casino and the time share units are separate, adjoining buildings. The timeshare unit was about the size of a large hotel room and was listed as an efficiency. It was clean and well-maintained, although somewhat spartan. The kitchen is tiny (no counterspace and a small-footprint stove&oven), so while cooking for yourself is possible, it's also challenging. There's a large foodstore about 3 blocks away (Pueblo Foodstore, not SuperMax). This is not a luxury accommodation, and doesn't even really compare to other high-end timeshares that I've seen (like many of the Marriott properties). On the other hand, the facility is right on the beach. It was clean, comfortable and functional. Staff was generally very helpful, and there's lots of security at the facility. The fitness center sucks, but you can rent beach chairs there cheaper than you can rent them on the beach itself (and you only need to carry them 50 yards to the beach). The hotel is on the Isla Verde hotel strip, two doors away from the luxury Intercontinental Resort & Casino, (which is also home of the $14 hamburger). It's extremely close to the airport (taxi was a fixed rate $10, so don't let them charge you more). It's only 10-15 minutes from Old San Juan and other areas of interest, and a good staging point for excursions around the island. For example, we took a ferry to the outlying island of Vieques. We drove our rental car from the hotel to the ferry in Fajardo in about 50 min., and that was during morning rush hour, I would not hesitate to stay again at El San Juan Towers (known as ESJ), however, if you've come to expect a high-end timeshare, this is not the place for you.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cHORRIBLE ROOMS and really BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!\u201d", "Author": "XXTRISHXX", "ReviewID": "UR79794160", "Content": "We live on the Island of Puerto Rico, 30 minutes from the ESJ Towers. Our air conditioner broke and we needed to find a place to stay at 2:30am, we called the ESJ Towers and the clerk told us, \"We have plenty of rooms available, we also have plenty of ocean view rooms available\". We got there, I am handicapped and they had NOT ONE HANDICAPPED PARKING AVAILABLE!!! I was told I could park the car in the \"No Parking\" spot and walk in the rain to the hotel and they would make sure it wasn't towed away (is it even legal to have no handicapped parking?). I made my way to the front desk, asked the clerk for an ocean view room, he said he had one on the third floor, he advised me of the no smoking policy and I had to sign a paper that the entire hotel is no smoking (not a problem as I don't smoke), I paid and proceeded to go to my room. I opened the door to the smell of cat urine, gagging, I made my way to the balcony and noticed we were not in an ocean view room, the only \"view\" we had was of the dumpsters from the back of a different building, the smell was atrocious! I called the front desk and told them it wasn't an ocean view room, he told me they have no ocean view rooms, they are saved for guests that they want to sell a timeshare to, since we had been here before and did not buy the crimeshare, then we were not allowed to stay in the better rooms. I advised him that my Aunt wanted me to take pictures of the hotel and the view so that when she visits me she will have an idea of what type of place it is, and if I take pictures of this room and the \"view\" then she will never stay at this hotel. I told him that it reeks of cat urine and there are cigarette BURNS in the comforter, if this is a non smoking hotel why are there cigarette burns where I have to sleep? I asked him to please put us in the room I paid for and he told me, \"When you called I had rooms for 40 people, but then I sold them all before you got here\", I told him, \"When I checked in, you said you were putting me in an ocean view room, and it wasn't a problem, this is not ocean view and it smells really bad\", he told me, \"I sold all 40 rooms before you got here\", I told him, \"It took me 30 MINUTES to get here, you mean to tell me you sold 40 people rooms in 30 MINUTES? And why did you tell me that you are putting me on the third floor ocean view?\" His reply, \"I thought you meant that view\", I asked him \"are you honestly telling me you thought \"dumpster view\" means \"ocean view\"?? I then asked to speak to the manager, Tobias I think his name was, got on the phone, I explained the situation and that I was lied to and he told me, \"I got here at 11pm and there were ONLY TWO ROOMS available, your room and one other, we sold the other room\", I told him \"Someone is lying, because we called at 2:30am and was told there are plenty of rooms, we drove out here, it's 3am and now you are telling me that when you got here there was just two rooms available, but your desk clerk tells me there are 40 rooms available...who is lying to me, and WHY? I was planning on taking pictures of the hotel for my Aunt, she has been wanting to come here and wants pictures of various hotels in the area, he tells me, \"We have a room set up for pictures, it is a room we don't book, but we have it set up to look good for timeshare people, but we never book it, if you want to take pictures I will let you in that room but only for pictures\" I explained to him that my Aunt does NOT want a staged room, she wants to see the actual place, and if I take pictures of this room and tell her it reeks of cat urine she and her friends will NEVER STAY HERE! The manager continued to lie, and I asked him why are there cigarette burns all over my comforter, does he really expect me to sleep in a room for $189 with the stench of cat urine and burnt up old blankets? The MANAGER then put the CLERK on the phone, so I told the clerk I want my money back we are leaving and never coming back. He told me come down, we don't care. I went to the front desk and the manager saw me and quickly ran out of the window and hide in the back room, never once apologized or anything. This hotel is not worth your time or your money! If you want a REALLY nice hotel, look up the El San Juan Hotel and Casino, yes, they are affiliated with the ESJ Towers, but it is built newer and they take the time to make it smell and look great. The price online is very expensive, but if you call the hotel directly and make a reservation you can get it for the same price as the ESJ Towers or cheaper!!! The ESJ Towers used to be a great place to go, but since they decided to sell to timeshares, they went downhill, it really is a dump, the rooms smell like a dump, the view they give you is really bad, unless you never stayed there, then you will get one of their ocean view rooms and they will try to sell you the timeshare. By the way, I marked \"value\" in rating this hotel as a two instead of a one, because when we did stay there years ago, we got the ocean view and it was one of the cheaper hotels in the area, and the beach is GREAT. So if it is your first time staying and you get the ocean view it's a good value, but if you don't buy the timeshare, I would suggest you don't go back because the way they treat you is really bad, and now in today's economy the better hotels are the same price, I would highly recommend the El San Juan Hotel and Casino!

The Hotel - you are first greeted by the heat in the lobby. It is dark - probably to keep the heat down since there is no air conditioning in the public areas. That includes the lobby, elevator and hallways. The decor is depressing - had a flashback to the 70's. It is decorated the same as it was when the building was erected. The Rooms - My first room was on the 5th floor overlooking the pool. When I exited the elevator you smell dampness, heat and food. It reminded me of the projects - except the projects have insulation so you don't smell food in the hallway! The room was just as bad - old appliances, dirty carpet, run down furniture and you could see clear under the door into the hall...was just waiting for roaches to come visit in the night. I didn't see any though! The bath and kitchen were clean but everything was so OLD. Moved to another room on 7th floor - b/c of the smell of smoke. The 7th floor room (King - city view) was much better - updated with modern appliances in kitchen, but the arm chair was visibly dirty and soiled. Bathroom was used when I checked in and it appeared that the bed was used - but the manager told me they just don't iron the sheets? The toilet broke - but then again it was an old school toilet with hardware from the 70s or 80s. The toilet and tub are separate and in a tiny space - if you are big you will have to leave the door open. Maybe if you step into the tub, then close the door. The Location - typically when you stay at a \"beachfront\" property it is expected that beyond the back exits of the hotel is the pool area and then the beach. The layout at ESJ has the pool maybe 3 stories up from the beach - to get to the beach you have to go down into the garage basement - walk a distance - stop in an office to get towels, then head to the first security door, to be greeted by yet another security gate with a guard. (that closes at 7pm) Then you may exit to the beach. It was a hassle. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. GO TO Mi Casita. Not much to do except hang out at El San Hotel - this is the premiere nightlife spot in Isla Verde - ran into a few celebrities. It is right next door. The Beach - it is a nice beach, but for beach lovers who are use to the more expansive beaches off the Florida Gulf Coast or East - you will want more. The beach has a small strip of sand and can easily get crowded. Hardly enough room for frolicking. The view includes run down abandoned buildings and other hotels. Luquillo Beach is gorgeous and I hear Flamenco Beach may be the best in all the Caribbean. They have umbrellas for $10 - chairs for $3-5 bucks. Amenities - They charge $12.95 for internet access! It has to say it is included in your rate for it to be free. They do have a computer room for use @ 35c per minute - but the internet connection is pitiful and a complete waste of time. I complained - one desk clerk gave me a crumpled AT&T piece of paper and told me to call them. Excuse me - you provide the service - don't you care how it is working??? Breakfast was OK. It is served in a cafeteria style room - also dark but with TVs. Customer Service - the manager and staff may seem to be accommodating - truthfully I feel their only goal is to not be rude. Which is not bad - but I am often greeted with a smile and by my name when I check into nicer chain hotels. If you have to wait in line while 5 staff members have a conversation and ignore you until they finish - it means to me customers do not come first. Just don't have any problems, don't hassle them and things will be fine for you. On the otherhand - the people who are nice are just genuinely nice people and naturally can't help themselves - not too many of them though. Summary - If you expect beautiful accommodations when staying at a beachfront hotel - you will be SORELY disappointed. However, if you are a family/group on a budget and want to be close to the beach as much as possible and need to cook a few meals - I can see how some would think this is great. But how do get over the dark halls, smells and 1970s lobby and hassle getting to the beach??? Also - perhaps the higher floors with an ocean view are renovated?? But my bathtub was lined with shiny linoleum - from 1970.

Our room at ESJ Towers (1573) must have had a recent makeover, because the furnishings, amenities, etc., we all new and comfortable. We were on the west side of the building, away from the airport, so it was quiet with a great view of the beach. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and answer any questions. We visited the pool and beach several times during our stay. Never tried the Happy Apple restaurant off the lobby, since there were so many other excellent places nearby. The balcony was nice, but whoever decided to install air conditioner compressor units on those small balconies should be pushed off a balcony! Everytime the AC compressor turned on you had to either turn off the AC or go inside to get away from the roar. Terrible design! As previously reported, the Towers provide a lot of security, which they must feel is needed, although we never saw or heard about any problems. The room safe was large enough to hold our laptop, so we were happy with that. The local neighborhood is urban, and probably not a great place to go for an evening stroll. But in the daytime it felt pretty secure to us. We rented a car from Hertz (no problems at all, a week's worth of gas cost us only $25!). The driving in Puerto Rico (both in the city of San Juan and on the winding, narrow mountain roads) was harrowing, to say the least. These roads are definitely not for the faint of heart! But we survived, and visited Old Town, Fort Morro, the rainforest, and the observatory at Arecibo. Didn't drive all the way around the island as planned; decided to stay at the resort a couple of times to recover from the roads! Did I mention the lack of signs (others have in their reviews)? Road signs are optional all over PR, so you never know where you really are or what road you are turning onto. Sometimes you just have to be lucky. One staffer at the observatory advised me to get a GPS unit, although I'm not sure how well a GPS would work there. Probably a good investment. The observatory at Arecibo was a little disappointing. No guided tours, just a movie that they show you. The staff isn't very technical, so I couldn't get answers to many of my questions (I used to work at the Kennedy Space Center and consider myself a \"space junkie\".) At the rainforest we paid three bucks for a guide, who had an advanced degree in horticulture. My wife is a serious gardener, and found the walk to be quite informative and interesting. Well worth it. The underground \"dungeon\" garage at ESJ Towers is not a fun place. But we always managed to find a parking spot and avoid hitting any of the poor pedestrians who try to walk along the narrow driving lanes to get to the pool or their cars. One big surprise at ESJ Towers was the lack of any timeshare sales pressure. We saw people sitting at an unmarked lobby desk who looked like timeshare salespeople, but none ever spoke to us and we received no calls, not even a brochure. The lobby concierge was also very helpful but never suggested that we spend a dime on a tour or anything else. I liked that! We found the Pueblo supermarket down a side street across from the ESJ Towers, behind the Chilis restaurant. Good place to buy a deli lunch or some of those delicious PR breakfast rolls. But for dinner we went out every night to one of the excellent restaurants. These included the Parrot Club in Old Town San Juan (good), and Koco, Alfredos and Brother Jimmy's BBQ at the El San Juan Hotel next door and Lupis Mexican restaurant on the other side of the ESJ Towers. All of those restaurants (all a very short walk away) were most excellent, with outstanding food and service. Even the BBQ was better than most stateside places we've been to. Nightlife is a big deal to us, and although we didn't explore the city looking for locals hangouts as we usually do (driving and parking conditions were prohibitive), we discovered nightly salsa bands playing in the huge lobby of the El San Juan Hotel next door. This is a place where the locals dress up and watch the crazy tourists, and the tourists go there to watch the locals show off their best moves. We always sat at the largest lobby bar with a good view of the dance floor and the band, satisfying our craving for nightlife. Prices were a bit stiff, but service and entertainment were worth it. There is a casino at the hotel, but it takes your money and gives little in return. Guess that's all I can think of. We may post some photos or a video in the near future, but so far haven't worked on the ones we took there. Would we go back to Puerto Rico? Probably not, because there are so many other nice islands in the Caribbean with less congestion.

The first thing that scored high points was the fact that they have a free parking garage with security. It has become common practice in PR to charge an arm and a leg for parking at hotels that are already quite expensive. So this was excellent. You go straight from the garage into the elevators to your apartment. They gave me a large studio with two queen size beds, and a kitchenette . The bathroom was huge with double sinks and the shower even had a stainless steel retractable clothes line. I was lucky enough to get a breathtaking view of the ocean and the Isla Verde skyline through the large sliding door. The balcony of the unit was quite large and had plenty of space to sit and walk around. You also get private access to the beach with a key.I just wished my husband had been there with me but it was a quick trip to see my dad. Definitely a safe place for a woman traveling alone. It is an older property and as soon as you walk into the lobby you can get a feel from the seventies but it is kept in tip top shape. It' only 5 minutes from the airport and you can leave your car parked in the garage and walk to any store or restaurant in just minutes.

That being said, let me continue......We exchanged our timeshare, through interval, for a week's stay at the ESJ towers. It is minutes from the airport, costs about 10 bucks for a cab ride. The hotel/condominium (some people live there full time, this seems to be common) is located in Isla Verde, right on the beach. Yes, the lobby is a bit dark, so are the hallways, but not in a scary way.......there seems to have been a lot of fresh painting going on, as well as an overhaul of new carpet, decor, etc.. There is NO SMOKING inside the hotel and you are encouraged to smoke on your balcony, thankfully!!! Our room was on the 9th floor, overlooked some homes and the beach, this is a very populated area so wide open spaces are NOT to be found, other than the beaches. Our room had 2 double beds, they seemed a bit smaller than a traditional double, flat screen tv, kitchenette, with microwave, small stove, refrigerator with ice maker, sink, etc.. The room is decorated in that typical carrib/floridian motiff of pastels, flowers and wicker. Bathroom was a decent size, a little dated, but clean and large enough. There is a pool, which we never used, they claim it's olympic sized, but I don't think so. It is very basic with a lot of loungers lined up in rows with a little bar for snacks and cocktails......not my scene (there seems to be a large senior population that stays here), plus, i want to swim in the ocean! To access the beach, you must go down to B1 floor, walk a few feet throught the parking garage, where the fitness center is (it has showers, sauna, lockers, adjoins a long workout room). There you can pick up towels for the beach, if you need them and rent a lounge chair, if you want to, for 2.00 (they're 4.00 if you rent on the beach) which we didn't......i like laying on the sand! Go through security and you're on the beach. The beaches are all public, ESJ ensures that nobody wonders onto their property, who isn't a guest, by posting a guard at the front drive, front doors and beach side. It's NOT in an unsafe area, it's just to assure that the grounds are used by the guests only. Here's the deal about the beach......there are 2 bays......the one in front of the ESJ is long with a wide. white sanded beach, it's where most of the hotels are located. There is this seaweed \"thing\" that occurs a couple times per month where the ocean purges itself of seaweed and washes it up on the beach and is in the water......there are machines that they used to clean it up, but it's a lot......it runs in cycles down the beach, no big deal. We, however walked about a block over to go to the bay on the other side, where the surfers go, fo us to swim and sunbathe. it's about a 5 minute walk, down 2 streets to the the beach and a walk down the beach until we reached a spot we liked, usually between the ritz and the marriot. no seaweed on this side, it's a bit quieter and more sun. NOT to say that the beach in front of ESJ is bad, we used both beaches, we preferred the one on the \"right\" side..... The hotel is really right in the middle of everything; great restaurants, bus routes, grocery store around the corner, casinos, etc. The hotel also offers a concierge service which helped us pick out 2 excursions, a tour of old san juan, the fort and Bacardi rum, the other was to the El Yunque rainforest where we swam in a waterfall. Some key points: Try DONJOSE'S restaurant, just around the corner for AN EXCELLENT AUTHENTIC homestyle Puerto RIcan dinner, nothing fancy, but great food!!! The bus rides to old san juan are only .75 and take about 45 minutes and are an easy way to travel, but be aware that everybody in san juan drive like maniacs!! they make manhattan drivers look like they're standing still!!! We had an awesome stay here at the ESJ towers, remember, your vacation is what YOU make of it.....if you're going to be picky, crabby etc. that's the time you'll experience, you are going on a vacation to enjoy yourself, a hotel is NOT your home, NOT everything would be done as you would at your own home.

Two is that if you rent a car, there's a chance that someone's guest could be parked in your spot. We got a rental, went to our assigned parking spot and had to wait 45 minutes for the owner to come move it. All of the staff at ESJ were very helpful and kind. Not one complaint about the service, if anything I compliment them. They always greeted us when we were coming in or heading out, always hailed down a taxi like it was an emergency, helped with questions about whatever we asked. It was nice not to have to deal with them directly for our billing though, that's one reason why you should definitely rent from Chana. It's ESJ for less! Not to mention El San Juan Hotel and Casino is literally next door.

I had read most of the reviews before we left and was a little apprehensive. We are beach people and Isle Verde has a nice beach, some trash, but no sewage nor broken glass. We were not hassled by vendors, locals sell beer($3), water and drinks($1) on the beach. The beach bars are more expensive. After 6pm the noseeums bugs come out and attack with all teeth. Don't rent an umbrella($10/day) when there is plenty of shade under the palms. The hotel was nice, we were on the east side, 3rd floor, full shade by noon with a nice ocean breeze. Room was an efficiency with 2 double beds, kitchen with full fridge and a full bathrrom. It was enough for my wife, daughter(19) and me. Corners of the floor and the bedspreads could have been a bit cleaner but the towels, sheets, carpet, dishes, fridge were all clean. ESJ overdoes security with the pool and beach access closing at 7pm. Requires ESJ bracelets are bit much for using the pool and beach. Access to the fitness room ( beach gear, towels and replacement room linens) was easy to find and no hassle. As for eating, we ate at Metropol, (to the left of the security gate 2 blocks for PR cusine and was nice. We ate mostly ate at Lupi's sports bar right by the main road entrance, which as great ! I highly suggest the grouper fingers! Old SanJuan is accesible by taxi for $21 each way. The best thing we did was the Catamaran tour and for $80 per person its the best money you ever spent. If I knew it was that cool we would have done it several times. All the staff and locals were always friendly. The Pueblo grocery is 2 blocks walking straight out of the ESJ entrance and a Walgreens was 2 blocks to the left of the entrance. The worst thing we encountered was the damn Card keys to access your room, pool and beach. they hardly worked! We would stay there again for sure.

We rented from Maria O'Neill, who advertised on vrbo.com. If you would like her contact information, please send me a message and I will forward it to you. She sent us pictures of her place, and it was exactly as we would have imagined. 10 minutes from the airport, 14th floor condo with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. This was perfect for us, since there were two mother/daughter pairs, and then two others. The mothers and daughters had 1 queen room, 1 king master room, and the other two friends each had their own twin bed in another bedroom. Plenty of closet and drawer space. Each room had a window that looked out to the ocean. And the view from the balcony!! :) It was the first thing we saw when walking into the condo! Absolutely breathtaking. As we were a group of women, we felt very secure since there were 3 doors (with locks) to enter the condo. The hotel is a little old and dated, but I don't care about that as long as the room is great. I think the issue of your room depends upon the owner of the condo itself. Our owner had great taste in decorating and made sure our condo was very clean, so we had no issues. Plenty of towels were provided. There was a wall-mounted TV in each bedroom. Cute bathroom soaps and shampoo were supplied. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Kitchen had a large fridge, microwave, toaster oven, and washer and dryer in the far corner. Plenty of storage space for your food and drinks. The staff was great; extremely helpful whenever we needed it. Everyone was friendly and offered great advice. The one negative I have is that I would not recommend the breakfast buffet- at $13 pp, it was not worth it at all. It just didn't look appetizing, and it was not that much of a buffet- not that many choices available. And you couldn't pay cash, you had to charge it to the room. Why charge it when I have the cash right here? There were two rooms that had 3 computers available in each for free. It was nice to check email and print out our boarding passes at no charge. I only had to wait for a computer once, and then only for about 5 mins. The beach in front of this property is great. It was not that big a deal going to the ground floor and walking through the parking lot for 10 seconds to get to the beach. Towels could be picked up on the way to the beach, supplied in a room in the garage. Chairs were available for rental at $4 each, umbrellas at $10. Right next to the El San Juan hotel, so we went to their pool bar for drinks, and there was a cart on the beach that sold chicken and beef skewers, hot dogs, water, etc. The water was perfect- nice and warm enough so that there was no shock upon entering, but cool enough for a break from the sun and heat. The waves were gentle, but high enough to have fun jumping in them. The sand was soft too. We could see the airplanes taking off from SJU from the beach, but the noise was minimal. We could barely hear them. There was a dispatcher at the entrance of the hotel, so if you needed a cab, you waited for less than 5 mins for one. We usually got one right away. The A5 bus also stopped right out front of the El San Juan hotel. We never rode it, preferring to take a taxi. Within walking distance is a Walgreens, Denny's (for breakfast), Outback steakhouse, Ponderosa, etc. We ate mostly in OSJ. I would recommend you look up La Bombonera, Barrachina (dinner and a flamenco dancing show), and El Asador (open air dining and bar). We used Castillo Tours for a sailing and snorkeling trip. Nice since one of their offices was in the hotel lobby, and we received transportation right from the hotel that day. Well worth the $80 pp for the whole day's transportation, sailing, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), lunch, and snorkeling. Overall, I would stay at this place again with a group. If you're looking for a place for couples, I wouldn't recommend it.

But our room was so bright and spacious, and we had a view of the ocean toward Pinones as well as over part of Carolina. It was terrific to have a full kitchen, and the grocery store was a 10minute walk away. My only complaint is about cleanliness - the maid wasn't thorough; we found several sunflower seed hulls on the floor by the patio door which was gross cuz obviously the last slobby guest had spit them out of his/her mouth. And there were some dirt marks on the floors in the bathroom, like the maid had cleaned with a dirty mop or just smeared some of the dirt instead of wiping it all up. The shower didn't drain that great, either. But I thought the location was terrific - right on the beach, a really nice long public beach.

The timeshare is owned by my mother in law and she was able to transfer her week to us. This was our first trip to PR. I had read reviews of ESJ before going and was so scared at what I would find. But the cost for us was so cheap (about $175 for the whole week) I couldnt pass it up. Let me outline the good things about staying here first. The hotel is a short ride from the Airport. There are several resturaunts within walking distance. There are many \"American\" amenities nearby such as a walgreens and fast food resturaunts. The bus stop is close. The beach was decent and the pool was nice. They have a play area for kids. The staff was nice. We had a pretty good view on a nice little terrace. They have high speed internet acess. Now the bad news. The entrance to the hotel is located in a weird spot. I think some people live here full time so there is a security gate at the front. then down a long road, on the side of the building is the main entrance. Not too big of a deal but kind of a long walk if you are on foot. The lobby was very outdated- fantasy island style. They have an arcade also outdated. And a small grovery store insanely over priced. I had read other reviews about how gross the rooms were. They were not exaggerating! The room smelled horrible! We finally got to the source of it- it was comming from the sink in the mini kitchen. It smelled like rotten food. I didnt ask to change rooms becuase I had read that they wont accomodate. Also there is not maid service for the timeshare rooms. So you have to go to the garage and change out towels. We sprayed air freshner the whole time we were there. We didnt use the kitchen at all so it was pointless. The beds were hard as rocks. The floors looked like they hadnt been swept or mopped in ages. The whole room was outdated. The shower was old, and the faucet kinda rusty but tolerable. Getting to the pool and beach sucked. You had to go downstairs through the parking garage. Kind of a schlep. You have to rent beach chairs. We rented a car the last three days there and the parking garage sucks! I would avoid staying here ever again unless I stayed for cheap and before I booked I would let them know about my previous experience and hope they would put me somewhere better. The only upside was that Puerto Rico was amazing. It was the best vacation I have had to date. We did so much we were only in the room at night so we dealt with it. Definately go to Puerto Rico. If you are staying around San Jaun, avoid this place. You have to go to the bioluminescent (sp) bay in Fajardo.

Everywhere we went, including villages, looked fairly well maintained and prosperous. This time our unit #553 was like a hotel room with a small kitchen (apt. range, sink, full refrig, microwave, dishes for 4) Last time we had more space but in sight and sound of nearby airport. This time balcony overlooked ocean; well, actually rooftops and very noisy service area, but wide ocean view beyond. Double beds, lots of bamboo furniture with many drawers. Room had new looking blue/green pattern carpeting, peach colored walls, tropic colored bedspreads and drapes. Table and chairs for 4. As exchangers we had no maid service which suited us fine. Bathroom had separate bath and toilet space, large sink and vanity space with closet and adequate hangers. Small soaps, extra tissue. Paper towels and dish cloth thingy in kitchen but no detergent. Not much contact with personnel but what we had was efficient and pleasant. Key cards did not always work for access doors to beach and pool. Watch that tricky gate to beach. Have to set it just right, punch in numbers and move quickly. I and many others got caught in between like a monkey in a cage and had to wait for assistance, but got used to it. Beach beautiful and long around the coast, great for walking and sunning but not many people using it for swimming, except on a holiday while we were there, lots of local families..Before, we went to Luquillo Beach along the coast to the east, famous and beautiful but we did not get there this time We (senior citizens) enjoyed just sitting on beach, reading (chairs $2.14 daily, towels free) and sitting around the pool. Rented Corolla from Hertz,, found out at last minute that our home insurance did not cover PR so had to buy expensive insurance; therefore we felt obligated to make good use of the car. Went to El Yunque rain forest one day, our 3rd time, but they have built a really nice visitor's center since last time with exhibits and facilities. We drove only as far as the tower and climbed up for the view, did not penetrate any farther. Lovely weather all the time we were there this week, 84 degrees and very little rain. Drove into Old San Juan, finally found parking garage. OUr car was equipped with GPS and we really used it but not always understandable in city and mountain villages with one way streets and detours. Traffic seems much much heavier than our last trip. Roads are good and well marked but lots of traffic and delays, even on the four lanes. We walked the usual tourist route, El Morro etc, in Old San Juan, had lunch near the cathedral. Husb wanted to drive into the mountainous interior. From an article in Que Pasa maga zine we chose Barranquitas with lunch stop in Aibonito and programmed car to take us by scenic mountain routes. It was that all right, round and round and up and down, good well marked roads but narrow and curving. Beautiful scenery of mountains. Had lunch at Aibonito and returned, did not make it to Barq. As previous reviews, we returned nearly every night to our fav restaurant, Mi Casita, also ate at Chili's across street from ESJ entrance gate. Minimarket in ESJ is well supplied but expensive. We bought breakfast supplies. There is a grocery store next door to Mi Casita. El San Juan resort and casino next door was a Wyndam property last trip. Expensive restaurants which we did not use this time. Casino took our money and did not pay off as well as last time so did not spend as much time there.

The local area has some good restaurants . Mi Casini is a block West in a shopping center. It is excellent. To the East is Interpol. Also very good but no breakfast. Rented a car as there is not much to do locally. Reasonable rates. Advised by ESJ to look for our P-spot as they are not in order for security reasons. Four floors of searching random numbers. We never found it in two days. Ran the risk of using guest parking and won. We still can't make sense of this. Also, the conciere was helpful in calling the rental company but not much help in pointing out that they were looking for us outside while I roamed the lobby for 20 minutes.

Checking was quick and uneventful. We stayed on the 6TH floor which faced the east side and some partial views of the Atlantic. As far as Personnel, every one was very receptive to requests.You have to request towels for the beach, but the location is on the way to the beach, so it is not inconvenient. What is inconvenient is when you have to walk all the way to such location for your room towels or toilet paper. The access to the beach as right behind the hotel, but we were perplexed by the fact that it does close at 7:00pm, yet you can walk a few blocks and have access to it. Perhaps this is to reduce liability for the Hotel, however, when the pool closes also at 7:00 pm , it really puts a hamper on trying to relax and enjoy the premises after dinner. The beach was extremely busy, but it could have been due to the date, we were there for the 4th of July. As far as the pool, was clean and a decent size. The lounge chairs were in great condition and there was some cabanas with tables provided, and the towels for the pool were actually provided right there also. You do need to provide for the room key so they will attach a band in order for one to have access to the pool. The room was a different story, although the beds and sheets were very clean, the carpet and the bedspreads/window treatments contrasted. Not that we expect everything to match, but there are somethings that could be done to create a more inviting room.The kitchen was mainly a galley kitchen, but it did have all the necessities needed for cooking, except for a blender. That was one necessity that should be incorporated, perhaps they could save the money they are spending on the hand bands at the pool and purchase the blenders. Although, our room faced a residential area, it still had some partial views of the Atlantic. The balcony was big enough to add a couple of chairs and small table, but at least if offered such an amenity, although, the A/C unit could be quite noisy.We did have breakfast one day at their restaurant, once again the decor was drab looking and the lighting was too dull. We had breakfast for 2, it was about $24 for a hot breakfast, nothing out of the ordinary, except for a gregarious middle age woman who sang to us and everyone else there while serving coffee. She was the only Sunshine in that location.There is a small store on the premises, and it carries the necessities.The hotel is very centrally located so you can walk to restaurants, and other hotels. It does sit behind the El San Juan, which like many big name hotels, has a Casino. Also, straight out of the hotel, you can find a supermarket, you could walk, but it might be about 8 or so blocks.

The decor is from the 70/80s but regardless the room and hotel were clean. The sheets had an emblem of the hotel with the year 1975\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 think that was the last time they ever made any changes. The point of this trip was simply to visit Puerto Rico for leisure and tourist attractions. That's what this hotel was perfect for. We woke up every day, got ready and went out. This hotel met that need. There were the occasional rain showers that forced us to stay a couple of hours and it was okay. We rented a car and that's something I would recommend. We never ate at the hotel restaurant based on the recommendations on this website. We did buy groceries on our first day and had breakfast in the room every day.

Management came and took care of it. Regardless, the wait and the fact that no one monitored this (until after the scandal) was ridiculous.

They didn't bring anything to you. Did I mention that you are charged $5 a day for these items? That is what I did mind, but simply thought \"oh well\".

Upon our arrival, the door to our studio unit broke before we were unpacked and locked us out. The property owner came after waiting over an hour. We used the sliding patio door and left our personal belongings in our unlocked room for the first day of vacation until they repaired the locking mechanism. Our private porch consisted of hot, sticky, tacky green flooring with 5' concrete walls that hid our view from the pool, but allowed mop water from other balconies. And as for the door leading to the pool; it automatically locked after closing it and our owner provided no key, even after we demanded one. So we used a nearby concrete ledge to step up and over the wall to our room until security (I like to refer to him as the towel nazi) scolded us. So poolside was NOT poolside and even if it were easy to get to and from the pool from our \"poolside\" room, the pool only overlooked a portion of the beach, but was not accessible from the pool. We had to walk back indoors, take the elevator to the parking garage, walk 5 minutes through the garage to the towel rental room (which was often vacant), and then through a sequence of secured doors (swipe cards) and when we made it outside alas, we had to remember a 6-digit security number to get to and from the beach. A code that, although I kept forgetting (I'm sorry i WAS on vacation after all) other guests and locals alike recited whenever I chose to walk the beach, I mean between the hours of 9am-7pm of course. Once on the beach, we found the need for sandals, as glass and seaweed cluttered the shore. To the right, we noticed that raw sewage was being emptied directly onto the beach from a restaurant, so that area was out of the question. For the remainder of the vacation we swam in the pool, played poolside BINGO (which was the only quality entertainment, if that floats your boat) and walked along the shore, but we never felt a sense of security or safety, maybe a sign from all of the beautifully landscaped RAZOR WIRE that made me feel like I was in Alcatraz. We thought we would try the rest of the island, since we read about beautiful beaches in Puerto Rico. Another let down. Don't try to travel the island in a day, it takes forever considering there are only 3 places of interest along the way (tolls ranged from .50-$1.75). The town of Ponce, with it's cute marina appeal, isn't worth the drive with it's shallow coral beach, not to mention the public bathrooms that were splattered with human waste (a recurring theme in Puerto Rico). San Juan is what it is, a port town that attracts cruise ship tourists. I do, however, recommend the El Morro Castle tours in Old San Juan. Overall, ESJ Towers is not a beach destination. And since the building itself casts a shadow over it's own pool until almost noon everyday, and the stand up jacuzzi closes at 4pm, I can't say it's a \"sit by the pool\" destination either. If you are considering Puerto Rico, I would suggest the Intercontinental San Juan Hotel & Casino, with it's cleaner sea, ocean front pool and accomodating nightlife.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended!\u201d", "Author": "mandalay1971", "ReviewID": "UR15069093", "Content": "For around $200 a night, this hotel is hard to beat.

I read all the reviews on this property and was quite apprehensive as to what we would find. We booked our 3 bedroom/2bath condo from a private owner. We did not book through ESJ Towers so I cannot comment on the units they have available for rent. We knew going in that that this is was not a fancy resort with all of the anemities they have to offer. The location is great. The staff at ESJ Towers were great - couretous, friendly, extremely helpful......they couldnt have been better. The conceirge is open every day until about 9pm. It was an invaluable source of information and help for us. We found the lobby large with lots of seating. My husband spent a fair amount of time using the wireless internet in this area. There were 2 rooms with computers and printers - great for printing out boarding passes or anything else. There is a mini mart on site that has a huge variety of items including beer, wine, liquor- yes they are more pricey than a large food store, but it is very convenient to pick up a thing or two. I had read alot about beach access. It was not a big deal at all. You take an elevator to the parking garage, exit, walk maybe 30 steps to a door (security - you need your room card to exit) that leads to the beach. It is not \"dark\" during the day as the entrance the cars use to enter the parking garage is right there and lets in LOTS of light. Also the fitness center is located in this area of the parking garagewhere you can also sign out towels and rent beach chairs for $2 . Once you leave the building, you enter a small playground area and a gate to beach access. You punch in a 5 digit code to open gate to beach. This access code was the same the entire time we were there. There was also a securty guard there most of the time checking our names off the list. There is also a man right on the beach in front of ESJ Towers who rents nice beach chairs for $4 a day. Water sports are located very nearby too (jet skiis, banana boats etc). The pool......This area was very nice and large. It had lots of reclining beach chairs. The chairs had cushions on them and towels were always avaialble. We were there over Easter and we were always able to find chairs. There is a small snack stand that sells soda, water, beer, alcohol drinks and hotdogs. There is also a nice bathroom in the pool area. There is security there - a ESJ security guard checks your name on a list and gives you a wrist bracelet. We did not use the restaurant or visit the Mano Mano Lounge. There is a billiard room with 2 pool tables. Also a \"card room\" with 4 tables. People were using this as a computer room for wireless internet users. The game room had approximately 10 video games in it. You have to pass through a security gate to enter the property. There is also a security person where you park to register etc. He was great! There is also a securty person where you enter the parking garage. This is a very secured property. From what I observed, all of the properties are treated in this way. While some people find this an aggravation. It is done for our safety. This isnt a 5 star hotel or resort. For us, it worked great. We had a nice clean condo with 2 ocean view balconies, washer and dryer 3 tvs etc. Hotel prices in San Juan, especially beachfront, are pricey. I would suggest you research private owners who have property here. Quite often you can see pictures of their units and that is a great help. Overall, I would not hesitate to stay here again. It isnt the Ritz or the El San Juan......but you arent paying the high prices like you would staying there. We chose it so we could all stay together in one condo as it was a family vacation. We didnt want to stay in a hotel with separate rooms for a week. If you have any questions, send them my way.

We were awoken at 2am with them unloading tables and chairs for a large party the next day. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked, but they placed us in another room the next morning.

Unfortunately, even more loud is the air conditioning unit that is on each balcony that makes sitting out on the balcony less than desirable. Not enough to bother sleep, but loud on the balcony. The beach was fantastic and the pool was great. It would be better if there was direct access from the pool to the beach. Vendors are on the beach for chairs, para-sailing and jet skis. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Great parking in an enclosed garage. Near all sorts of restaurants and easy access to the highway for quick trips into San Juan or other parts of the island. We stayed here at a fraction of the cost of close by pricy hotels and simply took advantage of services at other hotels with a short walk (i.e. restaurants, casinos, shopping). Though there is a convenient mini mart in the lobby. We had breakfast at the hotel once (not good) and did not go to the bar or game rooms or onsite gym. For dining, I highly recommend Alfredo's restaurant at the Intercontinental. Somewhat pricy, but great food and great service. Ask to sit outdoors. One down side is that being a time share, most of the residents were older (70s and above) and you again had the feeling you were on an episode of the Golden Girls. This was mostly apparent at the pool vs the beach which was a very mixed crowd. Being ins my 40s and wanting a quiet, relaxing trip, I didn't mind, but my travel companion in his 30s felt awkward. So, it's not the Ritz, but youre not paying the Ritz prices either. Instead, it is a good value for on the beach property, clean rooms, convenient location , friendly staff and lots of in house services.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat family vacation\u201d", "Author": "karthikb", "ReviewID": "UR14645564", "Content": "We spent a week in late March 2008, staying at the ESJ towers.

It also had about 6 fairly new computers with internet access that can be used as part of the $5/day mandatory resort fee (it covers parking also). The secure access to the beach was not as complicated as some of the reviews had suggested. Also, we realized it was not just for this hotel but almost every hotel and residential buildings along the beach had similar secure controlled access into their properties.

Nice happy greetings when you enter, cab service at the drop of a dime. At checkin we were told that we had to pay an extra charge of $40.00/room if we wanted maid service. If you choose not to use the maid service you simply have to walk downstairs to trade in old towels for new ones. (as well as sheets and pillowcases) The rooms are a little \"out dated\" as far as interior design. After a long day of touring around the city i didn't let that bother me. It is a place to lay your head until the next day's long excursion. The pictures on the website speak truly. There is a restaurant called the Happy Apple downstairs, a grocery store, game room with pool tables, a cocktail bar, free internet access room with 3 computers available and a workout room. The Hotels is on one of the most nices beaches, Isla Verde. The water is georgous, blue as blue can be and wonderful sand. There is no bar service so be sure to take a portable cooler down with you. There might be small portables that will sell you drinks but you can always walk about 10-20 feet further down to another hotel who will sell it to you. Here is a list of things you should know: `The Pool closes at 7pm 7 days a week. `There is not beach access from the hotel after 7, I believe b/c of saftey reasons. `you have to walk down the street to find your own beach access after 7pm. (I'm not sure if you can even come back to the hotel beach area) You do have to walk downstairs through the underground parking garage to gain access to the beach, it's not as complicated as others have said. The pool has no swim up bar but a small cabana that sells beer and pina colodas, hot dogs and nachos only. `you do have a small but useful kitchenette, refridgerator, small electric stove, microwave, coffee maker, and average sink. If you are used to luxurious interiors or upscale dining, this is not the place for you. You are next to El San Juan Hotel and Casino & The Intercontinental which is a small walk away.

We stayed in an area called Isle Verdes. ESJ Towers is one of the many resorts located on Isle Verdes. There are a plenty of sightseeing and fun activities to do on this island. It is a US Territory so it has all of the common fast food restaurants like the US such as Subway, Pizza Hut, Dominos, McDonalds, Burger King, etc. There are a number of people who understand and speak English every where that you go. Peurto has a lot to offer a vacationer, but ESJ is no hoopla. There is nothing fancy about this resort hotel. It gives you your minimum accommodations both in the rooms and on the grounds. When you enter the room it has the appliances on one side of the entrance (usually to your left) and enough space to enter with your luggage. The kitchen appliances are aligned next to one another starting with the refrigerator, stove, sink, and counter with microwave and cabinets in your basic white color. Once you walk pass the microwave, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the bedroom similar to an efficiency apt. The furniture is made of wicker (See pictures attached). The room is exactly like the pictures on the webpage online at [--]. There are small rooms off the lobby that houses one of the listed items per room: internet or writing tables, ping pong table and board games, a pool table, a small arcade room, a general store, a bar room, a restaurant for breakfast and lunch. The outdoor pool is located on the second floor. It is nice and clean with a refreshment stand. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use cash at this stand. You have to bill it to your room. You have to walk through a dimly lit parking garage to get to the small gym and beach. You exchange your towels in the gym as well. It has a treadmill, bike, little tv, and free weights. You have to have a pass code to enter the beach. This was the worst feature of the hotel. They should just make steps coming off the pool area so that you can easily get to the beach. It is inconvenient to leave your room on the 8th floor, go to the basement, out the door through the dimly lit parking garage, up some other steps, and punch in your code that you have already forgotten by the time you get to the beach. If your room is in the south building facing the pool and beach, change rooms because it is noisy. The hotel behind you makes deliveries all day and night and uses a crane system to hoist the freights and it is loud. We had to change rooms to the other side of the building to sleep peacefully. They were remodeling some of the rooms beneath us which were noisy, but they worked on the rooms during the day. ESJ has average resort accommodations. There is nothing luxurious or elegant. It is basic and simple in each room. The lobby and pool are its greatest features. I rate the overall hotel a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153C\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd average on a grading scale of A-F. I rate the pleasantness of the staff an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A-.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I rate the location on Isle Verdes a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153B.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The next time that I visit San Juan, I will stay at another resort for the elegance. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in college then it is great, but if you have visited other resorts, it does not come close to a silver or gold star resort. I had mainly three complaints. The noise outside my room from the adjacent hotel delivery system, the hot and cold water knobs had mold and rust around them, and the entrance to the beach being accessed via the parking lot. They accommodated us by moving us to another room. I enjoyed that the resort was located in short walking distance to all restaurants, ATM, block buster, post office, San Juan Hotel with the casino inside, and a 24 hour grocery store, etc. Isles Verdes can use street cleaning, but is tolerable. I believe most people like ESJ because it is close to shopping, restaurants, souvenir shops, Walgreens, a 24-hour grocery store, the beach, public transportation, and tours. Old San Juan is a better looking part of the Island. It reminds you of San Francisco with the hilly streets and it was clean with a lot of historical sites. Here are some of the activities that are a must when you visit Peurto Rico: Bacardi/Old San Juan tour, Rainforest tour, Kayak-Bioluminescence Bay tour, Catamaran Trip, and a ferry or plane ride to Culebra Island. You should do one tour each day so that you can relax by the end of the day and get the busy items out of the way in the beginning of your week. The Bacardi/Old San Juan tour costs $40 per person and includes a tour of the Bacardi Rum Distillery, San Cristobal Fort, and historical sites. The Distillery gives you two free drinks and a movie tour. They stopped the actual walk through of the distillery. (Big disappointment). The Rainforest Tour costs $65 per person which consists of Yokahu Tower, hike to La Mina Rainforest (the more beautiful waterfall). Kayak Bioluminescence Bay tour costs $75 per person. It is a kayak tour that all can enjoy even beginners and non swimmers. You tour a lagoon which has waste deep water that glows a fluorescent green color. Unfortunately, humans have destroyed most of the water so it barely glows, but it is done at night and is a lot of fun (nothing scary). The Catamaran trip costs $65 per person. It consists of sailing, snorkeling, and lunch. Culebra Island Trip is the beach with the white sand, tropical fish, and best beaches. The 16 minute plane ride is only $27 per person and the ferry was $2.50 for a 2 hour ride. You must arrive to the ferry by 6:30 am to get in line to get a ticket if you want the earliest ferry or you may find yourself standing outside in the sun waiting for hours for the next ferry. The plane ride is the better way to travel because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less crowded and guaranteed to have space available when you want to leave. The ferry not so much. I hope this was helpful. I encourage others to take the time to print your experience. I gave lengthy details because I did not have many recent reviews before I toured. You can stay at ESJ but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect luxurious rooms. Expect rooms that look like they cost $100 a night not $250 or above. Isle Verdes is one strip with basic shopping\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no fine dining and a little trashy in spots. Not the entire area. The beach is okay with a lot of seaweed on the shores.

The apartment was very clean, was decorated attractively, had plenty of clean towels and linen, and a kitchen fully equipped with dishes and appliances. We even had a washing machine and dryer in our unit. I think the condition and decor of the units vary, but we lucked out. The pool was nice with plenty of lounge chairs surrounding it and a hot tub nearby. The pool was a plain shaped pool without fancy landscaping, but it was a nice size and clean and there was a kiosk by the pool which served pretty good drinks. Plenty of towels were available for quests at the pool and at the fitness center. The beach was nice except that for part of our stay there was a lot of sea weed in front of our hotel. It was not only our hotel, but some of the adjacent fancier resorts also had the same problem. The staff at ESJ were very helpful and friendly. The staff at the front desk, the concierge, the minimart and the restaurant were all very friendly and accomodating. My children enjoyed the ping-pong tables, the game room and the pool tables during our stay. I was glad to see that the hotel offered internet service 24/7 at no extra cost to its guests. The location of ESJ was central to a lot of the tourist sites in Puerto Rico as well as casinos, golf courses and night life. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to families who are looking for a nice, convenient place to stay with the understanding that the facilities are not fancy, resort level facilities. We would consider a return trip to ESJ Towers in the future.", "Date": "February 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Mayland", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "BeachloverBaltimore", "ReviewID": "UR6710407", "Content": "We just returned from a week-long vacation at the Esj towers. After reading some of the more recent reviews on this site, we approached the vacation with trepidation. I'm glad to report that our accomodations were much better than expected and that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We rented a 2 bedroom condo through a private realtor, Palm View Realty. The agent, Alma, was helpful in securing apartments for my family as well as my sister's family. The apartments were spacious , clean and well maintained, even if they were somewhat old. We had a nice balcony with a beautiful view of the ocean. We did not have any maid service for the week and I felt our unit could have been provided with more clean towels but this is variable from unit to unit as my sister's apartment was very well supplied. We found the hotel pool to be very nice. Although not as fancy as a resort style pool, it was fairly large and very clean. There were plenty of lounge chairs available and a kiosk from which to buy drinks. The beach in front of the hotel was nice but unfortunately, there was a lot of seaweed in the water and we had to walk down the beach a distance in order to find clearer water in which to swim. The access to the beach from the hotel was through the parking garage but this was a short walk and no big deal. There was a boat rental stand on the beach right in front of the hotel where we were able to rent jet skis or go out in a banana boat. We found the workers in the hotel to be very pleasant, especially the host in the restaurant from which I bought coffee every morning. The hotel had a game room, pool tables, ping pong tables, a business center and a decent fitness center.

ESJ charges for everything--beach chair rentals as well as laundry which we were not accustomed to with timeshare exchange. We did not get maid service during our week and had to take our dirty towels for exchange each day. No VCR or DVD in the room but many cable tv channels were provided. On the plus side, the front desk staff were all very nice as well as the concierge. The man that runs the small store was great and always had a smile. The best part about ESJ Towers is the location--great beach, right in Isla Verde near restaurants and close to Old San Juan.

The restaurant (Happy Apple) has horrible food. Soggy hash browns, tasteless eggs, I could go on for a while. The happy apple has a leak in the roof, and their solution is a bucket. The ceiling panels are falling apart/discolored. Nothing was good about this restaurant. The service at the front desk has an attitude that they just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care.

ESJ is a very good vacation spot depending on your group - I'll get back to that below. Based on our room, the rooms are similar to a good hotel room and include a large bathroom/vanity area and a decent sized kitchen. Sure ther's some wear and tear to the rooms but it's not blatantly obvious - you'll notice little things over the course of a week but nothing that is a concern. The amenities are decent: convenience store, okay concierge, adequate workout room, decent sized pool, and beach access. The pool is a standard rectangle and while the pool area is nice it's not resort level. It does get 8 ft deep and it's a large pool. There's beach access that you have to get to through the garage - it's about a 60 second walk once you exit the elevator. It's inconvenient but not an issue. When you do access the beach, you are at the east end of about a 2 mile stretch of beach. A short walk further east and you have access to about another 2 miles. Get a room facing west if possible. The west side balaconies over look the pool and has a great view of about 1.5 miles of beach. The view on the east side is of a small neighborhood and beyond that you can see about another mile of beach. ESJ is located in Isle Verde next to the El San Juan and Intercontinental properties. So the immeadiate area is great. The other resorts actually encourage you visit them. Once you walk from the hotel to the main road (maybe 1/4 mile), you can walk the mainstreet for probably about a mile east and 2 west. Ther you can walk to Metropol, Edith's, Mi Casita, Lupis, the grocery stores, Walgreens, a few bars and other stores. The place is a buzz at nighttime - and I always felt safe. So it's the good room facilities and the great location that I give ESJ a good review. My only negatives are the pool closes at 7 PM and there's no real pool side bar (they have a kiosk they pass off as one). I think teenagers may get a little bored at the site. Younger children would be fine. Adults traveling alone would be great.

The toilet and shower along with shelving area was in a different room. Different but nice. The restaurant in the hotel had the same old buffet breakfast every morning. They switched it up twice while we were there. I was getting sick of waffles, eggs, and hashbrowns. Forget dinner. The restaurant was closed at 2pm!!!

Food places everywhere. Plus the 4-star hotels are next door with excellent restaurants. The biggest downside was the fact that no one in 7 days changed ouor sheets, towels, toilet paper. If you are part of the Time share program side of the hotel you have to do everything yourself. If you are just staying there as one of their regular guests then I would think they would have daily maid service! If I were to visit PR again I would never think about ESJ Towers. Even if they do change my sheets everyday! the beach- EXCELLENT the hotel- NEVER AGAIN!

Let me start by saying I stayed here with my Husband and daughter in August because my mother in law, sister in law, father in law, cousins of them and basically the entire damn inlaw family wanted to show me where they go every year and took my husband since he was a child. They have timeshare here and to me thats why they rant and rave of it... either that or the other reason well known... they don't know class or come anywhere near it! The hotel itself is HORRIBLE! Seriously listen to me... HORRIBLE! I am not some person who uses the words superb or has to have to true luxury either! I'm 26 and from brooklyn so i am well down to earth. First off there is no I repeat no where good to eat in this hotel! There is 1 restaurant open for breakfast that is GROSS!!!! As for the pool the only food at the tiny little bar there (no swim up) is a hot dog or yogurt! the hot dog is good. The pool was ok. An average pool. To be honest not too shaby for the hotel but no swim up bar, and rude kids everywhere! The rooms are eh... they are simple. 2 queen beds and a balcony. bathroom small and like any normal bathroom. The room wasn't gross or dirty. It was just not my taste... it was plain and simple. there is nothing else to describe there cause there is nothing else to do. They have an arcade and a lobby lounge (boring). PS everyone can not be in the lobby past 12:00. that was no biggie to me cause i didn't want a part of the lobby. Anyway as for Puerto Rico itself it really is beautiful. Don't dare compare it to Jamaica cause it blows Jamaica away. I EXTREMLY RECOMMEND the hotel next door!!! 7 star resort +++ in my book....The El SAN JUAN WYNDHAM!!!!! We ate there almost every night. LA PICCOLA FONTANA IS AMAZING!!!! 4 diamond award there! Also The Steakhouse there left of Fontana is GREAT!! Other restaurants that were AMAZING was MOMOYAMA! Japanese steakhouse that I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! BEST JAPANESE STEAKHOUSE I EVER ATE AT!!! Its in the continental hotel which is in walking distance about two blocks to the right of esj. Also very good was RUTH CHRIS STEAK HOUSE! It was right there next door to MOMOYAMA! write these down cause you will thank me! In the RITZ CARLTON HOTEL MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED THE VINEYARD!!!! Excellent lobster and steak!!!!! Amazing appetizers!!! Beautiful restaurant. My husband surprised me with a GORGEOUS diamond ring there. THE FOOD WAS TO DIE FoR and i am from New York and its hard to impress me with food! I love to eat...surprises me i am only 120 pounds cause I eat like an animal and only quality food! The casino in the Wyndham is GREAT! HUGE AND WONDERFUL!!!! The bars in the wyndham are great and NEVER dead! Also try senior frogs to go out at night.. GREAT BAR!!! If you like clubs go to the one in the wyndham... ITS AWESOME! true new york feeling! One day we went and took the barefoot catermeran trip... IT went to a private island off PR called la verde and we went snorkeling and had a great beach! the lunch buffet was great!!! great selection all included with open bar! They played music and you could take the sun on the way there! It was great. Another day we went to the town old san juan... Was so nice! They had so many shops from guess to coach to shop in and great spanish restaurants with cobble stone streets and a view from the park of the entire island! so nice! We ate in an amazing spanish restaurant that wasn't expensive at all... i forgot the name but it was on the block of the park! Last restaurant on the right. Also from here they have a night cruise that goes around the island that has live music and open bar for 12 bucks! ALL in ALL I had a great time!
