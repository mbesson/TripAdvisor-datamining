As for the breakfast, it was always pleasant to go sit on the roof/terrace. There is an indoors and outdoors seating area. The food was very limited, and was the same every day, but the staff at the kitchen were as kind as the rest of the staff. The reception is small, and there is a laptop with internet access. We didn't get to test out the wifi. When enetering, it seems more like a guest house than a 4 star hotel, but the brochures and maps they offer are excellent. The location is more than excellent. The area around was incredibly beautiful to walk through, and you can walk to the tramway within 2 minutes, and the grand baazar in under 10. The only problem was there was only way to access to the street by car, and hardly anyone comes up there, as to turn your car around is difficult; you will have to walk from the main street to the hotel. Although this is no problem (only 1-2 minute walk) this made the hotel hard to find for the first time. The price we paid was very fair.

About 200m walk to the metro. 10 mins walking distance to the Grand Bazzar. Lots of choices in restaurants which are reasonably priced nearby. If you are interested in carpets there are lots to see nearby - prices here are for uninformed tourist. We are a family with a 10yr old son and we found the room size adequate. The showers could do with some work. The decor is not what you can describe as splendid - but you really do not visit Istanbul for the hotel's decor. The staff is wonderful - friendly and warm.

We stay in places ranging from top hotels to bargain beds and breakfasts). This small hotel is clean, quiet and convenient, and has a great location, great breakfasts and - more than anything - super-helpful, friendly staff. Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ark opened in 2010 after the building - which had previously housed a gold-smelting operation - was completely redone. As a result, everything is new. The rooms are tastefully decorated, and our king-sized bed (in room 203, which we really liked) was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, with a large, super-cozy duvet/comforter. By the way, shower water temperature and pressure were very hot and very strong, respectively. Oh, and there's free wireless Internet in the rooms. Breakfast (included in the price of the room) is served on the roof, which is half outside terrace and half inside room; the terrace has a great view overlooking Aya Sofya. The meal consists of an excellent buffet featuring eggs (boiled, scrambled or omelette), a variety of fresh and dried fruits, cereals, yoghurt, cheeses, breads, olives, jams, honeycomb and various other items. For some reason, the eggs were consistently absolutely delicious; no idea why, but we looked forward to them every morning! So overall, the hotel is very comfortable and has a cosy feeling to it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also situated in the heart of Sultanahmet, a short stroll from Aya Sofya, the Blue Mosque, Topkap\u00c4\u00b1 Palace and other major sights. The Grand Bazaar and Galata are a short walk, or if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling lazy you can take one of the very frequent trams - the nearest stop is less than two minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk from the hotel. All of this would be enough to justify a stay at Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ark. But what makes the place really special is the owner and his staff. The hotel is owned by Ali Ha\u00c5\u0178imi, who also runs a wonderful carpet shop of the same name down the street (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to buy carpets in Istanbul, DO go see his store - unlike so many others there, he is honest and his prices are very reasonable, which is why he has deservedly garnered recommendations from many sources, including National Geographic Traveler. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get fleeced elsewhere). Ali is a wonderful guy: courteous in an Old World way, generous and genuinely appreciative of his clientele. We stayed there for ten days in December of 2010 and our return home was short-circuited by a major storm which shut down London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Heathrow airport and other parts of Europe. One day, after we found out that our flight out had been canceled for the second day in a row, we went to head out to the airport to rebook (again), and ran into Ali in the hotel lobby. As soon as we told him what had happened, he insisted on driving us there himself. On another day, he took us to an excellent local restaurant for lunch, and at the end of the meal we discovered that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d paid for it. This is not exactly what you expect from your average hotel owner. His staff are similarly friendly and helpful; in particular, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to thank Yilmaz, the manager, who was courteous and helpful throughout out ten-day stay. And young Mustafa, who was a delight to chat with, and for whom no request for help was too much trouble. So, all in all, Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ark was a wonderful experience which added greatly to our enjoyment of one of our favorite cities. Coming back there after a day of sightseeing was almost like coming home - and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rare in a hotel. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss it. (Final note: when you book, check the rates for Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ark through venere.com - when we did it, they were slightly cheaper than the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct reservation system, and featured a deal that included free transfers to and from Ataturk Airport. If this deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there, the hotel will arrange for you to be picked up for around 30 Turkish lira (I think that was the price). Travel time from the airport to the hotel by car is 25-40 minutes depending on traffic; but you can also get there for a mere 3.50 Turkish lira (a little over $2 US) by taking the metro to Zetimburnu and then changing to the T1 tram down to Sultanahmet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to do, though if you have a ton of luggage you may want to take a cab instead).", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Owner, Great Service, Clean Rooms\u201d", "Author": "joejoeno8", "ReviewID": "UR89480872", "Content": "The owner, Ali, is great owner.
