The laundry machines in the back are powerful and cheaply priced. I stayed 10 days and it was a pleasure. The down town area is close by as is the gas lamp district.

After searching for a hotel that would be in my price range I came upon Hotel Occidental. It is a lot like a dorm building which I would only recommend for people who are young or adults who don't mind sharing a bathroom and shower. I paid 160 every week with an extra 25 bucks for my boyfriend to be a guest. Parking is a pain in the butt until you wait for the meters to be free. They offer parking in the hotel but it is very limited. I suggest you bring a pillow because the ones in my room were horribly flat. The hotel does offer internet which only had a few random issues during my stay. I enjoyed that the bus i had to take to get to my internship in Hillcrest was two blocks away. I wouldn't suggest walking around here at night alone but it's certainly not the most dangerous area i've ever seen. There is a password code for the entrance door which makes me feel safe except when other guests of the hotel let random strangers who didn't live here in the door. There was a homeless person sleeping in the lobby all night long! As for the kitchenette, you basically wash your face and brush your teeth in the same sink that you wash dishes in. it was a little difficult to prepare my meals in the microwave but I managed fairly well. I just wish that the mini fridge has a better freezer section. i couldnt have frozen goods which made it harder to spend less on eating out.

Being a thorough kind of person I researched all possible hotels beforehand on the internet, and I picked this one. And I wasn't wrong! It's in a very good location, close to downtown and even better: close to Balboa Park. The hotel is relaxed and the staff very, very friendly and helpful. Being European we thought the breakfast was a bit too sweet (pastries), but there was bread to be toasted, cream cheese and fruit in this complimentary breakfast too, and we bought a loaf of darker bread, tomatoes and hard cheese ourselves which we took to breakfast without a problem. So breakfast became a lot of fun. The selection of tea was nice as well. The breakfast room is a bit small, but you can take breakfast to your room if you want. The free bikes were wonderful. We ride bikes in our country (Belgium) all the time, so it was great to try it in San Diego. The slopes are a bit steeper, though! My sister took her laptop to work on her presentation and she could use the free internet connection. We loved having a kitchenette in the room, so we could use the microwave to prepare some food and the crockery and cutlery provided to eat it. The small fridge was great to put in the food and drink we bought. The showers were across the hallway and always spotlessly clean (and available; we never had to wait one minute). We could do the laundry at the hotel too, which was lovely because you don't have to walk the streets with your dirty clothes in tow! And then there were complimentary apples and newspapers at the reception desk; what more could you want? And now for a comparison: colleagues of my sister were staying at one of the very expensive hotels close to the convention center (I've forgotten the name, but it had two tower blocks). They had a swimming pool, yes, but if they wanted to rent a bike they had to pay something like 10 dollars an hour or 30 dollars a day. Breakfast was not even included in the high price and after having delivered 1 (one!) message the reception desk complained this should not be a regular occurence! We were so pleased that we had chosen this hotel when we heard my sister's colleagues describe their hotel!

And I must say the staff was courteous and helpful. I wished they worked at a better venue. For one thing the hotel is located in a rather rundown area. The place itself had no ATM. Was told there was one at the corner liquor store, which made feel unsafe to say the least. And eventhough you couldnt get into this hotel without a room card they had this rule that you couldnt have guests after 10 PM. The cable channel selection was the barest I'ever seen in any hotel. I've gone to smaller hotels that had better. They had videos yes, but not that many.

The continental breakfast was typically mediocre. Their pastries were stale. This is a hostel, not a \"European style boutique hotel.\" Furnishings were the absolute cheapest - the least they could have done was to go with colorful, cheap IKEA furnishings to make it look more bright and cheerful like some European hostels do. IKEA mattresses certainly would have been a higher quality. Many kids rooms have better furnishings than this. The actual reception held by this hotel was also mediocre, but i was told it was a good price...Im sure considering the amount of money this hotel got from all the guests that stayed there...I started noticing hotels nearby. There was a Holiday Inn and a Motel Six that offered better value. BTW even at the cheapest hotels I got a receipt showing my charges.

They had complimentary bottled water, popcorn, coffee, and kleenex, plus plenty of DVDs to borrow and play on the DVD/TV. I arrived early and they offered to store my luggage till check in at 2pm, and gave me map/instructions to visit Little Italy (~15 mins walk). On Saturday, Little Italy has a 'mercato' from 9:30-1:30, which had lots of fresh food and stuff to buy. Yogourtland was a great make your own dessert place, that only cost $0.30/oz. Balboa park was technically only 2 blocks away and about 15 mins walk to the official entrance and museums. Park had a nice variety of sights, but you should get there early, else most museums close by 4:30pm. If you're going to a convention, you can sometimes get 50% off exhibits, like the DaVinci exhibit. Was also able to borrow a cruiser bike, lock and helmet to bike down to the Marina boardwalk next morning. It took about 1.5 hour to travel down thru the Marina, seaport village, marriot hotel and return back via downtown/gaslamp district. Breakfast was a great selection of cereal, pastries, toast, bagel/creamcheese, coffee, juices and bananas. This was comparable to the $15 continental buffet I had at the Marriot.

The rooms, while small by American hotel standards, are certainly of an adequate size and the continental style breakfast consists of fruit, bread, bagels, b'fast cereal, tea & coffee. It is obvious from the hotel's own website that this is not high-end luxury but a comfortable 'guest-house' style of accomodation. The rooms are wired for internet and there is no charge. The hotel is almost directly under the approach path of planes for the airport as is Balboa park and much of this part of the city. The planes are however not a problem in my opinion. I was on the second floor and found the sound-proofing/double-glazing meant that there was no disturbance at all. This hotel is about 15mins walk from the central business district & 25 from the conference centre. If walking use the western side (right-hand sied on the way in) of 4th Ave as the junctions are easier to negotiate.

Ok, this hotel is not by any means a hostel. Yes, the bathrooms are outside of the rooms, but they are private and immaculately clean. This is typical European style, and save considerable costs for the hotel that translates to cheaper rooms. The hotel is in the city, but a little outside of downtown, but the area is not a war zone or anything. It is also very close to the interstate, making it a 15 minute max drive to pacific and mission beach. the entire place is extremely clean, and comfortable; the rooms are small yet include a sink, microwave, small counter space, midsize fridge and cubby-like shelf space. Sound can be an issue I guess, but you are staying in a city, and close to an airport. The patio, smoking area is very cute. They have coin-washers and always have fruit in the lobby. Breakfast was good, although not hot food. Staff was very attentive, cleaning staff was very thorough. Here's a breakdown: Price: Excellent for what you get. get over the disconnected bathrooms, you're not going to run into anyone in the hallway, they are well maintained, and you can lock the door. There are also enough of them where there is typically no waiting for one. Free wireless, free beach cruiser rental. Rooms: Bright, simple, very clean. ample space to stay the night, if you're spending any more time in the room in San Diego there's something wrong with you. Go to the beach for god sakes. Kitchenette in the room with sink, microwave, small fridge, dishware and towels. Cubby like shelves and hanging space. A decent desk with reading light close to phone. Free wireless, also a cat5 port in the phone. Food: Pretty good included breakfast. Pastries every morning, bagels with cream cheese butter or jam. Hot coffee or hot water. 4 choices of cold cereal, assorted oatmeal. OJ and apple juice. Bananas, apples. Instant coffee and tea, 2 bottles of water and a microwave popcorn in the room. Vending also available. Apples in the lobby. Staff: Cleaning staff were really nice, very thorough. Never had issues with the room, or the bathrooms, i think they cleaned the bathrooms a couple times a day. Front desk person was 24/7 and always helpful and sweet. Rose was very cool. Location: not super, but not a war zone, was upper area near Balboa park, quick access to the highway (15 minutes tot he beach!!) Cons: parking is difficult to find. They have a couple of spaces but its $10 a day. Street parking is metered 8am to 6pm, there was a garage available but i didn't use it. I spent the days at the beach so it wasn't so much of an issue, and parking enforcement seemed to be lacking in the area. It would be nice if the room had a thermostat, but you can deal with it, I dunno what temp it was but it was even and tolerable. If I can't stay on the beach, this will be my new usual spot.

The welcome pack in the room contained books and information as well as tea/coffee/bottled water. The rooms are air-conditioned and this was most welcome in the very hot weather of San Diego. Everyone in the hotel was pleasant and offered a smile everytime. Breakfast was good, nothing much but again adequate, cereal and pastries and the like. Breakfast was available from 7am to 11pm.

I paid $69.00 per night for the room (excluding taxes). My room had free coffee, bottled water and unpopped popcorn. The room had no toilet, shower or closet. My room had no clock when I arrived. The desk staff provided a clock-radio when I requested a clock. The hotel looks like it was recently renovated. There were no cracks in walls or ceilings, the paint job was good, etc. There were no signs of insect or rodent infestations. There were three shared bathrooms in the hall on the floor on which I stayed. Two of the bathrooms had a toilet and a sink. One had only a toilet. All were clean. Staff immediately corrected a backed-up toilet when notified of problem. There was at least one room in the hall that contained a shower for guests' use. The bathrooms and the shower were always vacant when I needed to use them. Good maid service each day. Friendly, helpful desk staff. Good free continental breakfast from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. with plenty of cereal, bananas, apples, rolls, muffins, coffee, milk and fruit juices. An adjacent room had a microwave oven for heating oatmeal at the breakfast. The hotel's lobby had free apples and chocolates throughout the day and evening. The best feature of the hotel were four free top-of-the-line bicycles . Only one or two were in use each day. The hotel is one block away from Balboa Park, about one mile from the shoreline of San Diego Bay (great sightseeing along walking and biking trails), from the downtown central business area and from the Gaslamp Quarter, and about two miles from the San Diego convention center. It took less than 20 minutes to reach each of these by bicycle. The hotel has only a few parking spaces. However, it is near several major bus routes with frequent service. I took two city buses to reach the hotel from the airport . The trip took about 45 minutes, including waiting times. Not bad for $2.25. The hotel is beneath a flight path to the airport. However, airplane and traffic noise was only a problem in the room between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m. At all other times, the room was quiet. The hotel's neighborhood is not fancy, but is clean and good.

Although I stayed here in early June, my experience has just ended yesterday. I was moving from the East Coast to San Diego and I knew I needed a hotel with weekly rates to use as a home base until I found an apartment. I discovered Hotel Occidental online, being from far away I could not see any hotels before staying there and this was one of the few options that had real reviews and information beyond a name, address and phone number. Despite having shared bathrooms, this place seemed clean and safe. It was. After reading on the website that there were rates starting at $200 a week, I called the hotel. I was informed that the cheapest weekly room they had was $285. When I inquired about the $200 a week rooms I was told they were all booked. I asked the difference between the two rooms, I was told both had shared bath, kitchenette and a twin bed. I was told the $285 room was \"quite a bit bigger.\" I was suspicious as soon as I checked into my room, I don't imagine there was any smaller room in this hotel. I could describe it, but I will let the pictures do it for me. There was no desk like described in another review. The room had no clock. No place in the room to hang wet towels. There was a counter with sink/microwave and cabinet with 1 dish, 1 plate, 1 fork, etc... The bed was more like a cot than anything. Although comfortable for my short, week long stay, it was far cheaper than almost every hotel bed I've had up to this point. All these things were minor and wouldn't give a hotel a 1 star review, Everything went smoothly the day I checked out. Around 11am I saw the maid near my room and when she asked, I told her I would be out of the room soon so she could take care of it. Everyday she had been in there to replace the towels and make the bed. I gathered all of my belongings and took them down to the lobby in a few trips. On my last trip down the stairs the maid was by the door and we exchanged pleasant farewells, and she entered the room to begin cleaning. The checkout process took about 10 min and then the woman at the front desk called a taxi for me upon my request. About 15-20 minutes went by as I waited for the taxi to arrive. Nobody on the hotel staff approached me or acted as if there were any problems. My taxi came, I left for my new apartment. The next afternoon I got a voicemail on my cell phone. It was the nice woman who owns Hotel Occidental. Apparently I left red ink stains on the carpet of my room. Due to this, they took the liberty of charging $300 to my Visa card that was used to pay for the room!!! I immediately went back to the hotel to address the matter. I explained that I had no red pens, markers or anything else that would have caused this damage. I assured them that before leaving the room I looked it over and there were no damages whatsoever. The owner and Ms. Mendoza (who ironically enough posted her own comments on this site the same day as my departure) would not believe that these damages were caused by me. They told me \"You were the last one in this room, these stains weren't here before you stayed. Someone has to pay for this damage.\" It was too bad that neither of them could explain to me why I wasn't stopped and shown these stains before I left the property the previous day. Not knowing the laws and my rights, I nervously told them I would be disputing this charge with Visa and they told me \"That's fine, but we already charged the credit card and we're getting our money.\" For nearly 3 months I have had this $300 charge in dispute on my credit card. It caused me a great amount of undue stress. I truly believe the Owner and \"Project Manager\" of this hotel are trying to take advantage of people to make this new hotel successful. Being a young person they thought they could take advantage of me. They got away with overcharging me on the room. I could accept that. Lying about stains and committing fraud is inexcusable though. Now that Visa has confirmed this was illegal activity, I will be reporting this hotel to the BBB. Don't be surprised if you stay at Hotel Occidental and are told \"I'm sorry, we can't accept Visa\" In closing, if you decide to stay at the Hotel Occidental, be sure to inspect your room thoroughly upon check-in. When it is check-out time, request a member of management come to your room and inspect it with you. If they did it to me, they could do it to you just as easy. I don't want anyone else having to go through what I did.

Even the single rooms had MOST of the basic amenities (cable TV, internet, free local calls, desk) but it also included a kitchenette with dishes for two, a microwave and a mini-fridge. 4. Great for socializing and meeting other people in the common areas (patio and lobby). However, since guests seem to be budget-conscious, the social aspect may appeal only to a 20s/30s age group. WHY I WOULD NOT STAY HERE 1. This is not a hotel for luxury. Even though it provides the basic amenities that most hotels provide, it is very basic. No luxurious linens, no fancy decor. In fact, once you make it past the front desk, you will feel like you are in a newly built college-dorm. Very plainly decorated, steel doors for each room, etc. No irons in rooms, although you can ask for one at the front desk (but no ironing board). 2. There were only two showers available for 25 rooms on the first floor. There were 6 \"waterclosets\" also (just a toilet in a small closet-type room with hand santizer). Don't misunderstand, these were all VERY clean. I mention it only because it can be surprising if you have never stayed in a situation like this. 3. The internet connection, even though it existed both as a data line and wireless, was horrible. It dropped a connection every few minutes, making instant messaging, listening to music, etc. nearly impossible. I over-heard other guests making similar comments. 4. Front-desk staff was less than helpful. I had parked in a pay parking lot ($7 a day) and asked the front desk if there were other less expensive or free parking lots nearby. She said, \"oh, well, they are just around...you just have to look for them.\" For the most part, this reflected the staff's willingness to help guests. 5. Bring earplugs!! The hotel is located directly underneath the landing path of commercial airline traffic just as they are about to land. Although air-traffic is minimal at night, you won't be taking a nap or sleeping in without earplugs. 6. While I haven't see the two-bed rooms, I can't imagine staying in a one-bed room with more than 2 adults. Even 2 adults and a small child would be too many. This is not an establishment for children. OVERALL If you are coming to San Diego on a budget or plan on actually going out and EXPERIENCING San , then this hotel is an excellent option. It's very new, clean, economical (you can buy food, keep it and prepare it in your room and save $$$) and comfortable if you don't need to be pampered. However, if you are traveling with a family, want an exercise room, swimming pool, dependable high speed internet connection, concierge service, etc., then this is probably not for you I should point out that the website photos and information on the hotel are very accurate and can be used as a good description and guide.", "Date": "August 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cAn Oasis amongst monolithic Luxury hotels\u201d", "Author": "samsen", "ReviewID": "UR5523594", "Content": "I just checked out today from the Hotel Occidental and had a great time. I travel frequently to San Diego on business and although born and raised in San Diego, I often have difficulty pouring hard earned money into the larger monolithic hotel chains. In this case, the city was near capacity. I happened upon the Occidental and was surprised to have a private shower and komode when I had booked a shared bathroom. The Hotel exudes elegance and charm! The interior decorator cleverly captured the era of the hotel by hanging art work of snapshots in San Diego history. I was especially impressed with the posters of 1916 and 1935 California Pacific Exposition showing some of the decades old Balboa Park architecture (Still standing, left over from the state expo). The room was simple, but the amenities had been thoughtfully planned out: A mini-kitchen including refrigerator and microwave...and best of all a DVD player built into the TV. This room is only what college freshmans dream about. High tech in design, but comfortable. A great, quiet location that is 2 blocks from almost every cultural and recreational activity. Undoubtably, the Hotel Occidental will be my home away from home address for future stays. A true destination hotel with real international appeal. If you are tired of over-rated five star oppulence and want to live like a local with a comfy (Glad to be back home) feeling, then this is the hotel for you.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cA great FIND!\u201d", "Author": "foxglove10", "ReviewID": "UR5516695", "Content": "I was a little hesitant about staying in a European-style hotel with some shared bathroom and shower facilities, but I have to say this was a great little hotel with a charming feel and a wonderfully helpful and accommodating staff. The amenities are quite nice - each room has a microwave and refrigerator. Some rooms have a WC (just a toilet) and some have a full shower - you pay a little more for them. When they say \"shared showers,\" I initially had visions of gym class in high school, but these are private showers, one person at a time - it's just that you may have to wait your turn, just as if you were staying in a home. My travelling companion has travelled extensively in Europe, and she assured me this was exactly like those, only cleaner. The housekeeping staff is amazing - the guy who said there was no maid service must have had a Do Not Disturb sign out or something, because our room was spotless every time we returned to it. We loved the fact that breakfast was set up every day from 7am until 11am, and it was much better than the usual hour-long 7:30am - 8:30am continental quickie offered in so-called \"upper level\" hotels. The later end time allowed us to truly enjoy our VACATION by sleeping in, rather than getting up as early as if I were at home, dressing and rushing out to grab a stale croissant and coffee, like other places we've stayed, resulting in needing a protein fix an hour or two later. Here, breakfast is fresh fruits, fresh danish and croissants, muffins, cereal and milk, orange juice, coffee - a nice spread offering a breakfast of some substance. They also have a nice laundry facility if you need to wash some clothes during your stay. Lisa, Giselle, Ricardo, and Lauren were all very attentive to our every need, had great suggestions for us, gave us directions when we needed them, and were generally great. There was a little snafu with our reservation the first night, but we dealt with it and were upgraded to a nicer room for the remainder of our stay (although the first room wasn't really bad - it just lacked a private shower, and this turned out to be no problem). Upon checkout, we found we'd been comped the lower price for all four nights of our stay - we didn't ask, nor expect this, the staff simply did it for us as an apology and a thank you. The one negative thing I could say is that there's not a lot of parking on the property, but the offset is that there is a ton of residential parking nearby, which is free. Downtown, Gaslamp, the Convention Center, loads of restaurants, Balboa Park, and the Zoo are all in walking distance if you're fit, or short cab ride if you prefer an easier pace. Simply put, the Hotel Occidental offers a lot of value for your money. And I didn't even mention the bikes you can borrow. I'd say a lot more positive stuff, but I'm afraid I've already done too much - once everybody figures out that this place is there, I think booking a room is going to get a little tougher. It's a great find in a crowded vacation spot!", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Occidental", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d590139-Reviews-Hotel_Occidental-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">410 Elm Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515723", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/22/2e/80/freshly-trimmed-trees.jpg"}}
