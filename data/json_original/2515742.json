The room was spotless, the linens, pillows and bed seemed new and crisp. We were put in a room intended to serve disabled people so the bathroom was very large and the shower had a chair in it and adjustable shower heights. The disabled parking was very close to the room. This would be a very nice place to stay if you are disabled. The price was very reasonable. The breakfast was more than pastries with cereal and toast available. The only negative is that the free wifi was weak in the room. It cut in and out and was not very useful. I would not hesitate to stay here again. We have a student in UC San Diego and the distance to the University was not a problem, about 5-10 minutes drive.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, convenient location\u201d", "Author": "Justine1976", "ReviewID": "UR125384070", "Content": "Went to San Diego for a day trip during President's Day Holiday (Feb 2012) and found it extremely difficult to find a hotel in the downtown/Gaslamp quarter area at an affordable rate. Decided to try Rodeway for 1nt stay (with my husband & 2 teenage boys) because of the affordable rate & proximity to the downtown area (about 5 miles). Upon arrival, I was a little worried because the lot was full, the hotel was sold-out for the night and our room was next to a group of youngsters drinking beer that appears to be ready to party. I braced myself for the worse but was pleasantly surprised! We had a quiet night and slept comfortably. The room was nice and clean with a flat screen tv, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker & free wi-fi. Did I mention that the parking is free compared to the downtown hotels that charge $16-$30/nt? The complimentary breakfast was basic - pastries, cereal, coffee, etc. My only complaint was that it did get noisy in the morning when people were packing, getting ready to check out, and talking to each other through open rooms. I also didn't like that you had to go the front desk for a hair dryer & iron. Nevertheless, the front desk attendant was always friendly & accommodating to all my requests & even provided a complimentary toothbrush & additional toiletries without any hesitation! This Rodeway is not a high end hotel but it's a decent place to stay at a reasonable rate and is conveniently located with easy access to the I-5. Will stay there again.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood value and great staff\u201d", "Author": "yachtwillow", "ReviewID": "UR123886837", "Content": "We stayed for four days here and were delighted with this place.

Breakfast was good and plenty was provided - yoghurt, waffles, muffins, fresh fruit, danishes and buns, coffee and tea and good orange juice. What more could you want? Our only reason for not supplying an 'Excellent' was the water pressure. Running around trying to get wet was a pain but really not anything they can fix.

I was a little hesitant when I first read the reviews online, but then the more recent reviews were quiet good so I went for it. We arrived at 3 AM and were checked in promptly. The room was quite nice and had clearly been remodeled recently. The only draw back was that there was no bathtub, and we had a 7 month old baby, so it was a little challenging to bath her. They had a pack and play ready for us when we arrived (even though it was 3 AM) and had even provided extra wash cloths and towels as I had requested when I made our reservation. The Roadway Inn was close enough to my grandparents' home (they live right on the beach) and other fun things to do, and was definitely quite nice for the price. The breakfast was adequate but I would have like to have seen more protein available like hardboiled eggs or something like that. Overall it was a nice place to stay to visit my grandfather for his 90th birthday, and it fit our budget. We would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim, California", "Title": "\u201cNice location, decent for the price\u201d", "Author": "Pearl_McG", "ReviewID": "UR118390536", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location. Sea World is a very short drive and freeway access to the rest of San Diego is even closer. We stayed overnight for an event and the place wasn't bad at all. It was small but considering we were only sleeping there and not vacationing IN the room it was tolerable. The shower was about the size of a small studio apartment shower, my husband who is 6'2 fit with little trouble. The staff was nice and the place was clean and obviously recently renovated. The only thing I didn't really like was the air conditioner at the top of the closet space. I had to get a chair to adjust it and then I don't think it worked too well. We just opened the doors and took advantage of the cool breeze anyway but I tend not to get to bent out of shape with things like that. The breakfast was basic, pastries, bagels, juice and a coffee machine. That actually was pretty nice, to be able to walk over to the office and get a hot mocha before heading out for the day.

Pulled back the sheets to reveal a sea of hairs of all varieties all over the bed. Got dressed, went to the front desk to complain, the young clerk questioned why I had taken so long to complain from the time I checked in, seriously! Was given the room next door and guess what, same thing. Although, the bed only had a couple of hairs on top of the comforter, the bathroom sink had hair shavings all over, hair on the towels, a live roach, which I killed, and a dead spider smashed on the wall.

It was so empty and had a very strange vibe. The sheets were a whole other story, The comforter had menstrual stains, as did the sheets,and the blanket was full of holes and cigarette burns as well as HAIR and various other stains( I suspect they were bodily fluid stains).So,well passed midnight, we to walgreens to get 4x5 blanket throws to sleep on.

The front desk was very helping when it came to trying to help with the room issue.
