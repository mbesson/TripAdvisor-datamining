We arrived at Midway airport and easily navigated the subway system to find the hotel. (its a few minutes walk from all lines servicing the entire city!). We quickly realized that we picked the right hotel. Everything we wanted to do was either walkable (Magnificient mile, Navy Pier, Millenium Park, Bicycle Tour etc...) or easy to navigate on the subway or bus. We had no problems with the hotel services either. They had a great continental breakfast every morning. Many other hotels in the area had a similar or slightly higher rate but did not offer the breakfast, so this was a bonus! Also, the hotel was recently renovated, so everything was pretty new. The room and view was great for the price.

There are only 4-5 rooms on each floor. So, it's more like a boutique hotel. There are two TVs--one in the living room area and one in the bed room. It's nearby EVERYTHING! Marilyn Monroe is about 2 blocks away! Good restaurants within 1-2 blocks, train to O'Hare about 4 blocks away. And of course, you're just 2 blocks from State street shopping! Great bedding!

I was very doubtful that the hotel could provide the level of service and accomodations listed for the incredibly low price. Even if this hotel were not located in downtown Chicago, the price was almost too good to be true. The only down side, as mentioned elsewhere, is that valet parking for two nights cost almost as much as one night stay in the room. Since I had read that in the reviews it did not come as a surprise. Check-in was very smooth, efficient, friendly and quick. Now to the best part! The room was incredible. Spacious, would be an understatement. With windows overlooking Michigan Avenue and the Chicago River it was nice to look out at the snow storm outside while remaining so comfortable inside. I don't want to be repetetive with what the rooms have to offer other than to say that my scepticism was quickly put to rest. Many apartments have fewer amenities. Washer, dryer, stove/oven, microwave, flat screen TVs (2), separate bedroom,breakfast bar, full table setting for two. Seldom does an establishment live up to its billing, but this one does. We did manage to make it to a couple of the incredible pizza places that Chicago is justifiably famous for.

As is typical for Comfort Inns, the bed was very comfortable. (When staying at chain hotels, I prefer this chain for their comfortable beds.) Alas, I found the facility becoming just a bit seedy. In my first room on this stay, several slats were missing from the blinds. Although maintenance promptly replaced some, the mechanism holding one of the slats was broken so that slat could not be replaced. Also, the blinds in one of the windows didn't properly close. The hotel changed my room. In the second room, the stove burners, apparently replacements, did not fit properly. The top of the toilet tank had cracked at some time in the past. Although the repair was sound enough from a functional standpoint, it was sloppily done. (Why not just replace the tank top?) The quick cleaning administered daily by the housekeeping staff did not always include vacuuming. Also, on my second morning I left a few dishes in the dishwasher, intending to run the dishwasher after more had accumulated. Returning while my room was being cleaned, I was horrified when I saw the maid unloading the dirty dishes from the dishwasher, rinsing the dishes by hand in the sink with only tap water - no soap - then returning the dishes to the cabinets. I ate breakfast at the hotel on my first morning. The eggs resembled rubbery yellow discs. After that, I passed on the hotel breakfast. Would I recommend this hotel? I'm not sure.

This hotel is hands down one of the best hotels i have ever visited. And I'm hungry for more LOL:) Arrival/Room: When we arrived, we were greeted by the famous and fabulous staff members of Comfort Suites. With all smiles, they wished us a happy anniversary ( without us mentioning it ) and wished us a happy stay with them. We took the elevators up to the 24th floor and our mouths dropped when we opened the door to our suite. We had been upgraded to the EXECUTIVE KING SUITE!!!!! This room had a FULL KITCHEN, FULL LIVING AREA, CLOSET AFTER CLOSET, WASHER N DRYER, CEILING TO FLOOR VIEWS, 2 TVS, DINING ROOM TABLE AND SAVING THE BEST FOR LAST.........A FULL BALCONY!!!!!! I swear i felt myself tearing LOL but honestly its was simply beautiful. Patrick Kennedy ( Director of Sales ) had a bottle of bubbly and little goodies set up for us and i knew this was going to be the best vacation ever. How kind was that huh? Breakfast: Unfortunately we only took part of this for one morning. The hubby and i are LATE sleepers and the time change/ weather didn't help:). But for the one day they had the freshest waffles, sausage, yogurt, fruit, juices, muffins and bagels. It was delicious and a great way to start your day in the Windy City. Parking/ Location: We also didn't take part of this because we flew and did NOT rent a vehicle, which brings me to my next topic....LOCATION. You do NOT need a vehicle because this hotel is literally right smack in the middle of EVERYTHING. I hate driving, so i was so thrilled waking up everyday knowing that my destination for the day ( I.E. Navy PIer or Water Tower Place ) was only a few steps or blocks away. Like most Americans, we partake in fast food. There was Chipotle, Subway, Qdoba and yummy Sushi restaurants literally connected to Comfort Suites. Another great comment was that there was a Walgreens, CVS and 7 Eleven all within steps of Comfort Suites. We used these stores for little snacks and other little things that you could forget to pack while traveling. So traveling families ( with young children ) don't worry.The location of this hotel is unbelievable you can NOT find one better. You will see when you get there:) Staff: Speechless. Ashley was so cheerful and always ready to help Rachel was very sweet and went above and beyond to print out a list restaurants that were open on Christmas Day for me and the hubby. Housekeeping were so nice and didn't mind coming a little later in the day for us because as i said we are NOT early morning people. They were great. 2 graveyard shift guys.....i forgot their names but they were always smiling even during the wee hours of the morning. Patrick Kennedy thank you soooooo much for making this anniversary the best!!!! Your beautiful building, lovely staff and amazing hospitality will always be remembered by us.

And there was no wall between the room and the kitchen, so we had to sleep with the fridge right next to us (making an annoying noise). The bathroom was right on the entrance door and it was tiny-tiny and I wish they'd clean it better. The layout of the room was just strange. The floor's hall smelled really bad and when we complained about it they said some people cooked in the rooms and there's nothing they could do about it (but IMO the smell was not of food). My husband had a back problem because of the bed. First I thought he was exagerating, but then we switched sides and I got a backache as well. we checked the bad and the matress was not even as if there's a whole in it. We talked to the people downstairs and they said it was because they have some overweight guests (and if they do they should be prepared for that - which they are not). My husband really complained about it so they got us a discount - which was nice of them, I owe them that, but overall, I wouldn't recommend the hotel.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maidstone, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAwesome stay & awesome staff!\u201d", "Author": "Jo H", "ReviewID": "UR119605687", "Content": "Recently returned from a week long stay here.......cannot say enough good things about it!

I know what guests expect from a hotel staff and the hotel itself. I was very happy with my stay here. I only stayed for two nights, but didn't want to leave! Location: It was smack dab in the middle of everything. Navy Pier is a five minute bus ride away. The train station is literally a thirty second cab ride away. There is tons of shopping and food choices within walking distance. The water taxis and Wrigley Building are less than a five minute walk away. The Walgreens and Subway next door made it easy to save money on quick meals and drinks to keep in the room. The Rooms: While the common areas are somewhat small, the rooms are huge! It literally felt like I had my own apartment in the city. They must have been apartments back in the day, as it is an older building. I had already expected the smaller areas, as it's a hotel in the downtown area, where everything is cramped. Imagine my surprise to walk into my room! I was placed on the 11th floor and had a corner room facing the water. Beautiful! The rooms are also very clean and included all the necessities, including a fridge, dishwasher, microwave, cooking utensils, and stove. The cleaning staff even washed my dishes for me! The Staff: Professional, friendly, and quick! They made sure to get my two rooms close together even though I forgot to request that. They even held our luggage for us for a few hours on the day we checked out, so that we could go to a couple museums before we left. The Value: I paid an employee rate, so it was worth the money a thousand times over. I know these rooms usually go for a couple hundred. Worth every penny! The breakfast is great. If you're looking for location and value, stay here! The Cons: The building has 26 floors and you may have to wait a couple minutes for an elevator (there is two of them), but not really a big deal. The breakfast area is small, but also just a minor detail.

The hotel couldn't be better located for a leisure trip to Chicago; just a short walk to the museums, the loop, and to shopping/dining on the Michigan Avenue. The lobby is small if you're used to the fancier hotels downtown, but the rooms are larger in comparison to those we've had in other downtown hotels on earlier Chicago visits. We had booked a 2 queen suite, but were upgraded on arrival to a huge 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite (If you're reading this Comfort Suites, thanks again). The room was clean but the furnishings were dated and due for upgrades and new carpet. We noted a leak at the toilet which was quickly repaired on the day we notified the front desk. The front desk was very attentive and responded quickly to any request we made. The room had a full kitchen, which we used for dinner comfortably one evening after a trip to Trader Joe's a few blocks away. Our biggest pet peeves were noise and WiFi access. You expect outside noise in a city like Chicago, but most of the noise was internal from the A/C system or from the appliances in the kitchen area. We did find that it became white noise quickly and it didn't keep me from comfortable sleep. However, if you're a light sleeper it could be an issue, especially in the front bedroom which is separated from the kitchen by an open doorway with no door. WiFi is provided but for most of our stay the connection ranged from barely usable to not worth trying. Breakfast was the average budget hotel quality and the hot options were lower quality than what we're used to. It's OK if you want cereal, but we found ourselves across Michigan Avenue at Cafe Decartes for excellent coffee and pastries. Despite our peeves, I considered the Comfort Suites a great value considering that it was by far the lowest cost option for downtown Chicago for a room that could house three adults comfortably.

Strengths - Location - very central and easy walking distance to most tourist attractions, and close to trains and buses. - Price - we booked and paid an online rate that was on sale and paid a very reasonable rate. We then extended for an extra night at the beginning and they offered us a very competitive rate for the extra night and we were able to stay in the same suite for the whole stay. - The staff is very friendly and helpful. We were checked straight into our suite on arrival at approx 12 noon, and they were always very friendly every time we spoke with them. We arrived at breakfast just before 9am one morning and the attendant kindly went to the kitchen to bring out some breakfast for us and some other guests who were also there late. - Suites - our suite was very spacious and it was great to have stove/oven, microwave, dishwasher/dryer, room safe, 2 tv's, full size fridge, plenty of space. We were on the 6th floor overlooking Michigan Ave and these suites appeared to be longer and had the view over the Ave, so recommend you request one of these suites. We did not find the room noisy at all. We did not have the problem with the lifts some have reported, and found they were fast and we rarely had to wait for them. - Beds - extremely comfortable and I was finally able to get over my jet lag and get a great few nights sleep. - Wifi Internet - worked perfectly and easily Weaknesses/Opportunities There was so many great things about the Comfort Suites it is hard to find anywhere for them to improve. If I had to find an opportunity for them to improve it would be the following minor things - Breakfast - it was a bonus having breakfast included. The range was good - cereals, fruit, eggs, waffles, bacon/sausage, breads/bakery items, yoghurt, juice. The breakfast room was small and every day we went down it was standing room only and difficult to find a seat. We did tend to go down between 8.30 and 9am so I suggest you try and go earlier if possible, or take your selection back to your suite. - Bathroom - considering the large size of the suite the bathroom was very small. However considering the amount of time you spend in the bathroom this is a minor issue unless you plan to spend a lot of time there! - Room Cleanliness - Our suite was very clean and the smoke free environment was a bonus. The only issue we had was one of the cushions on the armchair had a stain on it and when I flipped the cushion over it had an even larger stain on the other side. I also found a hair that wasnt one of ours on one of the clean bathroom towels when we arrived. Both of these issues were not major issue for us but would be an opportunity to improve. Overall we were very happy with our stay. The value for money, location and friendly staff all made this a great choice of hotel and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good sized clean room in a central location.

One note - it is located right on Michigan Avenue, and the traffic was very loud at all times of the night. My biggest complaints: my family left the hotel for the day around noon. When my husband got back around 6, the door was left open. Not only unlocked, but propped open with the swing-lock. I understand that accidents happen, but this is a HUGE security problem. Nothing was taken, but it really upset me. I reported it to the desk, and they just responded that they would talk to housekeeping. The second problem we had was getting housekeeping (or anyone else) to bring us blankets. We unsuccessfully asked 3 times - twice at the desk and once on the phone - for extra blankets for the pull-out couch. Every time they said they would send some right up. When I went to the front desk to complain about the door being left open, I asked again. They finally sent someone up. I understand the hotel was probably full due to the concert, but this is inexcusable. I think the hotel is critically understaffed, and am worried that security problems like we encountered probably occur quite often as a result.

We stayed here a few weeks ago while we were in town for a wedding and although I was not expecting luxury (it is a Comfort Inn after all), I was definitely expecting it to be one of the nicest Comfort Inns I've stayed in, and I don't think it was. Location: Location really can't be beat - in the loop, on Michigan Ave, near the river and Near North Side. This is one of the primary benefits of the hotel. Rooms: Although the rooms are all suites, they are not much bigger than a standard hotel room (it looked like a normal hotel room but with a wall between the bed and couch). I think the room would be fantastic if you are staying for a week or more, because it includes a fridge, microwave, mini-stove and washer/dryer. As a family, you could definitely save quite a bit of money by not having to go out for every meal. HOwever, we were only in the city for a couple days and wanted to go out to eat, so we didn't take advantage of any of the extended stay features. I also thought the room looked a bit dated. While it was perfectly clean, they were some stains on fabric and scratches on appliances or furniture so it didn't look super modern. We were on the 10th floor and had no view to speak of (a tiny slice of river, but mostly parking garages). Breakfast Buffet: This hotel includes a complimentary continental breakfast and even though the selection is similar to most other Comfort Inns (make-your-own waffles, eggs, toast, muffins) I found the quality not that great. Staff: The staff was pretty friendly and was very helpful in recommending a nice beach within walking distance. They did give us incomplete directions when we asked how to get to the airport on the El. Misc: -Internet was free and worked very well (wifi & hookup) -Elevators were very small and horrendously slow, which made getting up to the room a pain sometimes - its hard to walk up 10 flights of stairs! -Hotel is totally smoke-free, which is awesome!! -No pool :( Bottom line: We had a perfectly pleasant stay here, but I think you can probably get an equally nice room for less money ($170 per night on a summer weekend with a AAA rate), especially if you're not super concerned with location (we wanted to be within walking distance of the wedding venue).", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, we'll stay here again\u201d", "Author": "JanH775", "ReviewID": "UR116927229", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in July for 2 nights, coming straight from the airport on the Blue line we found the hotel not too bad to walk to from the station and it was so close to everything we didn't need a car until we left Chicago, the only time we needed to use the train was to get to the Cubs game.

This was not a terrible property, but it was not up to the level of most places I have stayed in Chicago or places I have stayed based on trip advisor with no where near as good ratings. The positives were: staff was freindly and helpful, location was exceptional particularly if you plan museum grant park type stuff. There are a fair number of decent dining options right near by. The room we had (a suite for family of 4) was entirely functional, and had laundry and kitchen in room. The breakfast is about what youd see at most any Hampton or Holday Inn - but crowded the days we were here. No real complaints about any of this. But this place has some serious drawbacks. It is very cramped throughout (though less so in the rooms proper) the elevators are very small, often stuffed to capacity during our stay and often slow to arrive. The view from our room was awful, but we knew that coming in and this did not bother us much. The lobby is not hideous but rather follows the very small, even claustrophobic, and drab theme of the whole place. The basic problem with this place besides that it is cramped is that it feels quite long in the tooth. Hallways are kind of puke green with traces of a bad paint job on hardware fixtures. Loose door knobs and carpet well toward end of usefully life. Dated wallpaper and furniture. Our room did not feel all that clean and had a very soft lumpy mattress. I found somebody s gummy bears between the headboard and the mattress when the remote fell in there. This place has location and basic functionality, but other than that feels like a low end property and not worth the hundreds per night we paid.

This hotel exceeded our expectations. We were staying in Michigan with family and wanted to spend a night in Chicago in a location was convenient to various kid-friendly activities. I spend endless hours on the internet comparing different options and decided to go with Comfort Suites because of the good reviews on this site and its combination of good location and (relative) affordability. It was also important to me to find a hotel with a true suite. We have 2 small children and don't like to be in a situation where we have to turn the lights out and go to bed along with them at 8:00. Comfort Suites had true suites with a separate bedroom and door that could close. When we checked in, we were blown away to learn that we had been upgraded to their presidential suite. We now had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a full kitchen, washer, dryer, living area, 3 TVs and a view overlooking Michigan Avenue for our original price. Talk about ensuring guest satisfaction! We took a short stroll with the family to Millenium Park where the kids played in the fountain and admired the Bean. From there, we went to dinner just a few blocks away at Giordano's for authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. The next day, we took a short cab ride to Navy Pier to enjoy the children's museum and Ferris wheel. The location simply was unbeatable for our needs. The staff were fabulous and extremely responsive. We got to the hotel a little early and our room was not ready, so the staff arranged to store our bags so we could find ways to enjoy ourselves without being loaded down with the bags. Valet parking is at the Hard Rock Hotel, but the Comfort Suites staff quickly met us with a luggage cart and brought our bags the half a block to the hotel. We asked for a crib when we checked in and it was whisked to our room right away. My few words of caution would be to manage expectations about the common areas. It's a reasonably priced hotel on Michigan Avenue, so something's got to give! The lobby is small with just enough room to check in. The breakfast area is adequate, but during prime breakfast hours, it's a zoo. And the fitness room is nothing to write home about - 3 cardio machines and a universal weight machine. These slight drawbacks, however, didn't put a dent in my enthusiasm for the room, location and price.

Several nearby secure spots are available but nothing less than $35/ day self parking. No stopping on Michigan ave, so hauling your gear is required. Bathroom was the smallest i've encountered ever. Could barely fit with room to spare and when you travel with 2 teenagers, it made for some careful coordinating shower times. Free breakfast, nothing is free without a price and that price is congestion and dealing with the throngs of other families with small out of control children all vying for some make your own waffles and toast. Like most free breakfast deals, timing your arrival to breakfast is a gamble so spare yourself the aggravation (unless it's just coffee you need) and go to the Corner Bakery Cafe around the corner and really enjoy a satisfying start to your day.

Also huge in our consideration was the spacious room. We were staying a week (family of three) and the extra space made the time in the hotel much more relaxing. Each suite has a kitchen and a washer/dryer. The washer/dryer was a Godsend. There may be other hotels in downtown Chicago that offer a washer and dryer in each room, but I couldn't find them.

Upon check in, the front desk clerk was very nice and gave me the lowdown. I was on the 14th floor on a south west corner room. Got to the room and found it to be spacious! It was like coming home to an apartment. I started to unpack right away and then started to notice a slight funky smell. It was like a dead animal smell. I searched everywhere, but could not find it. I thought it was the kitchen, but it was not. I thought it was a \"City Smell\" thing. When I went to buy some snacks at the walgreens on the corner (there is also a Subway next to door too), I bought a scented candle and that did the trick. KITCHEN: The kitchen stocked will all the necessities to cook a meal and feed 4 people! The appliances looked a little dated. But it was pretty good size and had a large counter to use. LIVING ROOM AREA: Nice TV with spacious loveseat with pillows. Comfortable. The closet for hanging clothes and the dresser was in this area, but it was no big deal. Had a safe too. BEDROOM: Had a great view of other hotels, and the large buildings and up michigan ave, so that was cool. No lake view though. The bed was comfy with lots of pillows. The washer and dryer were in the bedroom closet with a iron and ironing board that were immaculate. Usually the water filler is missing or the board is burnt. Everythign was is great working order. Plus there was a TV in the bedroom too! BATHROOM: This was the major downer. It was a workable size, but it needed counter space. Got in to take a shower and the water pressure was a joke. One morning at peak time, it was dribbling water out while I was soaped up. I mentioned this at check out when I checked out and Patrick said they were having problems with the Hot Water. Gotta get that fixed for sure! Never took advantage of the free breakfast. The elevator was the slowest elevator in Chicago. At one point I watched it go up and down for 20 min before I got to my room. Just not cool. It is an older building and is no way new. But I enjoyed my stay.

The kitchenett and rooms with washer and dryer made us feel at home. All of the staff were helfpful, pleasant and professional and maid service was excellent. We chose this hotel because it is located in the heart of Chicago's Downtown. Transportation, restaurants and walgreens near the hotel. The stores on the manificent mile \" will make you want to shop until you drop.\" we were able to tour all of the place and events we had planned. We had only one concern about the homeless and panhandlers we encountered standing in front of walgreens store asking for money. We mistakenly went down the stairs leading to the underground passageway and discovered homeless and panhandlers down there. we thought that the stairs were leading to the Subway as in New York City. In addition, walking North on North Michigan Ave we observed several young women sitting on the sidewalk with signs stating that they were pregnant and hungry. A young man with a child also had a sign asking for money. We felt safe all times at this hotel and we were extremely greatful a safe deposit box was in the room for personal items. Again, we enjoyed our stay, but felt uncomfortable encountering homeless and panhandlers in the dowtown area. New York City had the same problem in the downtown area with the homeless and panhandlers approaching tourist. However, we no longer have this problem, because businesses in the dowtown area complained to former Mayor Guilliani. New York City Police has made this area a safe place for tourist to visit. We realize that Comfort Suites cannot resolve the problem with panhandlers and the homeless alone. it takes the entire community to resolve the problems. satisfied New Yorkers", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLocation is great, service is excellent, staff is friendly, big, clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "flintstone2", "ReviewID": "UR113516850", "Content": "We will definitely stay there again.

I attended a conference and hubby and bubby entertained themselves. We were really satisfied with our stay. We got a great rate online (direct from hotel), the location is fab - you can walk to the Golden Mile, museums, parks, and convenient for me to catch a conference bus from the Hyatt (around the corner). Great, affordable, quick mexican take-away restaurant two doors down too (Chipotle or something). We booked Comfort Suites because I knew we'd be keen on the kitchen and separate living/dining (and washer/dryer) which all turned out to be great. Really was a full kitchen (stove, oven, microwave, full size fridge, etc). king size bed in the bedroom was super comfy and fold-out couch suited the 3 year old (most nights, when he wasn't in our bed). Washer/dryer not bad but the dryer outlet dumped in to a bucket (supposed to catch condensation?) so we steamed up the windows whenever we did a load of laundry. Not a huge deal, and with a/c we appreciated a bit of extra humidity. Living room was small but adequate. Bathroom was also small but fine. We had a small problem with the plug (non existant) - called down to Reception, maintenance came within minutes and solved within 10 min later. Sweet! Staff at the front desk was very friendly. Not particularly helpful in terms of local recommendations, but seemed to be keeping an eye on things and generally tried to help. Breakfast was pretty average (toast, make your own waffles which others seemed to like but wasnt' my fave, yogurt, some egg offering, juice, coffee, apples and sometimes other fruit) - but, heck, it was free and very convenient (down stairs) so we picked up a few bits and pieces most days. Starbucks and Walgreens also only a block or so out the door. Again, very convenient. Bigger supermarket was 2-3 blocks away and still a bit of a 'city supermarket' (ie. not a great selection of nappies and baby stuff!) but we were able to stock up for lunches and would be great if you were adults (lots of yummy looking deli food and ready-made, easy to heat up meals). It's an odd tall, skinny hotel. So 20+ floors with 4 rooms on each floor. We opted to not pay for a view so faced out the back - but still could see peeks of the river and our toddler loved looking at the cars in the back allyway 17 floors down. We found it pretty quiet too. But then I suppose you should ask our neighbors as we were probably the noisy ones with the small child. Our neighbors seemed friendly, so hopefully we weren't too bad. 2 computers with internet access behind the reception. Sometimes busy but generally you could get in. Toddler and I visited the gym and it looked decent (although all we did was run matchbox cars off the back of the treadmill - luckily no one in there). If I was alone on business I would have been more than happy. Also had a stationary bike and elliptical machine and some weights. Overall we were really pleased - I would recommend, and we would go back again.

We searched for many days for any room in the loop, as hotels all over the city said they were booked. It came down to a handful of hotels, but we lucked out and the comfort suites had a single room left - The executive suite. We were told that there would be a king bed and a pull out bed and that if we were quick, we could snag a roll away or two for no additional charge. We looked at some photos and a very helpful youtube video showing what the inside looks like, noting the full-sized kitchen would be excellent for continued drinking throughout the night. Although pricier ($500/night after taxes) than the simple double rooms that you see on priceline, we understood that we were getting quite a bit more than a simple double room already and sealed the deal. When we got to the hotel room, we couldn't have been happier with the decision. To begin, the hotel bumped us up free of charge to the presidential suite. This suite is on the 26th floor. It can best be summarized by calling it a two-bedroom apartment. In fact, some of the attendees noted that the hotel room was probably bigger than their apartments. Two bedrooms with king beds in each, two full bathrooms, a washer/dryer, full-sized kitchen, dining area with an actual dining table, living area, loft complete with spiral staircase to access the loft, and a balcony with a great view of the river and the Chicago Tribune building. The location was great. We were able to walk to everything that we needed in the city. The rooms were clean. Even our resident clean freak (the bride!) loved it. The staff was great, and completely put up with a gaggle of drunk ladies with great humor. Without a doubt, $500 was a steal for this room. tl;dr - Pricier than the base room cost at other hotels, but significantly less expensive than anything else comparable. Great location. Clean rooms.

She said - we have upgraded you for free to the PENTHOUSE SUITE...Our jaws dropped to the floor at that point, we were stunned. So we got checked in and when we got to the room we could not believe it...It was awesome! We were on the top floor (26th) & had a balcony with an awesome view of Michigan Ave. The suite itself was awesome - we each had our own bedroom and bath. There was a kitchen, fridge, living area with sofas, washer/dryer, flat screen TVs, everything 2 buddies on a guys weekend could ask for. And to top it off it was spic & span clean. The location of the hotel is great - close to a 7/11 where we bought some liquor and a there was a wal-greens right next door. Also there are some restaurants close by that made it easy for us to grab lunch. The staff was very courteous and helpful. They really made our stay in Chicago that weekend wonderful. I will be going to chicago again this summer and I will definitely be staying at this hotel. I am recommending this hotel to anyone who asks me where to stay in downtown Chicago.

The room (we had one with 2 double beds) is like a studio apartment with a fully furnished kitchen (even a dishwasher), a stacked washer/dryer, and a large walk-in closet. The bathroom is small and nothing fancy; with the toilet & bathtub/shower in a separate room from the sink/mirror (which are in the same area as the washer/dryer and walk-in closet). There is a good-sized LCD TV. There are five rooms per floor, and ours was the one in the front middle. The other four rooms are corner rooms with views on two sides. Our view was of the buildings across Michigan Ave; though from right next to the window you could see the Chicago River and even the top of the Hancock Bldg. The breakfast is typical Comfort Suites food (just warmed up on-site), and does include the make-your-own Belgian Waffles. The eating area is somewhat small and was always crowded when we were there. They do provide trays (in your room) for bringing stuff back if you want. Although it will take several minutes (only 2 elevators, almost always busy) to get back to your room, you have a microwave there to reheat stuff. The location is great, just a few blocks from and El station and the Metra Millenium Station (and Millenium Park), bus stops within a block, and taxis always available on Michigan Ave. It's less than a block from the Michigan Ave Bridge over the Chicago River, the southern end of the Magnificent Mile. The only hassle is parking. Valet parking is available half a block south at the Hard Rock Hotel entrance ($36/day plus tips). Public parking (both do-it-yourself and leave-keys-with-attendant) is available for $35/day at 111 Wacker, a block from the hotel (this option allows you access to your car to get things you forgot to unload). There is no loading zone at the Comfort Suites entrance, you have to go to the valet parking area to just drop people off. So be prepared to drag your luggage for at least half a block in Chicago weather. This hotel is not cheap; but it is much less outrageously priced than anything within several blocks, even flea-bag hotels.

When I got into the room I did notice that this room has a large kitchen and a big sitting area. Too bad that some of this room was not better allocated to the bedroom and especially the bathroom. The bedroom has a door that closes to block off light from the hall but the issue is the bedroom has no wall between it and the kitchen. If you are looking for any kind of privacy between the bedroom and kitchen/living room there is NONE! Since you feel like you are sleeping in the kitchen, all night long you will hear the fridge turn on and off. I eventually got up and unplugged the fridge so that I could sleep. The heating system is also extremely loud and the walls are thin so that if someone runs the water or flushes the toilet above your floor you will hear it. The bed (supposedly a king) was only 54 inches wide. I have a king and queen beds at home and this was nowhere as close. I searched the web and found that they are full size beds only! The bathroom is extremely small and cannot accommodate more than one person. When compared to the entire room size this is huge design flaw. The room that I was in had problems with water leaking when you flushed the toilet or ran the shower water would flood the bathroom.

So, I called the front desk to ask if we could have a different room with 2 beds, like I had booked originally. The man was very rude and said that they were overbooked and there was nothing he could do for me. I told him that wasn't good enough and that I refused to stay in that room with only 1 bed. He put me on hold and then magically came back on the line and said that there was a room down on the 6th floor, but it didn't have the same view but it did have 2 beds. I told him I'd take it because we'd rather have 2 beds than a great view.

It started when I called to reserve a room. The guy was pleasant and knowledgeable, immediately e-mailing me confirmation info. The king-sized hookup was the same price as the queen right then and I was skeptical, having been hoodwinked in the past. After a lengthy but fun journey, we somehow landed in downtown Chicago smack-dab in the middle of a nightmarish rush-hour clog. Hungry and road-weary, we inched along, cut off by supply trucks and cabs as the GPS malfunctioned, guiding us in a laborious circle to nowhere. It was time to cry uncle when the blasted thing directed us into an underground parking version of the street above that resembled an Escheresque urban labyrinth. We called Comfort Suites and VOILA! A sweetheart of a guy patiently guided us out of that ceement hell and into the waiting arms of their valet service, located at the nearby Hard Rock. Finally in the lobby, the friendly folks there took care of us, even whipping out a bunch of menus for local joints that deliver to the hotel. Flipping on the lights, I was agape. For literally fifteen dollars more than a crappy motel room on the outskirts of town, here was a gorgeous, clean little corner suite many floors up with a giant bed, flatscreens, sitting room with couch and desk, a separate kitchen with oven, microwave, large fridge, breakfast nook and cooking space, our own washer and dryer and more-right in the heart of downtown! The numerous windows and corner location boasted STUNNING views, and I immediately threw open the drapes to take in the city night, awestruck. We ordered up delicious food and settled in as our traffic-induced blood pressures plummeted. Later that night, yet again mesmerized by the view, I began to notice the flowing river begin to freeze over. By morning it was all white and crispy on top, amazing.

This hotel was definitely worth the rate that I got. It was very spacious, with a full kitchen and living room in addition to the bed and bath. The location was excellent, very close to bus stops and El stations, and only a short walk from everything downtown Chicago has to offer. Although they don't officially offer early check-in, there was a room ready for us when we arrived at 11:30 (check in time is 3pm), but if you aren't that lucky, they will hold your luggage until a room is available. The amenities were not spectacular, but everything was very clean. Overall, it was a good experience, but I'll highlight a couple of the negatives, just to make you aware that they exist: My first impressions were not the best, because on the first afternoon, when we were trying to relax and get a nap before a late night at a theatre, there was some sort of commotion going on in the room across from ours. A housekeeping cart remained parked in front of the door (nearly blocking our way out) for about 2 hours. The workers went in and out of the room across from us, slamming the door at least once per minute (this went on for well over an hour), yelling loudly in spanish, and just being disrespectful. That evening when I asked the desk clerks about it, they were oblivious, saying there weren't any workers in there and making the two of us feel incredibly stupid. Thankfully, the problem did not persist the next day. The following morning, while my friend was downstairs getting breakfast (which was very good, by the way), housekeeping came knocking on the door at 8 am. Maybe that's normal for them, but having just gotten out of bed, I wasn't ready for them just yet. So I asked her to come back. She barely spoke English, so we agreed on \"no service today\", but it wasn't that big a deal. The only major problem was the bed. The pillow-top mattress was in grave need of replacement. It was very lumpy and uncomfortable, and so soft it felt as though I were sinking. For some that may be a good thing, but if you have back problems as I do, I caution you against this hotel. I found myself unable to go to sleep, tossing and turning for hours, and when I finally drifted off, I woke frequently, wishing for morning so I could get out of bed. If you seek relaxation and a good nights sleep, you should probably choose a different hotel. Now, what I've written may seem all negative, but don't be fooled.

They had a complimentary breakfast which was great, although the breakfast room was a little small to accommodate the amount of people they seem to have at one stage. I booked our room early in the year (for December) and got a great rate, which I noticed increased considerably later in the year. If you can, get in early and you will get a good rate. My only issue would be that trying to get a response via email was non-existent. This was disturbing when I was trying to contact the hotel via email. We were travelling around the USA and using hotel phones can be costly. Email was our main contact.

I was in Chicago this past March when I personally met with Rachel. At that time, I personally checked out 5 different hotels to house my family vacation from August 18 - 22. Once Rachel showed me the rooms, I knew that I was home. The location is prime. It is in the middle of everything. Exit the hotel walking left (north on Michigan Avenue), and you are a one-minute walk from the Chicago River and close to great shopping and incredibly beautiful architecture, and a short walk to River North and the Gold Coast. Exit the hotel walking right (south on Michigan Avenue) and you are close to Millenium Park and Grant Park. Two must sees for visitors to Chicago and lots to do for the kiddies. The rooms are spacious. They have everything that a family could need. A safety deposit box, an ironing board, a washer and dryer, stove, microwave, two sinks, refrigerator, and probably one of the most comfortable beds that you will ever sleep in. Before I came to Chicago, I had trouble falling asleep; a condition that I had since January. Comfort Suites and its amazingly comfortable beds changed all that. If I could put that in pill form, it would sell like hotcakes. The free breakfast served daily was also great. It is somewhere between continental and hot, with the perfect balance. Typically, there was an omelette or egg medallion, and bacon or sausage. Biscuits, a waffle station, maple syrup, fruit yogurt (peach and strawberry), hot coffee, assorted danishes, various personal sized cereals, orange juice, milk (2% and skimmed), and more goodies. Maria - the person responsible for stocking the breakfast - worked very hard during my entire stay and I insisted on helping her. She was polite and explained that it was not necessary. Maria always had a smile. The staff at Comfort Suites were very friendly. The reception staff, and I apologize if I leave anybody out, were outstanding. Myrna was full of spunk and life - a real firecracker. Stephanie was very personable and always offered advice on where to go and what to do with a smile. Sara (my mother's personal favorite) was always cheerful and also referred us to some great foodie spots in downtown Chicago. The cleaning staff at Comfort were also particularly awesome. What struck me the most is how at a certain time in the morning, like clockwork, the cleaning staff would line up by the elevators waiting to ascend to their various floors in the hotel (there are 26 floors). The awesome part is how the staff would step aside and insist on letting the hotel guests get on board while they wait for the next available elevator. To me, this demonstrates how Comfort puts customers first. I highly recommend Comfort Suites to anyone looking to be in the heart of Chicago and close to everything. Chicago is a walkable city so bring your \"comfort\" shoes. I am telling all my friends about my experience. Once you walk into the larger than average rooms, you will feel like you have come home. Once your head hits the pillow as you rest from your long day of seeing the city, a sense of \"comfort\" will overtake your body and you will smile as you drift off to a peaceful night's sleep. You will wake up refreshed, ready for a hearty breakfast, and be ready to do it all over again. Comfort Suites - you have my heart. Thank you for reminding me what a restful sleep feels like. I will definitely be calling you when I return to Chicago in the future. Kudos to all the staff at Comfort. Especially, Rachel, Patrick (thank you for heading to Walgreens to find that \"thing\" for my disabled brother), Maria, Myrna, Sara, and Stephanie. See you all soon. Thank you so, so very much for teaching your staff how to treat people. Not to mention any names, but I have stayed at some of the top notch hotels and I found the staff to be fake. I did not get that feeling at Comfort Suites. Places to Eat: For deep dish pizza, you have to try Lou Malnati. The closest location to the hotel is 439 North Wells Street. Giordano's - another popular pizza place - is very close to the hotel, but it has stuffed pizza, not deep dish. People - they are not the same. Trust someone who has eaten lots of pizza in Chicago. For amazing, but a little pricey, Spanish tapas, check out Mercat a La Planxa located at 638 South Michigan Avenue. I got a buzz from taste buds sensory overload. One of the new chefs - his name escapes me - was recently featured on the food network. I highly recommend this place. But make sure you see the menu before you take a large group. It can be costly. For popcorn, you have to try Garrett Gourmet Popcorn located throughout the city. Try the Chicago Style mix - warning: your fingers will turn orange/yellow since this particular mix consists of cheese and caramel popcorn. Typically, it is a 50/50 split, but you can request a different ratio to your liking. Second City in Chicago - you will save money if you book your tickets to Second City over the telephone and pick them up at the box office. Ordering online will set you back $4.50 per ticket, as opposed to ordering over the phone which will cost you $3 per order...not per ticket. Huge savings to buy drinks with.

First of all, this hotel is in the perfect location. It is just minutes walk to Millennium Park, transportation, Mag. mile, shops, restaurants, etc. The room was a good size suite with a separate bedroom and living area with pullout couch and kitchen. The beds (even the pull-out) were comfortable with great bedding. The bathroom is a bit small, and it would be great if there was a make-up mirror or something provided for the desk so we could get ready while others are showering. But, overall the room was wonderful and even had great views of the river and all the action of the city. One of the best selling points for this hotel was the employees. In the 6 days we were there everyone we interacted with was so kind and helpful and just plain friendly! When we needed help with a broken toilet, it was fixed by the time we returned from dinner. When we needed a cork screw the staff literally went to 4 different grocery/convenience stores trying to find us one. We need another blanket - it was there in 3 minutes. Every time we needed assistance with anything someone was there to help and they went out of their way to make sure we had what we needed. The front door was held open for us each time we came and left with a huge smile and funny comment or greeting. We truly felt like we were coming \"home\" after a day and evening out exploring. So - the only thing they could do to improve is perhaps stock the kitchens a bit better. There was really nothing available if you really wanted to cook in the kitchens. Not even a corkscrew, as I mentioned! And we were quite disappointed there wasn't a real coffee maker, only a small one cup at a time thing. They do provide coffee downstairs, but it wasn't quite up to our Seattle standards, so we would have loved to make our own pot. There were only a few glasses, dishes. Pretty sparse - which was okay for us as we really wanted to dine out for this trip. I highly recommend this hotel for families! It's probably not the most romantic or fancy - but for our trip with mom and 3 adult sisters it was just perfect - and a great bargain at about $150 a night.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lowell, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cPERFECT for the business traveller\u201d", "Author": "WeatherWife", "ReviewID": "UR73627746", "Content": "Our company had the good fortune to choose Comfort Suites for a first time business trip to Chicago in late July.

What surprised us was the value of what we got. We had a wonderful suite that was more like a one bedroom apartment, complete with a full kitchen and a washer/dryer in the bedroom. The parking was not a huge issue for us, like some previous posters mentioned. We received an email from the hotel prior to our arrival, explaining in detail the parking. I used Googlemaps and Streetview to better conceptualize the area. Once we got there, we knew exactly where we were going. The charge is $30/night for parking which seems like the norm for a large city. A few things mentioned by previous posters I'll also mention. The water pressure is very poor, but it wasn't a deterrent for us at all. Someone also mentioned the traffic noise but I can honestly say that we rarely heard anything out of the ordinary. Yes, we did hear sirens but you're in a large city in the downtown core so we expected this. With regard to the breakfast bar, you really do need to be downstairs by 8:00 if you want to get a seat in the breakfast room. That was hard for us to do, so we would usually grab a few items and take it back to the room. The location is fantastic; it's in walking distance to Millenium Park, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Grant Park and the river. We also went to see a White Sox game and found the front desk very helpful with information regarding the El. (The public transit system is fantastic in Chicago - don't be afraid to use it!). The rooms are large and comfortable. I loved the bed, great mattress and wonderful linens. I also loved the fact that the living room was separate from the bedroom and each contained a flat screen tv.It turned out the washer/dryer was a godsend - the weather was so hot and sticky, we would often need to change our clothes before dinner.

From the desk people to the bell staff, everyone was responsive and friendly and made us feel welcome. Patrick and Rachel, who run the group sales office, handled our questions and requests for months beforehand and followed up proactively, and professionally, when we were unable to. The property itself is rather small and the lobby cozy. The rooms, by contrast, are huge. They were totally renovated in summer '09 as part of the new Comfort Suites branding, and while they aren't plush or deluxe, they are tastefully decorated, clean, and have new amenities, including stoves, fridges, and washer/dryers. The rooms appear to be wearing well, and housekeeping kept ours in good order. The location is superb, halfway between Millennium Park and the Magnificent Mile. I'm sure there are quieter places to stay, but you definitely get the buzz of being in the middle of it all. My wife and I got the impression that many aren't yet aware that Comfort Suites is even there. Our photographer, who hadn't worked events there previously, raved about the views from the executive-suite bedrooms (banks of windows on two sides of the corner bedroom) and balconies during the getting-ready shots. Pros: ~ Nice location--more centrally located than the pricier properties up the Magnificent Mile. Two blocks to Millennium Park, half a block to the Riverwalk. From our top-level rooms, this made for a fantastic view up and down Michigan Avenue, w/ the Wrigley and Tribune buildings just to the north. ~ Really comfortable beds--not what you might expect in budget accommodations. Only the beds at a few four-star hotels or resorts I've stayed at topped them. ~ Large rooms--a common problem in our queen studios was hearing people knocking at the doors because, in the rooms, we were so far away. Seriously. ~ Service--solid, attentive, friendly service that made it feel like a boutique hotel. ~ Breakfast/atrium--decent and free hot breakfast in a sunny, modern atrium. Cons: ~ Parking. With no garage adjacent to the hotel and no stopping on Michigan Ave., guests must unload half a block south and then loop around to park at 111 Wacker. This proved too confusing for some of our guests unfamiliar w/ downtown Chicago. ~ Small bathrooms. Perhaps the most \"economy\" aspect of the property. ~ Elevators. While we didn't find this to be as big a problem as some who have posted, there are two elevators and 26 floors, and at busy times this could mean a few minutes' wait to get downstairs (or up). ~ No restaurant or bar: If you like a place where you can pad downstairs in your slippers to grab a drink, this isn't your place.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "ParisOnze", "ReviewID": "UR72047671", "Content": "A great hotel in a great location.

The location was right in the thick of Michigan Avenue. So it was busy, but close to everything. We were easily able to walk to Millenium Park, the closest metro stop on State Street, and a bus stop just around the corner. Walking to the Magnificent Mile is manageable, but with kids it may not be worth the aggravation. Driving a car is frantic, but once we arrived, we parked the car and never used it again until we left. On that note, you need to drive around to the Hard Rock Hotel entrance on Lake Street to valet your car. Then you can forget about it for the duration of your stay. The Comfort Suites staff will help you carry everything to the hotel, which is a one minute walk up Michigan Avenue. A few doors down from the hotel is a Walgreens drugstore. If you are in need of any minor grocery items (they even had fresh fruit) or virtually anything else, you can find it here. Breakfast was great. The breakfast attendant was extremely helpful. On our last morning, we didn't pay attention to the hours of the buffet and narrowly missed it. However, the attendant rounded up more than enough food from the kitchen to feed our party of 8. That type of service when you have hungry kids is priceless. The rooms were great. Complete kitchens and a washer and dryer are included. We had a king bed suite, with a pull-out sofa.

This delay allowed me to mix my business trip up with some site seeing and the location was excellent for this too, smack bang in the city centre and all the main attractions nearby. Throughout my stay all the staff were helpful and courteous including the excellent suggestions offered for local cuisine and tours - honest staff opinions. Furthermore, due to the hotel actually being more like an apartment, with clothes washing facilities (in-room), kitchen, separate lounge & bathroom etc.. It made my stay even more pleasant, making me feel more at home than in a hotel. Rooms are fairly quite (except for when the odd hotel neighbours leave their rooms and slam the door shut, and the occasional ambulance sirens) and very well equipped. The buffet breakfast is pretty standard (no frills), but the breakfast room is small. As I was a solo traveller, I managed to find a place most days either on my own or sharing with someone else's table. The only really frustrating moment I had was when I lost internet connection for a day (the day I decided to work from the hotel) and the problem could not be resolved by the internal hotel staff. I was referred promptly to the external provider, but it took them almost 24hrs to resolve - in the end, I ended up working from the breakfast room as the WiFi there was my only option.

We went to the parking lot by the Hard Rock Cafe and were told it wasn't the parking for the Comfort Suites. We wanted valet but were turned away. The self park, $30 night, is across the street from the hotel meaning you have to drag your luggage through the streets of Chicago. We found out that we were given incorrect information at the Hard Rock Cafe area parking lot. This isn't the hotel's fault but it needs to be addressed. I would only recommend this hotel if you don't drive. The other puzzling element is the lack of enthusiastic hotel front desk staff. They were professional but blah.

We like our space as we have traveled together before, so I checked out suite hotels in downtown Chicago. Most were very pricy. Comfort Suites offered the best rates for the four night stay averaging $125.00 per night for a one bedroom suite. The room has a pull out sofa so it can sleep two couples or kids. There are rooms with two queen beds and two separate bedrooms, but they were booked on the Labor Day weekend. We were given a room with a king size separate bedroom and we were not disappointed. First of all the location is superb, everything within walking distance right outside the door, ten minutes to Millennium Park, the Michigan Ave. water taxis and fabulous shopping and good restaurants right on the street outside the hotel. The room was exceptional for the price. A true mini-apartment with full kitchen, washer dryer, ironing board, security safe and separate bedroom with king size bed. The view from the 12th floor encompassed the Chicago river, Trump Tower and the room had corner windows that made the room bright and cheery. The room was spotless, well-stocked with utensils, thick white towels and above average linens. Paper towels and dish soap were provided. The king bed had six luxurious pillows and a beautiful duvet cover over the comfortable bed. Two flat screen T.V.s were in the rooms along with an adequate work space and office chair for business travelers. We had an occasion to call the front desk for small maintenance issues, and the technicians were prompt, courteous and would not even accept our tip's. All in all, the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The breakfast room was small but seated everyone, the breakfast was about average for this type of property, and the staff worked hard to replenish eggs, waffle batter and juices as they were depleted by the hungry crowd. The fitness center had nice equipment for a quick work out and was stocked with ice and a vending machine. An accessible business center allowed for printing out boarding passes and checking emails, as I did not bring my laptop. We were quite happy during our stay and stocked the room with quick snacks and drinks from the local Walgreens. Since we attended wedding festivities, we did not cook, but the four burner stove and oven, full size dishwasher(the maid even loaded our dishes) and cooking utensils allow for full meal preparation in the room if needed. The room was quiet, we heard no street noise and each floor seems to house only 4 apartments, so long hallways are not an issue. This hotel is excellent for active travelers and families that want a great value, clean and safe environment and like the amenities of a kitchen and separate sleeping area. The bathroom is small but functional and clean, and was stocked with small toiletries. My sister and I could have stayed there for two weeks and felt perfectly comfortable.

Inexpensive for a big city hotel, $170 for Saturday night, $150 for Sunday night. A great location for Chicago tourist, Its on Michigan Ave between Millenium Park and the shopping district. The room itself was amazing, it was a 2 bedroom suite, there was one room with a king size bed another with a queen size bed, a livingroom, kitchenette, there was a washer and dryer, and 3 TVs. There was plenty of room for 5 of us to get some alone time. But only problem was with the staff. Stephanie(who I never met in person was great on the phone) but when I got there the check in staff was horrible. After she checked us in which took 10minutes because she was talking to another employee about going to school and what career she wanted, she never bothered to tell us where our room was, where the elevators where, or anything about the morning breakfast we had. She was too busy to acknowledge us. Then the next day we asked for directions to the subway they didnt know, you'd think at the hotel they'd know. They gave us some bus directions. Also when we arrive at the city we were kinda lost, so we called with what location we were at , the girl said she didnt know where we were, well we were around the corner, how can you not know where we were when its your job, but especially when we were around the corner. Stephanie needs to work more. There is a parking garage around the coner too. This hotel was great and housekeeping was great. At this point the only negative was the employees at check in.

Our suite was on the 25th floor and we had a corner unit with views from two sides of our living room! Plenty of room to relax and if you take your bike with you, you will have enough room to store it in one of the several closets. I definitely reccomend this hotel and would stay here again. The location is excellent, the decor is very nice, and the room is very comfy. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfast bar was decent. The scrambled eggs weren't that good and the sausage links were pretty hard, but the typical items (muffins, bagels, waffles, cereal, juice, and coffee were very good.) What I enjoyed - the amount of space and the feeling that I had a one bedroom studio apartment overlooking downtown; free internet connection; plenty of room to store clothes and other personal items; really comfy bedding; large apartment-sized refrigerator; clean and tasteful decor; carpet was soft to walk on with bare feet; they had plenty of dishes and utensils available and even dish soap; We stayed for 2 nights, so we didn't take advantage of all the amenities in the room. We didn't use the 4-burner stove, microwave, dishwasher, sink, or toaster. But we did use the refrigerator and cupboards to store some of our groceries. What made it nice was that there was more than enough space that you didn't have to look at any luggage or other personal belongings just sitting around; you could find a place for everything so it made it feel more like a condo or an apartment. Knowing all of the amentities that are available, I would definetly consider this hotel over others for any long stays in the city. What I enjoyed least - When I entered the room, I noticed a certain smell to it. I've smelled that scent before and it's like a chemical spray that they use to deorderize. I don't really care for that smell, but I could live with it. Interesting items - you can crank open the windows; the washer and dryer are in your bedroom, there is a coat closet in the living room, there is a huge storage closet between the bathroom and kitchen where the hot water tank is at, you have a double door closet in the bedroom, there are two plasma tv's (one in the living room and the second on your bedroom wall); and there are enough cupboards in the kitchen if you bring groceries.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "joshua7576", "Title": "\u201cGreat Deal, but Watch Out\u201d", "Author": "joshua7576", "ReviewID": "UR36643156", "Content": "The number one thing most customers need to understand about this hotel is the parking situation.

We reserved a 2 queen beds bedroom suite and the accomodations were spacious, with ample closet space. The suite had a full kitchen, and comes with all the cookware, dishes, and silverware that you may need should you get the urge to cook. But why would you want to when you're staying in Chicago with all its great food? (The microwave did come in handy though when heating up leftovers for a midnight snack). The only negative was that the bathroom was really small, which was weird because the rest of the suite was large. The suite also comes with a washer and dryer, which is good in case you don't want to pack a lot of clothes and just want to travel with a carry-on (which is what my sister did). Everything in our room was new, the beds, the desk, the flatscreen TV, the rest of the furniture. We also got free internet, but you need to bring an ethernet cable because they don't provide Wi-Fi. The free breakfast was a nice extra. Everything was in good working order, and we didn't experience any problems in our suite. However, my parents were in another room and weren't so lucky...their air conditioner didn't work for 3 nights of our 5 night trip, which made their room an uncomfortable 75 degrees unless they opened the windows. The hotel did offer them a $25/night discount for the inconvenience, though I would have preferred they were given a room change or upgrade right away, instead of waiting a couple of days for maintenance to fix it. The location of the hotel is excellent, right on Michigan Avenue and right by the river. It's also convenient because a Walgreens is right at the corner, where we bought water and some snacks. Also, the bus stops were close by, either in front of the hotel, or around the corner, and we were able to go everywhere through public transportation. Public transit is cheap and very easy to use in Chicago, and you can buy 1, 3, or 7-day bus passes at the CVS pharmacy that is across the street, about a half-block away from the hotel. Also, the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful whenever we had any questions or asked for recommendations, especially Lee...he's awesome and a good resource for what to do in Chicago.
