The good... - location is great, only three minute walk from Jordan MTR (metro) station - very safe (all of HK is so safe for travellers0 - it was cheap - it was clean The bad... - it's not actually a hotel, but merely a collection of apartments 'managed' by an office. The rooms are scattered across 16 floors of the high rise building which means you share everything with everyone. It's particularly loud at night with lots of people roaming the hallways - the room was small. I think this is pretty standard of HK - the bed was way too short - I'm about 188cm tall and my ankles were even hanging out of the bed - the bed was hard - I may as well have slept on a futon - you can't pay your room deposit/security by credit card, so be prepared to part with HKD$300 (which is refunded if you don't trash your room). It's extremely inconvenient as I had planned how much cash I needed for my two day trip Would I stay here again - hell NO! I tried it because it was affordable, but I wouldn't ever come back!", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Jiun Long Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1380642-Reviews-Jiun_Long_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Cyber Plaza, 239Temple Street, Jordan, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1380642", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/5c/47/a3/a-standard-room.jpg"}}
