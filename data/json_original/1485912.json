Contrary to some of the other reviews, we did not find the staff unfriendly, maybe because we were prepared to attempt at least a few words in Spanish, and as soon as we checked in were asked if we wanted to reserve seats on the airport transfer bus for the morning. The hotel was very modern and funky in its design and although we had planned to go straight to bed, we decided to spend a little time down in the bar and reception area, once we had seen it. This was a little on the chilly side, due to the large glass doors to the outside of the hotel, which kept opening, but this wasn't a major problem. There was free Wi-fi in this, and other areas of the hotel, and we were given the access code when we checked in. As for the accommodation, the bathroom and bedroom were extremely clean. There was a large walk in shower (no bath) and a wide variety of toiletries provided, including a toothbrush and toothpaste, shaving kit and comb, in addition to the usual shampoo and shower gel. We requested, and received a wake-up call, which was a 'real' person and not just an automated recording. We did not eat in the restaurant as we arrived late, and had an early start in the morning, although it looked very nice. The only point to consider, although it did not affect us, was that there were too many people waiting for the 5:30 am hotel transfer bus, and they all claimed to have reserved a seat. We were okay, because the driver went through the room numbers he had on his list, so perhaps some of the other guests had not actually confirmed their places, but I think they were trying to sort out alternative transport for those who could not fit on the bus.

The lounge area by the registration desk has a small bar, but bar food is limited to crackers until the restaurant opens. The restaurant doesn't open until 8:30 pm, which might make sense in downtown Madrid, but isn't great for folks catching morning flights.

If having a great room at a bargain (for Europe) price is more important than having the city at your feet when you walk out of the front door, the Axor Barajas is well worth considering.

Be it restaurant, bar, reception, rooms, all are well laid out. Room was very spacious, perhaps largest rooms we stayed in in this price rage! It was a very nice to have 'living room' area of generous space without making sleeping part of the room crammed or otherwise small. Hotel's black and white color scheme and contemporary furnitures in the room did a good job giving modestly classy, yet still contemporary feeling. Two rooms we stayed in over two nights, rooms were very clean and similar layout, but the second room was little larger and a bit more spacious overall. For both rooms, bathroom was about the same size, also spacious (!) in both cases and of same design. They provide you with basic bathroom amenities like razor, toothbrush, shampoo, body soap and so on, which is nice (shampoo and body soap isn't bad actually. Don't make skin dry or hair coarse). I think the best part of the stay was the breakfast. I normally don't eat breakfast, but here, choice is large. Even as a vegetarian, I was happy to find quite variety of fresh sliced fruits to fill the stomach with. For non veggies, they should be able to find their favorite breakfast meats. That is, of course, aside from breakfast staples of bread, eggs, yogurt, etc. Good stuff. As for shuttle to the airport, DO ask about it when you check in. Otherwise you might not have a seat in the morning when you want to go. If anyone decide to take a taxi from the airport, for us, it was 20 euro the first time and 15 euro for the second time. Our place landed really late on both occasions, so we took a taxi on both nights. Not sure why the fare discrepancies. Not sure if we there was some thing going on with the road or we simply got ripped off. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel for a stop over. Price isn't bad, breakfast is good.

Arriving at Barajas T4 I headed out to the courtesy bus stop and within a few minutes the small minibus arrived. It had just 8 seats and turned out woefully too small. Still, I barged to the front and got on-board. Soon enough we were full but had still to pick up at T1-2-3! So onwards we went and the driver had to explain to the T123 passengers that there was no more room. We then set off on what can only be described as the most frightening bus journey (or any journey) I have ever had. The driver drove like a real idiot and I felt scared - and I've seen bad driving in my time. On the final street to the hotel the driver thought it right to sit in a queue but because he was impatient, tried overtaking the queue - for no real reason. He was also flashing his lights at anything that got in his way, cornering like the minibus couldnt topple over and boy I was just glad to get off. Id have got a taxi had I know just how bad this driver was. So, having arrived at the hotel I found check in very slow. Despite them getting a third receptionist to come on duty, it just seemed to take ages. I reckon it took 20 minutes from arrival to getting my room key. Once in the room I found it nice, if a little baron from a view point perspective. The room itself was modern, large and everything worked.

The facilities and guest rooms are generally very nice. The rooms are furnished in a very contemporary style. The beds are comfortable, rooms clean, bathrooms are large with an excellent shower. The restaurant is also a very good choice for both breakfast and dinner. This hotel really is an excellent choice for those needing to stay close to Barajas airport. However I have had a few experiences with poor service. The front desk is very inconsistent. I have had some very professional and accommodating staff help me with check-in, but I have also run into one of the worst front desk employees I have ever encountered. This last time in Oct. 2011, the front desk clerk could not find my reservation, and insisted that I had book their sister hotel next door (Axor Feiria). After schlepping myself and luggage over there, they told me that I was in fact booked at the Axor Barajas and called over to confirm that he had made a mistake. I returned and waited patiently for the same person to help me check-in. While I have no issues with an honest mistake, this clown made absolutely no attempt at an apology or even acknowledgement of his mistake for sending me away the first time. And then he acted like it was my fault since I pre-booked for the night before (a common practice when arriving on an early AM flight from the US), telling me they waited \"all-day\" for me and I did not show up. This type of behavior by a front desk person really demonstrates poor staff recruitement and training. It is a shame that in a country with +20% unemployment, hotels still get stuck with sub-par staff like this. It is also a shame because most of their other staff work very hard to provide good customer service. Readers should also be aware that their airport shuttle can be very inconsistent as well. After arriving at the airport bus area, I waited for an hour before the bus showed up. They advertise every 30 minutes. And while an extra 30 minutes is not really a big deal, it is a drag to sit on a bench and wait an hour after taking the overnight flight from the US. I would also caution anyone taking the shuttle back to the airport. While I have never attempted this, the shuttle from the hotel to the airport seemed extremely packed with dozens of people standing around with their luggage waiting for a ride. It seemed very chaotic and risky if you are on a tight schedule, so a taxi is probably a better option to avoid the stress. So would I recommend this hotel?...Sure, it is a good choice for a hotel near Barajas. But just beware the inconsistent service at the front desk and shuttle service.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bern, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNice airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "Swiss_business", "ReviewID": "UR120014181", "Content": "Very modern and comfortable, only 15 minutes from airport, great price with very good breakfast buffet.

We had booked the hotel & pre-paid through hotels.com. Needing a hotel close to the Madrid Barajas airport for a flight home the next day, we decided on the Axor Barajas for its location, price, & shuttle service from the airport (flew in from Porto, Portugal). The poor communication issue began after retrieving our baggage. We were told that the shuttle comes by every half hour, so we hustled to that area. After nearly an hour of waiting & needing to get to the hotel (we were quite tired from our 2+ weeks of traveling), we decided to take a taxi instead, a ride that cost 23.50 euros for a 2-3 mile trip. An exhorbitant amount, in my opinion! Since no taxi could accommodate all 4 of us & our luggage, our friends took a taxi as well & spent the same amount. We informed the desk clerk of our dilemma & asked why there was no shuttle. Her answer was, \"Well, it should have been there.\" No apology, no offer of compensation, no empathy! The second incident of poor communication happened the next morning as we went to the breakfast buffet, which was part of our pre-paid package. We were told that the breakfast buffet was NOT part of our package. Only by returning to our room & retrieving the copy of our reservation with hotels.com that listed the breakfast buffet as part of our deal were we allowed to sit down & eat. By now the food wasn't tasting very good. The third incident happened shortly thereafter. Because of the problem with no shuttle the night before, we made sure we reserved a shuttle for 10:30 a.m. before retiring for the night & was assured that it would be there. I decided to double-check that at 10 a.m. The desk clerk succinctly said, \"That is impossible, sir.\" By now I was starting to get a bit agitated & told him of the 2 aforementioned situations. He could see I was not going to accept his statement, so after a couple phone calls he said, \"No problem, sir!\" It came at 10:15. Other than these frustrations, the hotel did meet our expectations of a good location & a good price. If you're expecting more, you better double-check ALL communication with the hotel to avoid what we experienced.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201c9.5 out of 10\u201d", "Author": "Asatis", "ReviewID": "UR119811570", "Content": "Axor Barajas is one of the best airport hotels I've ever stayed in.

The hotel prides itself with the excellent ratings it has from Tripadvisor (with very visible sign in reception area), I would only do it justice by posting the very bad customer experience I had with them on that same website. We arrived at the Feria around midnight (a hotel for which I had a booking made for a king size bed some 4 weeks ago) and waited patiently in line with only one receptionist attending guests. Two ladies were in the back office but not helping out (not even with the many phone calls). When it was our turn to check in, we learned that our room was at the nearby hotel (Axor Barajas). I wasn\u2019t happy with the change as I had spotted major trouble when I got out of the shuttle. The hotel was visibly handling an \u201cEmergency\u201d or accommodating passengers from a cancelled flight. There were between 80 to 90 people in the large reception area. I have worked in the past in the hotel business and I know it is a very challenging situation. In the case of the Axor hotels it was completely out of control and to say handled \u201cpoorly\u201d is a gross understatement. The gentleman helping me out at the Feria insisted that I would be fine, that he would make the check in himself and that I would only need to get my key from the other hotel. When we arrived there the understaffed personal was trying to cope with the many guests. I received my key but was yet to face the most outrageous part of my arrival. We arrived in a room that had 2 pieces of luggage in it. It was already 1.20 am and I didn\u2019t want to have to (literally) fight for a room in an overbooked hotel. I called reception and asked them to take care of the luggage that was in the room I was assigned. Waited for 30 minutes but no one showed up. I also realized by then that the toilet had been used by the mysterious guest but nevertheless thought keeping the room was still the safest option. When I went down to ask who was going to take care of the bags, no one seemed to be aware of the situation! But I hadn\u2019t paid attention to the name of the person who had been on the phone with me so I had to explain my story again. At that point a non uniformed gentleman behind the counter was begging a receptionist ending his shift to \u201cstay a little longer\u201d. I had a chance to interact with him some minutes later when heading back to my room, he was speechless when I briefly told him what I had experienced in only 2 hours. I was eventually in my room (free of a stranger\u2019s luggage) at 2.20 am. I need to add to this review that: -we didn\u2019t get the double bed requested 4 weeks prior when I made the booking. -never got our 9 am wake up phone call. -were not booked (as requested the night before) on the 11 am shuttle to the airport. I have been able to make positive reviews on two occasions for the AXOR hotels in Barajas, but this experience left me terribly disappointed. Airport hotels have to be functional, flying/traveling is already extremely stressful these days. No one needs to go through this type of experience. I will request a refund or a voucher for a future stay. Hopefully I will be able someday soon to report that the Axor hotels are still a good place to spend a night and rest.

Funny thing is that the driver did realise it was my luggage (she gave me instructions where and how to put it in the bus) and she did realise that my stop is terminal 2 (she asked it to organize all luggage in bus in order of stops). When I wondered where is my luggage - she just said, that it was in terminal 1. Funny? I was standing at the airport with my 9 month boy in hands with no luggage. She told me she will drive to the terminal 1 and get it. I waited 10 minutes.. 15... 30... (it was 3 minutes drive).. As you can guess she never returned.. I spent all my money on mobile phone (expensive roaming) to get a message from the hotel that she did returned to terminal 1 but there was no luggage on the pavement. Was it hard to look better? Or just enter terminal 1 and ask \"Lost and found\" if they have it? Or just use brains and not to leave luggage on the pavement in first place. And the most shocking - was the reaction of the hotel - not a single regret, no \"sorry\", no willing to help or solve the problem. They just turned off the phone and didnt speak to me. So I was at the beginning of my vacation, without my luggage and late for my flight.

This hotel is well worth it though, just bring a good map if you are driving to it. On the way out, there was no trouble getting to the airport, a 10-15 minute drive. Easy rental car return.

Everything is nicely designed, almost sterile and clinical, yet there is nothing to warm the place up. No pictures on the wall in my large room, no plants, no anything.

I went down and ask the front desk twice about not having air con in my room, and only the fan is working. They promised twice that someone would come up and fix it. No one EVER came.

We paid 105 Euro for the night without breakfast and whilst this is not cheap, it is also not expensive. The staff at the hotel were very good and the hotel appearence itself was as good as the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were initially happy with the choice we had made. The problems started...we put the kids to bed and due to the July humidity in Madrid, we turned on the A/C so they/we could sleep. After about 30 minutes, an awful smell of came along and I am not able to put my finger onto what the smell actually was other than a dead festering animal. This became worse to the point that it was getting in our throats...it was awful to say the least! I quickly dressed and approached the members of staff on the reception politely explaining my concern. A youngish chap on reception quickly explained that they were aware of this but there was nothing they could do as it was coming along from a factory just behind the hotel. I headed back to my room and met an american gent who came out of his room and was equally concerned as me. I explained the factory story to him. In re-entering my room, the smell was absolutely foul so at that stage I re-approached the reception and asked a different member of staff to follow me to my room explaining the smell was unbearable. He explained that he has children and was again, a polite fella. He could speak fairly good English and on opening the door to my room, he quickly turned around saying that that it was too much and we needed a different room immediately. He then explained that he thought there was a dead animal in the A/C system and it had happened before...different story to the last one. He was very helpful in transferring my kids and the necessary to another room (1am). I was relieved to move rooms and began to fall asleep before the smell came along once more....I could not believe it and at this point decided to turn off the A/C rather than risk our health; much to my wife's dismay. We never got a goods nights sleep hereon due to the heat of Madrid. All my family suffered the following day due to tiredness and I should have made a fuss on checking out but I do not feel comfortable in doing this and so we just left. It is only on arriving home I feel that I should warn people especially as a friend of mine explained that legionaire's disease can be caught through A/C systems. I will certainly not recommend this hotel solely on the A/C failings. The manager knew what happened and i feel that he should have done something to make us feel a little happier. I got the feeling that the management are willing to accept complaints from a large and consistent flow of guests and that they are willing to accept this as they will always remain busy...Not good at all and still not happy.

But that's about it - everything else was great and there were plenty of nice surprises - how often does that happen - never! Once inside the hotel, the entrance lobby rises four or five stories. Staright forward and pleasant check-in. Small bar serves enormous gin and tonics. The room was fabulous - huge. Wood floors and funky minimalist approach. The bed was a super king and really comfy - I had a great nights sleep. Even the pillows were great which is rare in hotels. The work table had a laptop on it! The wireless connection on my pc was fast, but on the hotels pc it was poor. Well stocked minibar and at reasonable prices (beer \u20ac3, cava \u20ac6). On top of it was superb coffee maker. Double sofa and two single chairs, 32 inch TV. Wardrobe had a safe big enough for my pc. Bathroom is actually a shower room. The shower was excellent, with good pressure. usual amenities provided. A/C worked well. Black-out curtains good. I paid \u20ac100 a night which included breakfast (also v.good with fresh orange juice). I used the restaurant one night with a friend. We had a superb meal - starters of prawns, fois gras and something else, followed by steak and chips wshed down with two bottles of wine. Bill \u20ac125. Service was slightly grumpy.

The hotel is full of stuck travellers. The good points: * Great location for the airport * Amazing looking rooms. You walk in and go 'WOW'. Huge room. Great bathroom. Big TV. * Huge, comfortable bed. * Great value for this quality of hotel. Paid EUR \u20ac95 for a double room. Last night I stayed in a flea pit in Rome and it cost EUR \u20ac75, and this was 1000 times better. * There's a huge shopping centre around the corner. tons of shops. tons of restaurants. cinema (in Spanish). * Free WiFi. There's a computer room with free access to laptops. * Blackout blinds on windows (though they're not 100%). There are no blinking lights or LEDs in the room so it's pretty dark. * Lots of the reviews complain about bad service, but everything's been fine for us and everyone speaks perfect English. Maybe they read the reveiws and improved! The bad points: * On an industrial estate, so no character and no views * Our room was all white, which while looking great from a distance, shows the wear and tear close up. * The Internet connection was very, very slow. The hotel is pretty full so this may explain it, but if I were on business this would be unusable. * The shuttle bus (whilst free) only runs once per hour and only takes 19 people. If it's full up you get to wait another hour or have to pay for a taxi. * The air conditioning isn't working throughout the whole hotel. our room is baking hot. * I wish 'designers' weren't allowed near bathrooms. The bathroom door is glass, so when you go in the night the bathroom light lights the bedroom. There's no lock on the door. The sink looks amazing but takes about a teaspoonful of water before overflowing. If it weren't for the air conditioning I'd give this a 4.5. But not having working air conditioning made for an uncomfortably hot night, so it only gets 2.5.

More so, none of the staff even processed anything beyond rudimentary English, considering its proximity to a Hub airport like Madrid, this was unexpected. While the room cost is reasonable, the restaurant is overpriced to the point of absurdity. i.e. 20 Euro for a few pieces of undercooked beef (apparently it a \u201cT-bone\u201d), 10 euro for a few stalks of asparagus. Even more, they were unable to make any sort of concessions for a vegetarian. The dishes eventually served would embarrass the staff of other restaurants. The close location to the airport means dining inside is one of the few feasible options, and therefore its poor performance should play a large factor in your decision to come here. The clich\u00e9d expression \"beauty is only skin deep\" applies well to the Axor. The rooms and hotel are chic and trendy, but anything beyond the surface leaves one disappointed and frustrated.

A hotel can only achieve a maximum rating from me if it exceeds my expectations. If I stayed in a super posh 6* hotel with price to match, it would be very hard for it to achieve a max rating, because I would surely judge it as stringently as it's room rate suggests it is good. I obtained a very competitive rate for the Axor Baraxas - comparable to the rate of a low budget, low comfort hotel in the UK. The Axor Hotel actually consists of 2 hotels: the Barajas - a 4* business hotel - and the Feria - a 3* budget hotel. To be clear, this review is about the Axor Barajas. The location is very convenient for the Airport and the Feria de Madrid exhibition centre. There is a complementary shuttle which serves both the airport and the Feria. If you can't wait for the shuttle at the airport, be aware that jumping in a taxi will cause the driver to snort in disgust at the the low far this will attract, even if it is nearly \u20ac20. Avoid airport taxis if you can! As for getting about from the hotel - there are often taxis lurking outside. A cab to the centre of Madrid will cost you about \u20ac20. If you jump in a waiting cab, the meter starts when you jump in. If you ask the desk to call a taxi for you, the meter starts when it starts the journey to the hotel. Be aware of this or you may think the taxi is ripping you off - it isn't, that's how it works here. And so to the hotel. The front office staff are attentive and effective. After a swift check in one of three lifts will whisk you to your floor. The rooms are large and comfortable. I stayed in an executive room which was very well equipped. It had a table with 4 chairs, as well as a desk, so this would be an ideal place to hold a business meeting or to have room to spread out if you have lots of paperwork. The king sized bed was very comfortable, too. The bathroom has a great walk in shower and a soft closing toilet seat - both indicative of the attention to detail in this establishment. Each floor has a feature room - an ad hoc meeting room, a news room (papers and CNN for example), a computer room, a games room... Internet connectivity is free and is wired or WiFi in the rooms and WiFi in the public areas. The one negative aspect of my stay here was with the restaurant. The service did not meet the high standard that the rest of the hotel had led me to expect. The breakfast buffet was similarly unappetising. Having said that, for the rate paid, it was a spectacular success.
