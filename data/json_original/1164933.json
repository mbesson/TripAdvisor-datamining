This hotel is located right off of I-95 and in a well populated area with hospitals, shopping centers, stores and restaurants. It is one of the first hotels in the development, very easy to find, right next to a gas station, a McDonald's and a Taco Bell. The parking lot always had plenty of spaces, check-in was a breeze, all staff we encountered were very nice and accomodating. The lobby was beautiful, with plenty of seating and as is customary in Marriott brand hotels, hot tea and coffee 24/7. The room was very bright and comfortable. My only gripe was the channel selection on the TV was limited and there was a fuzzy reception on some cable channels. There was no fan in the bathroom but the mirror cleared up pretty quickly once the bathroom door was open. My only complaint (and it's not really a complaint) is that the location of the hotel is still far out from the harbor. Every restaurant or business we went to in that area was at least 20 minutes away each way by car. But the hotel was great, quiet, excellent for our needs and our standards.

We got a great \"park and cruise\" rate that allowed us to leave our cars at the hotel and take a free shuttle back and forth to the port. Note about that: Some of us paid for the park & cruise rate, while others carpooled with family and paid for a regular room. Each park & cruise room covers up to 4 people on the shuttle, so those family members who had regular rooms were able to \"share\" with park & cruise people to take the shuttle. Good to know! The hotel staff was excellent before we even arrived, politely answering all our questions and making arrangements for those with medical needs. They called us several days before our stay to set us up with times for the shuttle ride down to the port in an organized manner. The hotel itself is still very new-looking, everything is bright and cheerful. We had a regular king-size room (not a suite), and it was nice - flat screen tv, comfortable bed with extra pillows, plenty of closet space, and a large bathroom that was immaculately clean. (I've never seen such a clean hotel bathroom!) My only complaint about the room was that our bed did not have a comforter - only several layers of sheets - so we were cold. We had to turn the heat up in our room at night! Luckily, the room had a regular digital thermostat, so very easy to control and solve that problem! The complimentary breakfast in the morning was very good - waffles, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, pastries, cereal, oatmeal, juice, etc. A nice little seating area in which to enjoy your meal. The hotel is nicely located near many fast food and sit-down restaurant options. Just outside the hotel doors are a McDonalds and a Taco Bell, and a mall with shopping and restaurants is about 2 minutes away by car. There is also a small \"Market\" inside the hotel selling convenience-store food and drink items. There is a small business center in the lobby with free printing - useful for boarding passes and maps. We did not use the outdoor swimming pool as it was too cold, but it looked nice. I have only one complaint, and it concerns the shuttle service to the port! (I believe this is an outside shuttle company that the hotel contracts with, so please keep that in mind.) Because we were traveling with such a large group, we were split into 3 shuttles at 3 separate times. One shuttle was to contain a regular amount of passengers PLUS a wheelchair, a wedding dress, and several garment bags containing tuxedos. The hotel assured us that they would have the largest of the shuttle vans available for us. Well, they did bring the larger shuttle, but for the wrong shuttle time! It came and went, and when it was time for the wedding baggage to go to port, there wasn't enough room and some people had to stay behind and wait for the next shuttle. It was an inconvenience and was not a pleasant way to start the day. I will say, though, that everyone made it to port on time along with their luggage and it ended up being fine. Because of this experience on the way down to port, we were worried about taking the shuttle back to the hotel after our cruise. However, this time it went very smoothly! They had enough shuttles for everyone waiting at the port when we docked, and we were back to our cars in no time at all. I suspect that the problem we experienced with the shuttle had to do with the fact that we were such a large party. I caution those traveling in large groups to check and double check that your group will be accommodated by the shuttle! But for those traveling with fewer people (couples and small families), I highly recommend this hotel! And if you aren't doing a park-and-cruise and are just looking for a hotel stay, then by all means, this is an excellent choice!", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cModern, clean, new hotel with excellent staff--highly recommend!\u201d", "Author": "LizB_71", "ReviewID": "UR98142517", "Content": "We stopped at this hotel to spend the night on our drive back to Connecticut from Florida.

The area is easy to navigate and clearly very, very safe. Also close to 95, a very quick trip to and from BWI and Downtown Baltimore. Finally, for breakfast, the breakfast bar was great! The breakfast area had a nice flat screen and plenty of private seating. I had two Dunkin Donuts (which I noticed were from Dunkin Donuts because I could see the boxes hidden) and the coffee was good. They had Belgian waffle makers which smelled amazing, fresh fruits, other assorted pastries, bagels, yogurts, juices, milks, etc. It was quite a display. Check out was just as easy. They extended to me a late check-out, even though I didn't need it. Check out is at noon so there is less chance you'll be needing one anyway. Overall, great stay and I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cBest Fairfield I've stayed at\u201d", "Author": "30-StateTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR20456072", "Content": "I don't know why this is the only hotel shown in \"White Marsh., MD\" reviews.

I'd put it up against any Marriott Courtyard or SpringHill Suites and it's every bit as nice as the HGI and Hampton up the street. Very friendly, quality construction and here's a rarity: Flat Screen HD TV's AND the HD channels to go with it! Lot's of restaurants and shopping nearby.

Our first impression was how friendly the staff is! When we forgot toothpaste, they personally brought it to our room and it wasn't a small little tube but a good size tube. The room was spacious and very clean. The location is great--right off of 95 but quiet and close to a big mall with lots of choices of restaurants. My only little suggestion would be to spruce up breakfast. Danish, toast, make-your-own waffles, cereal, and fruit are great but perhaps eggs and bacon/sausage can be added too.
