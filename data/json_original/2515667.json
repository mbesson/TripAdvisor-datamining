Do not get in the water. The house keeping never refilled our built-in shampoo dispensers until the fifth day when I jumped out of the shower & called the front desk to ask them to give shampoo. It's quite a task to refill those bottles- the maintenance guy came with tools to change the apparatus & load our bottles up, so I guess that's why house keeping never does it. The lobster bisque at Baleen made me very ill. I did report these 2 issues to the front desk upon check out & they credited us $50 for house keeping trouble, and $50 for the lobster bisque episode. The bay-side bungalow left a lot to be desired- not worth the upgrade charges. The $17/night mandatory resort fee got us nothing but holes in our wallets- we never used the fitness facility, or sports courts but you must pay for them. There is no beverage service at the 'adult' pool, so you have to go to the main pool with all the kids to get any food/beverage service. There are only 2 restaurants onsite & nothing in walking distance, so unless you cab or drive somewhere, you better like the resort food- and prices. The room service was the same menu as Barefoot bar & grill, but pricier. The staff was friendly, but overall I expected the experience to be better. The ducks were cool to watch (but we have them in TX), the prices on wine were good in Baleen & the staff was friendly. But that's it.

The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom and shower room combination were a little odd, with the light switch for both in the dressing room half. This required you to have to walk through both \"rooms\" to turn on the light, and then return to the showering room. The shower didn't have a ledge along the floor to prevent the water from covering part of the bathroom floor, so that made showering a little messy. (This was just a minor inconvenience.)

There were some very cute little ducks that actually ate out of my sons hands. We didn't have a car and chose to cab to most places. Cabs were sent to our bungalow and were easy to get. We didn't have to pay for parking, which everyone complains about. Remember though, you are in a major city. Most hotels charge these fees. The nice thing is you can park right outside of your bungalow - great convenience. Elizabeth at the Market Place was wonderful and helped us arrange a car service to Lego Land. Worked out perfectly. We rented a boat one day, Sea World twice, the Midway one afternoon. This hotel is conveniently located. We ate lots of meals at Barefoot Grill and loved it. My son had a blast checking out the sharks, sting rays and fish in the pond plus also playing down by the bay. Overall, considering that we ate many meals at the resort, this was the same price as most upscale all inclusives but we found the food and drink choices better.

I almost changed hotels based on complaints. I found most of the complaints unfounded. If you are booked to stay here and not expecting a Ritz Carlton but a nice comfortable resort, you will enjoy it. A recommendation is to ask for extra towels and maybe bring small soaps.

The resort is set up as a series of small buildings that have two units each. It appears that some of these units have full-time residents and others are used as a hotel. As such, there is an odd vibe of full-time residents and vistors in the complex; this is not a bad thing, just a bit differnt from the usual hotel. The resort tries to give an exotic feel to the location by making it a walking experience, with staff in golf carts always willing to lend someone a ride. However there is very bad signage, and it is easy to get lost; half the time I flagged down a staff member on a cart was to get directions. Geting lost due to a lack fo signage, especially at night with limited street illumination got tiresome quickly. The rooms themselves have an \"island like\" flavor with hardwood floor, however due to the first level location, I did have some ants in my room, which was a bit unwelcomed. There is a casual and a more formal restaurant in the complex. While I only ate at the casual restaurant, it was not very good. Overall I felt that the resort was lacking something; it seemed like it did not know what it wanted to be, and as a result, it did all things a bit badly.

Found a not bad discount price for Paradise Point, and the website pictures and description sold us. I came here with quite high expectations. We stayed for 8 days. We stayed in a \u201cJunior Garden Suite\u201d which is a large room with a king bed and a fold-out queen sofa bed. A small kitchenette is at the end, with a fridge and microwave only. A large bathroom with two sinks, a separate room with toilet, tub/shower, and a separate walk-in closet with a dresser and coat rack make up the balance of the room. We had a nice patio looking out over a small pond with ducks, and a view of the ocean lagoon between two adjacent buildings. The room was very clean. The beds were not that good. The king squeaked and rocked every time someone moved. The sofa bed was likewise noisy. The room climate control worked well, but was too loud to leave running over night (when the compressor kicked in it was like sitting next to a large diesel truck). The resort grounds are very nice, a small army of landscapers are working non-stop to clean up palm branches and the like. There was never plant debris on the paved paths. Lots of flowers and trees make up the very nice grounds. Likewise, there is a ton of beach space although it is not really swimming worthy. The resort is surrounded by an ocean lagoon, and the shallows are weedy and green. Lots of sand for digging, suggests this would be a great place for young families looking for quiet beach time. The rooms are average, and the place is showing its age. I spotted a number of rotted lintels or California roofs on rooms, and there was lots of wood in need of fresh paint. I know this humid climate is tough on wood. We were shocked when we finally figured out that the deep blue colour of the pond water is because it has been dyed that colour\u2026along with the feet of many of the ducks (a real surprise for California). The staff were all wonderful and eager to help. I did get a bit tired at the excessive apologizing when I complained, but maybe that is a US thing. One apology is good, then do something to fix the problem \u2013 apologizing six times and doing nothing is just frustrating. Nevertheless, everyone I encountered was eager to help out. We ate several meals at the Barefoot bar and grill, and found the food quality quite good if a bit pricey. The service was very good. I have some criticisms, which may seem picky at first. Considering we\u2019re paying something like US$250 per night, I didn\u2019t think my expectations were unreasonable. I\u2019ve stayed at much cheaper places that had much better facilities. The facility charges an added $17 per night which is intended to remove the incremental charges for recreation, well, for some recreation. One benefit is internet access. Problem 1: after 45 minutes on the phone with their tech support people, I still could not get wireless access in our room. When I complained I was told I could get wireless in the lobby, and they gave us a $30 credit. 2: after being out all day (8 am to 8 pm) we returned to find housekeeping had not been through our room. I phoned for extra towels, which were brought by in 30 min. When I asked the next day that housekeeping please stop in as they had missed us, I got multiple apologies but that was it. 3: Looking to print out boarding passes on our departure, I discovered that the only guest printer requires a credit card swipe, with $5 charge for 5 minutes internet plus $1 per page printed. That last one really got me, as I can\u2019t recall ever being in a place that charged for internet use and printing. 4: (a small one) housekeeping made up our room and threw out the one bar of soap without replacing it. 5: I did not check to see if the power was on, but found an exposed outlet and in a different location a light fixture in the gardens with bare wires exposed just adjacent to the path. 6: one day we rented bikes for 4 hours to take a trip down the ocean-side. Cost was $12 per hour ($36 for 4 hours). I was surprised to find similar bikes for rent along the beach for $16 for 4 hours, which reflects the overall high price of everything on the resort. 7: The water taxi to Sea World is a great bonus (for a $9 round-trip ticket), but you need to have pre-purchased tickets for Sea World (we didn\u2019t but had San Diego Go Cards which got us full admission). After being told that was fine at the store the night before, a rather patronizing ex-pat brit boat captain the next morning said we might have problems. He then apologized profusely to the Sea World person that met us while we were standing next to him, leaving us feeling rather embarrassed. They should get their story straight and remember that the customers are the ones riding on the boat, not the Sea World staffer. We made the decision to not rent a car, which was our mistake (trying to really get away from it all). You are very captive to the resort. Public transit passes by every 20 minutes or so (except on Sundays), with the alternate being a cab ride into Old Town for about $20. If we had a car we would have purchased most of our daily use supplies (drinks & snacks) at a local grocery and saved over the much higher costs at the local Island Market (like $12 for a six-pack of Bud). If we returned I would either opt for a downtown hotel, or rent a car for the whole period. A rental car would allow for accessing cheaper activities like bike rentals off-site. Public transit worked well, and we met some really neat locals while riding. Overall I would rate the place as average, but would consider staying here again (with some better preparation, like renting a car). If I did it would be with downgraded expectations, that would not set me up for such disappointment.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muscatine, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat family place\u201d", "Author": "53reba", "ReviewID": "UR127065672", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a week at Paradise Point Resort.

One afternoon we had lunch at the bare foot restaurant out side, they had heaters to keep you warm which was nice. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad ($15ish) and it was awful, tasted like instead of making a dressing they just used straight mayo. Sick! My husband ordered a burger which is hard to mess up and he said it was fine nothing special. The other two couples we were there with were also not impressed with the quality of their meals in comparison to the cost. When our bill came, we asked our waiter to split it between the three couples, and he then asked us to total up our own bills and just give him cards to charge. Sorry but isn't that HIS job? Overall for expectation of high quality, fine dining at the resort you would think that they would make sure to hire ONLY the most competent people to assist their guests. That was very clearly not the case. In the gift shop there were people all over the store and a huge line of people to pay for items and only ONE person checking them out....

One day we decided to take the water taxi over to sea world which was great, and a fun way to arrive at the park. Only downside to that is that if you want to use the shuttle to come back it only comes back at 5 &6 pm, so you have to be there all day. Which was fine, but it would have been nice to use it to come back earlier.

I have to admit like others after reading some of the negative comments that I was unsure about my choice BUT please remember everybody has different opinions! I have to say I was mesmerized as we drove onto the grounds and found such beauty! We were greeted by Ben who was super!! Diego at the front desk was amazing, great comps, again Thank you!!! When we arrived in our room, which were upgraded to, we opened our patio door the the view and had ducks waiting for us (ok I am a sucker for furry friends.) We also had a very nice card and a basket of fruit waiting for us. We enjoyed our first evening by the pool and hot tub, right outside our room. Again amazing! The next day we grabbed our coffee and scones at the coffee shop and again, staff superb! Headed off for a road trip to Joshua Tree..long drive but beautiful, despite the wind and extremely windy road on the way back, but what and adventure! when we got back to our room we had a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of wine waiting for us, courtesy of our daughter and son in-law! Called the front desk for a cork screw, not realizing one was laying on the table...arrived in 2 minutes! Cannot ask for better service. So if you are ever in the area I would highly recommend Paradise Point. The amenities as super and the staff are just as awesome. Yes there is a resort fee of $17 and there is a parking fee of $32 a day, but have you checked out some other places? Our original plans were to go to Vegas, hmmm, can you say resort fees...I will take these fees and get an awesome stay, great beaches, at a very classy resort!!

Knowing that San Diego was our destination, we started looking around for properties to spend our 5 nights and 6 days. To be honest, we also were a bit apprehensive by the negative remarks made by some reviewers, so we looked for a bit at the Hilton by the Bay, and a couple of others. However, after some discussions, we decided to go with our instinct, realizing that there will ALWAYS be unhappy people out there, quick to nit-pick every last detail, and those whose standards are just ridiculously unattainable. THANK GOD we listened to our inner voice. From the moment we turned the corner on Vacation Drive, we knew we had arrived at our home for a week. Pulling up to the valet, we were greeted by the main man, Marc Garner, who quickly became our SD guru of all things. We cannot say enough amazing things about the staff at PP, from the valet, cleaning crew, grounds keepers, room service, spa staff, bar and restaurant crew, and management. The GM of the property has a kind, compassionate group of extraordinary people working for him, who go out of their way to make the guests at this resort feel as if you are the only people they are there to take care of. But we MUST give extra props to our guy Marc..... He's a gem.... We will certainly come back and he is one of the main reasons why. Our bungalow on the beach was a sweet little apartment, very clean, with a immediate beach access and a fire pit steps away. We ended up meeting some incredible people the first night we were there and met up a few more times throughout the week.... A nice community feel if you're up for that, but no pressure if you're not. The grounds themselves made you feel as though you were on an island of a combination of Tahiti, Figi, and Hawaii. Bikes to ride, mini golf to play, multiple pools to swim in, (including an adults-only pool), spa to relax in, bars on the water to let loose, a phenomenal restaurant to dine at, trails to walk, and beachfront to get lost on. And this is all just on the property. Rent a car if you'd like to get our and explore. Head to the San Diego Zoo and be sure NOT to miss Balboa Park. Go to Ocean Beach, Pacific Beach, Mission Bay, Belmont Park, head down to La Jolla and see the seals, then make a reservation at either George's and have the carrot cake for dessert or stop in at Crabcatcher.

More on that later... We were Priceline customers and they treated us well (not differently as other hotels do). Front desk was friendly- as soon as she started registering us, I asked if it was possible to get a room with a view. They were all sold out but she did give us a room VERY close to the bay! Such a lovely view! The front desk girl told us that she was going to initially put us in a room with a parking lot view- it pays to ASK for a nicer room & they do accommodate so make sure you ask! The room itself- or what it really is, a bungalow- was a decent size. One big room with 2 bed and a separate area for sink and bathroom with tub and toilet. Yes, the room was old and did look dated. No, the beds weren't as comfortable as one would hope (too soft, slightly saggy?). BUT we did only pay $80 a night so absolutely no complaining here. The room was clean and you could tell attempts were made to make it look well-kept. There was a small safe in the \"closet\" area and that's always appreciated. Oh, make sure you bring slippers or flip flops to wear around the place! Even though the weather was warm, the floor was COLD and hard on our feet! The \"amenities\"- we were charged $15 nt for resort amenities (it's since gone up to $17 I believe). We were gone for most of the 3 days were there (to the Zoo, SeaWorld, etc) so didn't get to utilize the amenities as much as we could have. We were close to the main pool and it looked nice. We did get a chance to play mini-golf and that was fun for our 7 yr old (it's just a small course spread out around the resort). I know you could rent bikes but we didn't want to fork over $25/hr. And the spa seemed to offer a lot of interesting services but, again, didn't want to be spending the big bucks on those (they weren't cheap!) Lastly, we did end up getting up room service one evening and it was VERY expensive! We ordered 2 burgers w/ fries and a small pizza for our kid. On top of the food, they charged us $5 for room service + tip (it was either !5% or 20%- can't remember) so I think we paid something ridiculous like $65 for this meal!! Bit pricey IMO. Back to the vehicle point... we didn't rent one and kicked ourselves the whole time we were there! It seemed every one else had one, though. Smart people. The resort is on it's own little \"island\" and there's nothing around. I mean nothing. No pharmacy or fast food joint. Which could be nice if we had a vehicle to jump in and drive to these places. We did walk to SeaWorld- took about 25-30 minutes from our room to the front gate. It's just over the small bridge but it was hot and we were a bit tired by the time we got there. On the way back, we cabbed it because we were tired from walking around all day. Now, cab prices. It cost us about $10 one way from SeaWorld to the resort. Not too bad. But the next day we went to the Zoo and I think it cost us about $25 one way. Rent a vehicle!! Yes, most likely you'd have to pay for the parking at the resort which I hear is like $30 night but the inconvenience of it all... esp if you're bringing kids- not worth it. First you have to call a cab, wait for the cab, pay the cab- on the way back, same deal. We did ask about buses but it was going to take us 3x the time to get where we wanted and it did not appear to be easy at all. With a kid, this would've been a nightmare so we abandoned that idea. If you're going to the resort simply to enjoy the lovely views and all it's amenities, and don't plan on leaving at all, then don't get a car. But if you want to be able to even leave to get a meal outside the resort, I think you'll want to ensure you have a vehicle. Last thoughts... the resort is very peaceful and laid out so nicely. Lovely views, ducks everywhere, little ponds, chairs set out to read by the views, golf cart escorts... really quite quaint and reminds one of another era. We'd never been anywhere like this (in North America) and were a little awed by the size and greenery. Nice place if you want quiet time or a romantic getaway or even to take the kids away for some fun. It seemed it would suit a whole demographic of people. I just don't think I'd pay the \"regular\" prices during high season.

We had a good stay but I just find that it doesn\u2019t deserve the 4* when I compare it to some other 4* properties (I have Westins and Hiltons in mind). The staff at the reception is pleasant, the ladies from housekeeping are adorable but the valet was not so helpful. We were supposed to get a map of the resort from him but we never did, so I\u2019m sure we missed out on a lot of areas of the resort. When you arrive at the resort, you definitely feel somewhere exotic, the landscape is really nicely done. The room. We got room 146 which was garden view\u2026 well it was more of a neighbor\u2019s view. Our bungalow was facing another one and there is not so much space between them so if you keep your curtains open, you can see right inside your neighbor\u2019s bungalow. In order to keep our privacy we had to keep our curtains closed at all times: quite a shame when you come all the way from Canada to see the sun! We could see that the room had been updated, but in a very superficial way: the furniture is nice, the colors are contemporary but when you look closely, the drywall was not updated as it is uneven, the windows are very old and don\u2019t do well with condensation and the worst part was the bathroom. The sink area is ok, with its granite counter but the bathtub/WC area looks as bad as a Motel6 bathroom. The white tiling and grout looks really dated and they put a very cheap shower curtain, the same kind I had in a Motel6. If you want to be a 4*, have glass doors to the tub and nice fixtures\u2026 I did appreciate the soap/shampoo/conditioner dispenser, as it is way more environmental friendly. The towels were horrible: when I go to a 4*, I like to think I will get nice white plush bath towels in which I can just curl up after a bath, well not here. It almost feels like you\u2019re getting a body scrub when you use them! The bed was great, we slept very well, it might be on the firm side, but we didn\u2019t mind. There is a ton of storage if you are going to stay there several days and you have an actual walk-in closet. The mildew smell is very unpleasant at first, but if you turn on the A/C, you\u2019ll forget about it after a while. We did start having runny noses at the end of our stay, so that would be another reason for us not to stay there again. The resort. I can\u2019t say much about the resort itself as we didn\u2019t really hang out there. We went once to the hot tub behind our bungalow. We first wanted to go swim in the pool, but ducks were already swimming in that pool and it kind of grossed us out. The beach seemed ok, but we went to other beaches (Coronado and La Jolla). Food I cannot comment on the resort\u2019s restaurants, as we never had a meal there. What I REALLY DISLIKED were the fees. For 2 nights, we paid $97.78 in fees ON TOP of the room rate. That includes the parking fee of $32 and the resort fee of $17 plus the taxes. I usually never complain about the parking fee, especially in a city center; but here, you\u2019re definitely NOT in a city center and every single room has it\u2019s own parking space right in front of the door. So if the room is empty, that space will not be used by anybody else. I think the parking fee should just be included in the room rate. The resort fee is ridiculous and they probably know it because at check-in, they give you a whole booklet dedicated to justifying the resort fee and what it includes. It includes: internet, phone calls, fitness center, basketball, tennis, ping pong, croquet, horseshoes and bocce ball. It\u2019s probably a great deal when you use everything but we didn\u2019t and would have appreciated the possibility to opt out of this service. All in all I wasn\u2019t that disappointed because I did not have high expectations AND because we only paid $70 for our room through Priceline. It\u2019s maybe worth the $70 + $35 parking + $17 resort fee + tax but I\u2019m not even sure. It\u2019s definitely NOT worth the $200+ official room rate (on top of which you will add the fees). I would not recommend that place but if you really do want to go there, please find some way to get your room cheap and you\u2019ll be less disappointed.

I would have even considered this a steal if only the resort fee were levied. For the excessive parking fee of $32 per night (I paid $22 per night at my hotel downtown--where parking is actually at a premium) one of the resorts work trucks parked in my reserved spot during the second day I was there. Luckily I had rented a car, because if not I would have been miserable. The resort is very secluded from any other restaurants, shops, or bars other than the overpriced ones they have onsite ($30 for pasta w/no meat and happy hour priced beer), and as a solo traveler it was not ideal. The actual room was fine. I see a lot of terrible reviews on here about the rooms but I did not experience any issue with bugs or any smell, although I was not in a bay front room. It definitely wasn't luxury, but it was far from a hostel as someone suggested. (Though the towels were awful). The area and views were quite lovely as were the pool areas (an adults only pool was key).

A huge part of our enjoyment was due to the fact that we LOVED our room!!! We had a Bayside Bungalow in Paradise Cove and the room was smack on the sand looking out on the beautiful bay with a fire pit right outside our room for nightly s'more making! The water on the bay was very tranquil, which allowed my husband and I to actually be able to sit on the sand and relax without worrying about our 2 year old running into the waves. It was a dream! The girls had so much fun playing on the beach and we loved that we could put little one down for nap, and we could sit and read on the waterfront patio and watch our oldest on the sand playing on the beach. We also loved that there was so much to do! There were 4 pools that we could use (5 total on the resort - but 1 is adult only). My daughters loved picking a different pool to use each day, and to our surprise they actually liked going to the small ones vs. the big main pool, which was fine by us. All the pools had a graduated entry, so my two year old could wade and splash around, which I loved. This is a truly FAMILY-FRIENDLY resort. One day we rented a surrey bike and cruised around the property, which was a ton of fun, and we just had so much fun exploring the grounds. It is the type of place where once you check in, you don't really have to leave! But the great thing is that if you want to go \"off campus\" for an outing, the location is phenomenal as it is close to a ton of San Diego family attractions. The room itself was amazing. It had a kitchenette, dining table, and separate bedroom, so we could put the girls down to bed early and stay up later without disturbing them. The bathroom was also fabulously designed, as you could shut off the door and be able to use the bathroom without disturbing little ones as well. It was clean and beautifully decorated. Again, the Bayside Bungalows were AMAZING! We drove to the resort so we were able to pack our girls' scooters in the car, which was fun to let them cruise around on. And one night we played a little mini-golf which was close to our room. If you are looking for a family-friendly resort, this property had a ton of activities for all ages.

The Good: Very pretty grounds with lots to do and 2 restaurants Large rooms Pool and jacuzzi were nice The Bad: *Parking fee (for us it was $32, but I heard another person get charged $27. This was on top of Priceline fee.) *\"Passport\" Fee (this is $15/day per person on top of our Pricelined charges... would have been fine if we had arrived early enough to use the services or if we had just known that was a charge on top of the Priceline fee.) This fee is for using the grounds, like playing tennis/etc. The Annoying: When we arrived, we instantly liked the hotel and decided to ask them if we could stay another night for around the same price that we got on Priceline. We weren't expecting to win a bid on a hotel with so much to do (spa/tennis/ping pong/pools/etc.) so we thought we might like to stay another full day so we could actually enjoy the hotel instead of just sleeping there one night. The woman at the front desk was friendly but said she wouldn't be able to let me know until later that night or when the manager came in the next morning. I didn't hear from them in the morning, so I called the front desk. A different woman told me that she would need to check, but no matter what, she would call me right back. She did not. I finally decided to pack up our stuff and check out. We were disappointed to leave, and wondered why no one ever got back to us. The hotel did not seem very busy, we only saw a handful of people during our stay... an extra night seemed like it would work well for everyone, especially if we kept the same room. Upon check-out I was told that we couldn't have the room another night because there was a conference coming in and all the rooms were taken. I didn't believe this last-minute excuse because if all the rooms were booked, then why didn't they just say that when I first inquired? The woman at the front desk said she was sorry, but whenever I wanted to come back, she would make sure we were taken care of. Sadly, I don't think we'll be going back. It was a cute place and we were excited in the moment about spending the day in the spa and using the Passports for tennis, etc., but we wouldn't go out of our way to return. Tips: Ask for the parking fee to be waived. I just happened to read the reviews on Yelp and a few people mentioned the ridiculous parking fees.

PPR bills itself as AAA 4-diamonds, but the AAA tourbook only gives it 3. It was vastly overpriced for the quality: - The much-touted multimillion dollar renovations had the feel of being done on the cheap, just enough to be attractive at first glance, but actually pretty shabby upon closer inspection (chipped paint, unpatched drywall dents, falling-down mirrors, cheap mismatched door knobs, etc.) - The heater in 1 room was a very noisy wall unit from the 1970s (not central air) that roared loudly all night long - Only 2 pools were heated, the other 3 were not. - The main pool\u2019s hot tub was filthy \u2013 filled with brown, cloudy, murky water. - One of the first rooms we tried (we switched it to an \u201cexecutive suite\u201d at a significant upgrade fee) had broken curtain rods and many other cosmetic issues - The living room furniture was unmatched, and dirty (sofa cushions) - The furnishings included a broken mirror leaning (not hanging) against the wall, a rickety lounger that rocked when sat upon, and a filthy sofa (once green seat cushions turned brown with dirt) without any throw pillows to relax on. - The only shampoo was in a wall-mounted dispenser in the standalone shower, but no bottles for those using the tub (when we asked the maid, she said sorry, there wasn\u2019t any) - The bath towels were very uncomfortable \u2013 not soft and fluffy, but hard and uncomfortable, with weird, \u00bd\u201d wide \u201cribs\u201d that were annoying to the touch Think of an older, time-worn resort, with a superficial coat of make up.

We went to the zoo, seaport village (really neat place-highly recommend), at at Konos for breakfast a few times.. cheap, seat over looking the beach, and great food. Also enjoyed eating at the Fish Shop and Fat Fish grill. We also very much enjoyed Barefoot grill on the resort. Our waitor was awesome. Cute little bridge that connects to the marina..lots of fish and two little sharks on the water. Had breakfast there as well and then rented a paddle boat. We really enjoyed our vacation there. Not sure if I persobally would go there on peak season.. we were able to enjoy anything and everything without a crowd. I did not like the bed.. but my hubby and son didn't complain though. It was too hard for me because i'm a side sleeper. Room was clean but floors get very dirty when tracking in the sand.. they really should provide a matt for the doors that opne up to the beach.

We were initially pleasantly surprised when we checked in as we were told the room we booked was oversold and we would be getting a complimentary upgrade and in fact it was 2 levels (We booked the Lanai room and ended up with a Lagoon View). The room was pretty out dated. The easy things to upgrade (TV/alarm clock/internet) have been upgraded but the core structure of the room is in great need of attention. The heater/AC wall unit made a large amount of noise making it impractical to use when sleeping, the paint on the bathroom door had peeled in about 50% of the area and they simply repainted it (leaving behind all the markings where the paint had peeled and looking very lazy/tacky). In addition, the walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors TV prior to going to bed and were again awaken by their TV at 5:45am. The package \"included\" breakfast at their bar. The inclusion is really a $36 credit to your room for breakfast. For 2 people, you can exceed the $36 cap quite easily ordering a plate and juices (we only had coffee which was a little cheaper). So depending on what you order, breakfast is really \"mostly included.\" Finally, the resort charges $28/night for parking. This happened to be included with our package but is astronomical! Not to mention there are plenty of spaces (one space reserved for each room plus a large general parking area). Our room charge for 1 night was $260. We will most definitely choose another location next time we vacation in San Diego as we were sorely disappointed. For that rate, I expect more modern, more private (not hearing the neighbors noise) accommodations. Quite honestly a Hampton Inn or similar would have likely been much better at roughly half the price (breakfast still included).", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn", "Title": "\u201cExcellent resort!

Unfortunately we were only there for one night, when going to check out colleges in the San Diego area. Paradise Point is an easy spot to stay when touring UCSD, USD and/or San Diego State. WOW. Paradise Point really is a stand-alone destination. You get off the freeway, and wend your way (five - seven minutes?) to the long driveway that takes you onto the island, then wind around to the reception area/lobby. Extremely nice staff, very cordial in spite of our cut-rate room price, gently confirmed the bad news (I already knew about from TripAdvisor, thank you!) that parking was $28 (oh PLEASE) per night, and the non-waiveable \"resort fee\" was $15 additionally. IF one can negotiate the room charge, even with this additional cost of FORTY-THREE DOLLARS per night, this is still an outstanding value. Because we were occupied during the days and evening with college tours and family visits, we did not avail ourselves of any of the shops or restaurants or room service, so can't comment on the quality/value of those resources. Despite our bargain basement room charge, the very nice front desk clerk upgraded us (do they do this for everyone?) and we had a lovely lagoon-side spacious room with two queen-sized beds. The bathroom was a little dated, but clean and good-looking. Plenty of towels, good shower. Shower gel, shampoo and conditioner provided in stationary pumps in the bath, but no bar soap - only outside in sink/vanity area. Hardwood (or laminate) floors looked new in our room, with tropical/primitive wall art - kind of weird but added to the ambiance. We were awakened in the morning by the ducks and/or other birds squawking nearby, outside our room. Kind of cool, but stay away from the lagoon if you want to sleep in.

Some are overlooking the bay & are probably more appealing but ours was basic, the bathroom was very small, the heat/air conditioning is from a wall unit, the tv wasn't a clear picture & the menu function option didn't work. The room had the odor of an old hotel room although it appeared clean. There was a sitting area with a couch & coffee table so other than the bathroom the size was fine. The hotel itself is motel style in which if your room isn't facing the bay you will have cars driving past to get to their rooms. I travel to SD frequently to visit my college age daughter and I've tried many hotels in the area.

Once in the lobby you begin to question your choice. I'll start by saying We were 3 adults meeting for a reunion from different parts of the country. When you arrive the front desk service is excellent and accommidating, the lobby has that odor of a classic older hotel without the charm. Our first room was terrible, looked as if it were once a confrence room with funky sliding wall dividers perminantly attached to the wall and a very awkward floor plan, as well it was next to a convention facility and on a court yard that seemed to be grand central for a wedding and a multitude of kids. We asked to be moved to a more private location and were accomidated immediately. The rooms are nothing like the web sight, furnishing are old and a mismash of african looking decor. The sofa sleeper is terrible and any remodeling since the 70's was new floor tile and paint. The grounds are wonderful and if you have a family there are sand beaches, pools and endless amenities to keep kids busy. Be prepared for additional costs, 25$ night to park and 15-25 a night for use of the amenities (not an option) so why not just include it in the price and not look deceptive. Resaurants are nice but expensive and there are boat and watercraft rentals. You will be 15 minutes to everything, old town, gas lamp, seaworld, zoo, airport and downtown. If you are an adult looking for a special experience ask for a bayside view as 80% of the units have a view of a grassy courtyard, small plantless pond or a hedge. The baysides seem great and much more private. Overall, if you are a family looking for a resort experience you will not be disappointed, if you are adults looking for a private getaway it's a toss up, depending on the room you get.

We put on are reservation a request for a room with the best view possible for the room we were getting. Paradise point did a great job, we had a bayfront view steps away from the sand. At night we sat on the patio drinking wine and listening to music while watching the beautiful old fashion big paddle boat float in the bay, beautiful scenary especially sunset. The adult pool was great we practically had the jacuzzi to ourselves the whole time. I love that you park very close to your room. Did I mentioned we had just got married and this was our mini honeymoon, well paradise point had a staff member bring complimentary wine with chocolate covered strawberries to our room with such a nice card congratulating us on our marriage, i thought it was so nice of them. I loved that you call for a ride to get around the resort and can call from everywhere from the resturants, the pools, the island store etc. The rooms were very nice as well, we got a junior suite. You dont need to bring shampoo, conditioner or body wash ( unless you prefer a particular brand) because they dont supply you with those tiny bottles most places do, they have decent size refillable bottles in the shower, nice touch. the food was decent too. very nice atmoshere here cons: sooooo expensive!!! the prices are so ridculous, we spent alot and it as just us two and we didnt even do much, cant imagine a whole family.The resturants are extremely expensive $20+ plates, I suggest bringing snacks/drinks and microwavable food so you dont spend so much on food there, the room had a frig and microwave. The bike rentals our expensive as well, we paid for two hours but were tired by 30 minutes lol so returned it at 1 hour, they were very nice and refunded us back 1 hour since we didnt use that hour, with no hassle. Other than pools, bikes and food, not much do to there, but it was relaxing doing nothing for us both. I think the passport to paradise was a waste of money other than pool and parking that was included =/ You have to leave a $100 room deposit, but you dont get it back right away and it takes 5-10 business days after you leave to get it back =(..

Placing our reservations a month in advance, I decided to splurge and reserve the bay view junior suite. We arrive with an exhausted, nap-ready kid at 2PM; we were told that our room was not ready yet, we're given pool keys, and told that we could visit any of the resort's pools while we wait. I ask for our room # so that I we could park and visit the pool closest to our room... we're told that they could not disclose our room #. Huh? Things got worse from there. At 3:30, we were given the go ahead to check in. We picked up our room keys, opened the door, and discovered that we had been given a garden view suite, not the bay view I had reserved. Strike 2. Going to the front desk and requesting a new room at this point is untenable...our child is exhausted...we decide to speak with the front desk the next day. That night, after the boy went to sleep, my wife and I decide to enjoy a glass of wine and some quiet time. We discover that we're not alone...another tenant, a 2 inch long cockroach is sauntering across the floor. This roach was so big, that I could have either smashed him with a shoe or put a leash around him...he does go very well with the three spiders in the ceiling. Strike 3. The roach successfully dispatched, our wine drank, we decide to call it a night...did I mention that we had to go to the store to buy plastic cups to drink our wine because the wet bar in our suite had no cups, no plates, no silverware, nothing? We crawl into bed and discover a blood stain on our duvet. It's not an OJ Simpson sized blood stain, but large enough that the maid should have caught it...we feel the benefit of the doubt slowly shrinking away. Morning. Surprised the coffee maker works, I have my morning cup and climb into the shower. When I get out, I reach for a towel to dry myself only to discover that it is as soft as a roofing tile. Seriously some free beach towels we got at dodger stadium that we use to dry our dog are soft as silk compared with ones. After a big day we return during naptime (1:30 PM) only to discover that the maid hasn't made up our room yet...so, off to the pool we go while we wait for housekeeping. Strike #?? I've lost count. My lovely bride stays with the boy (and her cocktail) at the pool while I visit the front desk to discuss my first day at PP. The guy at the front desk promises the maid will be earlier tomorrow, to report the insect infestation, and that the OJ duvet will be replaced. And the bayview room? He tells me that we got a free UPGRADE from a Bayview Junior Suite to a Garden View Suite. How thoughtful. It would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted this generous upgrade. Day 3. The towels are still exfoliating me, housekeeping had finished by the time we returned from Seaworld, and no signs of any other 6 or 8 leg co-tenants...maybe they're turning this thing around? Fat chance. That night we ordered an early dinner so we would have time to make smores at the fire pit in the main pool area with our son. We arrive at the fire pit at 7:30 PM. No fire. A couple sitting nearby tell us that they have already put in a request to have the fire lit. Not taking any chances I go to the front desk. The woman behind the desk tells me that she'll \"put in a request for the service.\" When I ask her what that means, she tells me that she punches in the request in the computer which will cause someone to show up \"soon.\" Not very reassuring. 7:45 PM. No fire. I return to the front desk. This time there are three parties ahead of me checking in. The woman at the front desk knows why I'm there, but she pretends she doesn't see me to make me wait. When I get to the front of the line, she explains that she doesn't know why the fire hasn't been lit yet. I suggest, impatiently, that perhaps she should pick up the phone and call someone. Her manager beckons me, promises she'll have someone there right away. 8:15 PM. Still no fire. My son is doing his best at waiting patiently for smores. I am no longer patient. So I bring him and his marshmallow laden stick to the front desk. The women there still have no answer for the delay, and seemingly no empathy for my problem. Exasperated, on my way out, I tell them to \"light the damn fire pit.\" The manager behind the front desk threatens to evict me. Unreal. 8:30 PM. We talk with a security guard walking through the main pool area. He gets on his radio. The fire pit is lit within five minutes. Was that so hard? 10:00 PM. We decide to crawl into bed for our final night at the hotel. We pull down the sheets and see the familiar blood stain on the bedspread.

We nearly didn't book here given some of the earlier negative comments (especially regarding cleanliness) but I'm very pleased that we did. We are avid travellers having been to every continent and would say that our experience stood up to standards set by similar luxury resorts around the world. Having clearly also stayed at the same time as some of the negative reviews below (during the power outage) perhaps we were lucky, but I'd like to offer our positive views to provide some balance. Our first impression which lasted throughout our stay, was that this was a luxury resort with beautifully kept grounds, amenities and rooms. We were in a Lanai Garden King room which had a serene private patio overlooking a pond. Although probably towards the bottom of the rooming price range, our room was mopped every day, towels were changed when needed and after leaving a polite request for our housekeeper, extra complimentary coffee was left for us. We were very close to the waterfall pool which suited us as it was very quiet. Although I agree that the main pool did look murky, I don't think it could have been as dirty as alleged in previous emails if it was treated the same as the waterfall pool - the latter was attended to every day at regular intervals by a legion of staff. I do agree that the additional daily parking and the 'passport' resort fee were annoying but this was made clear at booking so we computed it into the cost of the holiday. Unlike many all-inclusive holidays elsewhere there are relatively few activities which are complimentary so be careful as extras can add up. We took out a sailboat from the marina for 4 hours and we didn't feel the charge of $30 per hour was unreasonable. We chose to pay the $28 daily parking fee and keep our hire car as it provided us with freedom to eat out and see San Diego which we preferred. Without this you would be pretty much committed to eating every meal in the hotel and in fact we didn't do so once as there are so many restaurants within a short driving distance. We felt that we did more than offset the parking fee by buying in both breakfast and lunch items from a local supermarket and storing them in our spacious fridge. Contrary to an earlier comment, I was impressed by how the Paradise Point staff dealt with the power outage. Considering there was no electricity at all in California, and parts of Mexico and Arizona, I'm not sure how possibly they could have anticipated an outage of this magnitude or have been entirely prepared for it. Having said that they dealt with the situation admirably by keeping one restaurant open in running a series of gas barbecues and drinks in iced coolers. They managed to keep going until 8.30pm by which time most families with young children had been fed.

Upon checking in one of the rooms, there was an overwhelming smell of paint in the room, as if the walls had just been painted. We tried to air out the room for a few hours but the smell was too much. We called reception so that we could switch rooms and we were moved to another room about four to five doors away. When we entered our new room, it literally smelled like a wet dog or smelly shoes (not very pleasant). We found the room change frustrating because we were traveling as a group and did not want to be split up from our friends. We ended up staying in the new stinky smelling room after airing it out for two days because we did not want to be moved any further from our group. The other room which our friends were staying in smelled fine, no issues.

The reason why we felt that the resort fee was unnecessary is because we did not end up using any of the \"inclusions\" in this fee. (The fee includes the following activities: Bocce ball, croquet, ping pong, tennis, basketball, the fitness center and Wifi). The activities that we wanted to do, Miniature golf and the surrey ride were not included. The Surrey ride is $35 an hour which allowed all of us to ride together, four adults and two children riding in the basket on the front of the surrey. We really enjoyed the bike ride and would recommend doing it. The kids liked it the most. We also really enjoyed having a bonfire on the beach, on the last night of our stay. You can buy the wood and the items for making Smores in the resort gift shop or if you want a wider selection of snacks for your bonfire you can go to the store (Vons) a short distance away and buy your own items. Moving on to the interior of the rooms... We liked that the rooms had hardwood floors which is generally cleaner than carpeting. Unfortunately, the floors were not swept or cleaned during our stay! We had to literally wash our feet after walking on the floors, every time we walked barefoot in our room.That was both unecessary and quite annoying. The room includes a small refrigerator and coffeemaker. The beds were comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was good. There is a flat screen tv mounted to the wall which offers movie rentals for either $14 or $16 per rental, depending on how new the movie is. We must note that the tv reception was not good in either room. Several channels were quite fuzzy.If we were in our room more often, we would have found some of these issues unacceptable, especially for a hotel of this reputation. As we were rarely in our rooms, we didn't call attention to them. We did enjoy the grounds of the hotel. The landscaping is well done and pretty. The staff that we encountered were professional and nice. Although, we will note that some of the reception staff needs to be better informed of the check in process. Upon first checking in to the hotel, we were told that there would be $100 authorized on our credit cards for any misc. fees for each room (which is standard at hotels and wasn't an issue). Upon checking out of the hotel, my friend's card had the $100 held as previously mentioned but my card had $840 held. Not only was this unexpected, it was also very annoying to have to call the hotel after we had already left, in order to clarify the situation. I spoke with someone at the front desk, who said that the person who had checked us in should have told us that it was $100 authorized per NIGHT, not all together. This did not add up though, as we had stayed five nights, not eight plus and it was an odd amount held on my card, completely different from my friend's charge. Let me note that we didn't have any room charges, such as movie rentals or anything else that would have accounted for any charges. The staff member told me that the charge would come off in a few days. I did not make an issue about it, as the charge came off after about 4 days. It was simply an annoyance for me and a lack of training/communication on the part of the reception staff. All in all, our experience was average here. We would recommend this hotel on the basis of location, as it is so convenient to the beach and SeaWorld. Also, it is a short drive to the airport, Zoo and Old Town. Although,we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, it is not worth the full amount. Look for a package deal if you plan on staying here. *Tips for SeaWorld: We went to SeaWorld twice, using the two day pass that you can buy on the SW website. We really enjoyed the convenience of taking the water taxi from the resort even though it was pricey in comparison to parking at SeaWorld ($46 for four adults and two small children). It takes you to the back entrance of SeaWorld so that you are able to beat the lines and the quick trip over is relaxing. What we would recommend is: if you are visiting SeaWorld more than once: take the water taxi from the resort on the weekends when lines are the longest, park in the SW parking lot during the week when the wait is almost nonexistent (Parking is $14 a day or $19 for premium parking - i.e. Rows 1-6).

We did receive a free upgrade upon check-in to a bay front room, which was nice. The view was great from there. We rented a car, which was good considering that this hotel is completely secluded from any other businesses. The problem was that it was hard to get around the grounds in the car. There are very narrow roads, which are also the walkways for people. There are constantly DOZENS of golf carts with resort staff driving around. It was just really congested with all of the golf carts, vehicles, and people walking around in such narrow pathways. Some of the paths were one way, but some people seemed to completely ignore these signs, as they were pretty confusing, and there were people driving every which way. I guess I'm trying to say that a rental car is needed if you want to eat, shop, or see any actual beaches; however, navigating a car around the grounds can be quite difficult! The first night we went to the adult pool, and it was not heated. I called the front desk and was told that all pools were heated. We decided to go back two nights later and it was heated that time. The hot tub in the adult retreat was the only one that we could go to because the one in the main pool area was super dirty! We happened to be staying at the resort during the blackout in San Diego also. This was no fault of the resort at all, but they seemed very ill prepared for such an emergency. Food was made available for a short time. But while we were waiting in line to order, they announced that they wouldn't be serving any more food as it was getting \"too dark\". So if you were lucky enough to be in line early, you got supper, if not, you were turned away with no other options for the night. We ended up going back to our room and going to sleep and thankfully the power was restored in the night. I would have thought that they could have at least made snacks available to the guests. It was very frustrating to see all of these other people with food and then have the rest of us turned away with no other option. In the end we were charged $80 extra for parking our car and for a \"resort fee\" which covered extra activities that we never even used. This resort looks good in photos, and has some good qualities....the scenery is beautiful and the pools are nice. Our room was clean and towels were kept stocked. However, it should be much nicer for the price. The location is not convenient at all....especially if you want to get out and see San Diego. The beaches at the resort are on the bay and they were rocky and littered with bottles, towels from rooms, and trash. The fire pits were full of trash as well.

It was thirty years ago and the name of the resort was Vacation Village. My mom won two nights in a sales contest and this was one of the fanciest resorts we had ever experienced. My eyes widened as I gazed at the lagoons, tropical flowers and cabana-style one-story cottages. Located on 44-acres, the tropical island, situated on Mission Bay was filled with families riding bikes, building sand castles and swimming in the pools. I excitedly bounded out of the car and walked over to the lagoon filled with ducks and admired the observation tower. Many years later Princess Cruise Lines purchased the property when the popular television show, THE LOVE BOAT was one of the most watched television shows in America. Princess was going to sail to Mexican ports from the port of San Diego and package cruise and land vacations. Guests could cruise on their ships and stay overnight before or after the cruise at their resort. I never stayed at the San Diego Princess Resort, however in 1998, the resort was purchased by LaSalle Hotel Properties and one of San Diego\u2019s top vacation destinations was renamed Paradise Pointe. Since then, I\u2019ve been returning throughout the years. With one-mile of beachfront and 462 spacious rooms, the resort hasn\u2019t changed that much since my first visit. The decoration is more Balinese then I remember from the past. There are the Lanai Garden rooms with your choice of a King-size bed with a sleeper sofa or two Queen size beds. The semi private patio has two Adirondack chairs for reading a good book or sitting outside and enjoying a pre-dinner cocktail. The Garden Suites offer larger patios, walk-in closets and dining area with a wet bar. The Lanai Bay side offers nice views of Mission Bay and are situated near blazing fire pits for evening s\u2019mores. The Bayside Junior Suite Premium Lanai Suites offer more square footage, greater views and more amenities. One feels as if they are in Hawaii walking around the lush grounds. It\u2019s not the fanciest resort in San Diego and you will notice deferred maintenance, yet its fun for all ages. There are five pools sprinkled around the grounds. All the pools have been updated and the main pool near the lobby has a sandy beach. The family lagoon pool has a hot spa, as does the quieter adult lagoon pool. There is also a meadow and waterfall pool. The tennis/basketball/croquet and ping pong area are underused, however guests seem to enjoy renting Surrey bicycles and playing on the golf putting course. There are two excellent dining options. The Barefoot Bar and Grill is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner offering glorious views of the sailboats, kayaks and paddle boarders on Mission Bay. For dinner, the elegant Baleen Restaurant was my choice for a birthday celebration. Even though the night air can be chilly, the restaurant has outdoor heaters to keep guests comfortable while sitting on the patio overlooking the lights of Mission Bay. Paradise Pointe is a successful wedding spot with at least three weddings going strong during our one night visit over Labor Day weekend. Guests wanting to spend a day at Sea World can leave their car at their designated parking spot and hop on the Sea World Water Taxi at the dock. The 15-minute cruise will take guests right to the exclusive back gate.

We have previously stayed here twice before and it is one of our favourite places to visit. We are always a bit wary of going back to places we've loved before, in case they've changed (for the worse) since our previous trip. However, aside from a couple of minor niggles, we had another great stay here. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we love the resort feel. The location is very handy for all the San Diego attractions, and whilst you do need a car to get around, you can tell this from the location when booking. San Diego is also much nicer and easier to drive around than LA (for us Brits at least!) The rooms had been renovated since our last trip in 2007 and whilst the comments about the dusty floors did have some validity, overall we were very pleased with the standard of accommodation - after all, you're walking about in flip flops/sandals or barefoot, so you're bound to bring in a certain level of dust and dirt. We were given 'adjoining' rooms which basically meant that we had a bungalow to ourselves which was an ideal set up. The beds were huge - and high! Having fridges in both rooms and a microwave in one was also really handy. We loved being able to sit out on our patio and have breakfast overlooking the pond. It's a shame that they've changed the toiletries, as the old ones were lovely, although they've obviously wised up to everyone taking them home! The new ones are still really good though. We never had a problem getting sunbeds by the main pool, even if arriving in the afternoon after going out for the morning. Part of our Virgin package meant that we got free parking (always appreciated - especially when it's right outside the room), didn't have to pay the 'Passport to Paradise' fee and got $25 per room, per night resort credit - which equated to $350! It seems ironic that they are trying to introduce the mandatory 'passport' fee, but none of the staff around the resort seemed to know what to do with the slips of paper for mini golf, bike hire, etc. We were however able to enjoy two meals at the Barefoot Grill (including two free desserts for one meal) and two lunches by the pool with our resort credit and still had some leftover to treat ourselves with in the gift shop! The food at the Barefoot was delicious as usual, although we were slightly disappointed to see the menu had changed - we loved their Philly cheesesteaks and pulled pork!

However, Paradise Point offers a family vacation experience; with activities and tastes for all ages! For example: > Dive-in movie night: The kids splish, splash and see a favorite showing, while most parents, lounge poolside over catch-ups & cocktails. > Bonfires on the Beach: S'more's by the sea allows for nightly quality \"family time\" to connect over silly stories or games, in an unplugged beach setting. > Bungalows-All very comfortable with modern decor, updated amenities, and a \"front porch\" sitting area, on/or near the bay. > Food-Most resorts dumb-down their menu's to offer kid-fare; however, the meal options at Paradise Point, are more mature to satisfy adults, but still hold the interest of children. They do offer some of the typical, cheeseburger/chicken nugget staples, but also include more healthful fish, fruit and pasta options. **And, the outdoor restaurant on the bay is surrounded by streams of Koi and other sea life; which allows adults time to enjoy their own meals with a relaxing, almost tropical water view, while the kids are captivated in their surroundings. My nephews complained when we had to leave lunch, because they were having so much fun watching crabs crawl in the rocks and the sea birds steal fries from nearby vacant tables. > Grounds-The resort is not a Four Season's/Ritz caliber, however, there has been thought put into making the grounds feel like a get-away location. There are exotic florals/landscapes, \"wild\" marine life (ducks/birds/fish, etc.) roaming the property, and a quiet, serene feel throughout. > Activities-There are numerous on-site options such as boat/jet ski/paddlebike rentals, games, 3 pools (including an adult-only option) and beach sports. As well, SEA WORLD is a mile away, which is a fun alternative-especially, with the summer promotion of 2-day passes, which allows a more leisurely experience of the park. **There are a series of lagoons/lakes connected through the resort which are stocked with ducks and fish; armed with a box of crackers and left-over breakfast toast, my nephews and I spent 2 hours hand-feeding the critters and taking pictures. The ducks even started following us through the resort and the boys were thrilled with their new-found friends! *****Note: feed the ducks open handed, or you might get a slight nip. I have stayed at several kiddy hotels and always leave with either a headache, toothache, or purse-ache from all of the saccharine, screaming & spending! And, while Paradise Point is NOT cheap, there are mid-week less expensive and/or package options available. (If you sign up for their e-mail list, they send discount offers.)

As a side note: we wanted to come back to San Diego the next month for a quick getaway, and this place was a little too pricey being that it was June. I found the Hilton, across the street almost, and thought it was similar in features. We had such a terrible experience there that we checked out the next morning and I called Paradise Point.

It is a luxoirus resort so the cost should be somewhat expected but any food/acticities were very expensive. Also, they charge a 15/per day activity fee, which does not cover all the activities.

I was somewhat curious about the location since it was merely 10-15 minutes from the airport and didn't seem anything like the \"paradise\" promised on the website. We turned into the resort after traveling through a less than desirable looking part of the city and the scenery completely changed. The lush grounds opened up and we ended up in the middle of a different atmosphere. We were immediately greeted by one of the staff (Mark) and it was perhaps one of the best client service experiences I've ever had. From beginning to end he helped us unload, drove our car to our bungelow, made sure we were always taken care of. Big plus in my book. We had a series of bungalows that connected and sat alongside the \"beach\". Don't expect this to be the type of beach you see in other parts of San Diego, it doesn't appear to be made for swimming like beaches along the coast. It is located on the bay and the waters are calm and good for wading. Certainly an awesome view from our rooms though! Every morning we made sure to close our doors or the inhabitants would make their way into our rooms...so please, if you don't want ducks, geese and other wildlife in your room, keep your doors shut tight! We took advantage of the delivered s'mores kits and beach fire pits. Word of advice, these pits are first come first serve and most people tend to set up in the early AM and leave their things there all day which limits how many can enjoy the pits. We found that sharing with other families or couples would ensure at least some time at the pits. Rooms are spacious and decorated beautifully and all of our rooms had kitchenettes and living rooms. You can tell there have been major renovations and/or updates because the paint on the walls seems a little worn and repainted with several coats. Due to the style of the bungalow rooms, there doesn't appear to be central AC, units are featured in each room and it got a little stuffy during the day but nothing that couldn't be easily remedied. The grounds are amazing and makes for good walking after dinner or activities. The onsite dining options are varied. We ate at the casual restaurant Baleen's; service was so so, food was ok, drinks were good! During our stay, Prom was being held in one of the Ballrooms and they were having a blast! It was such fun to see all of the students dressed up and enjoying themselves. Overall, defintely a different type of hotel in an unexpected part of town.

I don't normally complain about service but my husband and I both found that the waitresses were more interested in flirting with the waiters than seeing to their guests. We ate here at different times of the day and found the behaviour exactly the same, perhaps they need a supervisor in charge. It is not cheap but not too extortionate. Lots of restaurants in San Diego so wouldn't really recommend it. We didn't try the Baleen restaurant because it was always empty and we like a bit of ambiance. The room was lovely and quite spacious. The bed was enormous and very comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and plenty of towels. We had to ask for extra coathangers as there was not enough. No problem, we had them within minutes. There are 3 pools, we didn't really use them but what we saw was really nice. They were clean. The grounds are very nice indeed and well kept. It is very relaxing. We walked everywhere and used public transport. We had no car and found this not to be a problem as the public transport is excellent. One word of caution, watch out for hidden charges. We were charged for the passport to paradise, even though we did not use any of the facilities. When I enquired about this, it was removed from the bill. However I was warned by the young lady at reception that if I return for another visit I would have to pay th $15 charge each day.

We kayaked the bay, rented a speedboat, smores at the firepits and swam in almost every pool onsite. Yes, it's not cheap....but nothing in the Mission Bay area is! The parking fee stinks, but it's the same price charged at all the hotels in the area. The $15 a night resort fee should just be included in the room price, but again these fees are the norm in that area :/ We ate one meal at the The Barefoot, the food was okay, the service was slow, I was enjoying my beer and the scenery so much I didn't care.

I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, and the ponds, gardens and walkways well maintained and great to walk- early in the am especially.

Lots for kids to explore and safe places to run around and play The spa is cozy and charming, one of the best parts of the hotel. Well trained therapists and a fantastic spa menu.

The sea bass dish was to die for, and the service was great, friendly but not intrusive. I was traveling alone, so I enjoyed the water view and atmosphere while dining there, sometimes it can feel a bit awkward when dining alone as I was, but not here.

The property itself has a wonderful curb appeal, and it does look like a tropical paradise, as long as you don't look at the area around the bungalows too closely. (the rooms are set in bungalows as opposed to a central hotel tower or building) This was our one family vacation for the year (we have 3 children - a 14 year old, a 12 year old and a 3 year old), and we arrived on July 3rd for a 5 night stay only to find that they wouldn't be able to check us in - the computers were down. They weren't keeping a list of who had arrived and was waiting to be checked in, so it was up to us to sit there in the lobby and wait until they were ready to check in again. They told my husband that we could go to the pool - as if that would somehow make us go away happy - but if we'd done that, there would have been no way to know that the computers were back up. Silly and a sign of poor management. As we were waiting - I was sitting in the car answering some email, and our car was hit by a bicyclist. We were parked, so yes - the bike hit us. I jumped up because the noise was really loud - and I saw someone riding away. So I got out of the car and proceeded to ask the person riding if there was damage - because he hit pretty hard. Well, I didn't see that a child was down on the ground beside our car (I was on the passenger side and this was on the drivers side). I felt horrible because my goodness, it was a child - and I have 3 of my own! As it turned out, the child was fine thank goodness - but the Bellman who had heard my initial reaction saw it fit to be extremely rude to me in the process. I didn't need that after having already been waiting for over an hour for their precious computer system to be up and running. Then another bellman passed by our car and I overheard him saying to another guest that the computers had already been down for a couple hours, that it happens all the time, and that he'd be surprised if people would be able to check in by morning. Seriously?!? Finally, two and a half hours later, the computers started working - but oddly - NO one working the front desk announced this to the people waiting. You had to go up to them and ask. By this time, my husband and I were very upset, and our children - including our three year old - were starving. As a way to appease us, the manager offered to comp our parking and cut our room rate in half the first night, which was very nice...if the room had actually been worth even the CUT rate. By this time, it was dark and yes - the tiki torches are a nice touch, and it did remind me of Hawaii. We get to our room, and the keys don't work. Annoying. We go back to the lobby - by car because the property is very spread out - get new keys, come back to the room, and they don't work again. At this point, I'm furious. My husband calls the lobby from his phone, explains the situation and they say they're going to send a bellman with new keys and he'll stay to make sure they work. 15 minutes later - we're still standing outside. Finally a security guy drives by in an electric car by chance, and he lets us into the room. About 5 minutes later a bellman shows up with new keys and presto - these work. As far as the room goes, it's nothing special, although it's a decent size. Two queen beds, a dry-bar area, a small table, a large dresser or credenza thing - a wall closet, small sink area outside the toilet and shower area - which had water damage on the walls that they'd tried to cover up with paint. Oh, no door to the sink area - just a slider door (that didn't work well) to the shower/toilet area, which also had mildew damage. Oh...and no carpet at all. Just a tile floor that was supposed to look like wood - and let me tell you, it was FILTHY. We'd shower, walk on the floor barefoot and our feet would be black afterward. We wore shoes the entire time, only to take them off when we'd get into bed. Gross. My husband was set that we were staying no matter what at this point, so we unhappily got dinner and got ourselves into bed for the night. The next day we got up and hoped for the best - we were planning to spend the day at the large family pool in the middle of the property, and I have to say - it was the one redeeming quality of this entire resort. We did eat breakfast at the Barefoot Bar, which truly needs to expand it's menu and include LUNCH type items that aren't $26.00. I don't even mind paying the money as much as I mind the lack of choices. There's one other true restaurant on the property called Baleen - we never ate there because they weren't able to accommodate us any time we requested a table. The afternoon was spent at the pool, which is also where we received our best service for the entire trip. The food was good, the drinks were good but of course resort-pricey, and the pool was a lot of fun for the kids. We headed back to our room about 3:30 to get ready for dinner, but lo and behold the housekeeping service never made it to our room. We decided to just get ready for dinner and call as we were leaving our room, which we did. After finding out that Baleen refuses to seat people unless you already have a reservation (and by the way - the restaurant was completely EMPTY when we arrived) - we ate at Barefoot Bar again. The food was so-so for dinner, but we made the best of it. Got back to the room after fireworks - 9:45ish - and once again, the room wasn't cleaned. We called yet again, and finally someone arrived to clean our room as my three year old was sleeping on my shoulder as I waited outside. It seemed to take quite a while - so we went around the backside of the bungalow to wait. Turns out, our housekeeper was taking a little TV break. We could see her watching The Bachelorette through our slider window!! As soon as she saw my kids looking at her, she closed our drapes, and we walked back to the front door to wait. As she walks out she tells us that she just washed the floor - so it was wet. This also gave us the opportunity to be able to see just exactly where she washed the floor - and let me tell you - she literally made one swipe past the beds, through to the bathroom, and that's about it. Disgusting. Next morning we get up, go about our day - come back to the hotel at about 7:30, and no, the room still wasn't cleaned. This time, when housekeeping arrives, we start asking questions - come to find out, they won't clean your room unless you specifically request it, or put a sign out that requests service. I've stayed in many resorts - never once have I had to ASK for housekeeping service. While the room was being cleaned, we decided to go to the pool near our room to swim. We get there to see that although there ARE lights in the pool and spa, they aren't turned on. That's a dangerous situation if I've ever seen one at night. It's not well-lit, and if someone like my three year old fell in and went to the bottom, we might not have seen her. We didn't stay long, just long enough to see a few people come, coolers in tow - to sit in the spa and drink beer. They were clearly drunk, and while I have no problem with people drinking, they were slurring their words and I wasn't comfortable with the kids there. I could go on and on. I should have realized when we booked that it was odd that there didn't seem to be a limit as to how many people you could have in your room. It was very clear that this was the type of place you come to party it up with as many people as you can pack in - and it's not high class - definitely not worth the $300+ per night tab they wanted for each room. Thanks Paradise Point - trust me when I say I'll be making sure to tell everyone I know about your \"fantastic\" service. Friends don't let friends (or strangers for that matter) stay here.

We are frequent travelers, taking around 3-5 vacations per year (please see my other reviews) we stay at the most luxurious hotels so I have a lot to compare to, and let\u2019s just say I wouldn\u2019t even recommend this hotel to my worst enemy, that would be too mean! Airport: The airport is very small, around 20 minutes from Paradise Point. We rented a car from enterprise, it was quick and easy. They had a bus waiting to take us to the nearest Enterprise location, and we were able to pick out our car. We had GPS so it was easy to get around, and the traffic is not bad at all in San Diego. Check-in: Our check in person was Gino, wasn\u2019t he pleasant\u2026.not. He first started with asking us to upgrade to the beach suite, I thought he was giving us a free upgrade for my bday, so I said is this for my birthday? And he goes No, we only have 1 left and it would be $150 extra per night (which we passed on). Also the Lobby smells like Mold, you will notice the entire resort smells like mold! We had a room right next to this filthy lagoon; this resort would be pretty if they kept it clean! Our room had a Full bed (which they call a queen), sleeper sofa, tiny bathroom, and a desk, the run and table were missing for the couch, what a basic room for 350 dollars per night, not microwave even! The next morning after sleeping in this tiny bed, I looked at my fianc\u00e9s travel documents, to see that he actually paid $30 extra per night for a king size bed. I called to speak with the manager Matt Quick, he apologized and said that he would switch us to a new room, and not make us pay for a parking for our 3 night stay. We switched rooms, the new room was bigger about 100 sqft or so, with the worst smell ever, it just hits you as you enter. The air conditioning was broken, the refrigerator did not work, our bathroom was covered in rust and mold (I took the quickest showers of my life there because I was so disgusted), but the bed was a king! We called about the air conditioner, and they replaced the entire thing right away. We actually left that day to LA and Disneyland so we did not have time to change rooms again, but there are no windows that open to get fresh air, just a patio door with no screen. There is Shampoo, Conditioner, Body Wash, Hair Dryer and Coffee Maker, no other amenities offered in the room besides the wireless internet that you will pay for when you check out. LA/Disneyland: The road trip was beautiful, we took the Pacific Hwy all the way there. It was only a 1 hr 45 minute drive to Anaheim where Disneyland is. We love Disneyworld, and we loved Disneyland just as much. We started at downtown Disney, $15 dollars to park there and only a short walk though to Disneyland. We ate at the ESPN Zone, which is our favorite. Disneyland also had a park called Adventure Park that we did not go to, but they have Tower of Terror, and a lot of fun roller coasters. The lines at Disneyland were very long, 80 minutes per ride; we only were able to go on 4! But the experience was well worth it. After Disneyland we met with a bunch of our friends that live in Manhattan Beach. We went to Hermosa Beach to have drinks and dance, The Shore was so much fun, great music and great crowd. We ended up staying out late, so we got a deal at a near Wyndham hotel for the night to sleep, even that hotel which was $100 dollars a night was nicer than Paradise Point; at least they had a microwave, working fridge, living area, and clean! Downtown San Diego: So beautiful! I wrote down a few hotels that were there that looked nice, Marriott Marquez, and the Omni. We ate at Lou & Mickies, the food was excellent, the service was good, and they had a wonderful wine list. And the price was not very high, for the two of us with wine our bill was $68 without tip. Next time we visit San Diego we will be staying downtown. Barefoot Grill: The first night of our trip we ate at the barefoot grill in the Paradise Point. What a disappointment. It was a 30 minute wait, and when we were seated we waited another 20 minutes for our waiter to come with our drinks. After we ordered, it was like he forgot about us, never came back for another 45 minutes, all we ordered was a burger and turkey wraps. We had to ask the bus boy to find him because we thought he might have gone home. Finally when he came back with our food, which was all seasoned with something that tasted similar to Dill, I ordered my free dessert that the hotel gave us tickets for. I had the S\u2019mores Chocolate Cake, and I must say that it was beyond delicious. Beach/Pool: The Beach is quiet, and it was nice to have right at the hotel, but it was filthy, there was trash, glass, sand flies everywhere. We decided to sit there for an hour, then head to the Adults only pool. We had a Friend who lives in San Diego come visit us for the day to lay by the pool, we are between the ages of 25-27. When we arrived, the \u2018security guard\u2019 asked for our ID\u2019s, we don\u2019t look like we are under 18 so it was ridiculous. Then I had my room key, since you need that to get into their gated pools and she still asked for my room number. Then when she saw that we only had 2 people on our reservations, but there were 3 of us, she told us our friend could not use the pool. So we were told to leave! I didn\u2019t even know what to say at this point. We just went back to the beach. Check Out: The day before we left I called for a late check out, and Stephanie informed me that I need to call back the day of our departure (our flight did not take off until 6pm). Typically this is not a problem for most hotels, they will give you an extra hour or two, especially if they do not have the facilities (shower, etc) to use. When I called the day of our departure, Stephanie answer, and I started asking for a late check out, literally before I finished my sentence, all she said was \u201cNO, we are booked, sorry!\u201d I said all we want is until 2:00 pm (check in time isn\u2019t until 4pm and It doesn\u2019t take over 30 minutes to clean a room and half the people arriving aren\u2019t arriving at 4pm anyways). After telling her all of the things we dealt with on this trip, the moldy smell, the broken air, fridge, and given a downgrade in the room, she said sorry you are disappointed but we don\u2019t make exceptions. I asked for her manager, and she was eager to get him on the phone. Matt Quick was the manager I spoke with again, and he did end up accommodating me 2:00pm request. So if you call, do not speak with Stephanie, she was horribly rude. I did inform her I would post her name on Tripadvisor for her rudeness and she said \u201cgo for it.\u201d At check out, we knew we would be charged the $15.00 fee for absolutely nothing, but it is not just $15 it is $15+Tax. They also charged us $25 per day for parking which Matt Quick said we would not be charged for. I did have her take that off the bill, we were just happy to check out! Overall, our experience was horrible, I read reviews before we left, but the resort looked so beautiful online and was so deceiving I ignored the bad reviews, I know better then that.

So I am writing this review so you may know the real dealings behind Paradise Point so more formative information can be conveyed to your clients. The only Paradise in this place is to the owners and stock holders. There is nothing free in this place and if you do decide to eat, lounge or use there facilities it will cost-not just a fair amount but they gouge you. A smoothie at the pool restaurant is $6 served in a small cup, bike rental for one hour is $25 and to play putt-putt in their make shift little course was $10 a person. I have stayed at many resorts and I don't mind paying a reasonable amount to play but that was ridiculous for what you got. Now let me tell you about the room, the room was very small and the bathroom was made at an angle which shortened one side. It was also connected to an adjoining room, you could hear everything that was going on in the other room-not very restful. The refrigerator barely worked and if you wanted a microwave it was an additional $25 a day. They tell you at check-in that you have this so-called passport which offers many free services compared to other resorts-its bogus. Once you check out, a hidden charge of $15 dollars is added to your bill for each day of your stay whether you used them or not. They also charge $25 dollars a day for parking which I new about but that is crap-there is parking every where available, just another means to rip you off. Now let me tell you about the service. My son and his girlfriend ordered a grill cheese and tomato soup entree from the Bare-Foot restaurant (it was a little cold outside) and it took a hour to receive their food, then instead of soup they gave him a cup of marinara sauce (spaghetti sauce). I questioned the waiter and he just blew me off like I didn't matter. The whole 5 day stay that I was there the pool was never cleaned. When I arrived, the bottom of the pool was covered with dirt and during our stay, it only got worse. Paradise Point is a big resort; however it only has 4 washing machine to accommodate hundreds of families-they are not even centrally located. they were located way on the other side of the resort and the only way to get there was by foot unless you were staying in that section. I was in San Diego for 9 days, I stayed at the Holiday in Express and the Sheraton by the Harbor. I got way more for my money- which by the way was half the price- at both these places. Free internet, refrigator, microwave, breakfast. The sheraton even had activities for the kids to do-we loved movies every night by the pool. The food at the Sheraton was reasonably priced with good portions. One last thing, I charged a plain coffee to my room one morning. it cost $4 and some change. When I checked out, I questioned a charge on my bill, they said some one charged $43 to my room from a coffee cart or something. They were accusing my kids of doing it. I assured them they didn't and I wanted to see the receipt. It took awhile but they found the receipt, they charged my room $43 for my regular coffee.

We arrived late, around 10:30p; front desk girl was very pleasant and fast to check us in, driving to our room the driveway was very dark, it looked like the campground in a horror movie. My wife and I were hungry so we call room service and were disapointed to find out it ends at 10pm, the person gave me the phone number of a place that delivers pizza late. Not a great dinner to start our weekend. I have read about the cleanliness problems in your rooms so the next morning I went into the bathroom first and was able to confirm there were hairs left from a previous guest to that room, I cleaned them before my wife could see them (she is picky). also I noticed several dents in the wall's paint that made the place look like it was very old and poorly maintained. We had planned to go out to san diego but after walking around to see the grounds the pools were so inviting that we decided to stay the whole day by the pool and then walking by the beach. It was beautiful. We also met our next door neighbors, a family with 4 kids, my wife and I were kind of embarrazed because we had been kind of loud the previous night and the bed's headboard is not mounted to the wall so it sounds like a drum against the thin walls. Hotel manager, please nail the headboards to the walls In the end I would recommend this hotel for a family vacation with the kids or with friends. I would not recommend for a romantic weekend (unless you're 60). I would also not recommend to people that I know as very picky or cleaniless obsesive.

The room was gorgeous and much bigger than we had expected. We spent hours sitting on our back patio watching the harbor and enjoying the sunset. The room itself did have a little bit of a musty/humid smell and feel to it but nothing that was really much of an inconvenience. The resort was very nice. There was a ton on the resort itself to do. The swimming pools and hot tubs were great. However, they did charge a $15 a day fee for a bunch of stuff that we had no interest in using. Also, there is a hefty nightly parking fee as well. If our fee hadnt been waived, we would have been charged an extra $25 a night. Those start to add up quite a bit. So be prepared to pay an bunch of extra when you check out.

We used various special offers (conference and credit card member rates), and got great deals on all our rooms for a 1-week stay. The rooms were spacious and fairly clean. Pools were adequate/small, and all the \"recreational\" activities included a sky-high deposit. Parking was close enough, but the roadways in the different villages are worse than a bumper car course! In truth, Paradise Point Resort reminded my family of an older Hawaiian hotel - insanely high rates for the ambiance, but no real substance or bang for your buck. A few times we took advantage of the water taxi to Sea World, which was fun and convenient enough, but honestly overpriced as the park tickets were sold at face value so there was no real 'savings' by buying from the resort. The nightly Sea World fireworks are fairly visible from the entrance to the resort and from the observation tower by the lobby. We also ate at the Barefoot Bar and Grill three different times (for breakfast, for drinks and appetizers, and ordered room service). This place is.... again, adequate. Serves a purpose, but you better bring your patience along with enough money to pay the bill. Food is subpar and service is slow, but it IS all delivered with a smile. My group of 7 people (ranging from ages 2 - 70) stayed in 3 adjoining rooms in the Hibiscus Village (where you see and hear EVERY car that enters and leaves the resort). Each room either had plumbing that leaked, tile that was uneven, missing door screens that let in huge mosquitos; and ALL the rooms had phones that didn't work right, hotel tv menus that never functioned (we couldn't even check out from our room!), and old fridges and microwaves that should have been replaced 5 years ago. Rooms were cleaned daily, but at various hours, and we never had the same maid twice. However, there were plenty of times when other cleaning staff dropped by to chat while the maid worked (while we were sitting outside with little kids, waiting for the room to be done!). Cleaning staff also drove their carts way too fast, all while chatting on their phones. The bathrooms were also very small and sparce, almost like a motel room bath (in fact, one of our rooms didn't even have a door closing off the bath/toilet area from the sink!). For as much as the grounds staff mowed the grass (which we could hear for hours and hours in the afternoons - NOT at all a quiet and tranquil resort!), there were huge spiderwebs everywhere - on the flowers, all over the patio furniture, along the gates, etc. Seriously? THIS is what the resort is charging almost $400 a night for?!??! If you're still going to book at this resort after reading these reviews, do yourself a favor and make sure you snag a good deal from Priceline or Expedia. By no means is Paradise Point Resort a bad place, there are just much better and smarter options for spending your money if you do your homework.

Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff who were eager to make our stay special. After a short conversation with the woman who checked us in, we were given a generous upgrade of our reserved room, and managed flexibility with the parking fee. This left us with a good initial impression of the resort. The young man who showed us to our room was also very friendly, and extended himself as a resource during our stay. We were quite impressed with the aesthetics and location of the room, as it sat facing bay with two Adirondack style chairs on the linai. There was a small private beach with fire pits, and while we didn't use them, we did benefit from the smells of the fire enjoyed by the other guests. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The food was above average, as well as the service. The only aspect that we could offer some constructive criticism towards is that there seems to be some lacking in the attention to detail. For example, doors were difficult to open, fireplace in room had very low flames, beer can left on linai from previous guests filled with ashes and cigarette butts, somewhat non-thorough room cleaning. We only say this, because we feel this place has too much potential for these kind of things to be overlooked. We really thought the staff and grounds were wonderful overall. If something was not to our liking, we have to say they were responsive and wanted to correct any problems. We would return and recommend a stay without hesitation.

This place used to be called Vacation Village which were (and still are) a bunch of brick boxes situated in tropical-style landscaping. I wish I knew this; I was expecting an actual hotel especially because of the pics, rating, and price. The rooms were \"renovated\" but that only means a new coat of paint and furniture. We reserved a bayside room but upon check-in they said they didn't have any available and that Orbitz overbooked it (I've never had that happen before). Therefore they gave us the executive suite that was large but had a slow-draining sink, 30 year old fridge, a microwave from the 1960's, slow-flowing shower, smelly sheets, hair & crumbs on the carpet, creaky bed, squeaky door hinges, thin walls, and a slight musty smell. Had I known this was a bunch of brick boxes from the sixties that had a new coat of paint I would have gone elsewhere. Ya, the grounds are nice and there are a bunch of pools and some activities for the kids but those are the only redeeming qualities but definitely not worth the price. I don't know how so many people can give this place such high ratings. Maybe they think brick-box rooms and superficial renovations are luxurious, but it absolutely does not justify the price. If this place was going for $100 - $150 per night and if I knew these were brick boxes instead of an actual hotel I wouldn't complain. Oh ya, parking is $25 bucks per day to park next to your room and there is a $15 per day mandatory resort fee (when you check-in they hand you this \"passport to paradise\" showing how the pools, internet, gym are free but they didn't tell us about the $15 per day fee, but it's not like you have a choice). You'd think for the price per room all of this would be included but it's not. Bottom line: I feel misled. I wish I knew these were 1960's brick-boxes with new paint. And all the high ratings for this place really surprise me. I don't know if they're reviewing the same place or have different standards of what luxury and resort means.

One of the appeals was that this was not a traditional \"box\" hotel. Each room is ground level and in singles and groups of two and four rooms, bungalow like. The property sprawls over 44 acres and it is VERY easy to get turned around. I got lost several times, especially at night while driving, since some of the signs were not well lit and obscured by foliage. I had a large bungalow facing one of the lagoons. It had a bedroom, walk in closet, full bath, separate sitting room, dining table and chairs, and a kitchenette with a microwave, sink and mini-fridge. My biggest disappointment was the bathroom and the bath amenities. For as much as one is paying for the stay, having shampoo, soap and conditioner on wall dispensers is kind of gauche. Housekeeping did a decent job although it was not as consistent as I would have liked. I didn't have issues with bugs, although there were a few flies and moths that got in while I had the door open. The rooms open directly outside, so this is going to happen. This is truly a resort hotel, not necessarily one for a business traveler. The wireless Internet was hit and miss and the wired connection was next to the plasma TV. There wasn't a desk, so I had some challenges taking care of business while I was here. The restaurants are a hit and miss on service. Baleen is expensive but has a decent menu. I recommend eating outside if the weather is pleasant, especially when the sun begins to set. Again, higher prices but the quality is there. The bar/lounge is OK and where I had the most issue with service. It took a while to get seated. The first time I was there, the waiter seemed to forget about me in favor of a larger group. The second time, I ate at the bar and it was much better. Again, this is a resort hotel. You pay for everything, including parking, which can be wonky with the numbered spots. This is away from San Diego proper -- about 15 minutes from the Gaslamp District -- but there are a few restaurants close by that are good if you want to take a break from eating at the resort. The biggest drawback is that the property is spread out so much and it's easy to get lost. Some of my group were concerned about walking alone late at night. The biggest plus for the property is the bell staff who have golf carts to help you with your luggage and to direct you to your room.

The plants, trees and flowers throughout the resort were beautiful, reminding us of a tropical paradise. Even though we stayed over Memorial Day weekend, the resort did not seem crowded or noisy. When we walked to the island market or by one of the swimming pools, we noticed a lot of people, but the way the bungalows are laid out on the property, it makes you feel somewhat private and isolated, which we liked. We had a garden room which is not along the beachfront, but the beach was just a short walk away. Our room did have a lagoon off our patio, with a cute family of ducks that came by several times a day to see if we happened to have treats for them, which we had purchased at the island market! The view from our patio was peaceful and beautiful. We ate twice at the Barefoot Bar & Grill; the service and food was wonderful! The gentleman at the Coffee Bar was great also! We called the concierge for tourist advice several times, and they were very helpful. The bell staff was informative and welcoming, especially Fernando, who greeted us every morning with a warm hello when we arrived at the main resort area. Everyone working at Paradise Point appears to LOVE their job! The only negative feeling we had was regarding transportation. We were wishing the resort had a shuttle service to transport guests to the downtown area at least, because we ended up spending a lot of money on taxi service. We attempted to take the local city transportation system with a $5 per day pass. The price was right, but it took us 90 minutes of bus and trolley riding to get to the zoo. The city bus driver was less than helpful and not very friendly. We ended up walking around the transit station for a while until we found a transit official who offered us a map and further information. This does not reflect poorly on the resort, but made us wish Paradise Point offered a shuttle service.

Having never been to the area, we chose Paradise Point because it looked cozy and seemed like a safe bet for a nice room and facilities. Plus, we were traveling over Memorial Day weekend, and I'd heard the beach areas got very busy. The private beaches and marina seemed promising. Our room was a regular garden view with king bed. It was nice enough, but nothing extraordinary. There was a coffee pot, a safe and a small, dorm-sized fridge, which we didn't discover until our last day because it was designed to look like a door on the desk. Had we actually used the fridge, it would have been nice to have a microwave available, but there was not one. The best part of our stay, hands down, was the room service. We ordered breakfast every morning, and I was skeptical about the prices being a good value...but they were. Everything we order was delicious, they were quickly delivered, and the portions were huge. Two of the days, we didn't even eat again until dinner because we were so full. The main pool was heated, but not the smaller pools in each grouping of rooms. The weather was uncooperative that weekend, so the unheated pools were out of the question. There was plenty of room in the main pool, but we didn't swim because it was where everyone had headed and we were looking for something more private without children splashing about (ours were staying with grandma). We visited the onsite store (The Island Market) several times. It was well stocked with snacks, souvenirs, and trinkets. They were priced as you would expect at a resort. The Barefoot Bar and Grill was a nice place to hang out if you are staying on the resort, but in retrospect, I'm sorry we wasted a meal there when there are so many choices in town. We walked past the marina, but it seemed to be mostly small boats and a couple of jet skis. We were more interesting in snorkeling and parasailing, so we ended up going to the public beaches anyway. About the only thing we did on the resort was renting bikes one day (I think they were about $20/per hour for each bike). The resort website is deceptive in this area because they provide a very detailed map of Mission Bay bike paths, but when you fill out the rental contract, there is a section which states you can't take the bikes off their property. It was okay, but you can only do so many laps around the parking lots. I would have enjoyed it much more if we'd been able to go cruise along the beaches just across the street. If I could do this over, I would walk over to the beach and look for a bike rental off-property or bring our own. In hindsight, I probably wouldn't stay here again. Our total bill for 2 people for 3 nights was just over $1,000. That included our three breakfasts, 2 in-room movies, $25 parking per day, and a resort fee (maybe $15 per day?). Considering that there were so many fun things to do in the San Diego area, we didn't spend $1,000 worth of time here. What little we did do (eating and bikes) was extra anyway. Next time we come to San Diego, I will have a better idea of the \"nice\" areas and the areas I wish to avoid and will just book a regular hotel with a year-round indoor pool! The \"resort & spa experience\" really doesn't justify the premium price of this location over any nice hotel.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cRidiculous fees, in the middle of nowhere, kind of a rip-off\u201d", "Author": "pickyeaterblog", "ReviewID": "UR111342052", "Content": "We stayed at paradise point over the Memorial Day Holiday for a wedding. Other than the fact that the hotel is located right on the water and is a great location for a wedding, everything else about our stay was an absolute disappointment. To start - our arrival experience was sub-par. We arrived somewhat late at night (around 10pm) -- and we were checked in extremely quickly and given almost no information by the front desk. Key things that were omitted included: 1) We weren't given a map of the property or told what was on the property or available for us to use 2) We were led to believe that the \"passport to paradise\" services (internet, phone, fitness center, etc.) were free when in fact they are not - you get charged $15 extra per day whether you use them or not! How outrageous is that? Then we were told to \"wait outside and the bell staff will be right with you to take you to your room.\" We ended up waiting for almost 30 minutes with no updates from the front desk on where the bell staff was or when they would be arriving, we weren't invited to wait inside where it was warm - we were standing outside in the cold because we thought the bell staff would arrive any minute to take us to our room. It sucked. Then - our room: The main issue we had with our room was that when we arrived, the body wash in the shower was basically just water -- and when we alerted the housekeeping staff of this issue they said they'd refill it but they never did. I ended up using the shampoo as my \"body wash\" for our entire stay. Also it's clear that the facilities are old and only parts have been renovated -- case in point: the shower water pressure was pretty bad and the shower head was not adjustable at all and super high up and kind of crooked which was frustrating for me as I'm only 5'0 and the entire shower went right over my head. Also - the drain in our bathtub was really gross looking - it had rust all over it and was clearly part of the \"original\" pre-renovated room. Now the random added fees. I already mentioned this before - but let me reiterate what a rip-off this hotel is. First - the room itself costs at least $220 / night. And this is just for a basic room. Then - the \"passport to paradise\" - we weren't told that we'd be charged $15 per day ($45 total) for these services whether we used them or not. We were led to believe that they would be free when we checked in. We didn't bring our laptops so we didn't use the internet, and we only made one phone call during our stay. We didn't use the fitness center or any of the other amenities as we were there for a wedding and didn't have time to use the facilities. This was completely misleading and unacceptable - and we felt totally ripped off. There are also random \"resort\" fees that get added to your bill every day that you don't know about and aren't told about when you check in. Room service is pretty slow (and as with all room services, totally overpriced). One morning I just ordered tea for two people - and it took 35 min to arrive at the room. I was also slightly annoyed that when I requested milk instead of cream with my tea that I was charged extra for it ($3.50 extra) Also - as with all room services - the service charge & additional fees applied to the bill are way too expensive. Next - the location. This hotel is in the middle of NOWHERE. We were staying at the hotel for a wedding, and we were there for 4 days. The hotel has basically 2 restaurants on-site - and for 4 days, you really can't just eat at two restaurants the entire time. All food options are a $25 cab ride away (or you have to rent a car - which we hadn't - so we ended up forking over the cash just to get a meal that was different from the two menus available to us at the hotel). The hotel doesn't really give you any helpful transportation tips on how to get to the downtown area of SD without spending a ton of money either. Overall I wouldn't recommend staying here.

After 6 hours on airplanes, we arrived at the hotel just ahead of the 4pm check-in time. The front desk told us their computer systems were down, and they were unable to accommodate us. They did not offer to hold our luggage or invite us to relax by the pool; it was \"Sorry, come back later!\" When we returned after 4pm, there were lines of frustrated guests in the lobby waiting to check in - plenty of people were as unimpressed as we were. Previous reviews are correct about the outrageous parking fee - it is $25 per night. This would be reasonable if Paradise Point was within walking distance to anything in San Diego and we could leave the car behind, but it's not. The hotel is set back quite a distance from downtown or the beaches. The fee was a surprise to us. We had booked the hotel through Orbitz and thought we were paid in full, so we weren't happy. There is also abundant parking - every room has an assigned spot, there's a large general parking area, and a large parking lot for the banquet hall. Parking's not at a premium so it just felt like a big rip-off. Speaking of ridiculous fees, this hotel charges for EVERYTHING. Internet has a fee. LOCAL telephone calls are $1 for the first 30 minutes, and $0.10/minute after that. Fitness center is $12/day (but it's free if you spend $75 in the spa!). It even costs money to play basketball. We joked that we wouldn't turn on the TV because they probably charged for basic cable. To add insult to injury, the room is stingy with extras. We had no soap in the bathroom, no lotion, no water bottles, and no robes. Housekeeping didn't show up until 5:30pm on our last full day (and didn't collect our neighbors' dirty room service dishes for 2 full days. Gross.) The most deceptive fee of all is the daily resort fee of $15 per day. Upon check in, you receive a \"passport\" that says for $15/day, guests receive internet, free use of the fitness center, free outdoor games, free local phone calls, and a few extras. It's worded to make you believe that you need to ASK for this bundle, so my husband and I purposely avoided all of those things to avoid the fee. We had already paid for the room once and were annoyed by the secret parking fee, so imagine our surprise when our check-out statement had the $15/day fee, for an extra $90. When my husband went to the front desk to complain, the girl admitted that lots of guests were surprised by the extra $40/day (parking + resort fee), but there was nothing she could do. In all fairness, the hotel is very pretty and well-manicured. The pools and spas are nice, Barefoot Bar & Grill is a decent place to eat, and the beds were very comfortable. But we just couldn't get past the feeling of being nickel-and-dimed to death. Basically, a very pretty, very overpriced, and borderline deceptive resort.

The fees here are also outrageous. $25 per day just to park your car here. That is $10 to $15 high. The mandatory $15 resort fee is a little high but atleast you get something out of it.

Very lush and tropical. The hotel is secluded, the closest area is Sea World., which makes it nice for families. One of the first things you notice, besides all the flowers and trees is the people riding \"surries\" or bikes thru the property. Then you see people playing miniature golf on a small course that is along the side of the entrance road. No windmills or water hazards, just little putting greens connected like links of a regular golf course. Next to the lobby is a lovely large lagoon with waterlilys and plenty of fish and water fowl. The lobby is a little dated, but according to the front desk staff, will be renovated sometime soon. Next to the lobby is a market and gift shop that has lots of cool things to tempt you. The bike/Surrey rental area is right next door. The fine dining restaurant, Baleen is a short walk from the lobby and the prices are not too bad. The most expensive is the Steak and Lobster at over $50.00. Not too far from their is the waterside restaurant that is open all day. Not a huge selection but the 4 cheese grilled cheese with Tomato Basil soup combo is excellent. Be aware of the heron's, they like to snatch food off your plates. Didn't see this first hand, but was advise to watch out for this one sneaky bird who liked to surprise you and make off with part of your meal. The rooms are 1950's bungalows that have been updated inside. Very Hawaiian themed with cheery bright yellow walls. There are refrigerators in the rooms, which makes it nice to keep your leftovers or a bottle of wine. The coffee makers are the type that use the coffee pods and make either one or two cups at a time. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Housekeeping comes by later in the afternoon,evening offering robes to be used during your stay. The sink area is very small. Barely big enough for one person to put their items on, much less two. The lighting is terrible, until you realize that the hotel is using the CFL lightblubs that take a while to warm up and brighten up. They don't offer little bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash. They have gone green and installed bottles of aforementioned items in the shower area. Body lotion is not offered. Most if not all rooms have a patio of sorts. It is either in the front of the room, or our the back door. Ours was out the back door and over looked a pond with a fountain and was right next to one of the many pools on the property. Two Adirondake chairs and a small table were on the small patio. No fencing between the patios but it felt secluded anyway. Nice little area to sit, drink a glass of wine and read a book or visit with a loved one or friend. Each room is assigned their own parking space number that matches their room number. The meeting rooms were very nice and plentiful. Many options for a business meeting, a wedding or a prom. (all of which were going on during our stay). While the resort is spreadout, you can easily walk from anywhere on the property to the meeting rooms, and if you have driven to the hotel, you could always drive from your room to the meeting area.

The master bed was extremely comfortable and the overall impression was almost bucolic. Ducks wandered in the grass, there were fire-pits and the sand. Even the Heat and A/C was not the usual railroad-train quality, but were quiet and even had a fresh-air option. The rooms were very quiet. So quiet that we didn't even know that a prom party with over 80 people was just next door until a HS Senior asked if they had kept us awake!

My son walked it with ease. I downgraded the resort for its restaurants of which we tried two, a casual one with a beachy theme, and a white tablecloth starched-napkin variety. Both feature extremely-high prices. The casual restaurant is in serious need of updating. The bench seats on the booths are padded with worn-out paper thin cushions that might as well not be there. The menu was dull as was the actual food. The drinks were watery. Apparently room service comes from the same kitchen - it is 10 times better. Also, there's a live band on Saturday night. The other restaurant is very much a mixed bag and almost seems to depend on the waiter. We ate there twice. The first time were were served by Brent and the experience was worth every cent of the $100 each we spent. Drinks were strong and well prepared, the appetizers arrived quickly and were delicious. Same goes for the main and dessert courses. Our second experience there was the dinner from hell. The drinks and appetizers went fine. Then we were forgotten. Really. After 3/4 hour my son had to take his toddler son back to the room. I finally managed to attract our waiter from the night before who brought over the manager. He really didn't seem to get it saying that my grandson's food was brought quickly (true).

First off let me start by saying our son has Asperger's (high functioning autism). We were really wanting a vacation since it had been over five years since we'd taken a \"real\" vacation. Our son likes places that are nice and quiet and not too noisy. After doing some research on the Internet I thought that Paradise Point sounded like a perfect fit for our family. I had read some negative reviews on here before we left so I have to admit I was a tiny bit apprehensive but let me put those fears to rest for you. Paradise Point is the ultimate resort! They have everything!! They have five amazing pools, two awesome restaurants (with gorgous water views), and a beautiful private beach that stretches all around the property. They have firepits all along the beach as well and you and your family can make schmores there at night. The room we had was absolutely amazing!! We were steps from the beach and we had a beautiful room equipped with a fridge, king bed, computer table, nice dressers and two big screen tv's! We were thrilled!! We had a beautiful deck equipped with patio chairs that we sat in every day. Our son loved the fact that there were ducks wandering all over the property and was ecstatic that the same group of three ducks came to our door everyday!! You can buy some food at the gift shop and feed them. Very reasonable price at only $1.50 per bag. Now I mentioned before that our son has high functioning autism so we found this resort to be perfect for children with special needs because of the serenity of it all. Definately not overstimulating and noisy. I have to also mention that I believe this resort is perfect for ANY family!! I think kids of all ages would love it! We are already planning our next trip back!! The customer service is impeccable and all of the employees go above and beyond to meet your needs. They can pick you up in golf carts at any time to take you and your family to one of the pools or dinner..etc. Did I mention there is an awesome store there with everything you could possibly need?

After a late journey down from LA we were both tired and hungry and frustrated that no food what so ever was available at the hotel at any time after 10pm. We arrived at around 10:30pm and were given some Pizza take out menus - however these only deliver up to 11pm so no luck there. We had to wait 10 or 15 mins at this late time just to check in as well as the receptionist was dealing with a complaint on the phone - we should have realised then what we were in for. We stayed in a Lanai Garden Bungalow and it was GROSS. Extremely dirty - in fact there was dirty tissue stuck to the bathroom wall and previous guests shaving gel on the shower fitting for the entire 4 night stay. There were dead flies stuck to the ceiling of the bathroom too which was very unpleasant. My partner left a pile of coins - mixed currency on the side the first day when we were out - and out our return we were surprised to find that the maid had taken it! Fair enought it wasn't a huge amount of cash, but surely by the sheer volume of coins that were there was (50+) and the fact that we had not left would make it clear to the maid that this was NOT a tip? We would certainly not tip the LACK of cleaning anyway. Additionally - watch out for the refrigerator in your room. Ours was very loud, so much so that we needed to unplug it in order to get to sleep. We let the maintenance team know and they simply came over the necxt day and replugged it in. We left it unplugged for the remainder of our stay. The walls are also paper thin - if your neighbour runs their tap you'll surely be woken up - you can hear everything that it going on around you from the room which makes for some poor nights sleep and very little chance of a lie in. To sum up - this hotel is very beautiful on the outside (grounds / restaurants / lobby etc) - however the owners a clearly too tight to invest on the inside.

I loved the coffee makers- they were the single cup brew style, so the coffee would not get stale. The shampoo, conditioner, body soap were really nice- pump style so we did not run out. The 18-hole putt-putt golf was a fun bonus. We loved the beach, the water-sport rentals (we rented a speed boat and paddle boat at reasonable prices), the many pools and hot tubs dotted throughout the property, the beautiful park-like setting with water fountains and whimsical artwork all around, and the fire pits on the beach and some of the pool areas. I liked most that they did not enforce the pool hours in a super strict way; the guests that stayed on were very respectful of the quiet hours... it was a win-win. The poolside bar, waterfront cafe, and waterfront restaurant were all wonderful, good ambiance and good food (but a little overpriced). I bought multiple things from the store (including the replacement for a forgotten swimsuit), they had everything there; we even purchased zoo tickets from them since they were the better deal at the time.

They never had more than two people working and for the life of me I never figured it out. Anyway, not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, just not the service I was expecting. Next, the room. We had a \"garden\" or non-beach room, but it ended up with a great view so we were pleased. The beach there is very nice, so again, great plus. The floors in the unit, however, were disappointing. They were dirty and I'm not sure when the last time was they were mopped and cleaned. To make matters worse, our ceiling in the bathroom had black stuff all over it along with yellow spots. It looked like no one had cleaned it for months. I was literally astounded, again, this is supposed to be a top-notch resort. I complained the next day and they fixed it right away - and did a great job. Other than that, the room was fine. There was wireless internet so that was great (it was free, or you could pay in your room for cat-5 connection.) The resort is very pretty. The landscaping is gorgeous and the pools and hot tubs were great. It's great for the kids as they have the \"ocean-type\" walk-in to the pool, if that makes any sense. All the kids were having a good time for sure. Major plus. On the flip side, and this could be just me so maybe this isn't an issue, but when I've stayed at other resorts, the reason why your room charge was so high is because everything is included. Not so here. You have to pay for everything: Bike rides, mini-golf, etc. You had to pay for internet (until I found the wireless internet the resort provided), and the gym was $12/day. I was really taken back by this, for when comparing it to say, Club Med, once you walk into the resort, everything is included. I know it's not apples-to-apples, but I think I was expecting a Club Med type service/situation and I just didn't get it. The food though was terrific. The grill was ok, but the Baleen was fantastic (pricey, but well worth it - Dinner and drinks for me and the wife was $120 before tip). All in all, it's a nice place. The beach looked nice, but it is so cold this time of year in SD don't even think about getting into the ocean. The resort seemed over-priced and I doubt I would return.

She told us one of the rooms was ready but we had to wait a while for the second room to be cleaned. We went to the room to unload our luggage and take a peak at the room. No mold smell this was good, went to wash my hands and noticed the counter was dirty so I took one of there pretty white wash cloths to wash it down with and it turned black along with hair it picked up. Then a problem we could not live with: no connecting door for the kid\u2019s room. So off we go back to the front desk, they were so nice and right away gave us another set of rooms. We are now loaded back up and head for the new rooms, we walk into the first room to be greeted by the smell of MOLD (they must have known this was a problem since they had the bathroom fan on) so off we go to get another set of rooms. This time a gentlemen helped me, he took off our parking charge and gave us a resort credit for the incontinence and offered to upgrade us to a nice room on the beach but we would be sleeping with the kids on a roll-away (give us one room instead of the 2 that we paid for). I declined since I didn't want to sleep with the teenage boys, so he gave us two rooms in the back 40. (We got to listen to the work crew cutting stuff up and trip over the extension cords left out across our walkway). By this time I was just done changing rooms and ready to get on with the vacation. The room was fine except they were so dirty, at first I thought well these just must not get used so it will be better tomorrow after they clean it. After returning the next day from our outing I noticed that nothing had been wiped down and they even left us with dirty glasses. We all were walking around that night in bare feet after showers not thinking the floors would be dirty, our feet turned black! So don't forget flip flops for everyone if you don't want to shower twice before bed. It was like this everyday, on day number 4 they didn't leave us clean wash cloths so I stopped by the front desk to ask for some explaining the reason about black feet. The supervisor talked to me telling me it was not expectable and she would have our room cleaned in detail the next day including getting those floors mopped. I then went to the spa to have a pedicure and manicure done for $258 why not since my floors would finally be clean (it was worth the cost Jennifer was amazing). Needless to say the cleaning we were told would be done WAS NOT. Dirty floors, dirty tub, dirty glasses, dirty counter tops, dirty chairs, and they never wipe down the tables in the rooms. Six blissful days of a dirty room, I'm just keeping it real.

We did, but the bedroom has an adjoining door to the neighbors and you can hear every word they say all night long! Awful! The ugliest room I have ever seen and the BATHROOM is HORRIBLE!

The mildew on the drapes and overpowering mold smell of our first room forced us to move (further away from our friends and the convention center).

There were two locked doors to adjoining rooms and we could hear the plumbing from the our neighbors very early in the morning as if they were in our bathroom. The beds are okay, a bit squeeky. We had our own little patio with two chairs and a tall hedge for privacy. Grounds: Grounds were lush and tropical--bird of paradise, palm trees, just gorgeous. But we spent a good amount of time on our feet being lost, as the roads curve around all over the place and the units look the same. You can sometimes catch a ride on a golf cart. The beach is lovely but it was too cold to enjoy it even fully clothed. Service: We found the service to be excellent from the front desk, gift shop, bell staff, etc. Food: Only 2 restaurants on property. Although pricey, we got tired of Barefoots and wanted to try Baleens but it was closed that night. Having no car and being there for business, we ate at the Barefoot a lot. Good food but I was hoping for more \"California fare\" and the service varied from good to not great, depending on the server. It was a huge problem for them to give separate checks.

Went in having read all the reviews, so I didn't want to get my hopes up...got a great deal on Hotwire, so we didn't really have anything to lose...just wanted to get a place close to Seaworld and this place was right across the street. Check-in was a breeze.Lobby area was welcoming. ROOM: Yes, it was a little strange having our\"beach-style\" bungalow right next to the road where the guests would drive by. The view outside of our door was the road and then the lagoon. So not much privacy if you open the shades. Speaking of which, the shade covering the door was too sheer and the lights of the cars would shine really brightly into the room, which was a minor annoyance. The decor was tropical island inspired and modern. The flat screen was nice, the refrigerator worked well, bed was firm and comfy. No dresser for clothes. Like other people said, the renovation on the bathroom was a quickie one. Coat of paint slapped on. They should have replaced the showerheads. Looks old and outdated. The water pressure is awful. It took forever to take a shower. Killed some bugs each day. Not a big deal though. GROUNDS: The landscaping and lagoon was so lush and beautiful. That part really felt tropical. We loved walking around with our little one, exploring the resort. They have many little pools scattered around (some for adults only and some for the family) and fire pits. You can make smores and stuff on the fire pits (they sell kits at the gift shop for $25, along with firewood...really expensive....byo). They have bikes for rent and a miniature golf area....very family friendly, but everything is expensive. LOCATION: Very close to Mission Bay, Seaworld, LOTS of great restaurants. All of the places we ate at nearby were good. We just looked on Yelp for recommendations. Also ate at Barefoot Bar for breakfast both days and had no problems. DO NOT feed the birds. They are VERY aggressive and we saw this other guest who had left his table outside for a second and the birds swooped in and started eating his food. Baleen is the higher end restaurant, right next to Barefoot. Didn't eat here during our stay. We also went to Balboa Park which was only 15 minutes away. So everything is very convenient. CONS: Yes, parking is $25 a night. They charge for internet too. The items at the gift shop (Island Market) are expensive. Lots of activities cost something.

Throughout our stay they were accomodating of our needs and extremely helpful with suggesting restaurants, local attractions, etc. We enjoyed our guest room and found it very comfortable and cozy. We had a suite that you walked directly into from the driveway, and it had a private patio with a little creek behind it. It was very relaxing and very different from a traditional hotel experience. The location was great too. We rented a car and found it very easy to get around San Diego and its surrounding areas. It would only take between 2-10minutes to get anywhere, even downtown. And, our room had a parking spot right next to the door, so parking was extremely convenient. Although we were spending our honeymoon there, we were also impressed with how family friendly Paradise Point is (yet, we didn't feel over run by kids- definitely a plus for newlyweds just wanting to spend some quality-quiet time together for their honeymoon). We feel as though when we have a family we would definitely go back and stay there. Overall, Paradise Point was a great experience that I would recommend to family, friends, colleagues and anyone else.

We visited with our two daughters and enjoyed the hotel, the Barefoot grill for lunch and Breakfast as well as Baleen for Dinner. The rooms were beautifully situated and had every convenience, easy parking and nicely appointed in a California beach meets Bali kind of ambiance. Lunch in the sunshine outside the barefoot grill was reasonably priced at about 80 dollars for 4 with drinks Beer and a cocktail or two. Suffering from acute hunger after a Freeway ordeal we dived into Wagyu burgers with relish, ours not the burgers, and passed up more adventurous fare which seemed to be pleasing our neighbors admirably. The first experience was excellent, good lunch , wonderful atmosphere and setting overlooking the bay. Great Start. We moved on to Sea World and came back in the evening to Baleen the signature restaurant at paradise Point. Gourmet food at excellent prices with inspired service led by Chris Kindig. Every dish was a highpoint from the split pea soup with smoked duck , the subtle apple brined pork chop and tomato and maple glazed salmon. There are good value possibilities in the choice too with Margaret River Semillon Chardonnay at 34 dollars a bottle and the 3 for 30 dining option which allows 3 courses for 30 dollars on a prix fixe menu.

Wouldn't recommend it for others with small kids. Read on for a, hopefully, nuanced description of our stay. We are currently at the hotel and leaving this morning after a 4 day night stay. We rented a very expensive bay-side bungalow which has a \"kitchenette\" (more on this later), separate bedroom and living area. The porch opens out onto the bay beach. This is a family trip and we have two small children with us. Pros The location is right on Mission Bay with great views day and night. The beach is good for small kids to beachcomb with 19 fire rings for a late night smores fest with the kids. There are five pools and multiple hot tubs that are heated. The ambience of gas-lit tiki torches down the main drives is beautiful. You're within easy driving of restaurants/bars in Pacific Beach and not too far from La Jolla with a huge range of choices. Great location for seeing the sights in San Deigo and environs. Cons It's very irritating how the hotel nickles and dimes you on everything. They charge a $25/day parking fee (which they'll waive under certain circumstances) for parking in front of a $400/night bungalow. There is a fitness center, but that's an extra $12/day/person. There's a village store where you can buy a small wood pile for a beach fire, but, oh, did you want a starter kit for that. It's extra. Need matches or lighter, more yet. Did you want a late checkout? That's $50/hour. The service is horrible. The first night we needed extra blankets (none on the pullout in the living area) and had to call 3 times over more than a half hour. We had similar experiences later in the trip. However, the room cleaners were good and eficient.. The bungalow \"kitchenette\" consisted of a microwave and a small cube refrigeratot. No plates, no cutlery, nothing. The doors on the kitchenette are hanging badly on the hinges and wouldn't close properly. Hard to describe it as a kitchenette. The bungalows are in serious need of being refurbished. It's clear that someone made an effort and slapped a coat of paint on everything, but things are old and dated. A sink spigot in the bathroom was so broken that it was hard to shut off. Our bungalow was very near the noisy causeway crossing Mission Bay making the \"sitting out on the porch\" experience one of listening to the sound of Harleys and trucks go by.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHighlight of Hotels\u201d", "Author": "Ashashin", "ReviewID": "UR91162334", "Content": "Wow! so Much to say about this place!

The hotel was rated 4 stars and met my criteria. It was close to SeaWorld and had direct beach access. At that point it would not have taken much to impress me. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. While driving from Phoenix, we realized that we would be arriving much later than we anticipated. I tried to call to make sure our late check in would not be a problem. I also wanted to make sure the room had 2 beds. It has happened in the past where I have reserved a rooms with 2 beds and still received a room with only one. I was on hold for 20 minutes and when I finally got through I was told that there was no way to connect me with reservations or the front desk as it was after hours. The person on the phone informed me that I had been on hold for so long because no one was picking up at the reception desk. My call finally rolled over to her and she was at a different location. Upon our arrival, we found driving around the property a bit confusing. The small signs indicating where the check in location was, were not lit. In fact, the entire resort was not very well lit at all. I\u2019m all for ambiance but I would still like to see where I\u2019m going. During my reservation process there was no mention of the fee for parking, which adds $25 a night. I would have rather paid a little more for the room ($10 at most) then be charged for parking. San Diego is a place where vacationers have cars. That being said, pretty much everyone will be paying for parking. Separating it out is only beneficial to a small portion of guests. When we went to park our car in our \u201cassigned\u201d parking spot, there was already a car parked there! In addition, the $150 a night for incidentals was a lot. The receptionist had to reduce the amount by $100 as the total amount was higher than my credit card\u2019s limit. The room was lacking in some conveniences. A coffee maker would have been nice. There was a coffee \u201ccart\u201d on the other side of the resort. I am sure I\u2019m not the only person that does not want to have to get dressed to drink my morning coffee. The first morning I tried ordering coffee through room service. There was a fee for \u201cdelivery\u201c AND fee for \u201croom service\u201d, as well as a 20% auto-gratis that the attendant told me was pooled so I gave him an extra tip. This brought my total for coffee and 3 small pastries to almost $40. I ended up buying coffee and a coffee maker at a local CVS. I also bought myself a mug at the store, which room service took when they cleaned the room the next morning. I called the front desk to let them know but it was never returned. A pair of sweatpants that I had bought for the trip was also taken. The room was nicely decorated however I would not consider the room all that comfortable. The mattresses were lumpy and one bed had a cheap blanket while the other had a down comforter. Of course I was the unlucky one who picked the bed with the cheap blanket. The heating/cooling system only seemed to operate on hot or cold (no in between). There was hardly any pressure in the shower, even with the adjustable head. These things were aggravating however the problem I found the most frustrating was that there were ants EVERYWHERE. They were in the bathroom, under the bed and worst of all in the bed. I woke up with ant bites all over me, even after they came to spray twice. Honestly I think they should have either moved our room or compensated us somehow. The last night we were there we went to have drinks by the pool. Apparently the pool bar closed before the sun even set. We used the phone near the pool to order drinks through room service. It took almost 2 hours for 2 drinks to come. Everybody by the pool was ordering drinks through room service so I\u2019m not sure why the bar was not staffed later. There were several amenities such as WiFi and a Fitness center however all were a significant additional price. The restaurants were decent but not great. If I am paying $70 for breakfast, it better be more than decent. Overall I would say I was disappointed. I would have rather stayed at any number of chain motels that has comfy beds, free parking and coffee in the room. I would have saved money and been more comfortable. My experience left me wondering exactly what makes a resort 4-star? I looked it up and the rating is somewhat subjective, however Paradise Point did not even come close to meeting the 4 star rating standards. Perhaps they have not been reviewed in a while? Maybe they were tipped off to who the reviewer was? Or maybe... they give service according to how much one pays for their room?

If that is the case, I would hate to see what it looked like before. Here is our pro/con list and keep in mind the cost per night when reading the list. Pros: -Very good food. We ate several meals (including all of our breakfasts) at the resort. Everything was very good. -Helpful, courteous staff. Everyone was very nice and they went out of their way to give us excellent restaurant recommendations. -Location next to the bay with easy access to sand and water. This is helpful when you are traveling with a small child, especially one who likes to play in sand! Cons: -Poor quality physical environment. For the price we paid, we were VERY disappointed with what we got. It simply looked like they redecorated rather than refurbished these rooms. We have stayed in far nicer hotels for about half the price. Even our honeymoon at a luxury resort in Anguilla was cheaper and far superior to this one. -Poor quality amenities. Towels were hard and uncomfortable. Not many extras in the room. No notepad and pen. No lotion/mouthwash. One phone. These things don't sound like much but when you pay that much money, they had better be in the room. Even the Days Inn has a notepad in it. -Paper thin walls. We could hear the baby crying next door to us (as I'm sure they heard our son crying as well). Wasn't expecting an exclusive Bayside Bungalow to be connected to another one (perhaps this was my own fault). -Everything was extra. I know this is common for resorts, but parking was $25 per night. The gym was $12 per visit (hence we didn't workout) and internet access was $12.95 for 24 hours (also didn't use it). -Location is not the best. It wasn't bad and not hard to drive downtown but there is not much going on immediately outside of the resort.

Staff was helpful with directions and at check-in. (your on your own getting to your room) The Negatives: Stayed in room 158, the beds are the worst I've ever slept on. The beds in the room need to be replaced, they are saggy, and every time you moved the springs creaked like a cheap motel 6 bed. (Wife and I had the worst sleep ever on a bed here) As mentioned from a previous reader, resort is quite large and when we checked in, we got a map and basically had to fend for yourself to find the room. It was kinda funny watching people wander around looking for their room especially at night when its dark at the resort. Not cool. Their high end restaurant (Baleen) is way over priced and average food. Wife ordered the steak and I had the halibut dish. Both were very salty. This is to bad since the location is lovely and the waiter was nice. Their other restaurant (Barefoot) has okay, breakfast food nothing special, their dinner wasn't great. Again nice location. The waiter/waitresses were average Paying $25.00 per day for parking and $9.95 per day for slow internet is ridiculous. Isn't the rooms expensive enough??

But the location couldn't be beat and we wanted something a little special and private for our first anniversary. Boy was I glad we risked it. I'm not sure if it is the recent change in management, but it was FABULOUS!!! Since it was our first anniversary, I brought the top layer to our wedding cake with me from Reno. When I landed, I called the hotel to see if I could drop off the cake immediately so I didn't have to carry it around since we weren't checking in until the next day. Of course was the answer and they went so far out of their way from there to make our stay special. I dropped off the cake and they put it into their catering refrigerator for safe keeping. We also got our room upgraded to a prime bay front room, they delivered the cake while we were out on our anniversary with everything we would need including champagne! The room location was perfect with a quiet setting, a beach right outside our door with a fire pit for fires, vaulted ceiling with a wall of windows looking out at the bay. Parking was right next to our room and it felt like coming home each night rather than going to a hotel. The grounds are magnificent with lots of greenery, lagoons, pools, and beach. All rooms are in one story buildings and most are connected to only a few rooms per building. Views vary greatly by room and you pay more for the better views... but they are worth it! It's very relaxing to look out on the bay or even a lagoon... not so relaxing to look out onto a parking lot for the cheap rooms. We ate breakfast at the Barefoot Grille with great service and good food. A beautiful view of the bay on the deck came with heaters making it pleasant to enjoy the deck. We had quick service, but weren't rushed. The only downside to the resort is that the rooms are showing their wear. They have done a good job with new flooring, new furniture, and new granite counters, but the microwave was ancient, the tub was rusted, and little things like the peephole was cracked (although there was a window right next to the door). Even this didn't deter much though. It's an older resort which comes with the great grounds and larger rooms so it's worth it. Everything was clean, just older. I highly recommend staying at the Paradise Point. The staff are amazing, properties relaxing, and the location cannot be beat.

It took you to many places around San Diego (Little Italy, Gas Light District, Old Town, Balboa Park/Zoo, Midway Museum, Coronado Island) and you could get off and on as many times as you wanted providing you got back on at a certain time and it would take you back to your hotel.

This is an older established resort so don't expect everything to be perfect or completely pristine. Go into it with an open mind. It is a little pricey for the quality of room, but I found the grounds and location more than offset for the difference. The dinner we had at the restaurant was second to none. Great service and excellent cuisine. The full course special they had along with one entree was more than enough for two, and they have specials on bottles of wind daily. Look for specials and discounts on the rooms from travel dealers online. For me and my wife we able to spend three days there for around $600 dollars along with spa treatments.

Also, there is hardly any grocery store etc. within walking distance to this place. This resort is right next to sea world. Now the room itself: we got a newer room. It was one long room with a couch, flat screen TV, a king bed, a small closet space with a safe, a coffee machine and a bathroom area. The door and the adjoining wall was made of glass and covered with white curtains-no separate windows. The curtains look nice but did not offer complete darkness during the day. They also did not close well enough for complete privacy-especially the one on the door-it kept pinching on one side. The bed was comfy but oddly placed at a slight angle to the TV. The lamps next to the bed never worked. Internet was $10/day-needed IT help to set it up. The service was good most of the time except for the last day when the housekeeping did not come all day long (8-4PM even with \"service please sign on\") and then when I was back in the room at 4PM, trying to take a nap, they called and said that it could only be done in the next hour as the maids leave at 5. But they had extra towels, so it was no big deal. Also, if they could add a small bottle of lotion and a small vanity pack (q-tips, cotton etc.) in the bathroom, it would be quite helpful! The restaurants-baleen and barefoot grill were good. The tropics bar and the island markert coffee cart remained closed all days.

The entire family was looking forward to this vacation. The web page for the resort was breathtaking. It made it seem like we would be on a tropical island.

That should have been the first clue that this was not a 4 star resort. I walked into the lobby while my husband waited in the car with our kids. The lobby was small and looked a little out dated (clue number two). The gentleman at the front desk told me that we would be charged $25.00 a night for parking, that we had not been told at the time of booking. And if I wanted to park for free that it would be a 15 minute walk outside of the resort grounds. Once we had been given our room number we got back into our car and headed out to find our room. As we drove around we noticed the flat roof style huts with one door but two room numbers. They don't show you this at all on the web page (clue number three). At this point we don't like what we saw but hoped that the inside of the room would make up for the exterior of the buildings. We open the door to our hut and notice two more doors. One to our room and that of another room in the small hallway that connected us, the foor was discustingly dirty. It looked like it hadn't been swept in weeks. Cobwebs all along the walls with dead bugs in them. Once we walked into our room the smell of mold over powered us!! The beds where new with nice headboards and a new flat screen TV, but that couldn't block the smell out. The shower head was rusted and half falling out. All along the tub we could see the mold, crack and rust. The tropical view from our room was one of a fence with dried out plants that gave us a view of the busy street outside the resort. I couldn't believe this was the same resort I had seen on the web. I felt robbed and cheated. Who rated this place more then 1-2 star was crazy.

We didn\u2019t have to pay for parking, internet or the gym as they were included in this price. I found the internet speed to be VERY slow and am very happy I didn\u2019t have to pay for it. Room: The room was nicely decorated but the bed was hard as a rock. The bathroom had paint peeling off the walls and the toilet was way too close to the door. I\u2019m not sure why it was placed so close to the wall when there was plenty of room to in the bathroom to move it away from the wall. We had a small fridge in the room that wasn\u2019t working when we arrived. We called to have it fixed and maintenance was there quick to fix it even though we called at 10:30 pm.

We had paid more than $750 per night for a room on the bay (after getting a group discount). We had two people in front of us in the check in line. It took us more 45 minutes to finally get to the counter to a rude and arrogant clerk who also informed us that we would be charged an additional $25 per night per vehicle. We got our room keys and we were guided to our room by another clerk who opened the door and let us in. The room seemed okay, but not the high-end, $995 per night resort room on the bay we had been dreaming of. We left the room to have dinner and drinks at the bayside bar in the resort for a couple of hours. When we returned to our room that night the keys refused to open the door to our room. We took the dreaded LONG walk to the lobby in the dark to have the keys reprogrammed. Again with only two people in the line in front of us, we waited another 50 minutes to get to the counter. We were told that we were staying at the wrong room and we would have to move. They gave us a new set of keys and sent us out with yet another clerk to show us the correct room. Needless to say that we had to repack our stuff and move to our assigned room under the supervision of a suspicious clerk. Our new bay side room opened to small body of water and a beautiful noisy freeway bridge. From this point on we felt that this place was an absolute rip-off and not a high-end resort we had expected at this price. Two cheap paper cups for four people (no glass cups), loose screws on the door locks with multiple- trial- screw holes, a wrong size shower curtain that was too short and too wide (too many holes for the number of hooks) causing the bathroom floor to be flooded with every shower, a noisy bathroom fan that shook the bed posts in the next room but did not suck the bathroom air, a hungry ant colony in the kitchen that immediately covered the complimentary two-day old cookies and the leftover food from our dinner of just an hour earlier, a highly over-priced nacho chips plate with a dab of cheap frozen imitation guacamole and a few drops of SqueezeIt imitation cheese, $12.99 for an in-room movie, $4.50 for a 95 cent bottled water. We felt as though this place was making a genuine attempt at every step to cheapen our experience. We were glad to leave this glorified Motel 6.

I hope you find this review helpful before you book your trip. I have vacationed at a Sandals Resort in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, a resort in Cancun, Mexico, and the Hyatt Hill Country Resort in San Antonio, Texas. Paradise Point in San Diego does not come close to any one of these other resorts and the San Antonio resort I mention doesn't even have an ocean, lake, river or any type of body of water around except for their excellent man made lazy river that runs around the entire pool area. First of all - It is over priced. The grounds are not gated and while enjoying a nice quadracycle rental in the property we noticed what appeared to be a local police officer talking to a guest about what looked like a car break in. We also had someone run through our patio that hotel security staff was chasing. The pool area was not impressive at all - its a little larger than the average hotel pool but no slides or diving boards or anything really unique like you would find on other resorts. The room was old - averagely cleaned - we had purchased some food for breakfast one night to find ants crawling all over it the next morning. After complaining to the front desk - received a $100 credit at one of their restaurants - the food was bland and very average for the price - we tried to use the credit at the restaurant but we chose to eat out the rest of our trip. Also - cheap pergo flooring and knock off scandanavian furniture does not make it a 4 star room and the old noisy window units....really? We took a drive to La Jolla about 15 - 20 minutes away. We saw the real paradise in La Jolla. In La Jolla - you can really enjoy the beach - \"not\" the bay. The bay at Paradise Point is nice but you really don't want to swim in it - kayaking and fishing are fine but actually putting your body in there - at your own risk. We have concluded - our next trip to the San Diego area - will be in La Jolla. Anywhere relatively near the beach is fine - Wow - what a beach! You have it all in La Jolla including the aquarium and the zoo and Balboa Park are only 20 minutes away. In conclusion - Paradise Point should be called Motel 6 on Paradise Point.

Since he was a local and we had walked out of 2 other hotels we had nothing to loose after a 8 hour drive. We called the Paradise Point from our car, they were very nice and helpful and made the reservation quickly. We arrived about 10 min later and was blown away from the surroundings. We felt as if we were driving into Kauai. We saw families riding bikes, playing mini golf, swimming etc.. we knew right away this was a great family place. The lobby was beautiful and the front desk service was very friendly. We told her about our experience at the other places and she told us she would place us in a great location on the property. Our room was more like a bungalow. It was very large for a family of 4 and we really loved that we were only a few feet from the beach. We called to the front desk to extend out stay to a full week from 4 days. They have 5 pools on site, so we rotated pools and the main pool has food and drinks. The service at the main pool was outstanding! The kids all at the pool got blow up animals to play with at the pool. They have a great little store on the grounds and they are close to Pacific Beach so you can also go out of the grounds to get food etc. They also have great room service. We ordered one night and got our food 30 min later. Then at night you go out to the beach and reserve a fire pit. It was a great experience to have your own private fire pit with your family making smores after a picnic on a private beach. This location is close to everything, very clean.

Our little half a duplex with garden view was updated, clean, comfortable, quiet, even with a putting green right behind it. The grounds were beautiful.

We agreed if our kids were smaller, they would have been able to occupy themselves for hours with the putting green( all the resort kids were playing mini golf on it!), riding the rental bikes, playing on the private beach, hanging out. The common area in the center has ponds, ducks, herons, and an observation tower to climb. You can see the fire works from Sea World nightly from many places on the grounds. We generally stay at hotels, not resorts, so maybe I am easy to please, but I've payed as much in San Diego in high season and gotten much less. The only negative was having to pay for internet connection, so we went without. We over heard a couple of women in the gift shop snottily discussing the clothes ($50-200 items). \"They are soo ugly.

Parking is $25 a day, mini golf costs, etc (even Internet) One last tip- we decided to walk to sea world from the resort as there is no shuttle. The front desk lady said it would be a 15 minute walk.

I don't call that a vacation when your raked over the coals everytime you want to do something \"extra\". Maybe for some this is \"fun\". For me I'd rather stay in a nice chain hotel that appreciates their guests. Spending more doesn't make it memorable, but if you don't mind opening up your wallet to be drained......this is the place for you.For me it was overrated, really don't have an interest in staying here again.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prescott, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay- Can't Wait to Go Back!\u201d", "Author": "mountainmama1", "ReviewID": "UR68269297", "Content": "I have to admit I was very hesitant, after reading such mixed reviews on this resort.

We knew there wasn't going to be a coffe pot- and I do agree that's something they should provide. The coffee cart is excellent, but people would be much happier with a coffe pot in the room...and many would still buy specialty coffee drinks and the delicious pastries from the cart. The food at the restaurant was very good, and the women in our family enjoyed the spa.

It's located in the heart of San Diego on Paradise Island in MIssion Bay, close to nearly everything and yet set apart and very quiet. It also has a variety of equipment available for use on the bay (sailboats, paddle boats, etc.). Coming from the north, as we entered the Mission Bay area I noticed a sudden change from busy city surroundings to a quiet island setting. Part of this quietness, I think, is due to efforts by the city itself: we witnessed the bay patrol stop a speeding jet skier on the bay and asked him to slow down. This reduced both noise and possible hazard to vacationers who were using leg or wind-powered craft on the water. We ate primarily at the bar & grill, where the food was impressive (presentation as well as quality) for a simple family patio restaurant. It made me want to try the main dining restaurant, but we had no time during our 2-day stay. The rooms were very comfortable and decorated in an appropriate island motif. One of our friends said that the entire resort had all its rooms recently redecorated. The only comment I would have is that the hotel could do with a better coffee cart service, especially in the morning. While they had one, its quality was not on par with, e.g., the national chains, and the location in the bay makes it difficult to drive out for a venti half-caf in the surrounding area.

Upon arrival to our \"upgraded\" suite we entered a room that was dirty (sink with food particles in the drain, bugs in the bathroom area, dirt all over the light switches, paper on the floor, cob webs in the corners... obviously not the clean I am used to even in the most basic hotel. I phoned the front desk and explained the condition of the suite and was moved to an \"executive suite\" within 30 minutes. Upon arrival to our new suite, we encountered some of the same problems in terms of cleanliness and no bedding for the pull out sofa sleeper. The pillows for the second bed were wet and once again debris on the floor, the bedroom door would not close without slamming and putting weight into it making it just as difficult to open, no soaps, a tub faucet that was falling out of the wall with a huge hole above it. I phoned housekeeping and asked for bedding and was informed that they were out of pillows, linens and blankets and had nothing to send us. I again phoned the front desk and then asked to speak with the manager on duty. I was told there was not a manager on duty and that she would send someone to another empty room to retrieve the missing bedding. Upon arrival the linens smelled of cigarette smoke. I gave up and 4 of us, slept in a king size bed - suffice it to say it wasn't a pleasant evening. The next morning I did meet with a manager (not the GM, he was on vacation), who listened, admitted the resort dropped the ball and did not charge us for the room night, and then offered to move us. Unfortunately, there weren't any rooms available, and the manager had the current room cleaned from top to bottom, reduced our rate if I wanted to stay. That said, the property while may have been renovated, it's not the caliber of resort my family is used to. The pools are small, the beach dirty... The restaurant was good.

We were expecting your typical boiler-plate resort and were pleasantly surprised to find all this kid-friendly stuff----lagoons with ducks (kids could stop feeding them), multiple pools, sandy beaches, fire pits at the beaches, tiki torches, \"campfires\" at at least one of the pools (people roasting marshmallows every nite), tall observation tower (the kids loved climbing it), miniature golf, bike rentals........ The property almost has a campground feeling to it, which we most appreciated. Kinda cool, considering it's in the middle of a metro area! Location was great----5 minute drive to sea world, or if you'd like to save on the $12 parking fee, you can easily walk it in 20-30 minutes, which we did twice. Also within 15 minutes (traffic permitting) from downtown, airport , zoo etc.... And, within a 5-10 minute drive to Trader Joes and Von's supermarket. In addition, Home Desperate is close for firewood purchases.... Beaches on the ocean were very close, as was an old-time amusement park. Room was more than we expected---ours was fairly spacious with a king bed, and a pull-out couch, which was perfect for our 2 young boys. Kitchenette was just enough---decent sized under counter fridge, smallish microwave, granite countertops and a sink. We made most of our meals there, except for a few dinners out.... As another reviewer said, it would have been nice to have at least <I>some</I> minimal kitchen utensils. It seemed like the room was updated within the past coupla years. Another thing we appreciated was being able to park right outside our front door! OK, now the complaints----didn't like the $25/day parking fee. Might as well build that into your room price, unless you don't drive. While the room rate we got seemed fairly reasonable (about $129/nite+parking) for what we got and the location, the extras seemed a bit pricey---restaurants, duck food, s'mores kits, mini golf club rental fees and your other typical incidentals, not to mention the parking..... While the room was nice, the dark ceramic floor tile made the room a bit dark and gloomy, especially at nite. Also, my feet were always dirty after walking barefoot on this tile. Bathroom was a bit dated, plus the exhaust fan didn't work worth a crap (pun intended)..... Other than the sliding back door, it would have been nice to have a couple windows that opened. Overall, i would <U>definitely</U> recommend this resort to people with kids. For singles or couples w/o kids, it's your call----this place has a ton of kids.

I was pretty worried when I read the reviews, but I figured we weren't really going to be in the hotel much anyway. It ended up that we did spend more time in the hotel than we thought, so here is my experience. To start, we arrived at 12 noon. Check in time is 4pm, but I was hoping we could unload our things and go do a tour and come back. I was told there wasn't a room clean yet, but that she would call me when the room was available. I was also surprised to find out that parking is and extra $25 a night for a 'dedicated' parking space. They take your credit card when you check in for 'incidentals' okay- no big deal, but don't use a debit card, it freezes $300. I told the front desk clerk I didn't have a credit card with that amount on it :) and she said well I can just charge you $150 on your debit card. We left, and by 4:30 were ready to go back and relax after driving all night and doing a tour at the USS Midway. (If you have kids- take them! Very cool.) Noticing I hadn't received a call yet, I called the hotel only to be told that our room still wasn't ready. ? Check in time was 4:00 I thought? Sorry- still not ready. So I arrived there at the front desk at 4:45 and after waiting 10 minutes in line (again) and they \"gave us a new room.\" The room was very nice. I was worried about the remodeling issue after reading the reviews here, but our room seemed to have already been remodeled. It had nice furnishings, a flat screen TV, new flooring, fresh paint and a nice sink area and closet space for luggage. The only part NOT remodeled was the tub, and toilet area. You could tell that was a leftover 70's project they did not get to. While clean, I don't understand why not just re-tile the tub and behind the toilet and finish the job? It was a little odd. We had a private entrance, and a semi-private patio area off the back of our room. We never heard any noise from either neighbor beside us, only from people outside walking by to the pool. I would request a 'cove room' or room on the outskirts of the property next time to avoid people walking by with noisy kids, but overall it wasn't too bad. We were happy to find out there are 5 pools at this resort, all with hot tubs. One pool is heated all the time, and the rest were solar heated for the season. The pool closest to us was very warm, and had two fire pits which they turn on at night. There was also croquet, and a very nice hot-tub. Towel service was great, they have a basket at the pool with clean towels. We would grab a few and take back to the room to supplement the 4 exact towels they left in the room. Pool hours are 9am-10pm. They have tiki torches all around the property and pool at night which was a nice touch. We went swimming at night several times after being out all day, and sat in the hot tub. Nice way to relax after walking all day. The beach was nice, nothing spectacular. It's actually an inlet, so don't think you are going to go surfing or anything. They did have a bunch of things to do at the resort (all at extra charges) but we didn't get a chance to do any of them, although the sailing looked fun. The concierge was very helpful and very nice. The landscaping was beautiful, and the location was perfect. It's literally 1 minute from Sea World and close to everything else. I was very impressed (as were my children) with the entrance. When you drive up into the property, the first impression is that of a 5 star resort. After looking at the menu for the restaurant, we decided to head down to Denny's each morning for breakfast, which was great. It's about 3 minutes away, just over the bridge. We planned ahead and had a list of dinner locations we wanted to eat at based on advice from local residents and reviews on line, so we skipped the overpriced gourmet tourist food. Overall, our stay was really great. I would stay here again, but next time I'd try to get out of that parking $25 sham, (Our 'dedicated' spot changed each night, and while across from our room, there never seemed to be an issue with finding a spot, and the place was booked.) and I'd request a room a little more private. One thing they do need to fix are the road signs. There is one major place on the property where there are two signs, one says NO RIGHT TURN and one says NO LEFT TURN, in the same spot!! The road is supposed to be one way, but I'm not sure if anyone ever just goes one way? For the price, ($98) a night, this was a great deal. One final thing- They do charge you $1.00 for a 'room tax' upon check out. What is that? Why $1.00? Wireless internet is an extra $10 a night, be warned. I didn't feel like taking the time to find out, but I thought it was kinda odd.

Excellent food and service! It's a little fancy, but we went early to dinner and they were great w/the kids there too! The only downside about this hotel is that there are no coffeemakers in the rooms, but there is a coffee cart near the Gift shop.

Take this review with a grain of salt - we typicallly stay at Ritz Carltons. We picked this hotel because we were visiting a relative who lives very close by - and it was recommended. It was inexpensive - we had some package that i think the room ended up being around 150ish a nite. The room was large - there was a big sofa as well as a king sized bed. Unfortunately the first night the heating/air unit leaked a huge puddle of water and there were ants around the bath tub. I called maintenance in the morning. We returned home late at night (1030 pm) and the heating unit had been fixed but housekeeping had never come to the room. Unmade bed and wet towels. Ugh. I called the front desk (I was furious) and they offered to send housekeeping over. I turned that offer down - we were exhausted and wanted to go to bed. I told the person i would like to speak to a manager. She said a manager would not be in until 3 PM the next day. I said \"have the manager call me so I can express my irritation with him/her. If i dont hear from him/her I will post it on trip advisor so they can read it there\". Obviously I never got a call. The ants remained our entire stay - but they were only in/and around the tub so we didnt bother reporting them again. The restaurant Baleen is nice - we had a good dinner and good servcie there on valentines day. The service at the bar (at Balleen) is BAD. We stopped by one night for a drink. No one else was sitting at the bar. We asked to see a wine list. The bar tender gave us a list and then proceeded to rearrange the liquor bottles and also fill waiters orders (from the tables). I am not kidding - 10 minutes go by and his back was to us the entire time. Finally i say \"excuse me sir - i am sorry - do we need to sit at a table to order a glass of wine?\" I said it very nicely and of course he didnt get the fact that i was being sarcastic. He said \"oh - you can order here what can i get you?\" Whatever. At the casual restaurant by the water - i went there alone for breakfast one morning. I waitied 10 minutes for a menu - 10 minutes for coffee. The omelet was very good. Had to ask 3 people to find the waiter to get the check. There was plenty of staff - i guess they were hanging out in the kitchen talking to each other. The place wasnt crowded - no excuse. The internet service at the business center is afortune. If i recall it was like 9 bucks for 15 minutes . Ridiculous. They charge 25 bucks a nite to park there. The workout room was pretty nice and not crowded. The have a multi -use pass that they dont tell you about - but it is much cheaper than the stated fee of 12 bucks a day.I think it was 35 bucks for 5 visits - and two people can share the pass. I hope this is helpful. I dont usually stay in hotels like this so maybe this is what you get for 150 per nite. It is NOT as nice as the sister property in Naples.

I then requested 1 king and she told me she was going to give us a complimentary upgrade to the king with a view. We were excited!!!!!!!! The bellhop had us follow him over to a room in the 500 block. UPGRADE this was NOT. It was a very dark and tired room with ONE queen bed. I called the FD clerk from the phone in the room and she informed me that this was my complimentary upgrade.....confused by going from 2 queens to one king to a DARK DREARY ROOM with ONE QUEEN BED, I then requested to be DOWNGRAGED. She informed me that getting a king was impossible on the holiday weekend. I told her she JUST told me she was UPGRADING us to a king room with a view. She said she could not help me BUT that she could give us the room with 2 queens. I requested to SEE that room. I asked FD clerk about this room, does it have at least a view. FD clerk told me she does NOT know what the different rooms look like and I was to ask the bellhop. I turned to Keith, the bellhop, btw, who was an extremely nice young man, and told him FD clerk does not know the room and she said YOU would know the room with the 2 queens. He nodded and told me he did know this room (now in the 100 block) was newly renovated BUT no view at all, nothing, just the parking space for our car. We went and looked at the room and yes it was newly renovated. We decided to take this room AS we had plans and were meeting people and had to get going. I tipped Keith nicely as he was very helpful. Upon using the bathoom in our room, the door FELL OFF.....yes, indeed. I went outside to the parking lot and called to a hotel personel driving around on a golf cart and she called for an \"engineer\" to come fix the door which they did! There is nothing in the room. No coffee maker, no hair dryer, no water, no DO NOT DISTURB sign to hang on your door. There is a free fridge in the room, which we loved. The bed was VERY comfortable. The walls are PAPER THIN.

My husband told them we will be leaving at NOON. Parking is $25.00 per night. Check out is easily done on TV. Paradise Point is like a MOTEL as you drive up and park in front of your room. We did not enjoy our stay here at all. Thankfully, we only slept here. We went to OLD TOWN San Diego and that is fabulous. Many shops and wonderful homemade Mexican food.

And for that reason, I cannot complain, but will give my views after staying there. Check in was very nice....attractive lobby and staff very nice and welcoming. We arrived early (11am) and they were able to give us a room. Mind you, this is early November and it was a Sunday morning...not prime tourist season. But I did appreciate being able to drop our bags in our room as we had a full day planned and did not plan on being back to the hotel until later in the evening. And it is a good thing that we did. If we would have waited until it was dark, we may not have found our room. The lay out can be a bit confusing....the roads in the resot are very narrow and buildings are not marked very clearly. Our room happened to be on the \"back-side\" of a building...that made for confusion on how to get to it. The room was a \"bungalow\" type with a nice, small enclosed patio area at the entrance. They have two nice chairs to enjoy the outdoors. Being on the \"back-side\" of the building was good for this reason as it gave you more privacy from the parking area. The room, upon entrance, looked inviting...nice color scheme and pleasant layout...but it did have a rather musty smell as some people have stated before. It wasn't horrible enough to warrent changeing rooms....but was a little distracting. (that is the reason for only 3* for cleanliness) Because we were there during off-season, we did not use the grounds or pool areas. But they appeared to be well kept and attractive. The pool areas looked nice...one had a fire pit area that would be nice to have used if we had been there longer. I also liked the fact that they had an \"adults only\" pool....but we did not use it for this trip. Cleanliness (3*) because of slight musty smell) Location (4*) is really good...across the street from SeaWorld. So if you have children and this is your primary reason to visit San Diego, it is a good choice. It is close to beaches and has good access to freeways if going other places. I think it is very centrally located for a San Diego vacation. Rooms (3*) because they are nothing to get excited about (imho)....pretty standard room...two queen beds, desk, chair, TV, drawers for clothing, standard bath....tub/toilet separate from vanity, nice large closet. The negatives about the room...NO coffee pot!!! I thought that coffee pots were almost standard in all hotel rooms these days. They did have a \"coffee cart\" near the lobby that we walked to for coffee in the morning.....muffin and 2 coffee's were $11..The other negative was the fact that there is no \"window\" to allow fresh air. There is the \"old\" wall air conditioner/heater/vent units.....very NOISEY!!! The nobs were not on this particular one, so there was no way to adjust the heat level. The only way to allow fresh air was to leave the door open, or have the noisey fan running. The other negative was that there was no way to turn the porch light off. Because of the door/window set-up, this allowed quite a bit of light to shine into the room along the edge of the curtains....enough to be distracting all night. I am sure they have these lights stay on for safety reason, but I like dark room to sleep in. Service (4*) as the staff that we dealt with was very accommodating and we were able to get into our room early. Value (3*)....I did not mind the price that I got using the \"no name \" service...but I HATE being stuck with a $25 parking fee!!!! My biggest pet-peeve for hotels these days...and the thing I complain about all of the time....just charge more for the room, please...this is considered nickle & dimeing me, and having what I consider to be \"hidden fees\". (OK, so maybe I am old-school...but I still don't like it!!!) Would I \"chose\" to stay here?

They would either have to be on the payroll or they are not well travelled. Given what we believed to be the amenities of the resort, our intention was to stay a week and travel around So California from there - knowing there would always be plenty to do right on the resort grounds. I saw the resort on TLC's Jon & Kate Plus 8 and given Kate's stated penchant for clean, we had high expectations. The place is filthy. The grounds are neglected. There are potholes in the crazy roads that take you around th resort. The rooms are dark, dingy, old, tattered. We had a ferrell cat sitting outside our door on arrival. It was just yucky. We were taken aback by the amonia/urine smell as we entered the lobby to check in. That was the first clue but we decided to proceed. The first room we were given was in front of the main pool with a sandy beach (why this is necessary given their private beach is beyond me. It just makes the pool a dirty, sandy experience). The bathroom had been updated but the floors were dirty with hair and sand, the rest of the room was painted a brash yellow and the furniture - which they call 'distressed' looked like it came from Walton's mountain. The tv was an old 36\", there was no coffee pot in the room (you have to schlep to an outdoor vendor cart in the morning to get coffee), and the smell of mold was overwhelming. They graciously offered to move us. I have nothing to say about the staff we encountered. They clearly know that they are the only thing that would keep a guest at the facility. So, we felt as another family did that they try hard to be pleasant. The next room was larger but overall in worse shape. The yellow paint must have been a bargain because it is everywhere. We were afraid to walk on the carpets in bare feet so we put on socks. We put a towel on the floor of the tub so we did not have to touch the dingy, dirty bottom. The black on the socks was something I had never experienced anywhere. But it was the hair on the bathtowel and the bugs we found on the bath curtain that had us spend a day of our vacation in Paradise visiting other area hotels. There are great resorts nearby and they were a better value. We stayed in Torrey Pines and LOVED it. The hotel is going to undergo renovation but I would suggest that the housekeeping and grounds staff will not likely be renovated. So, if you get in early ... right after the renovation, your experience may be much different. (Though the pictures of the renovation showed that they were keeping the yellow paint which tells me they will not be truly rehabilitating the place but rather putting in new furniture.)

I will post pictures too at a later date, I took a lot of pictures of the place just for TA. So here's the (long) review: I booked my family (2 adults and 2 children) into the Paradise Point Resort in March 2009 - I came across their website through my searches for beachfront properties in San Diego, and there was a 48 hour online sale ($207 a night for a bayside 1br bungalow suite). It seemed like a great deal, especially with a full bay view, and a great location, so I booked it right away. The website showed a beautiful resort and rooms. Then I started reading the reviews and got worried, but I was still getting a really good price for a bayview room. I called the resort to ask some questions and raise my concerns about what I had read in the reviews. I called the 1-800 number, the reservations desk forwarded me to the concierge (thinking I wanted to ask questions about activities at the resort). The concierge told me that he would get the manager to call me back and talk to me - the manager (Joe) called me within 10 minutes. I expressed my concerns about the reviews I read (cleanliness, bugs, condition of rooms), he told me that while the rooms are older, the rooms were clean. I asked about the parking costs and he reduced it from $22 a day to $12 a day. I asked a few more questions and felt comfortable with his responses. We stayed at Paradise Point Resort from March 12 to March 19. I've tried to put all the details that we experienced while staying in this resort in this review, so it's really long... We arrived in the evening, around 8:30pm. When we arrived, there was one person at the front desk, and the lobby was empty. He was courteous and friendly and checked us into our room. He also gave me a card (it was a birthday greeting card from the resort, I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday when I called to ask questions). The front desk clerk (Jarrod) mentioned that the manager (Joe) had put us in one of the nicer bayside bungalows. The bellman showed us to our bungalow (he drove a golf cart and we followed him in our rental car). He opened our door for us and helped us with our luggage. We had bayside bungalow #542 (3rd from the last one on the street). The first thing the we did was whip out our cameras and take pictures of everything so I could post it in this review :) The 1br bungalow was clean, bright and really nice. The bar/kitchen area had a mini-fridge, sink, microwave, and coffee maker with complimentary coffee. There was a side table and metal ice bucket too. All were clean and ready for use - just note that it was more of a bar area than a kitchen. There are no utensils, or cooking things, or dishes, nor do they advertise it as such - we knew what to expect, so we came prepared with disposable cutlery and dishes and paper towel. The dining/living room area was nice and open, dining for four, with a large patio window overlooking the cove, two chairs and one ottoman in the living room area, storage coffee table with some magazines on top, two side tables with lamps, and a double sofa bed. There was an older but functional tv in a cabinet with drawers in the living room, and a similar set up in the bedroom. The drawers were clean. There was a newer wall air conditioner/heater unit in the living room and in the bedroom. The bathroom was an interesting design - there were two sink areas with large countertops (one in the bedroom, one in the living room) sandwiching the toilet and bathtub which had doors on both sides so that it was accessible through the living room or through the bedroom, and there was a big closet next to each of the sink areas, with two luggage stands - we could have used more hangers, but we made do (I didn't call and ask for more). The bedroom was big, with a king sized bed (nice bedding), and small bench at the foot of the bed, night tables, digital clock radio, phone, and lamps. The sink areas and kitchen areas were well lit, the bedroom was only lit by the side table lamps, the dining room and living room had adequate lighting, and the toilet/bathtub area had dim lighting with noisy fans. Everything was clean, I did check the corners and base mouldings (from reading one of the reviews), and they could have been cleaned a little better, but they weren't filthy. The carpet was clean but older. The distressed furniture style and mismatched furniture style doesn't quite match - it doesn't match the nice granite kitchen and sink countertops, or the crown moulding and chair railing, or the bedroom linens. The toilet and bathtub are old but clean. The towels were white, we had enough for 4 - they weren't very soft and plush because they're the ribbed kind, but they looked newer. There was gel soap bars in the sink areas and an oatmeal soap bar for the bathtub, as well as shampoo, conditioner, and something else (either lotion or body wash). Outside the front door we had a great view of the bay, and we had two outdoor chairs and table. The buildings are older, but we felt pretty good walking into our unit and checking it out. While we were taking pictures, we received a phone call. It was a clerk from the resort, welcoming us and asking whether everything was to our satisfaction. We mentioned that one of the bedroom lamps needed a new lightbulb, and within 5 minutes a maintenance man came and replaced the bulb. The sofabed is not very padded and you can feel every spring in it - it sagged in the middle a little, too - when I had asked the manager about it when I called the month prior (I saw some reviews mention how uncomfortable the sofabed was), he did mention that they could bring something to pad it more for us if we wanted. I would have called to ask for that, but the kids didn't once complain about it, slept well throughout the entire trip, and the only complaining was more about who was hogging more of the bed. I don't know how they slept on it - I tried it out just to see, and there was no way I would have had a comfortable sleep on it - but it worked for them. Our king sized bed was really comfortable, I slept really well all week. Bugs - I did find a centipede crawling on the air conditioning unit in the bedroom on our first evening, but we didn't see any other bugs in the unit until after our 3rd day there. It isn't surprising, though - by that time we had walked on the beach and tracked in some sand, we were using the kitchen area and had fruit and food items there, and we bought firewood to use in the firepits in the evening and they were inside behind the front door - plus, when housekeeping comes to clean, they leave the door open because they leave their cart outside while they clean. All in all, in 7 days, we saw 1 centipede, 3 spiders, and around 30 ants - the first time we saw some ants on the ceiling in the kitchen area (after day 3) - I left a message for housekeeping about it and they cleaned the walls, ceiling, floors, etc (it was pretty evident that they did). the next couple of days there weren't that many ants, just a straggler here and there, but then my kids found a bunch of them crawling on the floor in the closet where we kept all our shoes - which is why I suspect that we tracked them in with our sandals and slippers from the beach. I left a message for housekeeping to please clean the closet areas, and they did. Usually I'm quite phobic about bugs, but these were tiny little ants and they didn't really bother me - the spiders were small house ones. The kids actually enjoyed finding the ants in the closet. Our unit was a short walk to the nearest firepit on the beach in the cove, so it was a bit of a chore to lug the heavy patio chairs to and from the firepits as well as the firewood and supplies, but it was better to be where we were because it was a quieter unit being closer to the end and not being directly in front of the firepits and beach. We bought our firewood from the nearest Von's (the Island Market was selling firewood at just over double the cost of Von's), but we bought the Smores kit from the Island Market for $22 because it included the long wood sticks to cook the marshmallows. We enjoyed an open fire for three of the nights that we were there - the kids had fun playing on the beach in the dark and making Smores. They even caught some tiny baby fish or shrimp (not sure if these were baby grunions) the size of the eye of a needle when they scooped up water from the shoreline. We didn't have a problem securing the closest firepit on all three occasions, even though the entire resort was booked (and the firepits technically are public use). Each unit only has 2 patio chairs, so I called housekeeping and asked them for two folding chairs - the fellow who came couldn't find any but brought me two conference type chairs to use - they were just fine, and we kept them for the entire trip to use out on the beach. Our unit was also directly in front of the tennis courts and bike rental place, so we just walked across and rented a quad bike for just over half an hour and biked around the resort - the kids really enjoyed that. We used the main pool once, in the evening - there's not much lighting, and to me the pool didn't seem very warm, I was freezing, but my kids didn't seem to have a problem and happily swam about for over an hour. We did find one of the filters had come off and notified one of the maintenance crew. I didn't use the hot tub because there were a bunch of young adults using it (being spring break), but it seemed really nice. We got to the main pool by calling the front desk and asking them to send a cart over to our unit - it arrived in just 2 minutes. The walk from our unit to the pool wasn't really far, but in our slippers and suits at night it was better to hitch a ride. We also got a ride back from the pool. When we were dropped off my door key card stopped working, luckily we were able to flag the cart driver to let us into our unit - the next day we got new key cards. I called to ask for robes, and they brought us two large fluffy robes to use (only one size, XL), they were really warm and comfortable but they were really old and showed their wear. We hung out on the beach in the cove for one day for a couple of hours. The kids had fun playing in the sand and exploring the rocks down the way, looking for little crabs. The sand did have a lot of broken sea shells, and my daughter found a piece of broken glass, but other than that everything else was fine - the kids were running around the beach barefoot and didn't seem to have any problems. It was really nice being so close to the beach and cove from our room, we had leisurely breakfasts looking out at the view every day. SeaWorld is just a two minute drive from the resort. We decided to walk the distance - it just seemed so silly to be so close and drive two minutes to pay another $10 in parking and then have to walk in from the parking lot. My kids are 10 and 6 - and with a bag full of lunch, snacks and water, and a bag with warmer clothes for the evening, we walked from the resort, across the little bridge on Ingraham Road that separated the resort from SeaWorld, and up to the front of SeaWorld - it took us 15 minutes door to door each way. The walk was actually really nice because we walked pass Ski Beach and park, took in the view, we got to look down at some boats and fishermen when we were walking across the bridge, as well as some birds, and before we knew it we were there. On the walk back, we chatted about all the things we saw at SeaWorld, and it really made the time pass quickly. There's a view tower near the lobby and pool, we went up there on our last day, you can't really see much through the bars at the top, but on each stair landing you can get a good view of the pond and the pool. The spa is next to the main pool, the treatment costs are really extravagant, we didn't try any. We did not try out their restaurants since we bought food to eat in, and also ate out of the resort. We didn't have time to try out the mini golf, either, but we saw a lot of people out enjoying it. We also saw people enjoying the tennis courts, too. We checked out early in the morning, there was one person at the front desk, the lobby was empty again, and she printed out my receipt and that was it - she didn't ask me how my stay was, but was friendly and courteous. All in all we had a fabulous stay, all the staff were friendly and helpful and met our needs every time, housekeeping cleaned our room well every day and met all our requests (extra towels, extra coffee). I can only comment on the 1br bayside bungalow that we got (room 542) - and although it does show its wear in places, some parts of the room were updated and the overall atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing, and it was very functional for us. I'm really happy that we experienced this resort and even happier that our experience was one of the good ones. One note - as much as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and experience at Paradise Point Resort, I would say we got our money's worth (based on the price we paid) - I wouldn't have stayed there for full price, and after looking at the rest of the resort, I definitely wouldn't stay anywhere but in a bayside 1br bungalow - the whole point was to have the view and the beach, the other areas seemed gloomy and backed onto parking lots, roads, and other units. And I agree that the parking fee is unnecessary and should just be incorporated in the cost of the room, but I was satisfied with a discounted rate, better than nothing!

Because we were a party of 5, to many to fit in a regular taxi, we had to call for a shuttle every time we wanted to go anywhere. I recommend utilizing the resort's private beach.

The girls at the Front Desk are exceptional. Prior to our arrival I had the pleasure of talking to Renee, I was very concerned about all the negative reviews I was reading and she was very honest and assured me that we would have a great time, and WE DID.... Thank you Renee you're the BEST!!!! We were then escorted to our room, full of all this negative anticipation from the reviews we read we pleasantly surprised.

We were in the Orchid section which had a nice view of Mission Bay, and we even had the opportunity to see a SKUNK, wow they are beautiful...but then we went in our room :o) We chose to use the smaller pool which was right around the corner from our room, it was nice and quiet with a beach entry, towels are available at the pool for your use, there is a hot tub as well as torches and fire pits for evening relaxing. This Resort is amazing the landscape is something else, the landscapers have some job to keep this place so immaculate, every day they are vacuuming the streets, blowing out the falling leaves, trimming the shrubbery, what a job and it shows, it's truly beautiful. We were very close to Sea World if you were a walker you could even walk it, but we drove it's just over the bridge, we didn't eat in any of the restaurants or got to the Spa, what was I thinking?, so we can't tell you much about them other than they look nice from the outside. We had 2 minor problems, someone took our parking space and since they are assigned we were concerned about parking, the Front Desk immediately offered us alternate parking, the other problem was one day we were not provided towels, let me tell you in less than 5 minutes someone was at our door with warm hot towels. The Staff is exceptionally helpful and attentive to your every need. The one thing that we did not care for was the $22.00 per night parking fee, personally I think that's a lot $10-12.00 would be acceptable to me but every hotel is doing it so you can't get away from it, just hope you don't have a parking spot near the sprinklers. Pack your bags, go and have a great time and by the way, someone posted a photo of a piece of furniture that looked like it was painted and the paint was peeling off, well the motif of the hotel is that distressed look so it's suppose to look like that.

My son definitely enjoyed looking at them. The room itself was average. It had a bedroom with a King size bed that was comfortable and sheets were very clean. There were connecting bathrooms with two sink areas sharing a shower in the middle. The shower showed signs of wear and tear; however, the water pressure was excellent. Clean towels were also provided. The living room area had a pull out couch, two arm chairs, a futon, a small round table with 4 chairs and a small kitchenette with a sink and a microwave. Overall condition was average, but clean. When we first walked in there was a smell of moisture, however, once we opened the door and let some fresh air in and sprayed Fabreze, the smell was no longer noticeable. Our first night there we decided to have dinner at Baleen, a restaurant on premises serving above average priced food. The staff at Baleen were very accommodating, especially with our two babies - high chairs were provided. The food was a little disappointing. I had ordered a salmon dish, but it had a weird BBQ sauce and another flavor I couldn't put my finger on. The server gladly exchanged my dish to Seared Ahi Tuna - it was finger lickin' good. Other people in our party ordered Rib eye steaks, Chilean Sea bass and Lobster Tails - they were satisfied with the portions and taste. We ordered our desert to go and enjoyed it back in our suite. It was chilly that weekend, but the fresh air was very crisp and refreshing. The next morning everyone in our party decided to order breakfast in and enjoy it with the view of the ocean. This was perhaps the worst and the most disappointing service me or anyone in our party has ever received. All of us pretty much ordered egg dishes (how hard is it to make eggs?). It took us 4 phone calls and an hour and 15 minutes to track down and receive our breakfast. When the breakfast finally did arrive it was cold and missing butter for our toast and a large pot of coffee (they did deliver the creamer). We called the room service and spoke with Patricia number of times regarding the condition of our breakfast and the missing items. SHE offered a refund and we accepted. The missing items never arrived and we decided to let them know at which point she stated in a not-so-pleasant-customer-oriented tone that 'were were the ones who requested a refund and shouldn\u2019t be getting the rest of the items\". This was absolutely not true and simply an unacceptable way to deal with customers. Although we did receive our money back, it wasn't what we were looking for. We wanted a nice, relaxing weekend with good service but it was cut short after our breakfast incident. We checked out right away with disappointment. I MAY recommend this to a friend, but definitely not the room service. I have placed a phone call to the Service Manager, but have not received a call back.

The resort is in bad shape, every where you look. The room, this time bayside lanai, was very dated. Furniture ready to be changed out. Nicks on walls, outside door/windows/paint/door matts all in very bad shape. Room smelled moldy and musty. Refigerator in room, very loud and leaking water onto the wood furniture (part of the smell), needed to unplug at night just to sleep. The pool furniture at the adult pool, broken. The pool area was kept clean, and the pool bathrooms looked to be udpated with new tile. The ponds are nice to look at, but also in need of repair, the main pond by the big pool, has what appears to be a bridge that has broken apart and not repaired, and that end of the pond was in very bad shape. Because I was so bothered by the shape of property after arriving, I refused to pay for any services on property, including food, so enjoyed all meals off property. If you are attending a large gathering event, such as family reunion or wedding, I think the place would be nice to gather, and you don't have to worry about damaging the rooms, since they are already in bad shape, the property could be alot of fun for a gathering, but for a couple, looking for a resort, this is NOT the place!

The room reminded me of beach front condos we have rented and have also enjoyed. We stayed in a bayside studio and it was clean and comfortable. It was very quiet! I think that is also dependent on your neighbors no matter where you stay. We loved being able to step out of our room with our daughter to go play in the sand and watch the beautiful sunsets! It also had the convenience of a small kitchen that had a small fridge, a microwave and a full sized coffee pot. We bought our own drinks and snacks. The employees were all very cordial and accommodating. The restaurants had great food. The barefoot grill had a wonderful atmosphere with a great view on the bay. Kids enjoyed feeding the fish and the frequent visits from the seagulls. We knew it would be pricey to eat on the grounds. The hotel IS overpriced overall. The $22 parking fee was no surprise thanks to the other reviewers and when we were checking out other hotels in San Diego, most of them had a $20 parking fee. We were taken by the hotel tax! In summary, this a great place to get away from it all and be with your family. I suggest staying in a studio or bungalow, if feasible, to get a better room judging from the other reviews.

We wanted a water-facing room with easy access to a nice beach--and was able to get a good 30% off deal one of the Bayside bungalows because we stayed 3 nights. I read through a lot of the reviews, and I can see why this resort gets such a mixed reaction. First of all, the place is HUGE and you know that they have to fill a lot of rooms in order to cover the operating costs. I'm sure that's why there are a lot of priceline opportunities---but beware as there is a vast difference in the set up of accommodations for each price point. If you're not specifically paying for a standalone bungalow (lagoon or bayside), then you're likely in something of a motel like structure with cramped patios right beside each other. Even the bunaglow are pretty close together, and your neighbors can really impact the quality of your stay. The front grassy area and firepits are all shared. This would actually be nice if you had a couple families traveling together. The view from the bayside bungalows as represented on the website are artfully misleading. It is not nearly the hidden away paradise you think---across the bay is a lot of traffic along a busy road. Having said that, the cove waters are very calm and great for young children to splash around in (although the signs warning you of potential high bacteria count does give you pause). From the cove you can see the Sea World fireworks at night which is a nice bonus. The bunaglow itself was well appointed. It was great having a separate living area so that while preschooler napped or went to bed, you could read/watch TV/talk/relax on the patio. There were two separate bathroom sink areas on either side of the main bathtub/toilet room. Housekeeping was difficult to schedule if you didn't want your room cleaned on their usual scheduled rounds--as in it didn't happen one day. Again, the size of the place probably really hurts their ability to provide flexible service. One of the best tips I can give is to bring your own snack food and bottles of water. Our bungalow had a little kitchenette with fridge, and it is way more convenient and cost-efficient to bring goodies yourself. Our stay contained both weekdays and a Saturday. The pools are really lovely but do get extremely crowded on the weekend. Even the ancillary pools that were practically empty during the week were jam packed on Saturday. Thank you tripadvisor reviews as we knew to stake out our pool deck chairs early on in the morning! The spa is not quite at the level it should be. I had booked a month in advance one of their signature treatments (Javanese Royal Treatment). The treatment itself was great. However, they had no lockers available when I got there (I guess the fitness center shares lockers with the spa...but geez, I had pre-booked a couple hundred dollars worth of services and they can't set aside one?), they had failed to tell me when I booked that my therapist would be a man (doesn't bother me, but I think some women might not be comfortable), and the toiletries were pretty sub-par. The on-site Barefoot Bar & Grill is OK. Prices are a bit high, but the setting is really nice by the water. Food service by the main pool is nice, but they don't serve breakfast. The resort itself is lots of fun. Ducks and fish to feed (best thing we brought was our own loaf of bread--although you can buy duck and fish food at the gift store), covered cycle carts to rent, miniature golf, nice pools. We had planned to not leave the grounds during our entire stay and we were never bored. So in summary: if you are willing to pay more to stay in one of the bungalows, are prepared by bringing your own drinks and snacks, and don't expect too much in the way of luxury, this can actually be a really nice family getaway. Stay away from weekends if you can.

As a result, we didn't get to use everything the place had to offer, but next time we're in San Diego, we'll probably stay here again with the intent of doing more at the resort. Our room was nice but musty and the air conditioner wasn't great - it seemed like there was some kind of humidity problem in the room and I don't really want to think about what kind of mold might have caused that smell. I didn't see any, at least. The pool is great - well heated, with a really shallow, almost beach-like side that is perfect for under-4, can't-swim kids, while still offering a lot of space for big kids to swim and splash. The location is fantastic - only minutes from great SD beaches, minutes from Sea World, minutes from the airport (which is noticeable when the planes fly over during the day). But it's an interior part of the bay, so the beaches at the resort itself are a bit stagnant - no waves, and it was slimy when we were there. The concierge recommended the perfect seafood restaurant with a kid-friendly menu. Next time we go, we'll try the miniature golf and the croquet, and maybe check out the bike rentals. We didn't do the s'mores special (the firepits are on the resort's beaches), but even though it's pricey, it was tempting anyway. We ate breakfast at Barefoot, out on the deck, and it was typical hotel breakfast fare at typically expensive hotel breakfast prices. They're pretty good about controlling the birds out there, and hotel staff were feeding the fish in the pond by the restaurant, and let our kids help - which was probably the highlight of their stay. Oh yeah, and they charged us $22 to park there, which I thought was a bit rough considering that the rooms are scattered all over the place, not in one big building.

After all, I pricelined it and you get what you get and can't get a refund. I believe the average price of this resort lies somewhere between $160-200 per night for a standard room. We got a standard room. However, the priceline price was for $70 a night, add in the $22 a night the resort charges and we got our room for $92 per night (not including taxes, fees, yada yada yada). I thought that was a fair price all things considered. I consider myself a fairly well seasoned travel for my young ripe old age of 34. I have stayed in a lot of resorts & hotels. Here is my breakdown of this place: The room: We received a standard room, with 2 queen beds, 2 sitting chairs & 1 table (awkardly long & placed strangely in the room). There was a small refrigerator in the room, a coffee maker, hairdryer, iron & ironing board. The refrigerator & television were housed in the armoire, along with the coffeemaker. You receive soap for your face, soap for your body, shampoo, conditioner & body wash. The towels are a bit rough. They are not soft towels, I did not like them. The refrigerator did not have a door on the little freezer compartment that is in the refrigerator & the side bar inside was broken off so we could not stick anything in the side of the door. I noticed those weird \"wood bugs\" crawling around on the inside of the armoire...ok....eek. The shabby chic thing is not working for the room decor. It looks trashy & yucky. Rooms are in need of a paint job & new furniture. The walls were dirty. I always look at the walls, the baseboard & the corners of the floor in the bathroom areas of hotels to determine if they properly clean and this one failed. Yuck. The maids really need to do a better and more precise job of cleaning. The bathtub was oddly retiled over or something. It definately needed an upgrade as well. Upon walking through the door of our room the \"tack board\" (nails and all) were exposed where some of the carpet was torn up right along the edging of the carpet against the door. Our young daughter stepped on this more than once when she would walk up to look out the window. Rooms need: new furniture & the hotel needs to dispose of their ugly shabby chic design, it's just not working here! Can we get some nice bathrobes in the room for guests to use? This place is supposed to be a 3 1/2 star resort, come on...act like one. The beds were comfortable but I just felt like the room needed to be cleaned or something... As a side note I broke out in hives while staying here. I have no idea what type of detergent is used in the bedding, etc. I tried at the front desk and they could not reach the housekeeping manager so they gave me her phone #. But when I call I only get voicemail. Other incidentals: Charging for parking? come on! $22 for a parking space. Do you know that customers do not like to be nickeled and dimed to death? Just incorporate the parking charge into the price of your daily rate, how hard can it be? Front desk staff: very nice but both times I visited (to check in and check out) there was only one person working and there was at least a 10-15 minute wait to be helped. Seemed like the one person working up there was overwhelmed both times and had no back up? Pools: We visited the main pool on one occasion. Very nice. Has a little beach/sand area and a shallow area for the little ones to play in. Was not overcrowded at all when we were there. The main pool is the only pool out of the 5 pools on the resort that is heated. The other pool areas looked nice, some have big gas flame heater things that they turn on at night. Grounds are lovely. Nice landscaping, you can go for a stroll along the pond or through the resort. It's nice to have a place to roam. I loved, and so did my daughter, all of the ducks in the duck ponds. There are tons of places, gazebos, sitting areas, to sit and lounge and be by yourself. The lobby itself is nicely appointed and HUGE...lots of places to sit, fireplaces, etc. Some people stated in other reviews that if you get a room too far back in the resort it can be a long walk to get from point A to point B. Not neccesarily. I didn't find it difficult to get from one end to another. But then again I love walking. The resort is within walking distance to the beach. The beach was nice & clean. The only issue I found were there was lots of shards of seashells that if stepped on could feel like little pieces of glass but I never cut my foot. There are about 10 firepits on the beach for guests to use, however you have to buy your wood elsewhere or buy it from the marketplace on the resort. We did not eat at either of the restaurants. I did buy items from the resort market place. A little overpriced but not terrible. I bought a San Diego coffee mug for $8, mango sugar lipglos for $4, newspapers, huge bottles of water are $4. Some of their clothing & other tourist items are way expensive, you can probably get those things elsewhere for less if you care to . There is a little coffee cart right outside of the market place where you can get muffins, bananas, lattes, etc. I had a cappuccino frozen latte $7.50 ( a little spendy) but hey, what the heck...indulge a little right? All in all this is a very nice property. I am assuming that the more deluxe rooms/suites are decorated much nicer and are much cleaner than the \"standard\" rooms. At least I would hope so for the price some people pay to stay here! Not me, I priceline if I can. I was also a little surprised at the lack of character of some of the buildings, some had these goddy looking structures over the doors (see my photo). I still liked the resort, I just wish they'd do some more upgrading.

There was also a couch that looked like it was a sofa sleeper as well. We were right next to the Adult Lagoon pool -which was heated as well as a \"just right\" in temperature jacuzzi. We chose to stay onsite and eat at Baleen. We called to concierge and they picked us up from our room and dropped us off at the resturant. We ate outside and were kept nice and warm with the heaters. I highly recommend the Filet Mignon - cooked perfect with a pepper crust and the portion was large. My GF had the Ahi Tuna and she could barely finish her plate.

It was dark, had mis-matched furniture and even a non-matching cover for the toilet tank (a smaller, differently-shaped cover had been placed over the tank - tacky!).

That room was so much better - airy, bright, a little kitchenette, large space with a king-sized bed and queen pullout couch (but even my 10yo daughter complained about how uncomfortable the mattress was). We were very happy with that room. The resort is nice - since it was off season only the largest of their 5 pools was heated (but all the hot tubs were), which was fine for us. We used the compliementary ping pong and the pro-shop let us use the tennis courts for free (usually $20/hour which seems spendy). We ate at the Barefoot Grill and it was fine - usual resort prices. They have all kinds of boat rentals which seemed fun - we just ran out of time as we had gorgeous weather and spent a day at Mission & Pacific Beaches. Bell staff were all very friendly and helpful.

There was no real desk, except a hutch to pull out and sit uncomfortably under the TV. The furniture looked quite used (even if they're trying to replicatate an antique look) and the walls were dirty and scratched. The sliding glass door didn't fully close or lock, though it did have a safety bar in it. On the plus side, the beds were big and comfortable and had nice sheets. The $10 a day for internet is really uncalled for in the 21st century of wireless networks; what's worse, you have to plug in an ethernet cable; you don't even have a wifi choice. Room service also charges a $4 \"delivery fee.\" What I've loved about other resorts I've stayed at was the fact that these types of amenities are simply part of the package; here it felt like getting nickled and dimed everywhere I turned. There's also no shuttle services to anywhere and since it's in the middle of an island, it makes it pretty boring or expensive if you don't have a car. As for the service, the bellhops and tram drivers were excellent, but the front desk is on the slow side. Anytime I called the front desk I was put on hold for a long period of time.

This ended up being OK for me because I was there for an intense conference, and not paying for a \"vacation resort experience\". None the less, here are my comments: My check-in process was fine, although when I asked to have my reservation stating I was there with a conference, I was told that because I booked through a third party they could not put that in, but that I would get \"everything that all conference attendees get\". Not the case. They tried to charge me 10.00/day for internet use, and when I stated I was supposed to get free internet due to being a conference attendee, I was told this was not the case because I had booked through a third party (Orbitz). I had to go to the conference staff, and they did eventually get me free internet. I had their basic \"garden\" room. My room was OK--I had some trouble sleeping due to the bright light outside my door (covered by a somewhat thin curtain). And noise carried very easily from adjacent rooms, so much so that I could hear other people's conversations. Bring earplugs. The resort itself is pretty with several pools, and you can take a nice walk along the beach around the resort. At night I found the lighting to be poor in certain areas of the resort, which could be an issue for elderly. The food we had for lunches at the conference was delicious. I ate most of my meals after conference hours at the Barefoot Bar and Grill, which had pretty decent food, although somewhat pricey and not a lot of healthy options. I was able to use the fitness center for free (but like other people have said ,their usual charge is 12.00). The fitness center is actually halfway decent, with 4 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, and 2 stairmasters, along with freeweights and some weight machines. I really wonder how much they stick to their policy of charging 12.00 to use the fitness room because most days I just walked right in and no one asked me anything. I did treat myself to an Indian Scalp massage and hand and foot massage at the Spa, which I had heard was good. I was somewhat disappointed--my massage was mediocre at best, and $150 for a total one hour mediocre treatment seemed to add salt to the wound. My massage therapist's name was Jesus, so I would try to book someone else if you go to the spa. The concierge in the hotel lobby was extremely helpful and friendly.

Overall, it's a nice place and very convenient to Sea World, but the place is just crying out for some renovations. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, but the rooms feel old and dilapidated. We originally had a Lanai Garden room with a King bed and a sofa bed. It felt very run down, old, small and although the room was clean, it just felt a little dirty. Definitely needs some updating.

A few other observations: -We ate at their Barefoot Bar & Grill for dinner and again for lunch. Service was really slow at night and a little better at lunch time. Food was a bit overpriced and the quality was sub-par, particularly for the price. The nearby restaurants in Mission Beach are much better and a lot more reasonable. -We rented a paddle boat and a motorboat from the marina and they were fantastic. Really helpful and the prices were reasonable. -We went to the \"Pro Shop\" to play tennis and found the courts to be pretty run down; the tennis rackets available to be borrowed were a joke. Old, beaten up, too small and in horrible shape. I think they were paddle tennis rackets. Also, the ping pong table was gone, so we couldn't do that either. -The main pool has a beach which is cool and it was pretty easy to get a drink. We were there in August - high season - and the pool was pretty clean and not very crowded. We got 4 chairs for the family pretty easily, which says a lot about the place. Two thumbs up for having lots of chairs at the pool. The other outlying pools were also relatively uncrowded and were great for kids because they are pretty shallow. -Proximity to Sea World was great. If you don't count waiting in line to pay the $12 to park at Sea World, you're no more than 5 minutes from the front gate. Unless you stay in a Beachside room, just try to plan on being away from your room as much as possible, so you're not bothered by the tiny size.

Our bathroom was great and looked refurbished. The bedding was spotless, but the rest of the furniture was shabby and chipped and the walls were scuffed. There were stains on the carpet, but they had been hoovered and it was generally clean. Our room didn't smell, but the kids room did smell musty. We suffered what other reviewers have mentioned - our rooms were not ready when we arrived at 5pm! The second room was not ready until 6.30pm, an hour and a half after check in - though in their defense they immediately and without us asking gave us $100 on the room to go and have a drink whilst we waited, but it is frustrating when you've had a long journey. As others have said the parking fee is a bit cheeky and not needed when a room is so expensive. The restaurant food ( Barefoot grill place) was fine, but again, they let themselves down. The outdoor furniture hadn't been treated, so the legs of the chairs and tables were rotting and the seats needed sanding and re-varnishing. The second day, all of the waiting staff had dirty uniforms at breakfast - there's no need for this and the manager should be looking out for this sort of thing.

I almost have grown up at this hotel, as we go at least once every year. Every year I grow more and more in love with it, and when the occasion arises, it has always been my dream wedding destination. Yes, it is pricey, but I believe it is well worth every dollar. I have read the reviews here and have no idea where they are coming from. The pool at paradise point is one of my favorites. I have stayed here almost 20 years, and have never seen a \"weird greenish tint\" to it. In fact, the pool has just been remodeled over the past few years, and is absolutely breath taking. The main reason why I love Paradise Point is the landscaping. It's breath taking. Since this hotel is older, all the plants are full grown and absolutely magnificent. My favorite thing to do is to just walk around the hotel and explore and take in the scenery. (esp at night when all the torch lights are light...) If you are a fan of being able to explore and walk around your hotels, you'll like it here. And that beautiful San Diego weather just adds to the charm! The hotels may be starting to show there wear, but I would never compare them to a \"motel.\" anytime we have had a problem with the room (ie, one time our drain in the shower didn't work) someone came out that day to fix it. And, seeing as this hotel is on the beach, you can expect the usual wear from simply being near water. My only complaint is that since new owners, the place has started to cater to a different, less family oriented crowd. I def miss the old barefoot grill with the sand pit! ;) and the old breakfast buffet where the check ins currently are. But those reasons aren't strong enough to keep me away! Anyone who cannot see the beauty in this place needs to open their eyes. To me, this hotel is not like the usual cookie cutter \"corporate\" hotels. It has character. And I think you will find the more you stay, the more you'll want to go back. Paradise Point is my favorite place to get away, stay for a week, and never even leave the hotel.

We just finished a two night stay at Paradise Point. It was my husband, our 14 yo daughter and me. First of all, we stayed in a Junior suite. This is a little pricier than a standard room but it is a larger room with a sitting area, a tiny kitchette area and a very nice bathroom arrangement. When I originally booked in early March the Jr Suite were pretty expensive so I decided to settle for the standard room. However I kept checking prices and the suites came down in price so I changed my reservation to the Junior Suite. The main reason I love Paradise Point is because our room backed up on to a lovely shaded green belt. We had a small patio with chairs. There was a pond near us and every morning I would drink my coffee, read the paper and sit on the patio while ducks would meander by. I just found it peaceful, tranquil, lovely and exactly what I look for in a vacation rest. I will agree that the rooms aren't 5-star quality. But this is a very old place and what the rooms are, is clean and comfortable. They are freshly painted and the decor is 'shabby chic' or maybe they are just shabby (?) but I really had no complaints. The room was clean, the bathroom was very nice with double sinks and granite countertops. The bed was comfortable and I slept wonderfully. My only real complaint was there were no instructions with the coffee maker. The first day I didn' use nearly enough water. The second day I figured it makes about 6-8 cups. I probably could have called to find out. We played the 18 hole putting green, ate at the Barefoot Grill and my husband and daughter rented a jet-ski and jet-skied around Mission Bay. We all relaxed a lot and in a very beautiful setting. I am a person who reads hotel reviews religiously, am very picky about where I stay and really thought twice about Paradise Point based on some of the reviews. But I think it comes down to what you really want. I've had San Diego vacations where we've stayed Downtown in a high-rise with all the moden conveniences and walked the Gaslamp up and back and took in a baseball game. Tons of fun. And I had this vacation where I sat on a patio, fed the ducks, did the daily crossword, enjoyed an absolutely beautiful parklike setting and just relaxed. Both were great vacations and both cost about the same. San Diego isn't cheap for any quality hotel but for what Paradise Point is, it is unique and we will definitely go back.

The cost is more expensive then an inland hotel, but it was the best place for us because of the young children that were traveling with us. We stayed in the bungalow again and were first put into a room that had little sand and mostly rock with a dangerous incline. My daughter is 4 yrs old and the other child with us was 6 yrs. so when i contacted the front desk and explained my situation they gladly switched my rooms. I was afraid they wouldn't be able to because we stayed during the 4th of July weekend and it was full, but they accomodated me and i wish i could remember that girl's name because she was very helpful upon check in and when i changed out the room! I probably won't do a 4th of July weekend again because there were too many people on the beaches during that weekend and Sea World was crazier than it usually is. It took us over an hour to enter Sea World because we went on the 4th! With the exception of one family who wouldn't allow us to share the firepit on the beach, we had excellent neighbors. Our kids played with each other and we all sat on the beach and talked and relaxed! This is the perfect hotel because the bungalows sit right on the bay so there is plenty of sand and water for the kids to play in. This is not the hotel if you're looking for an exceptional room. It's dated but comfortable. The sofa bed is definitely not comfortable at all, but even my sofa bed at home that is only a year old and rarely used is not comfortable. So we bring an air bed that sets up in a matter of minutes. Because of the young children we haven't tried dining out at their restaurant which i hear is pretty pricey but i have ordered room service and it's decent as far as room service goes. We love having the mini fridge and microwave in the room. We bought fruit for the kids to munch on and sandwich fixings and then had popcorn as we watched TV, which wasn't much! With the location and the weather you can't help but be outside! We took our own beach chairs since the ones on the patio are heavy and hard to move from the patio to the beach but our chairs fold are easy to transport. You have to come prepared to relax and the firepits aren't in front of every room...it's more like one to every four rooms, which we didn't have a problem until the one family said we couldn't share with them (my kids wanted to roast marshmallows) because another family was coming to visit them. I brought my 4 yr old inside crying but this was no fault of the resort. We could see the firepit from our window and their \"friends\" never showed up! But other than them, last year and this year we had no problems making friends! I like it better that way! But no one is bothering you unless you make contact...everyone is friendly, the housekeeping, room service and front desk personnel were all helpful and courteous and after 2 yrs there is no doubt that i would stay here again and recommend it to others!

However, there is no beach, but a bay with views of apartments and freeways. There are no chairs provided to guests at the coast, who are left with option of taking the patio chairs from someone's bayfront room - without getting caught. There also is an abundance of pine trees - and a shortage of palm trees - by the shore which reduces the tropical vibe. The decor of the rooms are decorated based on a New England Hampton theme as opposed to a tropical theme. The red plaid couches, the colonial headboard and lamps and the (sparse) artwork on the walls all should be removed in favor of a tropical theme, like the rattan mirror and chairs in the rooms. However, I love the spacious bungalows! The bathrooms are marble palaces and the bath products are of spa quality.

Baleen is a 4-star restaurant, with a $40 price-fix menu to match, except the menu was limited to steak, seabass or quail.

I called the hotel and asked a bunch of questions. The agent on the phone was exceedingly helpful and I drilled her with questions. She satisfied my interest and I took the leap of faith. Great Decision! Amalie loved seeing the ducks. My schmoozing of the agent resulted in a very nice room upgrade at no cost.

There were fish and ducks to feed. Walking paths were nice. There was a movie at the pool in the evening. We used an outside pizza delivery service right to our door. Disadvantages: Like so many other reviews, our room was not ready at 3:00 pm when we arrived. They said they'd call but didn't. We didn't get into our room until 4:30. There was no room service menu in our room. Our portable crib requested at check-in didn't come until almost 7:00. The restaurants were expensive and not really geared to someone with kids. Golf carts to get you around were a nice touch but seemed to disappear after dark...and this is a place where you can really get turned around. No ammenities are really provided. I've stayed at Best Westerns that will give you a toothbrush if you've forgotten one. This place will nickel and dime you to death. As I mentioned, we were there because of airport snafus. We had no luggage. 6 diapers, a pack of wipes, two toothbrushes and a mini toothpaste set me back about $24. All that said, this seems like a great place to come with a family if you are prepared. We met many families from Orange County who come as a getaway with the kids. They bring snacks, waters and toys for the kids. They enjoy the pool, movies, beach and walking paths. It's a gorgeous place with room to explore. Despite some of the negatives, I believe we'd come again if the price was right.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cFar From Paradise\u201d", "Author": "3LilBears", "ReviewID": "UR16530068", "Content": "We planned an overnight stay in San Diego and we picked this hotel since it was close to a lot of attractions (Sea World, San Diego Zoo, Fashion Valley Mall).

This review is for the Paradise Point Resort and Spa. \u201cOh, you\u2019re gonna love San Diego\u201d they all told us as we travelled down from San Francisco. Well I\u2019m not sure that we saw the true San Diego (given that we had a 3 night stay and both Sea World and San Diego Zoo to fit in as part of our Southern California Attraction Pass), but overall we were very disappointed. The journey down from Anaheim was hell on wheels. A 4+ hour crawl like nothing we\u2019d seen on the holiday prior to that. We got to the resort late afternoon and at first all appeared fine. The grounds are large and well maintained. I likened it to an upmarket Centre Parcs (for all the Brits reading this) \u2013 a series of bungalows with a shared front door which then leads left or right to your room. You park outside your bungalow in a number bay. The rooms were pretty weird. An eclectic mix of aged furniture of all different styles and colours, a drab kitchenette and an odd sliding door directly opposite the beds to the bathroom. There was a patio door to a small patio overlooking a large pond (no, not a pool; a green weedy pond \u2013 somewhat of a risk for young kids). Lighting was poor and hot fully functioning and the air con was a beast of a thing in the corner of the room that nearly had the place taking off when it was turned on. Our closest pool was quite small and very shallow: more suited to small kids. There were a couple larger pools on site but not exactly close at hand. The reception building was simply a place to check in and out but the staff were extremely polite and efficient. Eating wasn\u2019t easy. The location, opening hours and offering were not very appealing hence we did our own thing off-site. All in all, the brochure picture looked stunning and this was the second most expensive nightly stay after the Beverly Hilton. What with the journey down to San D and then a nervously early set off to LAX to allow plenty time, we really think we would have preferred 6 more nights in Anaheim (for the same price as our 3 at Paradise Point). If you want to spend loads of cash paying for extra sports activities on site then OK but to be honest, having had such a great holiday, Paradise Point was a big let down \u2013 definitely not paradise for us. As for Sea World, well, after Disney I\u2019m afraid it cannot compare. I\u2019ve done Sea World in both Florida and San Diego and I won\u2019t be going back. San Diego Zoo was also disappointing. Some good areas but also quite a lot of very bedraggled enclosures that were really not what I was expecting. The bus tour is useful to get your bearings but overall, the zoo is quite hard to get round and very hilly in places. Food offerings and gift shops at both attractions are poor.

I loved the location because it's easy to drive to other places, but it still feels like a private resort. It didn't even feel like we were in a city. The entrance when you drive in is pretty as well as the lobby. At check in we asked to get an ocean front room, but they were all booked. We went to our room after check in and the room was nice. Small TV, but we weren't planning on really spending much time watching TV. We didn't really have a view except grass where you can walk around, but it was still a nice room. The room looks exactly like it does on the website. My main complaint is that the room had a strange smell and the beds were big, yet a little firm for my taste. Also, we ordered in room service and the food was okay. Not something I'd order again. I go the Ahi Tuna and it wasn't at all what i was expecting. My boyfriend got pizza and that was really good though. The pool's really pretty and heated which I liked. I'm basically giving this place 5 stars basically because the room is spacious and nice. The resort as a whole felt like Hawaii and we felt everyone was there for leisure as opposed to a place like a big hotel where it's a mix of business people and tourists. We wanted something special and a place that felt like a romantic getaway and we got that for the most part. We weren't expecting anything extravagant because we only paid 140 for the night.

The best meals we had were in the 5 star restaurant that was, unfortunately, a few years later converted into a banquet hall (What a bunch of idiots!) On our second stay the prices were higher (both food and room) and our only complaint was that the music from the live band at the restaurant was too loud in the evening (I think it was the Barefoot). Our third stay and the prices were higher again. The room service staff were pleasant and for the most part timely. The pool side restaurant had removed the spicy Buffalo wings from the menu (What a bunch of idiots!) and my wife had several minor complaints (can't remember what they were.) Her complaints were not being addressed, so, she asked to speak to the manager (don't remember the ladies name) and would you believe it, the manager refused to come out to the front desk to speak to my wife! Unbelievable! Our 4th stay in May '07 we had a larger suite with a double bathroom. I didn't like the location because it was next to the storm drain. Which is just an ugle eyesore, and what parent wants their kids playing next to an unsanitary storm drain? Incidently, the storm drain beach is the family beach where all the larger families stay because that's where the bigger rooms are. I have several complaints from our last stay. Maid service has definitely gone down hill; on one instance we asked for some sugar packs and ketchup and we got tissue and cotton balls--slight translation problem here? But my biggest complaint is smokers! Try and relax in a beach chair with a magazine and a great view while some idiot is upwind puffing away on a cancer stick! In the Baleen restaurant there were cigar smokers on the outside patio. So, we figured, \"well let's just eat inside.\" What a bad decision! All the smoke was blowing inside the restaurant!!

The first room we checked into had \"leftovers\" in the toilet, and a great deal of hair on the floor of the bathroom. The tub was dirty, and the non-skid surface of the tub was peeling up. The room smelled strongly of mildew, and the bed was very old and cheap for a supposedly \"upscale\" resort. To top it all off, the curtains would not fully close over the floor-to-ceiling windows, allowing a foot-and-a-half wide unobstructed view of us in our bed to anyone who cared to walk by. Since the room was filthy, we asked for a different room. Management complied by putting us in a room that was smaller, also smelled strongly of mildew, did not have adequate lighting to fully light the room, and the curtains still left a foot-wide gap through the windows. So, we went back to the front desk again. This time, the management gave us a suite that was, in their words, \"one of the best units on the property\". Being a one-bedroom suite, it was certainly acceptably roomy. But that's the best thing I can say for it. Even though it was a \"luxury suite\", the furnishings were still terribly cheap and uncomfortable. Exact same bed as in the two other rooms. Smelled just as strongly of mildew as the two previous rooms. Still unacceptably dirty (there was a a dirty plunger and several wadded-up pages of a newspaper on the stoop in front of our unit), but we just didn't have enough energy to complain anymore. The carpet was a worn, threadbare, indoor-outdoor carpet that was fraying along all the edges and along the seam in the center of the room. To top it all off, there is an additional $22/night charge for parking - which is not even covered, it simply gives you an uncovered (and undersized) parking space on the asphalt in front of the unit. In short, this hotel simply does not meet expectations. The grounds of the resort are OK, but the room quality is two-star at best. I'm not exaggerating - the rooms are along the lines of what I would expect to find if I stayed in a discount hotel along the side of a deserted highway somewhere. Which would be fine, had I paid a two-star discount hotel rate. Which I didn't. The \"discounted rate\" that I paid for this trip was more than what a legitimate three-star hotel costs at the full price. In fact, In the past I've paid less to stay at legitimate four-star hotels hotels in the San Diego area. Be warned - this property is old, run-down and until they give it a complete renovation there will be many other hotels in the area that can give you a better experience for the money.

Our first night in we were so late that we ended up ordering room service...just a pizza...but wow, what a pizza! Breakfast the next morning, on the waterfront, was also excellent. Their premier restaurant, Baleen, looked gorgeous...also on the water with a beautiful deck. Wish we had more time! The grounds are beautiful and, as the property is 44 acres, there are plenty of areas to walk and explore. Even though the resort was heavily booked, it never felt crowded. Wonderful espresso cart...best mocha ever, right next to the resort market..but only open until 11AM, I believe. Nice bird sanctuary area to relax with your morning coffee...or walk to the beach and enjoy it there. 4 separate pool areas throughout the property. 1 is for 18 and older only, another perfect for children, etc. We did not try the spa, will definitely use it next time. Also beautiful. Only recommendation I would make is to verify the type of room you want. When making our reservation we thought we were getting a room identical to what we saw on line after speaking with reservations, not the case however, we were not dissatisfied..we just didn't have an opportunity to enjoy sitting outside of our room as the front porch area didn't receive any sun.

The grounds are beautiful. Extremely spread out. Our room-nice king bed, with couch and two extra chairs, plus a desk and chair. Also had a wood armoire with TV and mini fridge. I liked the bedspread on the bed. It made me think more of home or a bed and breakfast rather than a generic hotel bedspread. Our fridge did not work. It lacked a temperature knob and wasn't even plugged in. There was coffee left for us, but no coffee pot. I'm sure we could have asked about the fridge and coffee pot, but it really didn't matter to us. You could definitely tell that the place was old. The last night we were there, the armoire door came off one of the hinges. It was a heavy door and I didn't want it falling off the other hinge in the middle of the night. We called the front desk and someone came to take the door off completely. It wasn't something that was a quick fix because the wood of the armoire was worn and old. Again, it wasn't something that concerned us cause we were leaving the next day. We did not have a car, but from what I understand, it costs $17-$25 to park your car. ( I don't know the exact number). The bar/grill at the hotel is WAY overpriced. We didn't want to eat there, but we were starving and didn't have a choice. The gym is located in their spa. The gym cost $10 or $15 but we had a reduced rate. Small gym, but they had what I needed. All of the machines are brand new. Each bike, treadmill and ellitical had it's own tv and they gave you water, headphones and a towel. The changing room was very nice as well. The grounds are very extensive and spread out. If you call the front desk, they will send a golf cart to take you to other places in the resort. You really need a car at this resort as there is no other place closeby to walk to. I don't feel as though the prices they charge for this place are worth it. They were charging $185. Considering that you have to pay to park, are limited on the food choices and that it is old, I think you could do better in the SD area. If you could get in this place for under $150, I think it would be ok. The proximity to Sea World is outstanding and that is one positive point. There are lots of restaurants within close driving distance. One other positive point is that the meeting and banquet facilities at this place are outstanding. The rooms and the restrooms are beautiful. Also, the staff was always very friendly. So, I give the 3 circles because we had some good and some bad with our trip.

The grounds are absolutely beautiful and very tropical. It is quite a bit to get around within the resort but nothing horrible. We did enjoy walking and there is a great climate there. The staff was pleasant. We had a lagoon bungalow which was very nice and clean and very nicely furnished. Some of them did need some work on the outside. One problem that we did have is that half of the window was not covered by a blind or heavy curtain, only a very sheer curtain, which let in very bright sunlight early in the morning and made it very hard to sleep in if you wanted to. At night you had to be careful where you stood at the bathroom sink area because you could see right in. We wound up putting our comforter over the sheer curtain that was there to help get some privacy and block out the sunlight. The \"lagoon view\" that we had was filled with pond scum, which could easily be remedied with a pool skimmer. The ponds above the one that ran into ours were very clean, we were at the bottom. The pool area is beautiful but if you are trying to spend a weekend without the kids, the larger pool area, which has the bar area, was filled with children. If you want to have a drink, the adult pool does not have a bar area at all. We did have to contact the front desk 3 times to request a bellman because he didn't show up when we were leaving. When we finally decided that we would walk our luggage to the lobby building, he came as we were walking out our door. The Barefoot Bar and Grill has an excellent breakfast but I didn't care for their dinner. Very pre-packaged and not worth the money. Do prepare to spend $$ if you are staying there.

After reading some of the reviews on here we were a bit worried that we had made a mistake, but we've stayed at places which have received mixed reviews before and always enjoyed ourselves. I am so glad that we went back as we had a great time. Reading some of the negative reviews I wonder whether we stayed at the same place! We are a family of four (mum, dad and 2 'kids' in our 20's) and so we had 2 rooms. We were pleased to discover that our rooms were within the same bungalow so we shared the same front door which opened into a small passageway and then our rooms were on either side. We had lovely views of one of the lagoons and we were right next door to the waterfall pool. The rooms were plenty big enough, with a king sized bed and a sofa in mum and dad's room and two queen sized beds and a smaller sofa in our room. We had mini fridges in both of our rooms which we always kept well stocked with food and drink - a trip or 2 to the nearby Vons saved loads on buying breakfast and lunch everyday. Our room also had a small sink area (aside from the bathroom) and a microwave - which was handy for popcorn on the beach in the evening! We liked the way the sink was separate from the main bathroom, allowing 2 people to get ready at once, rather than one taking up the whole bathroom! Speaking of the bathroom, we LOVE the complimentary toiletries provided, they smell great!! A few negative points were that the plumbing was quite noisy - we could hear when the other room was using the shower, and if both rooms had the shower running at the same time you lost water pressure. A couple of times we found that the maids had forgotten to replenish one of the toiletry items, if we wanted to we could have phoned to have them replaced, but we didn't bother. Yes, the carpets had probably seen better days, but given the type of resort you spend a lot of time barefoot or in flipflops and you don't take your shoes off before you come in the room so what do you expect? It certainly wasn't so bad that you didn't want to stand on it, they just weren't as clean as our carpets at home! I'm not going to complain about the cost of parking (mainly because it was included in our package from Virgin holidays!) but anyway, we are used to paying at hotels. Yes, it's an annoying added expense, but at least you get a dedicated space right by your room. What is really annoying is when people park in your space! As we had 2 rooms, we technically had 2 parking spaces next to each other, but one night we came back and found someone had parked their huge SUV not only in one of our spaces, but blocking both of our spaces! Please park where you're supposed to! We found the concierge to be very helpful, and even let us use his phone to call home when we mentioned that whilst using one of the phones in the lobby, the person the other end couldn't hear, and was there another phone to use. The grounds are beautiful and we always saw people tending to the plants around the resort. We didn't find the pool dirty like some have said - yes, there was the odd leaf etc, floating around, but surely that's to be expected with the amount of surrounding foliage?

Weather was cold but sunny. Booked largest bungalow on beach, had two separate areas, one bedroom with separate vanity and closet, and Student slept on comfortable pull out and his own vanity and closet space. Toilet and bath was shared between the two rooms. Space is larger than it looks on the website. Kitchen unit had nothing. We bought plastic bowls, dish soap and sponge, cereal, milk, snacks, and ate breakfast in the room each morning. Maid and front desk staff were excellent. However, the bungalows were old, toilets back up occasionally (water only not sewage) causing water damage to be dried out and leaving musty smell. Decore nice, modern, and comfortable but the unit just smelled and felt a bit old, musty and damp (my husband didn't think it was noticable). I guess I prefer newer construction. But what can you expect from an updated resort right on the water? Water view, beach front, and gardens were spectacular. Great central location. Casual dining on site and for room service o.k. Student thought hamburger awesome. TV channels very limited, no plug in for playstation 2. Pools seem nice. The heated one was too cold but we spent some time in the whirlpool with everyone else. Good resort for families with older kids (7-16 probably ideal), adults on their own or sharing with other couples. Less expensive room options around the site as good as the beach option. Rent a minivan. Driving is easy to all attractions. Ask the resort for a reduced parking rate for longer stays. They are very helpful and keen to ensure you enjoy your stay. Meal Tips: authentic, inexpensive mexican food at Valentinos in Mission Bay; and, fresh Italian take out back to your room at Cafe Bella, Garnet Ave Mission Bay. See all Sea World shows and consider two day pass with backstage tour. Well worth it. Loved Legoland. Both Sea World and Legoland have huge, excellent play areas for young kids. You could spend several hours at these locations with toddlers and preschoolers so bring something to read. Carlsbad shopping outlet is great and close to Legoland. The mall has a Diner that has the best milkshakes! Las Americas is even better shopping south of San Diego (quick drive). Coronado bridge and beach great. Zoo fun (avoid the petting zoo, disappointing compared to local farms). We did not go to the wild animal park. Old Town is very quiet and nice. Great mexican food everywhere. Our four year old could not follow the walking tour (too boring) but my husband and our student thought it was great. The shops have interesting art and pottery, and unique imports.

The unit that we get has very large windows facing the bay with beautiful views. There is a sliding glass door that leads to the bay. Outside the slider you have your patio with chairs and small table, then grass, then the sand on the beach, then the bay. Inside we have a kitchenette with a small fridge, sink, microwave, storage and counter space. I can not tell you how wonderful it is sitting on those patio chairs watching my 2 year old and 5 year old playing in the sand together with sail boats and rowing teams passing by in the bay. I find that view so calming and relaxing... that is why I love it there so much. The inside of the room has a king bed for my husband and I and a sleeper sofa for the kids. The property grounds make you feel as if you are in Hawaii... very lush. My husband and I enjoy their fine dining restaurant , Baleen, because we can bring our kids there without worrying about it. They have many other activities there like a minature putting green, swimming pool, boat rentals, etc. I can not believe this place is rated so low. I love it there. Yes, the furniture in the rooms are a little banged up, but I'll take that any day to get that relaxing bayfront view. The property is also situated on its own private island, so you are away from all the riff raff of Mission and Pacific Beach. There are no homeless or seedy people drinking alcohol & hanging around a public restroom next door like there is at Tripadvisors #1 rated Pacific Terrace Hotel. The rooms are not luxurious like the Pacific Terrace, but to me, nothing beats opening that sliding glass door to the bay, putting my feet in the sand and enjoying the sunsets and the beautiful relaxing views. It is very calming and that is what you need with two young kids. We always go off season so we feel like we own the beach as it is very quiet and not a whole lot of people around. At night, we build a fire in one of the fire pits that are situated on the beach in front of the units and roast marshmallows for Smores. The kids love it. My husband and I love it.

Comfort: I was unable to get a good nights sleep, primarily due to the very hard bed. Other than that, I had no complaints. Food: The restaurants are expensive, but the food is good. Room service is available. If you venture one mile north or south, there are many eateries to choose from. Ammenities: The main pool is nice and heated! I cannot comment on the the others (waterfall pool, adult pool, child pool and one that was under construction). The rental fees for the water vehicles (pedal water trikes, wave runners, power boats) are on the high side --- wave runners were $95/hr and a small power boat was $80/hr. Other comments: The room I was in had quite a few small black moths in it, which were OK, they minded their own business. The TV received very few channels clearly. On \"movie night\" at the pool, the hotel was showing whatever was playing on ABC Family.

One was bigger,and had a walk in closet. My mother took the smaller room and my wife and daughter and I took the bigger one. The bed was reasonably comfortable, but the pull out bed that my daughter slept on was not due to a very thin matress. I would recomend getting a room with two queens if you needed to sleep more than two people. The big room had a little private porch that I enjoyed sitting in in the afternoon.

We enjoyed an evening campfire in the fire ring on the beach which was near our room. Campfire supplies (wood, matches, marshmellows, etc.) were pricey at the hotel store.

We found ourselves surrounded by towering palm trees, huge flowering shrubs, natural-looking lagoons, ponds and fountains, with strategic patios on which to relax next to flowing waters. The curbside valets and bell staff were cordial and accomodating; however, our first nasty surprise came in the sumptuous lobby upon registering, when we learned that it would cost $20.00 per night-no exceptions--to park our rental car in front of our room--or anywhere on the property, in fact. The desk clerk informed us that this was clearly stated on their web site (news to us). With no other parking within a reasonable walking distance, we had no choice but to pay. This added another $100.00 to the cost of our five-day stay. After traveling since early morning, we were more than ready for lunch at 3 p.m. on the day of our arrival, and seated ourselves at the outdoor restaurant. Our hamburger and sandwich lunch with iced tea came to $50.00, (including a modest tip for modest service). We were even billed for refills on the tea! That was our first and last meal at the resort. The rooms are motel style. An inaccessable outdoor light shone through the door window all night long, making it impossible to truly darken our room. \"Shabby chic\" best describes the decor. This included the armoir holding the TV, fridge and our clothing, and shabby it was: the white finish was marred by nasty black marks at the base and appeared to be rotting in places. One drawer was askew, leaving nearly a one-inch gap above one side of the closed drawer, and using it was a chore at best. (With bilateral tennis elbow, I had to ask my husband to pull it out and push it back in.) The bathroom door molding was completely rotted away in places. The mirror over the single sink was lighted by two 52-watt bulbs (yes, that's 52)--good luck grooming with that kind of illumination. The weather that week was not conducive to lazing by the pool but , if memory serves, available television programming consisted of MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, Headline News, the Discovery and Disney channels, and the standard local network outlets --oh, and, of course, a pay-per-view movie channel; there was no channel listing on-screen or on paper; NBC had a distinct orange cast at all times; the audio interference was often so severe that it was impossible to follow the program. ABC was sometimes watchable, but often there was no picture. All of the channels featured annoying audio interference to varying degrees. We registered complaints the second, third and fourth days of our stay. \"Engineers\" came to our room twice to tell us someone was \"working on the problem\" but by the fifth and last day of our stay, nothing had changed. The concierge was available only to those standing in front of him. Calling on the phone meant sitting on hold until we gave up. and looked for other information resources. So, if you're thinking of a nice resort vacation at Paradise Point, be prepared to pay through the nose and be higly self-sufficient; don't be disappointed when your accomodations fail to be on a par with the lobby or the grounds.", "Date": "February 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Altos, California", "Title": "\u201cBusinees for the hubby, pleasure for me\u201d", "Author": "odilelosaltos", "ReviewID": "UR6748868", "Content": "true ,the hotel looks like it needs some freshing up.

Keep in mind that anything the resort has to offer will come at a cost. Secondly, if you're expecting luxury, you'll be disappointed. I booked a room for 4 nights in January for my fiance and myself, so that we could get married on the property during our stay. That said, the grounds of the hotel are immaculate and masterfully kept. The rooms however are old, a bit out-dated, and would probably classify as \"rustic\" sooner than \"nice.\" I might go as far as to say \"cozy.\" The hotel is not for those who couldn't book their room at the Hilton but more for those who want a more secluded, outdoorsy, almost camp-like resort. The ammenities on the grounds are laughably expensive; the spa, the workout facility, the restaurants... there were too many alternatives in nearby La Jolla to spend money on the resort. There is a parking fee of $20 per day though the front desk charged us only $10 (due to the length of our stay). Other than that we were offered nothing special (which I found a bit odd considering the nature of our visit). We stayed in the \"Lanai Garden\" (base room) for 2 nights, then paid extra the last 2 nights to stay on the beach in the \"Lanai Bayside.\" It was worth the extra $50 per night, and it took only a few minutes to coordinate, though I felt slighted having to pay - the resort was practically empty and again it would have been a nice gesture. All in all we had a very memorable visit. The hotel is centrally located but secluded from the surrounding attractions.

Now having stayed there, I think I can be helpful to sort out the disparities. First, I think it helps to know about the reviewer. I'm comfortable in a clean Motel 6, but stay about once every six months in $300 and up resorts. Cleanliness and no deferred maintenance is paramount to me. Service is important, but I'm satisfied if the resort \"makes it right for mistakes, as long as there are only one or two that don't greatly affect the purpose for my stay. I hate overpaying, but don't mind paying a lot if I get something special for the price. So with that in mind... The first impression driving up to the resort is very impressive. You meander up a beautiful private drive, with well manicured and landscaped grounds. The check in building is OK. There was a snafu immediately at check-in. I couldn't determine if it was the fault of the resort or the agent, but all was straighten out ,with much apology, in about 1/2 hour, a bit long for a tired family. If you arrived on public transportation someone in an oversized golf cart will take you to your room. You'll need it. Even if you drive, ask for someone to guide you to your room, especially at night. You WILL get lost on your own. Because of the package I booked, our room was probably on the lower-end pricing end of what's available. Considering the on-line pictures, I was disappointed at the drive-up appeal of the bungalow: fronting on a parking lot, although concealed by some attractive landscaping. Once inside, I found the room small, but very appealing, recently updated, with warm materials, and thoughtful interior decorating. The bathroom was well-done. All was spotlessly clean. Ask for a room with a water view. Many rooms have none, despite what you'd think from their pictures. It looks like the water-view rooms would make most people very happy. We were in San Diego during record cold, so opted out of visiting the pools which looked attractive. There are two main restaurants. I highly recommend breakfast at the Barefoot Bar and Grill. It reminds me of some of the nicer open-air resort restaurants in Hawaii with surround-views of Mission Bay, sea-water pools containing large native fish, and ubigitous, gulls, terns, herons and egrets standing by ready for any scraps your children care to share. Food and service were excellent, but we chose a low-volume time to dine. I don't know if they get busy. The putt-putt course is a unique, natural grass course with some very long putting between holes. It looks entertaining. Great views of Mission Bay from the climb-up observatory. If you're taking kids to Sea World you can't get much closer than this resort. Service overall was fair, not great for the price. My impression is they're somewhat understaffed. For example we ordered room service that took over one hour, and they never responded to our call to pick up the tray. We called back to tell them we'd leave it outside and it remained there overnight - spread around and picked over by gulls. The overall quality is very good, but not Four Seasons good. If you haven't been to many high-end resorts I think you'll be delighted. If you're used to high end service you'll be a little or a lot disappointed. Bottom line. If you can get a deal, I think it's well-worth it.

The temperatures were always in the low - mid 70s from about 8.30am until around 7.30pm so swimming was always an option.

I lwould expect the kitchen to be partially stocked with such itmes as utencils, cork screw, hand towels, possibly popcorn for the microwave. You are welcome to bring food from home, just remember there is only a microwave, small refrigerator and sink. The sofa bed was VERY uncomfortable, yet the bedroom bed (king) was VERY comfortable, my husband who hates hotel beds acctually slept very well! Bathrooms were clean and big, with shower on one side (leaky)and a full bath and toilet on the other, along with two full sinks. The linens were very nice. Housekeeping arrived 10 minutes after our call for more towels and the roll away (comfortable). In room movies - can't pause and no close caption. Room service was quick and well prepared, though remember the 18% gratuity and $3.50 per delivery is added to the bill. Our Garden bungalow was quiet until Sunday morning at 8:00, my 12 year old daughter was woke by 4 screaming children. Bike rental, croquet, ping pong, minature golf ,swimming all available, as well as water sport rental. Bikes ran out quickly. Main Pool was very crowded every day, but it's the only large family pool in the resort. Watch out for extremely fast cart drivers (employees), making housekeeping and room service deliveries! My son was almost hit by one while riding his bike. They need to slow down! Yes, parking is $20.00 per day, but we had our own numbered spot, no searching for a parking spot after a full day at Sea World. We only ate at the Barefoot Grill (room service food comes from here). Very nice staff, good food, good drinks, just watch out for the birds on the patio during the day! The large ones are very aggressive and will steal your food. Overall, a nice resort.

Easy access to anywhere in San Diego (once you get the hang of the freeways!) My feeling is that families with children will enjoy it more as it is large and busy with kids. The rooms were nice, clean and really quite quiet given the density of the resort. While we did have a problem with the shower drain, someone came within a few hours to repair.

Unfortunately, it faced the parking lot. We called and asked if there were any other available rooms that didn't face the parking lot (it was my birthday, yada yada...) They immediately rebooked us into another room that faced one of their many duck ponds. I thought that their signature restaurant Baleen was very good, if expensive. Their pool was crowded, but we didn't even try to go to any of their 4 additional pools because we were lazy and simply sat in the sun drinking pina coladas. I popped into the spa for one of their facials and pedicures (great experience for both my 6 year old daughter and myself). Anyway, I really liked Paradise Point. Everyone was very friendly and my family and I had a wonderful time. That being said, it's a completely different experience than the Ritz/Four Seasons (much more family directed) and more relaxing than anything you can find in the Gaslamp/Downtown San Diego. Just don't go expecting glitz or refinement.

We had the cheapest room (price is classifed according to beach or garden view), with garden view, which is fine. This place is great for people with children because there are a lot of activities, plus the large territory is great. I would definitely come back here with kids. Since we don't have kids, we didn't spend much time in the resort itself but used it more as a base for exploring SD. The location is good, central for all the exploring. The customer service was very good, very attentive and pleasant. No problems with checking in or anything. Quick to respond to all our requests and needs. They even waived the internet charge of $10 per day for me. I really was satisfied with my stay here.

Room cleaning was sketchy- used items (coffee, lotion) were not replaced daily, nor was the room really cleaned. The same pre-existing dirt was there when we left too. Room service was also incredibly slow and we had an old menu which led to many ordering frustrations (and repeated requests for an updated one were never met).

I arrived at Paradise Point (they did not know that I was doing a sight visit) after a very long night of traveling with my 10 year old and my husband. ( I had called the resort prior to arrival to confirm my reservation as well as to let them know that I would be arriving very late in the evening. ) They had overbooked the hotel and had no room for my family. It is 3:00 in the morning our time. After about an hour of them (Norman) calling around for a room somewhere else they sent us to the BAHIA. They had 1 room available. The grounds here are very nice but it is not a resort. It is a motel. Hot, Dirty, worn, and Old. I was told by Norman at Paradise Point that as soon as I woke I could come back and check into my room.....so after no sleep I called around 9:00 a.m. and was told that check in was 4:00. I explained everything to the front desk clerk and she said \"sorry..........come on by and we'll buy you lunch... but check in is 4:00. \" Long story short.............they did not charge me the $20 parking every day and they took off a charged dinner on my bill. Would I stay here again? Probably not. It is more important to me to be reassured a room when I am traveling with my family. On top of that, I should have been handled by a manager....but it seems that this happens all of the time at Paradise Point so nothing special is done. The rooms are old, just like many of the write ups say. They are very worn and could use as much attention as the grounds get. We did have a room on a little pond with ducks. This kept my 10 year old busy. The bed squeeked, the sofa bed was VERY thin, I cloroxed the bathroom........it wasn't clean enough for me. Everything in the room is worn from years of use. The carpet is very old and dirty. Bring flip flops or slippers .....my sons feet were BLACK from walking around the room barefoot. The grounds here are beautiful.

Our first week, we were at the Marriott Residence Inn in Hotel Circle which was a perfect base for all our amusement park hopping. Then up to Irvine's Hyatt Regency for a karate tournament. I will review these properties too, but suffice it to say that they met or exceeded our expectations. Unfortunately, Paradise Point did not. Our plans had been to spend the last few days of our trip lounging in the deck chairs in front of our beachfront bungalow next to a pristine (or at least well maintained beach) while our preteen boys played on the beach and in the water. When we arrived to check in, we were soooo excited. The grounds were lovely. The pools were pretty. The ponds were great and we loved the fact that there were sweet little ducks swimming around everywhere (we didn't know that we'd spend the next four days yelling at other people's kids not to throw rocks at the ducks, but I guess that's besides the point!). Our room wasn't quite ready for us, so we took the map the girl at the front desk gave us and went off to check out the general area where she told us our room would be. The first thing I noticed was that the \"beach\" in the picture wasn't exactly what I expected, it was more of a manmade cove - no waves - big drainage pipe spewing who knows what into the water with a warning sign not to swim within 72 hours after a rain - one stretch with no sand, just a huge wall of boulders. I became concerned about the specific location of our room (i.e. was it going to be near the sewage pipe or the boulders?) and went back to the desk to ask. The clerk didn't know, but when I told her that putting my two pre-teen boys near those boulders was a trip to the emergency room waiting to happen (I'm sure she heard \"lawsuit\" although I didn't say it) she said she'd put in a request in the back. When they called us to tell us our room was ready, we picked up the keys to Unit #526 (located comfortably between sewage pipe and boulders) and were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was quite lovely. The bathroom was set up so the kids needn't wake us in the middle of the night to potty (unlike the Marriott). The masterbedroom didn't have blackout curtains, but the thick shrubs shaded the windows nicely for late mornings. (On a side note, the thick shrubs only lasted two nights. For some reason they sent the lawn guy with a ladder and an electic trimmer to cut them down at 7:30 a.m. the second morning we were there. We spent the next three nights hanging every available towel in the room in the windows trying to block out the glaring parking lot lights!) No matter, the kids hit the beach and we hit the deck chairs and that's when I started noticing the trash...everywhere. Pizza boxes, beer cans (and bottles), wrappers, all sorts of nasty stuff, old, moldy towels, abandoned shoes, and so on. I called the front desk to ask them what time of day they came by to clean the beach and they said that it was a, \"public beach\" and they weren't responsible for cleaning it. Funny how the beach in front of the Hotel Del Coronado is public too, and yet the Del manages to clean it anyhow. So, not wanting to spend the next four days looking at a gross trashy beach, we cleaned our section ourselves. I even picked up a maxipad! #^$^%#%@^%!!!! GROSS!!!! I must have used a whole bar of soap washing my hands (which was never replaced - I'm glad I snagged some from the Hyatt!!)! Some other points...like others have mentioned, the food in the hotel restaurants is mediocre and overpriced and I laugh at whoever said the tuna in my salad was \"sashimi grade\". It should have been in a can. The beach is definitely a public beach. It is located next to a public park where some unsavory elements tend to hang out until half past late in the evening (we once had to listen to heavy bass from car speakers past 3 a.m. - another time they were shooting off bottle rockets!) The hotel staff once again can not help with this situation. The hotel doesn't keep the beach clean with the exception of when they are preparing for their beach karaoke night. They did manage to pick some of the trash (which was overflowing the cans) up in preparation for making us listen to drunken hotel staff and guests blaring karaoke in the style of the worlds worst American Idol auditions until 10:30 p.m. - so much for our nice peaceful bonfire. When I called to ask what it was about and when it would end, they didn't know. They thought it might be entertainment from one of the restaurants (that we weren't near) or possibly a wedding. It was painfully obvious it was a hotel sponsored function - they even had a last call for their cash bar! They just once again didn't want to claim responsibility for something obnoxious. I feel particularly sorry for the poor people whose lawn they claimed to set up the speakers on. To make a long story longer, instead of spending a lot of time hanging out around the \"beach\" in front of our $550 plus tax plus $20 for parking (even though every room has its own spot) like we planned, we ended up spending most of our time in other places.

The good points below make it a great family destination. Wish they would fix the Bad and the Ugly though . . . We agree with the prior post that guests should not expect a fancy spa type of resort. THE GOOD: The pool, the location (near Sea World, Mission Beach, airport and more), in-room refrigerator, bay front rooms, small putt putt course. We had a one BR suite on the beach on the bay. Our daughter loved playing in the sand right outside the room and swimming in the pool. Fast access to area attractions was a real plus. We enjoyed the pool side bar & grill, and the large suite. Also a good family friendly restaurant on the grounds, and a very nice gift shop. Room prices were good for the area. THE BAD: Like seemingly all hotels in the Mission Bay area, it seriously needs to be renovated and updated. The rooms have decent decor, with some newer furniture, but the overall feel is pretty worn. The exterior and landscaping is very worn and not well maintained. The maid service is slow and not so good. Bunch of guys driving around in carts doing nothing. They have an espresso bar, but its hours of operations are erratic, and the grinder had some disgusting looking beans around the top. The coffee was not very good. THE UGLY: Our room (and others) flooded during the rain, with brown water seeping up through the floor and pouring down through the light fixture in the bathroom. Judging by the water damage on the baseboards and walls, this was not a new problem. At least they didn't argue when we asked for a partial refund.

With so many small buildings, each requiring it's own water heater, roof system, and plumbing, it's really tough to manage. It's not built like one huge building with one system to control everything. I'm sure each building also has it's own electrical panel too. The hotel does a pretty good job keeping up considering the challenges. 2. The scale is enormous. It's almost like it's own amusement park with all the paths and vegetation and wildlife. Everyday staff is outside hosing down the bird droppings and trimming the vegetation. The birds are everywhere. They really make a mess. But the exterior is quite clean considering the birds. 3. I don't know how the hotel can charge as little as they can considering the huge staff required to keep the place up. The staff required are 10 times the amount required for a single building high rise type structure. 4. The age of the buildings put them right at the point of being torn down.

When asked if we had stayed here before, we said no, but had stayed at another Noble House property. He then said the he would waive the $20.00 per night (that we did NOT know about in advance) parking fee for being return customers. The parking spot was right in front of our room. It wasn't like they had to rent a spot in a nearby garage. The bell person was friendly and asked if our daughter would like to ride in the golf cart to get to our room. Being three, she thought that was a good idea. He was helpful. Upon opening our room there was a very musty smell. The room was obviously in an old building. They had redecorated - newer paint over badly prepared chipped walls. The furniture was new. But there were two small cafe chairs paired with a small round and short end table for a \"dining area\"- odd. The bathroom was a strange mix of old and new. New granite or marble countertops. Old bathtub and tile. AND DIRTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dirty toilet surfaces. Mold growing on the walls. An incredibly moldy shower curtain. Hair everywhere. Thick dust on the lampshades. Thin and dingy towels. Mold growing on the closet walls too. We ordered room service that night. It was fine (not remarkable either way). They did not pick up the dishes that were left out all night until after housekeeping came the next day. Breakfast our first morning was pleasant enough. We ate outside and our server was fine. Dinner in the casual restaurant that night was not great. The service in the mostly empty place was terrible. I am a 20% plus tipper and I even said to my husband that we won't be tipping much. Breakfast the day after was ok but with terrible service. We were due to check out and said to post the bill right away. When we went to check out it still was not posted and after three calls from the front desk the embarrased front desk person decided not to charge us. The grounds of the resort are very pretty. But bad service, expensive for what it was and a dirty room added up to NO WAY WOULD WE EVER GO BACK! I did not want to spend any extra time in that room after a long (and lovely) day at the zoo. Now... for a different story... after we went to Disneyland for a few days of impeccable service and a very clean and comfortable room at the Disneyland Hotel we came back to San Diego and stayed at the THE DANA ON MISSION BAY. Part of the hotel is brand new, part of it is old. They have redone all of the old rooms. We stayed in the old part. They were CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, OFFERED A FREE SHUTTLE TO SEA WORLD, GOOD STAFF AND A GREAT PLACE TO EAT WITH OR WITHOUT KIDS. The water main even broke on our way out. We stopped to get a bite to eat in the restaurant and Anna the manager was very on her toes, making it all work out without running water. So, if you need a place to stay close to Sea World this is one. So... Happy Trails. And in the end... what I want is a CLEAN ROOM and GOOD SERVICE. Paradise Point does not have it.

We paid an extra $50 a night to upgrade to a bayside view room- 233. To be honest, I was a little nervous about staying here because of the reviews on here, but we had a great time- don't be put off. We found staff to be helpful and friendly. The grounds are really amazing- gorgeous gardens and pools, with blazing torches at night- it was a shame that we had lousy weather as we would have enjoyed it much more with a bit of sun. Having said this, the pools are heated, and we loved the adult pool with the hot tub at night- it is pretty much deserted and very romantic with changing light colours in the pool/tub at night, with clean towels provided at the pool. If the weather had been hotter we'd have loved to have stayed on the loungers there. The bayside view was really lovely too. We ate at the Barefoot Bar and Grill every night and for breakfast one day- we found the prices to be reasonable and the food nice- eg $6.95 for 3 massive pancakes and syrup. Service was very good too. If you feel like eating out one night and don't have a car, take the no. 9 bus into Old Town, where there are lots of nice Mexican restaurants. The bus stop is at the end of the entrance to the hotel. the Baleen was too expensive for us. Sea World is a short walk away. We wanted to visit Coronado, so took the Old trolley Bus tour which can be booked and picked up from the hotel for $30, which was good value. We also went shopping at Horton Plaza and at Fashion valley. You can get on the no 9 and change at the Old Town transit center for Fashion Valley mall, all for $1.75 fare. Alternatively there is a free shuttle that goes from the hotel twice a day except Sunday. We loved the shopping and got some bargains in the Macys sale. On the downside, we were pleased with the room, but found the carpet to be a bit dirty if we went barefoot- probably because of the bayside location. It did smell a bit musty on arrival, but we didn't notice it after that and it didn't affect my asthma at all - think it's its sea location which causes this- we went to mauritius and had the same problem with mustiness but worse. We didn't have ants- and were generally pleased with the size and facilities in the room- not as bad as painted on here. Gift shop was very pricey for essentials, which was a shame ($7.99 for a sandwich). These aspects stop us giving it a 5- if the prices for rooms were a little lower and the rooms refurbished we would have given the resort 5. Similarly, we found the Spa to be very expensive ($120 for a 50 minute facial), so did not use this, when i would have loved to have gone if it had been a bit cheaper. Overall though, we thought the resort was great and would stay here again if visiting San Diego.", "Date": "October 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful grounds, nice location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4054122", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights and upgraded to a standard suite #301.

We waited about 15 minutes to order (finally went and got a waitress) and literally 30 minutes for a plate of nachos and 2 kids dinners of chicken fingers, and 2 glasses of wine.The restaurant was not crowded and we saw lots of wait-staff come and go from the kitchen. We did not try the other restaurant, so I don't know how that would have been. In general staff were not very nice or helpful. We went there again the second night, basically because we had tired and some jet-lagged kids with us (rather than go find a better restaurant off the resort as others have correctly suggested). The waiter paid more attention to our tables, but that didn't seem to stop him from forgetting stuff and for the whole thing to just took way too long. The room was ok, but just ok. There was a used band-aid stuck to the bed post (how did cleaners miss that??) Our alarm clock was left set by previous guests for 6 am. I wouldn't expect staff to check for that, but it could be a nice thing to think of. I guess we will next time. Our friend's room (with a little kitchenette and living-room area in addition to the bedroom) was downright dirty and run down. She is from NY so when she first described it I thought she meant it was like shabby-chic and maybe she just wasn't used to that Ca. style (which I like) but no, when I saw it I realized it was just shabby. The grounds were pretty, with flowers, ducks, etc. The rooms overlooking the little cove were cute, and the kids enjoyed digging and playing by the quiet water. But again, not terribly clean.

The parts of it were nice had little to do with the resort which is ridiculously overpriced for what it is. It was nice because we were in San Diego, which is beautiful, and because we were seeing our friends and playing with our kids. Our little trip was not ruined by staying there, because it would take a lot to make San Diego unpleasant, but it did bug us all that we had paid for and expected (nice website) something that this place did not deliver. The bottom line is this place should be either cheaper or nicer. If it was the cost of a normal hotel room (not a resort, which it isn't) that would be fine, it could be a decent family place that is a little worn out but fun. If it was much nicer and shinier and the service was decent and the rooms and grounds more uniformly kept then they could charge what they do and that would be ok.

The sand/dirt should be kept up since there are firepits along the bay and that tends to add to the problem.Overall, this is a perfect place to stay with kids since there are a lot of things to do and the pool is very nice and warm. Things in the hotel are overpriced. For example, 2 plain coffees were $7 at the coffee cart. Luckily, we had our car and the hotel is very close to restaurants and coffee houses so we left for food and drinks.", "Date": "July 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort--not so beautiful rooms\u201d", "Author": "MeinPhx", "ReviewID": "UR3674951", "Content": "My husband and I took our two girls, ages 5 and 7, to San Diego from July 10th-15th. I had originally read some good reviews on this hotel--it was not until a few days before departure that I started reading some bad ones. If I had it to do over again I probably would have picked a different resort. Check in was fine- we arrived about 1:30 and our room was ready. Very nice man gave our girls and my husband a ride in his shuttle to our room and I followed in the van. I was immediately disappointed with the location of the room. It was right next to the convention center . This made our view from our room some type of wood fence that was used to hide some of their equiptment. Since I had not specified where I wanted my room, I did not complain. I was also disappointed about the size of the room. There were two queen sized beds and a small desk with two chairs. The TV was set into an armoure that also held a very small refridgerator. If my husband and I had been traveling alone the amount of space would have been fine. The bathroom sink was very nice, but again very small. The shower/bath was also tiny.There was a strong must smell in the room. I decided not to fret as we were planning on spending the majority of the time at the pool and Sea World. We ordered room service that night. Took about 30 min to get our food. I would give it a 2 on a scale of 1 to 5. Not cheep by the way! In the morning we woke up to find we had visitors in the bathroom. Ants! I was not pleased about this. I do not go camping because I like the outdoors to stay outdoors!! We called housekeeping and advised them we would be gone for the day and would appreciate the ants be gone when we came back. Sea World was wonderful. Only stayed a few hours. Did breakfast with Shamu--I highly reccomend this for the kids!! They loved it!! Decided to go back to the hotel and swim. We would finish Sea World the next day. We really enjoyed the main pool. There were many families, but that was fine with us...we had ours with us!! The service at the pool was great. We always had a drink in our hand and the food was OK. Not a very big selection and the prices were high, but it was nice to be able to eat at the pool. The girls had their hair braided poolside. They thought that was neat. I would give the pool area a 4 on my 1-5 scale. The ants did make a return a couple of times and eventually I did not smell the musty smell. Must have gotten used to it. When we checked out we complained again about the ants and the fact that one day we came back and had no parking space--there was something going on at the convention center. They ended up crediting two days of parking which was $18/day. There were many on site activites- boat rental, bike rental, ect. We did not visit the beach at the resort, we drove to Mission Beach. Don't get me wrong. We had a wonderful time on our vacation. The room issues did not ruin the week, however I would not reccomend this resort or stay here again. It was definitely not worth the price.", "Date": "July 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cJust Got Back from Paradise Point\u201d", "Author": "WeLove2Travel23", "ReviewID": "UR3664233", "Content": "My family and I stayed 3 nights at the Paradise Hotel for a short vacation to San Diego. Our room was clean and nice and the grounds are decently maintained overall. The service was attentive, especially at the pool, where we ate lunch one day. We also ate one meal at the Barefoot Bar and Grill and the service was friendly and the food decent. The only bad thing is there are tons of large birds everywhere at the Barefoot Bar and Grill and one was eating eggs off of a table near us, which I thought was really gross. The family sitting there must have found it acceptable because they just sat there and allowed it. The restaurant should post signs discouraging that because the birds are a bit of a nuisance. I felt safe walking around the resort, even at night, because of all the families and other people around. The main pool is very large and warm and the pool area is kept clean. Some areas of the grounds could use a little TLC, such as a bit of trash in the lagoons and the water is a little funky in some places. Some of the outdoor furniture by the lagoons could also use a cleaning as well (the pool furniture is kept very nice). We stay at a lot of hotels and I felt that Paradise Point did an overall good job of meeting our needs. I am picky and would be quick to point out anything gross or dirty in our room. The curtains in our room need to be replaced because they were torn and worn on top. Other than that, the beds are very clean and comfortable and the rooms are quiet. I guess people's impression of this resort depends a lot on where the room is located and there is a lot of variation. Our room did not smell musty at all, nor was the carpet dirty, as I have read in other reviews. Why some rooms are cleaner than others seems strange to me as well (different housekeeping staff?). This is a nice, family-orientated place to relax. There are lots of kids everywhere, so we felt very comfortable (I was not the only pregnant lady by the pool). I wanted a place to stay with the kids while my husband worked in San Diego and not have to drive anywhere during the day. Our room was right on the bay and we had a lovely view. We walked on the beach at night and enjoyed all the bonfires and other people around. One last thing-the prices for snacks are very high in the gift shop and restaurants are pricey (the resort does seems to nickle and dime you). Since the rooms have refridgerators, we went to a grocery store and stocked up on juice boxes, bottled water, yogarts, fruit, etc. and ate breakfast on our little patio. For dinner, we left the resort and ate at some of the wonderful places San Diego has to offer, such as in Old Town, and for a lot less than Paradise Point.

Nice to be able to park the car right near our casita room. We are from the desert so the cool and green was NICE. On the pond I amused myself with feeding the ducks, and the fish for the snowy egret that stayed at my side all wkend. Food was okay--fruits and veg. were fresh-- San Diego is fairly compact so location didn't matter that much.. Nice conference room on the water with windows. Hate those dark-hole rooms in hotels. Easy to get around off-property, near La Jolla and other beaches. One staff member that stood out to me, she was helpful and a jewel. NOT VERY GOOD: First thing in the room, had no screen on the sliding door--so I called maintainance and they had to come and put one on. We live with A/C all summer so I wanted FRESH AIR all weekend. I spoke Spanish to the gentlemen, and tipped him, after all--it's management that screwing up not him. Water main broke and we were out of water within the first two hrs. Then they shut if off 9pm-5am to repair it. Left us a note with bottled water...as it should be! Two locks on the door, only one worked, the deadbolt above did not. Seemed like I could never get printed info from the Concierge--he was not there, and they didn't leave out any brochures --as if they were stingy or something, I wanted some maps and info on what to do, go, see. None to be found put out in racks. We asked for extra hangers for our room, and we got these WIRE ONES that looked like what you get at the cleaners with the cardboard bar on the bottom. Gee I mean, I can live with those but hey, what we were paying for a ROOM?? COME ON... SPELLED OUT CHEAP to me the first hour! OVERALL IMPRESSIONS: Would not pay to go back. The price doesn't compare to what you get. I like comfy rooms and clean, not worn. I need to feel, safe, clean and okay with the energy of room. The worn also makes it not feel very clean. Details mean alot! The details were overlooked.... Beds okay, nothing special--could be more firm. Our room felt like it was a bit dated and worn. And we were there for a conference, so our group bought a big block of rooms. You'd think they'd want our business back. I think some of the reviews I have read come from people with kids and some can live with a certain messyness and chaoticness -- I come from a family of 10 kids so I am not a snob. Families with kids can dirty up the rooms, or don't care about dingy carpets, etc.....so they overlooked the room points. We didn't go to SeaWorld so that was irrelevant to us, the location. I worked for the airlines, travelled extensively and have been to many nice resorts and even motel 6's...we've lived in Europe and all over the U.S, and can enjoy nice Motel 6's to the very posh. Paradise Point survives because of people who buy into mediocrity, and pay that kind of money for inferior services and goods, so it promotes it. The property is old and needs heavy revamping, which is why the pipes keep breaking, etc. No money is being put into the hotel for upgrading--shame, it's a nice property, just poorly managed. You can just look at it to tell. The rooms and details of the property look deteriorated. One day it might shut down from run down. Also, when I check into a resort or hotel, their main business is to supply a comfortable place to sleep and be during our stay, and the first impression I get is when I walk into that room. I mean, I told my husband, hey--here I am having to be on the phone calling for MAINTAINANCE, etc. and these are the things I do at HOME! When I arrive on vacation, I shouldn't have to be taking care of ordinary room maintainance things because that is what I am paying a resort to provide! So that didn't set a very nice TONE for our 5 day stay. My niece lives in San Diego and she kept telling me that we were staying at a VERY NICE RESORT. We brought her back to our room and she walked in and said--\"oh..this doesn't look like what I'd expect, for what you paid.\" So BINGO! We had a nice time, but really, this has been one of the most expensive places we have stayed this past year --I am talking about the room price--nice resorts always will have expensive eateries....so that is a given....close enough to other places to eat within a short drive....the little restaurant on the water was okay but we didn't eat at the nite-dining one. I am surprised for such a large resort there were only 2 restaurants on the property. There was some nice staff that helped to make our stay pleasant, those are the few that go out of their way to please and put in 110%, but not all were like that. I am so surprised, our 1st trip to San Diego and for that area, seems like other resorts and hotels would be UP from this place.

San Diego zoo is brilliant although $32 a head to get in including buses/skyfari etc but worth it!

That's pretty standard in every hotel here. But, if you're looking for one of those warm weather resorts with a huge pool near the ocean - this is definitely NOT it. I live in Los Angeles and we drove down for a few days with our 6 year-old daughter. This place is a great location if you're headed to Sea World. (It's next door.) And it was loaded with folks from England who we enjoyed meeting. But, it had some kinks that bugged me. When we arrived (a bit before the 4 PM check-in) the computer was down and they couldn't check us in. We had to wait an hour to check-in. The main pool is not very big and the jacuzzi is small and up the steps from the pool. There are three other pools on the property - but the others are much smaller and only one other one is heated. (It was chilly when we were there.) There is only one jacuzzi. This might seem picky - but, this is a huge complex with dozens of rooms. If the weather had been warmer and more people were in the pool and jacuzzi - you wouldn't have been able to move. As it was - I kept bumping into people when I was swimming. Our room was a lanai room - no view of anything except the parking lot in front of our room. Okay, that's what we paid for, but forget about the barbecue pit and view of the water unless you want to pay $300 a night. (Not really worth it.) Our room was conveniently located next to the main lobby and pool though. And it gave us easy access to our car. There seemed to be a lot of hidden costs where you felt nickel and dimed: $18 for parking, $10 to use the gym. The food at the restaurant was not very good and overpriced and the service was poor. And if you want to order one of those tropical drinks while you sit by the pool - it's $9.00. Oh and leave the golf clubs at home - that silly putting course they have is for kids and they charge extra to use it! Our first morning we were woken up by the gardeners at 6:15 AM mowing the lawn right outside our room. We complained and got $50 off the room. But, I would have prefered the sleep. That afternoon we returned from Sea World to find my earrings were missing from the room. We complained again and got more money off - but, again I would have preferred the return of my opal earrings. The rooms are nicely decorated in \"country\" style. But, the maid short-sheeted our beds every night and by morning I was sleeping on a bare mattress. When you go to San Diego you have three choices of areas to stay in: the Gaslamp area downtown which is terrific - you can walk everywhere. But, maybe not the best place for families with young children. There's Old Town which is a must see, another walking area and some nice hotels are there, (Best Western Hacienda is wonderful) but you might get some freeway traffic noise. Then there is the Mission Bay area near Sea World. Paradise Point is really on a point that juts out into Mission Bay. You have to know though that this is a marina and boating area - and you are not allowed to swim at the beach across from the hotel. The other problem with Paradise Point is that you have to drive to get to anything. You can't walk to restaurants or stores or pick up the trolley to Mexico like in the Gaslamp or Old Town area. Still I think if you have kids you might like the space at Paradise Point where the kids can run around. San Diego is a compact city though (unlike LA!) and Old Town and downtown San Diego are only a few minutes drive away. If you stay at Paradise Point, I'd suggest getting your drinks and some snacks at the grocery store. Thankfully there's a small (empty) fridge in the room and if you just drive down the road from the hotel you'll find a Von's and Ralphs. There are some things to reccomend this hotel: the staff at the front desk was courteous, the hotel was clean and well maintained and there was an effort to accomodate the guests. There's some nice touches on the property like the fountains that turn into torches at night. I'm sure the spa is nice - although I didn't have a treatment. But, I have to tell you the $10 for the gym was worth it because it also alllows you to use the eucalyptus steam room in the spa - now that was HEAVEN!", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mammoth Lakes, CA", "Title": "\u201cHow can you not love this property?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3365041", "Content": "I just got back 4/12/2005. After booking I read the reviews which seem to be quite varied, so we simply prepared for the worst of the reviews to be partly true. I cannot recall a more delightful stay!!! We booked a garden lanai but wished we had a room on the bay, once we got there. For $25 more per night we were moved to a room on the bay for our remaining two nights. Not only that, but we were at Sea World, so all we had to do was round up our suitcases and leave them together in the room. The bellman came by when the new room was ready and moved our bags. I was afraid we'd have to check out at noon and back in at 4, but no, they moved us directly over at 3:30. I don't understand the parking complaints, your space is reserved and right at your front door. So $18.00 is a little steep, but the overall cost is not. People that don't bring a car probably appreciate this expense not being \"included\". Food was great at the restaurants, every single staff member was cheery and polite. Every big \"tower\" hotel we drove past we all agreed \"I'm glad we're not staying there!\" My boys 11 and 13 will absolutely NOT sleep in the same bed and in any other hotel I've been in when there are 2 queen beds they do not allow a rollaway. These guys did. Not only that, but in our particular room the closet was soooo big that the rollaway fit in the closet and we still had plenty of room for everthing else, including accessing the door that went from the closet to the back end of the bathroom!

We had friends in other rooms and they also complained of a terrible musty smell along with other room issues....old worn sheets, loud clanging heater.

We experenced everything bad that every reviewer seemed to experence and though it all - we still had a good time! We stayed for a week during Thanksgiving 2004. It started off at check in - we were told that the water was not working and they were not sure when it would be turned on. We were told not to use the bathroom or use any water at all. If you had to wash your hands please use bottled water and you will not be charge. My wife was less than pleased, luckily, our flight was not that long so no one had to take shower. I remembered that we were on on island and these things do happen. After my wife had the maintence people provide a bucket of water so we could use the toilet - we had to discuss if we were going to really stay here for a week. At 11:00pm - 7 hours after check in - the water came back on. The room itself was Ok, nothing really special and it really didn't match the polynesian island theme. Three people taking showers, you will run out of hot water. We had a garden - lagoon view and by the weeks end, we had bugs inside (we were being careful about that too) the room. Somethings just seemed strange to us but that could be just where we are from - Oregon & Japan. At the begining of the week, there must have been about ten people in the whole hotel - the staff out numbered us two to one. It was off season and it was fun to have the run of the place even though I felt a little uneasy about eating in a restuarant and we're the only people there. Though out this, they would charge for everything; parking and miniture golf ($16 & $9 per person) fitness center...everything! If they could find a way to squeeze a dime out of you, they will try (duck and fish food were @1.25 each)! Maid service was Ok, once during the week they miss us and we had to call. Room service was quick and they had no problem in sending us extra plates and silverware. By Thanksgiving, the place started to fill up. Total, must of been about half full but it felt very pack. I cannot imagine this place completly full -parking, swiming even the rooms with their very thin walls would be horrible. The problems with check out were there - a mystery charge of $8.00 for water appeared. But we checked our bill using the in room system through the televison and called to clear it up before leaving. The funny thing about this whole ordeal was that I contacted the hotel via e-mail before we arrived and express my concerns about staying here. I pointed out many of things that I have read in the other reviews in this section and was reassured that none of this would come to pass. Even with all this, the grounds were just great. We brought our own scooters and was really alot of fun going through the maze of trails and roads. We tried swiming once at he main pool but the water wasn't really heated so we didn't stay to long. The location of the hotel is fantastic, nothing except for maybe the Wild Animale Park, is thirty minutes away. And once you get the \"lay of the land\" getting around is really easy. Over Thanksgiving weekend, they lit the Christmas lights and they were absolutely beautiful. So even with all the little things, it still was pleasant experence. I read on the door or somewhere that the maxium price for the room is $350 per night. I feel that the room was really worth about $125.00 plus $16 for parking and $5.00 for tax.

I think it is getawaytoday. Super company with whom to work. Anyway, we ABSOLUTELY LOVED the property. The number one benefit is its location - right on a point in mission bay. It takes away the hustle and bustle of being in a large city. Our Family felt safe and secure as well being nicely tucked away from the party scene of some of the other properties in the area. The pool was excellent and very clean. We ate at Barefoot Bar & grill for breakfast.....that's a little pricey, they charge a lot for juice ($3.95 i think)......But it was beautiful and worth it. Pretty standard for resorts. We also took advantage of room service quite a bit and found it a better option as we brought our own juice and other drinks and put them in the refrigerator there in the room. That worked out REALLY WELL. Another great feature was kids meals on the room service menu priced at $4.50. That Rocked. The rooms were quite nice but you have to keep in mind that this is an older property.........it's not brand new and does show some wear and tear....however, the features that were upgraded were the ones important to us. Marble in the bathroom, granite counter tops, nice shower head, new bedding and shower curtains, upgraded lighting, new carpet, etc. It's definitely a big property, so pick your location wisely.....certainly should ask for a room that DOES NOT overlook the parking lot. Also should have your kids bring skate boards and scooters as there are many trails throughout the property and it was a fun way to get around. IT's a perfect family destination.....we'll absolutely be back ! We looked at several other hotels while in the area and couldn't find one that we'd preference.

Yes, the prices at the restaurant seemed a little high for family style eating and the spa was pricey as well, and some of the features in the room were slightly worn, but there were so many positive things about the hotel that outweighed any negative marks I've seen written about to date. First of all, the setting is just beautiful. The grounds are extremely unique with the lush landscaping, ponds, wildlife, and so forth. Moreover, the main pool/jacuzzi area is equally beautiful and great fun to swim in for kids and adults alike. While the bedroom we stayed in was a little dusty perhaps at first and had a torn screen door, it is hard to find such spacious rooms with such comfortable beds and linens anywhere. Moreover, any issues we asked housekeeping to attend to were promptly addressed. I also really liked how the rooms all had patios that went out to lovely gardens and ponds. It made for some very relaxing morning coffee sessions with my husband! Finally, I found the staff most helpful. At times, the facility seemed a little understaffed, but we also visited at an off-peak time, so this wasn't a big problem. Once Thanksgiving week rolled around, I saw many more staff on site, so I'm sure it is a function of numbers of people checked into the hotel.

We had booked a Lanai Garden Room, but upon arrival my husband decided to upgrade to a bayside suite. The checkin attendant was quick and friendly. The Bellman that drove us to our room by golf cart was very friendly. Upon arriving my husband told me that the room was not as nice as he expected, but not terrible. The kids slept out in the living room on the pull out couch. We had a king size bed in a separate bedroom. A single bathroom is shared by all. The toiled is in with the shower so one person at a time had the whole bathroom. The room definitely showed it's age. The Bay outside was ok, but there were signs about the water not being safe after a rain (runoff). We did not feel that the bay water was swimmable and was cold. The room had a kitchenette, but no utensils, etc... That night we were cold (being from Phoenix) and turned on the heater. Our room filled with smoke and the fire alarm went off. No one called or noticed from the front desk. We fanned the room out till the alarm stopped. It was late and we did not want to change rooms so we went to bed with the smell of smoke in the room. The next morning we called the front desk. They did not seem to care about it - said they would send a repairman while we were at Seaworld. No apology, etc... We decided to see how the repair went. Seaworld was great. Our daughter got splashed by Shamu so when we got back to the room she layed her wet sweatshirt out on our deck chair. The sweatshirt was from Paris and had sentimental value for her. Well in the morning it was gone. She was crying and called the front desk to see if anyone had turned it in. They did not seem interested - did not act like they cared - and did not have it. I know it should not have been left outside, but they could have been like - oh no! We will definitelykeep our eyes open and watch for it (ie at least feign fake concern). The heater did work the second night so we did not pursue that issue. The last morning we called to see if we could get a late check out (a Weds in the middle of October) and they said no. There hotel book says to ask about late check out, but I guess they were busy?!

Our children, ages 9 and 11, had the buffet and my husband and I ordered from the menu. If your children are big eaters, go for the buffet. The granola encrusted french toast was a favorite. The grounds are amazing! You feel like you are in the Carribean with the lush landscaping and tropical trees and flowers. The main pool was teaming with children who act like children! The pool is heated and clean enough. It is partly surrounded by a sandy beach so the water gets murky. Lots of clean towels and waitresses serving drinks by the pool. Yes, the drinks are expensive. Nothing that you wouldn't expect at a resort. My husband and I shopped at Ralph's in Pacific Beach and bought wine and snacks which we enjoyed while watching the sun set over the bay again from our chairs.

This is a perfect family vacation even without the distractions of all the other San Diego attractions. Because it is so family-friendly, I am not so sure it is ideal for the couples seeking absolute solitude. I loved our room, the view, the peace and quiet, the landscaping. I would mention, if you are mainly visiting San Diego for the tourist attractions, it might be better to stay in a cheaper hotel since you won't have much time to appreciate the tranquility of the bay and surroundings.

We were referred here by our travel agent because it had a kids program that my kids (7 & 9) could stay at while I was in meetings. While the property was very pretty, it was not worth the $300 a night! The rooms were ok but nothing to write home about. The refridgerator knob was broken and it froze our drinks. A light bulb was missing over the bathroom vanity (which is very small) and I killed two spiders in the bathroom. The beds however were comfortable. My co-worker had no chairs on their patio. When they called about it they expected they would bring out nice chairs like the other patios had - they brought $5 plastic chairs. They were disappointed for the money they spent and value they recieved. Plus a $16 a night parking fee is rediculous. I was surprised that they charge for every amenity - tennis, fitness, etc. even the USA Today delivered to your room which most upscale hotels do not. The kids club was not geared for business travelers as the hours were 9:30 to 4:00 at a whopping price of $160 for 6 1/2 hours. There is no actual room for the kids like there is in other resorts they basically take the kids around the resort doing activites like playing tennis, walking on the beach, riding a bike, etc. My kids did have fun but the price and the times were not comparable to the other hotels with kids programs. The food was very overpriced and not very good. We ate at the pool and at the Barefoot restaurant - we would have gone out but there is not much around the resort close. I got a half hour massage at the spa and and found out that it is only for 25 minutes and they automatically charge a 20% gratuity! The treatments are all overpriced too - $72 for a 25 minute massage. On the 28th we moved to the Catamaran Hotel for the rest of our trip. The Catamaran has - which had similar type of grounds like Paradise but was $100 a day cheaper. We booked it through Southwest Airlines Vacation Package. We were pleasantly suprised that kids under 12 eat free at the Atoll restaurant, tickets for complimentary appetizers at the restaurant, complimentary cruise on Mission Bay for the family on the Bahia Bell, and tickets for 2 free hours in the arcade per child. Our room was spacious and had a kitchen with a full size refridgerator, dishes and cookware. Which was great to save money on eating out every meal. Plus the hotel had a schedule of activites most of which were free including surfing lessons, movie on the beach with coke & popcorn, kyak lessons, etc. They also didn't charge like the Paradise Point for all of the amenities like the fitness center, tennis, etc. They did charge for parking but it was $9.00 a night and it was covered in a garage.

We d heard a lot of great things about your hotel and spa and, I am sorry to say, experienced none of the pleasure about which others had spoken.For starters, we arrived at 3:15 P.M. on the afternoon of December 6th. Upon checking in, we learned that out room was not ready. I asked the person at the front desk what time check-out occurred and she said Noon. Why it took 45 minutes (we were finally allowed access at 4 PM) for our room to be ready I have no clue.I was led to believe by the person with whom I d spoken that the room was a suite, and that it was, indeed, separate from other structures. This was not the case. Our room, in fact, was attached to three other bungalows. I was also led to believe that this and another room (no ocean view) at $279 were the only two kinds of rooms left available at the resort. When we checked in, I heard a front desk attendant mentioning there were rooms available for far less. Thinking we were locked in to our $299 per night room, plus the fact that the phone reservation person said it was usually a $579 per night room, I figured What the heck? and we waited the 45 minutes until the room was ready. Upon seeing the room, we were surprised by: its small size; the fact that it was referred to as a suite at all; the fact that it was NOT separate but rather an attached structure -- the nearest room to ours housing a screaming child; the two spiders in the kitchen; the rust on the shower fixtures; the incredibly noisy heater; the fact that we bumped into doors all night, fumbling for the bathroom in the dark; and, in the morning, the fact that there were no flats on the windows, allowing the light to flow in at daybreak.The view, yes, was quite lovely from our windows, but other than that, the suite struck us as nothing more than a glorified Holiday Inn room. I, in fact, have been in Holiday Inns where I felt a great deal more comfortable. I took a walk on the private beach in the morning, only to find a bar-b-que pit with beer cans and garbage strewn about.
