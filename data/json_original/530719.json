Not sure where the star ratings come from, but it was a very poor advert for the starring system! On arrival we discovered that most of the other parents had already checked out and gone somewhere else! We were given a key to our room which was on the 5th floor - the door would not shut unless we locked it and even then it was a struggle and there was barely any room to get the 2 suitcases in, nevery mind 2 people. The bathroom was tiny and the shower difficult to get into although to be fair the water was hot. The towels were minute and had holes in. Breakfast consisted of a coffee machine which made the most disgusting coffee, which had a rather nasty scum on top of it, and the croissants were fairly dry. Jam to help these along was either pink or orange in colour, but certainly not anything in taste!

I don't think so, more like minus two star. I was on a school trip we first stayed in a lovely hotel in Sorrento and then came up to Rome with high expectations that our hotel would be equally as nice as the previous one. We were wrong!!! It's not as if we are a fussy bunch of teenagers, but we do expect the basics, even the teachers that were with us were complaining! First of all my room was absolutely tiny - a twin room with four beds! We struggled to fit our regular sized suitcases in the room. Second, our door wouldn't close or lock properly, which made us all rather uncomfortable. Third, there was a fusty smell in every room and some rooms smelt damp, thankfully ours didn't. In a classmates room, there was a blood stain on the curtain and the toilet wouldn't flush properly. One of the sockets in our room was broken. The shower door wouldn't close right. Our beds were extremely low and there was poor lighting in the room. Everyone was very cramped in the hotel. The corridors were narrow and it was very awkward for 42 noisy and excited sixteen year olds to move around in. Then the breakfast ................uuuugh! I couldn't eat anything - no joke and I am not a fussy eater. The croissants had blue mould on them, the bread was hard, no toaster, no orange juice (pineapple juice which nobody likes instead), sweet milk, smelly water and the delph was cracked and chipped. Luckily I had brought some food so I didn't starve in the morning. Being typical Irish teenagers, most of us can't survive without the cup of tea, guess what?? No tea, but a classmate brought teabags so we survived. The hotel doesn't even have a kitchen i.e. no oven,grill or microwave. Some of the teachers that have porridge every morning couldn't even have it because there was no microwave, mad isn't it? We were told by the hotel staff (who by the way were super rude and grumpy and I'm not letting them away with the excuse of having noisy teenagers around, because we were fairly quiet!) that we could have the drinks in the mini fridge free of charge, but on check out they were looking for us to pay for the drinks, we refused and they weren't too impressed. I had a great time in Rome and spent as little time a possible in the hotel. To say the hotel was disappointing is an understatement and I will never be returning to Hotel Lux! By the way if anyone is still interested in staying at Hotel Lux, the cost for a twin room B&B for one night is \u20ac100!!

Nevertheless, every day the cleaning lady took them out of the closet and put it back on the bed. It was disgusting! The room itself was so small that we barely put our bags inside. Ofcourse, unpacking was out of question, because of lack of space. The bathroom was disgusting: The shower cabin was falling apart and full of mold. The toilet bowl was just like on the picture that somebody attached on this web site previously. Breakfast: Dirty and old cutlery, bread from yesterday, ham good for rats maybe... O yeah, not to forget salty coffee... The staff was very polite and alyaws at service... until the last day. Then they told us that we had to leave our rooms not later than 10 am, athough it was written on the info sheet in the room that we could stay until noon. When I complained, they said nothing...

When has taxi dopeed us there we were nicely surprized to see that this was 4 star hotel and were excited by that only fact...But later when we went to our room were were surprised even more when we dicovered that room was too small for the hotel of that category, bathroom was small and awfull and not really clean. Double bad was not really double but rather 1.5 person size. Night was cold and we were searching for tha blanket in the room and found one in the wardrobe, but it was so old and dirty like it has never been washed. I went to the reception and asked to change the blanket but the guy on the reception could not undrestand what I was talking about and first brought me a sheet but not blanket , finally we managed to understand each other. But the replacement was not even better, at least it was a clean blanket but also like 20 years old. TV did not work, in the morning my husband got angly cause he counld not close door of the shower cabin and then shower held down and hit his to the head once he turned the water. I was also not lucky when I turned on the hair dryier and the pipe was broken from the main body . Breakfast...this is another story deserving another 10 minutes typing. I used to stay in 2 starts hotels in different cities like Amsterdam and London, but the breakfasts there were much better and fresh and you can not even compare with lux breakfast in that lux 4 star hotel.

After walking around the city for hours it was great to have a place to soak your feet. LOL. The rooms did not have a working A/C.
