Our first stay in this property while we were at a convention. There is a dedicated bridge over the main street and rail lines that put you right at Petco and a couple of blocks from the Gaslamp District, so only did cabs a couple of times when we were going outside of that area. Rooms were nice and spacious, Pools is big and screened from the wind. Vela and Odysea are both very nice venues for a drink or snack and the main restaurant was fine for breakfast and lunch. Big caveat is that you want a room on the bay / convention center side. That was automatic for Hilton Honors and an upgrade for others. The back side is an industrial view. Also, slightly annoying is that the pool abute a Dole unloading facility which is noisy and active when a ship comes in. You won't hear it in the room, but if you are at the pool or outdoor at the two bars, it will be noticable.

It is in a great location in terms of the views and if you want to walk along the bayfront, as the name indicates. The rooms are lovely and the service was good. I was there for a conference, and was a bit disappointed at the lack of restaurants in the immediate area. When you have limited time to eat lunch, it would be nice to have a couple of places nearby, but the hotel is on the opposite side of the train tracks from the gaslamp district, so you have to walk 10 or 15 minutes just to find a sandwich. The hotel restaurant is not that great and fairly expensive. When we were there for the conference, the Starbucks at the bottom of the hotel was always packed, but you couldn't find another coffee shop that was close by, so the hotel felt isolated. If I were coming as a tourist but looking for a similar experience, I'd stay at the Hilton Gaslamp instead, mainly for the proximity to restaurants, etc. The Gaslamp area is nice with a lot going on in the evenings. I also found it a bit frustrating how expensive parking was, even though that is relatively standard for this type of hotel. It was nearly $30 per day. You could park at the convention center for only $10, and that is right next door! Additionally, they charge for a refrigerator in the room. Again, standard for this kind of hotel (but I had recently stayed at the Sheraton in La Jolla which was actually just as nice as this hotel and included a free fridge). It just annoyed me that they were nickel-and-diming when the hotel is so expensive in the first place.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cStayed for a conference - Stylish lobby\u201d", "Author": "Fiend", "ReviewID": "UR127863919", "Content": "Good hotel.

I think I like the Gaslamp Quarter better (stayed there for 5 nights and only 1 at the Bayfront), but I must say it was a very good stay. The conference was almost totally held at the Bayfront, so I spent most of my other 5 days there. Nice property, bright, clean, and equipped with bars and snackplaces everywhere. But the view, man, the view. You can spend the whole day at the bar and just watch the bay. Well, one more thing to make me come back to town. The location is OK. Although it is within walking distance from the main attractions at the Gaslamp Quarter, it is still a long walk from the hotel. And I did not feel that confortable crossing the railroad everytime I wanted to go to the city (there was no major disturbance, though). The room was big and very clean. Mine faced the port, so i did not have the amazing view that others may have (the ones facing the marine). However, as I did not spend much time there, it did make no difference to me. Overall, the room was very good, as we had wireless internet access, a vending machine a few yards down the hall and a very functional workstation in the room. Did not have the time to enjoy the gym or to hang out at the pool (probably someone who will stay there for more time than me may remind that hint, the pool is beautiful and it faces the sea. It's a must go). The breakfast was OK. Did not have any complaints, but there was also nothing to make it remarkful. Staff was very nice.

A footbridge links the hotel to Petco Park - home of the San Diego Padres. Positives. Great beds. We had a queen room and the beds were so comfy and we slept really well. Breakfast: massive selection and good quality. Only downside was that we had to ask for fresh orange juice 3 times on the morning we had breakfast. Great views from the hotel. We were on the 27th floor. Negatives: We had to pay for Wifi. Having stayed in 5 hotels in California during our holiday, this was the only hotel we had to pay for Wifi ($13.95 for 24 hours). Housekeeping made an error with our laundry by telling us that we would get it back in 24 hours even though this 24 hours included Easter Sunday. Inevitably it did not arrive back on Easter Sunday so we had to wait until 10.00 am on Monday to get it Ba ck which then delayed our departure by 2 hours. The laundry charge was reimbursed.

This particularly needs to be mentioned because the hotel was hosting a convention for 5000-6000 people and all the rooms were full. Despite their work load, all the hotel employers were very nice. Specifically, at the Vela restaurant, Jorge, was always quick, ready with our orders. some tips for the hotel- its location is great, i had a car and it was easy to find and very easy to park- i parked at the 3rd level which is right next to the hotel reception, we walked to seaport village for two nights- it is a very nice walk on the boardwalk in front of the hotel and had dinner there. gaslamp quarter was also a few steps away with the bridge connecting the hotel directly to the quarter. in terms of parking, what i did was i bought the bundle your way package which included parking and breakfast for 25$ a night- otherwise only parking was 27$, so this was a great deal. wi-fi was included in our hotel convention rate, but you could also choose that as part of the bundle your way package. breakfast buffet at the vela restaurant was highly satisfactory, and my daughter was able to get her omelettes done as she liked them- i was also able to hold three business meetings at the restaurant so it was good in terms of saving time. i also used room service and they were prompt, and the food was good. we had lunch/dinner at the fox sports grill-which is below the hotel in front of the promenade, the food was basic american and the atmosphere was very nice. there is also a starbucks and yogurt place on site which we did not use, in addition the pool area and the spa seemed perfect but we did not have time to use those facilities either. it was however very nice to sit outside in front of the fox grill with the fireplace and the ocean behind you. all in all, this is the place to stay in san diego, rooms are perfect with a wonderful view, the staff is delightful and the location is excellent.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "KellyBayArea", "ReviewID": "UR127567547", "Content": "The location of this hotel is great!

My hubby and 3 year old took advantage of the pool everyday and our daughter enjoyed making crafts as well (nice service they provide for free for those with little ones). Also, beware that parking in the garage gets tough on days that the Padres are playing cuz they sell parking for $15 on game days. Who wouldn't want to park here when the stadium is right across the street? This was frustrating for us especially since we were hotel guests.

With conference booking, we got free wifi which was a super perk (they left a message on the phone with the password) and wifi worked seemlessly in the hotel bedrooms, thank goodness. My husband and colleagues were appalled that the waitstaff were clanging dishes and serving etc during a lunch session when speakers were presenting. We hope that the hotel can communicate better with conference organizers to prevent this rudeness by organizing time/breaks when there is no food service and disruption to speakers. The main onsite restaurant Vela was terrible - they messed up our order twice (bringing the wrong dish to our table and then the dish had the wrong side dish) and the total time between sitting down and finally getting our meal was 45 minutes. It was not busy and there was no compensation. I would not eat there unless you absolutely felt lazy and don't want to leave the hotel. Maybe try the Sports Bar. Location is good, right next to the Convention Centre and 5 minutes walk to Petco Park and 5th Ave/Gaslamp Area. Horton Plaza shopping was disappointing. We had dinner at the Hotel Del Coronado one night. It's worth visiting that historic hotel across the Coronado bridge. There is some strange thing about which kind of taxis and can you between San Diego and Coronado though. Nobu in the Hard Rock Hotel across the street was excellent. I was also displeased to find out that packages I sent to this hotel required at least a $6 fee per package for handling as all their mail is processed through the UPS store. No other hotels at which I've stayed had this policy but I think because this hotel is so large, it requires this service. You can check-in for your flight and print your boarding pass for free in the UPS Store/Business Centre. I still give this hotel a 5 points because it was comfortable and new. We paid conference price for this hotel, which was still about $250 per night. I would only consider it again if it was quite discounted.

Pros: 1. Rooms, clean, modern with comfy beds, good down-style pillows, and a large window with pseudo seat to take in the view. 2. Location, PERFECT for a convention,and a bridge to Petco park, right on the bay with fantastic views of Coronado island, a walkway along the waterway connecting you to the convention center, marriott, hyatt, sea port village, and eventually USS midway if you are a GREAT walker. However, only on site restaurants are there, everything else is a bit of a walk. 3. Pool, nice heated pool and jacuzzi with view of the bay (and a large Dole Freighter while we were there) and a Huge TV playing the NCAA basketball tournament. 4. Noise, this is the kicker, some of the other hotels are really near the trolly or worse train, that blows its horn throughout the night. I didn't hear much of anything from my room except some howling wind, but we were in the midst of a heavy winter storm. 5. Views, the lobby bar and various other vantage points have really pretty views of the bay, and had the weather been nicer we would have enjoyed our drink on the deck. They even have a fire ring outside that looked like a fun place to enjoy a drink. Cons: 1. Parking, was $27, I think, my frugal husband did free street parking blocks away, not sure how he found that but he was determined. 2. Service, we only interacted with the staff at check-in and check-out: check-in was luke warm and check-out was really slow due to a couple of guests with prolonged transactions Tips: 1. We bought the bed and breakfast package for an extra $30/nt for 2 buffet passes because I read on Tripadvisor the cash price is like $24? for one so I thought we'd just commit ahead of time. 2.

As we were there for a celebration they upgraded us to an bay facing room which was great except it did not have a bathtub in the bathroom. The hotel is beautiful and large with conference levels and a running/walking path that goes all along the bay. As Hitlon honors Gold we were provided with free access to the spa facilities and a 25 dollar credit to a treatment. The spa has a lounge area with refreshments and an eucalyptus steam room . We spent quite some time enjoying the facilities every day. We also got free appetizers at the Hotel bar which consisted of a handful of chips and some olives. Don't bother using these, you end up paying too much for a drink that you of course need to wash away the salty olives! Service was okay, the staff were helpful and gave us directions whenever we needed it. In fact the doormen and maids were the nicest, the girls are the desk not so much. Parking is extremely expensive at 25 dollars per day but we were okay with that as we got our room for $120 per night. Usually with Hilton gold breakfast is included but instead they give you a voucher for a drink and food item at the starbucks which is attached. You could trade the voucher in and pay an extra $10 for the breakfast buffet which is no way was worth the $35 they were charging. It had a sad looking omelet bar and not enough variety. In addition service was slow. The key advantage of the Hotel is its location to the Gaslamp district which was a half a mile away as well as the stadium.

We had a bedroom connected to a hospitality suite. PRO Great location. The hotel is near the gaslight district (walking distance), so plenty of places to go eat for lunch or dinner. If you plan to walk at nighttime I would check with concierge what is the safest way to go, as a friend from San Diego told me downtown can be \"spotty\" when it comes to safety\u2014meaning that one block could be perfectly OK, then next block is not that safe. If you get a room with a view on Coronado island, bring binoculars. You will see plenty of actions during the day and perhaps catch a glimpse of the Navy Seals returning from their daily practice and of course all sort of military and civilian vessels. The hospitality suite was very nice and very very large. The views were breathtaking, if it wasn't for a large framed print that detached from the wall and almost hit my daughter on the head I will have no complains. If you like jogging or walking you can take a nice stroll all the way down to the shops at the end of the Bayfront (past the convention center). You will walk by the marina and there are a couple of really lovely parks on the water. Beds were comfortable. Loved the Peter Thomas Roth products in the bathrooms! Had a lovely massage at the SPA. They will add 20% gratuity by default, but at least you will be notified prior to receiving the service and you can always adjust the gratuity accordingly. CONS I am going to talk about the \"package highjack fee\" because it was the first I ever encountered such a thing, and we travel a lot. We had a package shipped to our room. Apparently concierge or the front desk will not hold the package and will send it to the business center instead (which seems to be run by UPS.) You can get your package ONLY if you pay a fee. Of course no one will tell you about that and if you call concierge they may not know about it either. Here's the best part\u2014you would expect a small consistent fee, right? No! the fee is calculated based on the size and weight of the package, so unless you know how much your package weights you'll have no clue until you are trying to redeem it. We had to pay $6.99 for one small package that was probably less than a 1/4 pound. The fee was twice the cost of shipping\u2014the irony! At the business center we were \"greeted\" by a very rude young woman which had no interest in helping us (Note for management: this person was working on Friday, March 2nd at 6:25PM) . She was slamming envelops on the desk, being very unfriendly and completely annoyed by our presence. When we asked if she could please open the package, she ran the xacto knife so close to my husband hands we thought she was going to cut him! Service at the business center was despicable\u2014and I am still wondering what that fee covers and what if I do not want to pay the fee?...I don't get my package? Some of the cleaning ladies, were sort of...obnoxious and not very discreet. For example they would enter the room without too much notice or without announcing themselves and one in particular, if she saw us in the hallway, she would ask \"Does your room need cleaning today?\". I think that was the first time ever I was asked that question in a hotel! There are two restaurants in the hotel, but the menus are very limited and fairly boring. They also seem to have problems understanding the difference between \"rare\" and \"medium rare\". Children six and under seems to eat free at the breakfast buffet, but some waiters will omit the information... The bedroom itself was very small and average. Inquire about the cost of WIFI as they seem to charge per device and at $13 per day, with multiple laptops, ipads, iphones etc it can get pricey. SPA: it would be a good idea if the cleaning crew does not have to walk through the relaxation area with dirty towels etc\u2014perhaps an alternate route that does not involve passing through the relaxation area? They should also avoid cleaning (dusting in my case) the relaxation area while guests are in there. TIPS The San Diego Zoo is a must-see, but take a trip to La Jolla (bring plenty of quarters for parking). Our daughter enjoyed exploring the tidal pools and probably had more fun there she had at the Zoo. Check online for the best time of the day to go explore the pools. For lunch go to Georges. Great food and location. It can get a bit crazy there, so expect to wait one hour for a table. Additionally check out La Valencia hotel\u2014A little gem, in Hispanic style! and if you like Dr. Seuss stop by Legends Gallery, Fine Art of La Jolla. Great cupcakes at Sprinkles in La Jolla Village (there's also a Whole Foods there).", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest Hilton in all of the USA!!!\u201d", "Author": "Bessdressed", "ReviewID": "UR125968077", "Content": "Hands down the absolutely BEST Hilton in all the country!

The internet access in this hotel was unfortunately not complimentary; instead one has to pay a minimum of $13.95 per day. There is complimentery WiFi access in the lobby of the hotel, but this does not get mentioned anywhere. The bed and the pillows were fine for me, i.e., I slept well despite having to cope with a 9h time difference. Having said that, I got woken up one night by clanking noises. As it turned out a Dole banana freighter had just arrived and they had started unloading the banana containers onto trucks straight away. Once they had unloaded the ship, they loaded it with empty containers, which turned out to be even noisier. The entire process continued for the next three days & nights, which was a bit annoying, but I suppose there is nothing the hotel can do about it.

Nothing stands out in particular except that its nice Hilton now has the new Peter Thomas Roth amenities in the bathroom, which is a lot better than the previous line of no name products. The restaurants, as others have mentioned are a little overpriced. The Fox Sports Bar which is on the lower level, is pretty decent and packed but closes earlier than expected on the weekends. The lobby bar has last call at 1am, even if its packed, which is surprising. Overall, your best bet is to explore restaurants in other parts of downtown San Diego, and if its outside the gaslamp quarter, you can always share a cab. The hotel website and some tripadvisor reviews are misleading. The hotel is close to the gaslamp quarter but be aware it is a hike, especially if you're short on time. You need to calculate at least 15min each way unless you plan on jogging across the bridge and over to the heart of the gaslamp quarter. Some folks I know would just cab it over (approx $5), especially if time is a factor and/or if you have challenges walking distances. The hotel is a brisk 10 min walk to the convention center and there were shuttles to/from the hotel, during the convention, which ran infrquently, since this tends to be one of the closest hotels. Overall, it's a nice hotel, good customer service and a convenient location.

I found this out the hardway when I asked for directions for the concierge desk and was given either out right wrong information or misleading information. As far as the hotel stay went, it was just okay. I appreciated that the rooms were very quiet and there was plenty of counterspace. I would recommend an upgrade to a bayview room. Now, the problems... The second day I tryed to use the iron in my room. It either had not been cleaned or the previous user added a fluid to it other than water. So, when I started to iron my pants, the iron leaked out the fluid and stained it. I called the conceirge desk and they offered to send up a replacement iron, but said nothing about the pants. When the maintenance man arrived, I told him that they should pay for the pants to be cleaned since it wasn't my fault that the iron was broken. He agreed and told me that I get the pants back in the afternoon. When I checked into my room later, the pants were there with a note that the cost of the cleaning would not be charged to me. When I checked out a few days later, the cost of the dry cleaning was charged to me anyway, in addition to the entire cost of the trip, which had been pre-paid by my company. I explained this to the desk clerk, who was very rude and incompetent. Flustered by the conversation, I left my coat before getting into the cab. Once I got to the airport, I realized I was missing it, so I called back to the hotel. Hours later, they called me to say they found the coat and would send it UPS Ground.

When they say it's bayfront, they are not lying. Location: Like I mentioned, this property is right in front of the bay. Coronado Bridge to the west and the Naval base to the east, then the beautiful and lively downtown San Diego to the south. Getting around the hotel might get a little tricky as the road leads/leaves the hotel is parallel to a very busy set of train tracks. In addition it's right next to the Gaslamp Quarter which is constantly in heavy traffic. However don't let this get you down, as I suggest you WALK or take the public transportation (San Diego Trolley right in front) to wherever your destination is. Many of the close by destinations can keep you busy for a good 24 hours. Let it be family, historic or just some night life, you can pretty much find it around the hotel. Hotel: As many of you mentioned, unlike many Hilton properties in historic towns, this one is a very new hotel. I do not recall when it was built but if you compare to it's sister hotel literally across the street, this is not your typical, San Diego jaded hotels. If upbeat, new and bright is what you are looking for, then this is the hotel for you. The lobby is large, clean and bright. First impression it gave you is a very upbeat and comfortable welcome as you step into the lobby. Many amenities are located close to the lobby and it doesn't take much leg work to find whatever you are looking for. Also I must give credit to the sofas around the lobby right by the giant windows, they are comfortable. With the view of either the bay or the cityscapes, it's a very welcoming treat. Staff / Service: Friendly and professional. I simply don't need any other adjectives to describe them. Prompt, fast, sometimes very funny, treats everybody with their best. Not just the front desk staff, pretty much everybody I came across in the hotel are just well, happy and friendly. Valet is one of the most efficient I've ever seen. Cost a bit much but then again parking in San Diego, especially in downtown area is nothing but a major hassle. The valet is daily-rated so you have in-and-out access. Check in / out are fast. Now here's where the perk comes in... if you are a HHonors member like I do and when you reach certain level, you will realize that it's totally worth being royal and all the perks that comes with it makes the whole stay a new experience. Room / Amenities: I originally booked the corner view room but was offered an eUpgrade standbys. Now you can only get this if you book directly from Hilton. So upon check in, I was offered the Executive Corner Suite, aka the Sea Suite at the north west corner of top floors, at a pretty steep discount. Again you can only get these offers if you book directly from Hilton and being a HHonor member. The room was one of the BEST view rooms I've stayed at in any Hilton properties. Check out the pictures I included below and you will see why. It's large, clean, very modern and best of all, the view. From Coronado Bridge to the entire downtown San Diego, just the view is worth the price. The amenities in the room are very new. Furniture and all the fixtures are kept in good shape, however some of them needs a little maintenance. The bedroom is roomy, the bathroom is even better. Which if you have a standard of what a modern hotel should be equipped with, then this Hilton meets all the standards. One thing I had problem with was the bed. Now I am not sure if it's the mattress itself or what, but it seems like it's broken. The best way I can put it is the mattress I slept on was way too soft/plush without proper support. As if the springs inside has no tension to support any weight. More or less I had a good sleep there. Oh yes you can hear almost no noise at all! Which can be a tricky thing to do when some of the locomotives running at full power slowly passes by the hotel. Overall I would suggest this hotel to those whom wants to see downtown San Diego and the magnificent view of the bay at the same time. I see a lot of business travelers but not a lot of families here. Then again at the time of my visit it's not considered peak time for tourism. Remember this is at one of the prime location of San Diego and the hotel itself is very new.

Located just across the San Diego Convention Center, this hotel is close to almost everything of interest in downtown San Diego.It is conveniently near the gaslamp district where you will find all sorts of bars and restaurants and is also a few minutes walk to the USS midway museum. Very near also is the train stop which you can take to go to as far as the Las Americas outlet mall near the border of Mexico. The rooms are spacious and adequately furnished and the amenities are above average. I also love the bar with a patio facing the bay where you can have drinks at night. The walkway connecting to the bay walk is perfect for our early morning runs. The only negative thing i can say about this hotel is our experience at the breakfast buffet. We stayed for 5 days in the hotel and everyday we had to wait for atleast 15 minutes to get a table. They do give you a pager but you can't really go very far and there were not enough seats while waiting, so every morning you will see a long queu leading to the restaurant. We tried going early, at 630AM, and late, 9Am, but still the line was long. The staff explained that the hotel was full and that there were several conventions going on in the convention center. But they should have anticipated that given their location or atleast open another restaurant for breakfast if the hotel is full. To make things worst, you get the same food everyday. The choices did not vary and you will see the same type of food on the same tray on the same spot everyday. Again, they know that most of their guests are attending conventions which lasts for a few days so they should atleast vary their food selections (atleast the main courses) everyday. What made us go back to breakfast everyday (aside from the fact that it is included in the room charges) are the very courteous and friendly staffs in the restaurant.

Not that it was a drip or insufficient (and I'm all for water conservation), but it seemed just a litle on the narrow or weakish side given the room in the tub/shower (with the amply curved \"american-style\" shower rod).

In fact, I can't think of another hotel that comes close of providing the facilities/services this Hilton offered for that price. Transfers from the hotel are available, but you'll probably end up needing a rental if you're heading out of the downtown area, so you may as well pick up the car at the airport and drive the 10 mins to the hotel - it's not a difficult route and there is amble self-parking available (but the parking garage layout can be a little confusing). It seems a bit odd that in order to access some of the amenities (sports bar, starbucks, etc) you have to leave the hotel, walk round a corner, and enter from the outside. Then repeat the exercise to back into the hotel. Not a major trauma, but its a bit bemusing that you can't access them from inside like you can the cocktail bar and restaurant. A quick walk over the bridge delivers you to the Gaslamp area and more restaurants/bars that you'll probably ever need and catering to every budget and preference. If you just want to stretch your legs then the waterfront is right outside and you can wander along looking at various floating maritime attractions. Breakfast is good, with an amble buffet and portions from the menu are sufficient to see you through the morning (and maybe more!). Food at the Fox sports bar is perfectly acceptable, if somewhat predictable, but then it's a sports bar so you know exactly what's what. Rooms are clean and tidy, sensibly sized, the same can be said for the bathroom. Higher floors have better views, and if you plan to spend time looking out the window then opt for one overlooking the bridge rather than the container docks. The higher up you go the less noise is apparent and there's little need to close the curtains - no one can look in - and if you're not fussed at the scenery then save yourself the extra $ charged for the bridge view and stare out the window at nothing in particular from the comfort of the bed. I'm sure it's an endless source of amusement to the check-in staff as bemused guests wander around the lobby looking for the elevators that take you to the floor you're looking for - it isn't immediately obvious.

The hotel is very modern, with sleek lines and large, open spaces. The atmosphere is a little cold because of the modern style, but that is made up for by the warm customer service. At check-in, the lady at the front desk was friendly and professional. I had booked a Bay-City view King room, and I requested a room with more of a bay view, if one was available. She assigned us to Room 1602, which was on the very end of the hotel, overlooking San Diego Bay. What an amazing view! (See the picture I took from my window.) Our room was immaculately clean, and very comfortable. The bathroom had gorgeous lighting, and the water pressure in the shower was very strong (which is unusual for a hotel). I wanted to take that shower home with me! The room was very quiet, and I never heard any noise from the hallway. The pool area is nice, with a gorgeous view of the bay. A large container ship was unloading right outside of the hotel, but is was cool to watch. If I was trying to relax all day, the noise from the ship might have been a little annoying, but that is beyond the control of the hotel. I would have preferred a little more greenery by the pool area, but again, it was in keeping with the cool, modern architecture. We had drinks at the \"Odysea\" bar off of the lobby, which had a lovely view of the sunset at Happy Hour (discounted beer and well drinks). The service was again friendly and professional. Afterwards, we headed to the Gaslamp district for dinner, which is a short stroll from the hotel. I would be happy to stay at the Hilton Bayfront again..

If you are simply on vacation to the city and plan on spending time in downtown, it is a perfect location to access everything you need. A few extras: If you spend anytime at the pool, there will be a guy who comes around and takes drink orders, however if you don't mind hopping up to get your own drinks, head into the Vela Restaurant bar, and the beers are about $2 cheaper than what the guy outside is charging (he works for a different restaurant/bar at the hotel, and for some reason they charge more for the same size drinks) The hotel is right on the bay, and walking up the sidewalk along the bay makes for a gorgeous morning stroll or jog.

The rooms start 6th floor onwards so whatever floor you get, I am sure you will have some view and the higher you get the better the view becomes. Being a Hilton Honors member got us rooms on 22nd floor facing the bay, my mother-in-law was awed by the experience, staying here made it a perfect first vacation with her. They don't have an executive / club lounge for Hilton Honors members but they give you breakfast coupons for Starbucks good for ANY drink and ANY food item at their in-house Starbucks. We were also able to use those coupons to get a discounted price (only $10) for the breakfast buffet (more of a brunch.....) ! However the evening HHonors coupons for Odysea lounge were hardly worth anything, the front desk told us those were good for any food appetizer but the lounge folks honored those for only chips and humus serving (weird disconnect). Explained that to the front desk and they comped us some of that expense, Hilton customer service always wins me over ! The hotel has done considerable development around the area and even if you are not staying here, I would recommend visiting the complex and try one of the awesome signature cocktails at their Odysea bar in the evening on the outside terrace seating with a view of the bay. They advertise that the herbs used in their cocktails are from the personal garden of the executive chef, can't get more organic and low carbon foot print than that !! They also have this amazing footbridge that connects the hotel to Gaslamp Quarters, it reminded me of the Helix bridge in Singapore, great piece of engineering. There was a wedding at the hotel when we were there and the bride and groom must have spent almost half an hour just posing on this bridge ! Another tip, if you want to rent a car and drive around don't bother to rent from airport location, the hotel has an on-site car rental booth and with some good planning you can rent only for the day you need the car, return in the evening and avoid steep $27 self parking charge.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Place, Even In The Dark!\u201d", "Author": "bagoda1", "ReviewID": "UR118532861", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel for two nights while attending a conference a couple of weeks ago.

Spent the weekend here and I must say we were quite pleased. I'm one to nit pick on details and so here's the breakdown: Service: Amazing and friendly staff throughout the property. Checking in was a breeze; we asked to be upgraded to a better room for a slightly higher price, and a bundle package with parking and a breakfast buffet, so it really worked for us. The staff at Vela restaurant for breakfast was great too, even if they were busy with conferences/meetings going on. Checking out was no problem as well. We reviewed our account summary, found a discrepancy and they immediately fixed it without hesitation. Room: Very clean and simple room, which I appreciate. Comfortable bed. Nice flat screen tv. Spacious enough. Nice view (I believe the bay view is better than the Coronado bridge view). Bathroom is clean with plenty of counter space. Shower was a good size and water pressure was great, but wished for a slightly larger shelf. More hooks or racks for towels/clothes would have been nice too. And they have the narrowest trash cans ever in here too. Again, I am super nit-picky. Pool/Spa: I did not use either one, but I did look around the pool area. It is clean, with a large screen tv, and cabanas available. It looks just fine. Location: The great thing about this place (to me at least) is that is just a tad bit secluded from all the hustle and bustle, so you get a quieter stay vs. staying somewhere right in the middle of the action. You are right on the bay, you are right next to the convention center, and you have a connecting pedestrian bridge (also alongside the parking structure - and 3rd floor is most convenient) that takes you right to Petco Park and Gaslamp District w/ the bars, restaurants, etc. It's not more than an easy 10-15 minute walk max, depending on how far you go. You do have restaurants on site and you do have Starbucks and a frozen yogurt place as well. Price: This part is really subjective. It just depends on the time of year and their availability. I feel the price I got here was a very fair deal considering all things, so I felt I got a great value for my stay. They do charge for parking, and they do charge $1.00 telephone access fee, even if you don't use it. Overall hotel: I am impressed. This place is super clean yet inviting and comfortable.

Loved the views of the bay, Coronado and Point Loma, and the room was very comfortable with no allergy problems. As Hilton honors members we received free wifi and starbucks coupons. Loved the morning coffee from Starbucks and the sandwich or sweet. Had a snack in the Odysea bar since they no longer have an Executive Suite for Hilton Honors members. I can't really rate the food as the only special snacks we received was the Hummus dips (sun dried tomato & pesto), the atmosphere was nice and the service very good. We had breakfast buffet one morning in Vela. I expected more California fare than the carrot juice. The fruit was cantaloupe, watermelon & honey dew melon I can get anywhere. Nothing too special and the cook needs to learn how to cook eggs. Fox Grill was just a bar with bar food and not the best waitresses. The one we had (we did not know) was ending her shift we later found out. Very brusk and uninviting. Will only eat there again if nothing else is available. Did not try the spa. Our son did on a previous visit and enjoyed it thoroughly. He also said the pool was nice with the HUGE television. Had a wonderful day at the Art at the Bay that weekend and it was sponsored my the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. Thank you Hilton it was an added bonus. We had a lovely walk along the bay to and from Seaport Village. Beautiful walk with great sites to see. There were so many great restaurants around the area and so close by. Shopping close by in the Gaslamp and transportation within reach. If you want to venture out and didn't rent a car, they have Enterprise Car rental in the hotel. The only draw back was the parking charge of $27 self park. The Valet was even higher. We needed a car so just didn't think of the extra cost. The only drawback would be the port on the south side, but even that was not noisy and we enjoyed watching them load the ships. We WILL visit this Hilton again as it fulfilled all of our needs.

We sat outside and enjoyed a drink there. Great view for fireworks at night. You are directly across the street from the Padres stadium. Short walk across the bridge and you are there. We were on a high floor and did not hear the trains at night like you do at the other Hilton. If you have a family they have a kids check in on the weekend. Very cute! We got a cabana one day to sit by the pool. Has a TV which is fun and helps prevent boredom. Drinks at the bat by the pool are great and decent food, make your own tacos. Make sure you try the self serve frozen yogurt place next to Starbucks. Cool concept and reasonably priced.

On the plus side, the hotel is located right on the water so there are some great water and sunset views. Unfortunately, there's a big container ship harbor right in front as well, so the view was *dominated* by a giant cargo ship. The hotel is also brand new, so the rooms are modern and feels totally clean. The pool and jacuzzi deck also looks like a really nice place to hang out. The decor is modern, with lots of white ... but it just feels quite cold. This hotel ultimately is really just a nice business hotel. It's clean but pricey, relatively convenient but lacks personality. My point of reference is always \"would I pay to stay here for leisure\".

There is a salt water pool that looks out on to the bay. There is a loading and an unloading dock for ships on the left side of the hotel & pool. It didn't really bother me too much. There was a yellow dole pineapple ship unloading for the three days we were there. You will get to see lots of navy ships and some commercial ships come in and out of the bay daily. The area felt very safe and clean. The rooms were very nice. There were three restuarants on site as well as a starbucks and a frozen yogurt shop. The prices were not too terrible. If you can pay the little extra for the view of the city and the bay. It is worth it. There is a ship yard view, I heard it was not so great.

The hotel is immediately across a side-street from the SD Convention Center, on an embarcardero across Harbor Drive from the Gaslamp area, on the San Diego Bay. Orientation of the hotel is E-W (so rooms face either north or south). Our 23rd-floor room faced south, providing a perfect view of...the Dole (as in fruits) freight yard immediately to the south of the property, where a freighter that was in port was being worked the whole time we were there. It actually wasn't offensive to look at, as the operations were neat and orderly. But we were poolside one afternoon and the engine/generator noise coming from the freighter was a little more pronounced than just white noise in the background. I say it's the perfect business hotel because the lobby, access, and public areas are all business. It's like being in a class \"A\" downtown high-rise office building. Expansive open spaces, tall ceilings, lots of wood and stone surfaces, escalators to move you up and down to the street level, and meeting rooms right off the lobby. It's clearly not catering to kids (though there were many families there) and that was just fine. The pool is a token pool, not very large, not intended for all-day leisure. We did enjoy massages at the spa, attached to the fitness center. Good service, good-sized (not too small, not Las Vegas-opulent). Again, clearly targeted at the business traveler. I was a little disappointed with the bed which seemed a little springy and cheap for the quality of the hotel. As a business hotel it's a very easy recommendation.

I sincerely felt like they had cheaped out on the food, which again, from an \"upscale\" hotel, I was not expecting this. The first night, it was a bento box whose largest portion of the box contained nothing but cherry tomatoes.

The chicken was barely on the pizza, and the cheese was absolutely terrible. 2) The rooms and bathrooms are okay, but again - i've seen much nicer in less expensive hotels 3) The shampoo/conditioner they provided actually dried my hair out - which has never happened! I always use the hotel shampoo and conditioner, even if i'm in a cheaper hotel - and have never had a problem with it. My hair is brittle and dry thanks to the hotel amenities!

It really is beautiful, with incredible eye-catching decor not just in the lobby but also tasteful pieces in the guest rooms. However, it's not worth it when it comes to the service. Every person I encountered (front desk, concierge, etc.) treated me rudely or coolly. By far the worst part about it was when I was checking out--they handed me my hotel bill in a SEALED envelope at the final moment and then started serving the next person in line, so that I couldn't review the charges before leaving. I have stayed in numerous hotels and NEVER have I encountered this before at any hotel--usually I am asked to review the charges before they actually charge me, in case there is anything amiss on them. I thought that this was really strange. So, just to make sure, while I'm standing there, I open the envelope to review the bill, and lo and behold, find a charge on there that wasn't mine, for pizza. I had it corrected, though it was incredibly awkward with the person after me being helped, and the staff member behaving as though correcting a charge was a huge inconvenience for her. The other downside about this hotel is that they nickel and dime you for little things that other hotels would not charge you for (internet, use of the gym, etc., and I didn't even use the parking garage), so it appears to be cheaper but in reality is probably just as or more expensive than other hotels in the area. In addition, it is a busy hotel--when I was there, there were probably two different meetings going on simultaneously, so the lobby was often crowded and full of people. The location of the hotel is both good and bad--it has great views of the water, and is right next to the convention center.

The hotel is clean, decently run and nicely decorated in a loose ocean theme, which while not my style, was very clean and modern.

They also have free wifi at the restaurant. The Cons: The wifi was expensive in the hotel (up to $18 a day) and rarely worked well, especially in the conference rooms. For a hotel that was designed with a business traveler in mind, and which has large conference rooms for business purposes, the wifi signal was very poor and disappeared in most rooms. There is a Starbucks at the hotel (you have to walk outside to get to it) and this is the only semi-cheap breakfast option. However it only has the regular Starbucks fare, with inflated prices, and often has a lineup out the door. When the hotel is at capacity or close to it there are long delays for the elevator. Often it would take 15 minutes just to travel from the lobby up to my room.

We encountered the same problem on checkout - I had to remind the staff of our package - they just gave us the standard check out which didn't account for our resort credit and parking. Perhaps a minor detail, but why does the customer have to make sure they get the right rate and benefits when they have already been booked/confirmed? Lastly, the wait staff in the Odysea on our first visit were a bit slow and didn't even mention the specials including the Happy Hour (HH) specials (which we had no idea about).

While I very much recommend this hotel for it's location, I would not recommend if you are looking to save a few bucks. We were lucky and got a good deal on a room via AAA.

You won't be able to get a Miller Light at the pool for less than $7 (a bit much for a domestic, bottle). However, a trick we learned on our last day is to visit Vela restaurant right inside from the pool and pay $5 for a beer on tap, (although they don't have domestic on tap). Cocktails were a bit too expensive as well. The cocktail watiresses at the pool were horrible. I counted at least 6 different times the girls saw my husband and I and still didn't come to our chairs - needless to say we didn't want to tip them even if we did eventually get service, so we went directly to the bar. There were no small fridges in the room, but we brought a small collapsible cooler and hit up Ralph's from some beer, wine, fruit and saved about $50 in a bar tab at the restaurant. The rooms were great! They were a bit smaller than what we are used to, but the bed was extremely comfortable and the rooms were very quiet. The Dole ship even docked on Sunday and Monday and was loading and unloading and from our room on the 15th floor, we couldn't hear a thing. Also, internet is a joke - if you can use your phone as a hot spot, you'll save a ton of money! The customer service at this hotel is lacking to say the least. We ran into maybe one person at the Odysea bar that was friendly. The front desk staff was unattentive at check-in, but great at check-out.

I felt the price was quite fair for this area. The place was spotless! The rooms are not oversized by there was plenty of space to move about for two adults sharing a room with a two year old and a 5 year old ( we took a room with 2 queen beds). I know that some folks will not like a room overlooking the bridge or the train tracks, but my 5 year old daughter woke up each morning, and grabbed her milk and dry cereal and would sit on the window sill behind the curtain each morning to marvel at the trains moving in and out ( I only heard 1 small horn around 8 at night during the 2 days we stayed there) and the boats plying the harbor. We took an add on package for each room for a cost of $25.00 each. For my room we took a 2 day wireless internet and self parking package. I was really impressed with the speed! (This is something that tends to bug me in hotels charging a small fortune for access to what amounts to dial up!) No dropped connection problems at all. For my mother's room we took a breakfast buffet and limited spa use package ( she could use the relaxation rooms, steam room, sauna and showers), so she did have to wait for my slow poke kids to get dressed and out the door for breakfast each day. Also provided her some serious recuperation time after chasing them through the San Diego Zoo, which is only 2 miles away from the hotel! As for the rooms, they were perfect. Beds are deliciously comfy, the shower had plenty of hot water and pressure even though were were up on the 28th floor. The toilet flushes whisper quiet. And did I mention the a/c unit?? SO QUIET!! The a/c is built flat into the wall so no bulky unit taking up floor space under your window or dripping stinky water onto the carpet. Always nice for those travelers that may need to set up a baby's crib or pack n play next to their bed. The TV's in the room are 42\" flat panel LG tv's. They connect to a very expanded satellite package including CNN, FOX, MSNBC, PBS, HBO HD, FOOD TV, HGTV, NICKELODEON (Sorry no Nick JR, fellow parents) and a ton of others. There is an extensive On Demand (pay per view) service. The one thing that bugged me was that you had to pay $2.99 for each kids programming episode, although for an additional cost you could buy a package. No problem, I just set the kids up in front of our computer for some dvd's or I could have streamed some stuff from Disney or Nick Jr. I know there are reviews out there that give negative notes re: the cost of parking ( $35.00 for valet or $25.00 for self parking) or the fact that there is no fridge or microwave in the rooms ( $25.00 if you want a fridge brought up to your room. Free if it is for a medical need, like storing meds or special foods.) We ALWAYS travel with a large rolling cooler and ice for kid and adult beverages, fruit, ect for the kiddos so never and issue for us.

The parking staff was also very rude because we didn't valet. We were told we were only given 10 minutes to check in and then we had to move our car immediately. The gal at the front desk who also checked us in was not friendly either. The plus is the Fox Sports Grill and the Spa at this hotel. I got the best massage I have ever received at the Spa, and I was able to use the coupon I got when I checked in. We also really enjoyed the Fox Sports Grille, especially my husband.

You will be charged an extra fee to send or receive any packages at the hotel in addition to your regular shipping charges. This can get pricey depending on your needs, so be careful.

I thought it might be fun to try someplace new. I'm so glad we did! The hotel has an amazing location to start. It is the last property located next door to the convention center. Thanks to the bridge that connects it back to Petco Park, you have immediate access to everything. In comparison to the other hotels in San Diego, it is not too pricey for what they are offer. Overnight parking is actually cheaper than a few other hotels in the same vicinity. Since the property is only two years old, the rooms are very nice, clean and comfy. When traveling with little ones, that's important. We enjoyed the Starbucks on the first floor and ate at the hotel bar as well. The pool is great and we spent time there also. From the hotel, you can even make the walk up to Seaport Village. It's relaxing as a walk on Sunday morning. Because of the marina, the children love it as they can see all of the boats. The service we received at the front desk was exceptional. Thank you to James and Robert. Other than that, the service at the rest of the property was good, but not memorable. When I say 'not memorable', I mean I didn't go out of my way to remember their names to say thank you. I think that's pretty much on par with everywhere else. Since the property is larger than that of places like the Omni, you don't necessarily see the same faces over and over again. That's not their fault, so you can't criticize them for that.

The hotel- The hotel is located across from PETCO field where the San Diego Padres play and within walking distance to the Gaslamp district. The Gaslamp district is where all of the nice shops and restaurants are located. So, the location of the hotel is quite good if your purpose is to spend time in downtown San Diego/Gaslamp.

We had to pay 20 dollars to upgrade to get this view but it was worth it. Anyway, bathroom was clean but not very big, the room itself was not very large but it was comfortable. No noise at all and very quiet. Room had contemporary colors and was adequately decorated. Room had flat screen t.v. Bathroom small but the shower area was larger with tile flooring and glass door. No tub. Part II. The Stay: Service was excellent. Check in Time was only about 10 minutes and conciere was helpful in giving information. Our package included the buffett. The buffett was EXCLLENT and highly reccommend the buffett. Buffett had more offerings than most hotels and the quality of food was great. We got our room for 150 dollars and it was well worth it.

I would definitely never tell anyone not to stay here, but I wouldn't strongly encourage them either. I think the actual hotel is very beautiful and modern. The view in my room was of Coronado Island, which was wonderful. Pros- New, clean, modern, pretty, big rooms My issues were more with how much they charge for everything. I was here for business so I did not have to pay for the stay, so me saying that they nickle and dime you should mean even more. First of all, they charged me $20 additional dollars each night for a room with a view. Let me tell you that the first room \"without a view\" could not be more true. It was on the 6th floor and literally overlooked a concrete stairwell, part of the roof, and the shipyard. It was so depressing. Once I requested the exact same room, but with a view, I could see Coronado Island, which was great. The room price alone ended up being $300 a night, which is supposed to be a deal. Then, they charge you $14 a day for internet, which is a big pet peeve of mine. Finally, this hotel appears to be right by the convention center (which it is), but it was still a trek (~15 min.) for me to get to where I needed to be in the convention center every day. So, it didn't end up being any closer than where everyone else stayed. Finally, the set-up of the hotel is very poor. On the 1st floor, there are 2 entrances. At one, you can take the elevators straight up to your room. On the other, you have to take the escalator up to the 2nd floor lobby and then take the elevators to your room. Why? It was so confusing. And, to get to the Fox Sports grill (reasonable and yummy) and Starbucks, you have to go outside and all the way around the hotel. So, they are kind of in the hotel and kind of not.

As such, location was premium for walking to conference. Hotel is 10 minutes walk to the Gaslamp District for restaurants and nightlife, and a 15-minute cab ride to Balboa Park. So, it's not the best location for leisure travellers. I got a corner room on a high floor, with great views of the city and mountains in the distance. Room was soundproofed against the aircraft landing noise (airport is 15 minutes away by car in traffic). Bed was good for a sound night's sleep. Bathroom was sub-standard for a Hilton, without handshower and a bit cramped for two. Breakfast was generous; get the On Your Way deal, where two can eat buffet breakfast for about $25. The lobby was spacious, but had a strange design flaw. To enter the hotel, one has to go through a lower-level foyer then up the escalators to main reception. Once there, to get to the rooms, elevators are accessible only from one alcove in the lobby, even though the lobby wraps both ways around the alcove. As such, one has to walk around the lobby enclosure to reach the elevators. These should have been made accessible from both directions in the rectangular lobby. Weird. Other than this, the lounge and bar were very cosy. Mini-iPads were set up in th lounge alcove to allow guests to check e-mail for free. And the UPS shop downstairs offers free printing of airline boarding passes for departing guests. The hotel is right on the edge of the bay for joggers, and looks out onto Coronado Island, so the scenic location is an attraction. Taxis are quickly hailed by the curbside concierge at the entrance. The lobby concierge was very good at making dinner reservations and had a good knowledge of where pharmacies and supermarkets were located (a Ralph's grocery store and CVS pharmacy are about 15 minutes walk from hotel, in Gaslamp District). On checkout, I was stuck in a long line with other guests, but a hotel staff member approached me with a notepad on which I gave him my e-mail address for billing, enabling a quick departure without waiting.

The main drawback is that the internet is not fee, in fact it costs quite a bit. Definitely a nuisance in this day and age. All that is available in the Hilton, I found in smaller hotels, which also usually had free internet and a fridge to keep your drinks cold. The Hilton has many meeting rooms, but that is the only difference. To top it off, when I checked in, the hotel charged the entire cost of the room for both me and my colleague, who was supposed to pay separately and happened to check-in second, to my credit card, even though I made them aware of the situation. This meant that a couple of thousand dollars were charged to my CC, the first day of the stay. I was told they will just authorize the charges, but the next day I was told that they actually charged it. In any case, this has brought my CC to the maximum and I couldn't rent a car, canceling my trip to Joshua Tree Park, which I was really looking froward to. (It takes a number of days for the charges to be reversed, so there was no use doing that). Also, if you book through an agent, you won't get your Hilton Honors points, the usual feel of being nickle and dimed by Hilton. The pool is waist high, with no deep area for swimming.

I was disappointed how far it was, I would have much preferred the Omni, which is right across. Any hotel near the conference center-end of the Gas Lamp District would have been more convenient, or the Marriott (The Hyatt is too far as well). Also, the hotel doesn't have a free airport shuttle, unlike many of the other hotels in the Gas Lamp District.

That being said, any of the other hotels, especially the Omni, only have a city view, without having to pay extra.

We just put the air on freezing for that. The room overlooked the pool are which I have to admit is a huge pool with a massive outdoor tv. we ate one night at the Fox Grill and had the most wonderful waitress Lisa, who was incredible, nice girl, great sense of humour and really intersting. She is 6 stars. The two girls taht work on the guest services desk are complete cows, everytime we went there to enquire about a trip it was like they were too good to enterain our enquiry. They were rude, and snarly. One was a blonde the other a brunette, can;t remember their names, but if they were employed by me they would be given their walking papers. the day of Halloween, this balck guy that was dressed up as an angel was on the desk and he was amazing, so friendly and helpful - a nice change from those two other horrible girls. the porters and other staff are fantastic and Leah on the front desk was really nice and so helpful. Over all the hotel is brand new, the rooms are great, the walkway that connects you to the Gaslamp quarter is not complete yet, so that will make a huge difference once that is complete you will be able to walk over the train tracks. The hotel is very modern and the hardware used is not the greatest, our bathroom shower control was mangled, the shower curtains are about one inch in the tub so water leaks out on the floor all the time, its like they cheaped out on those minor details, no fridge, short shower curtains, lousy fixtures in teh bathroom.

At least the view would have made up for the obvious coldness of the hotel decor and disinterest of your personnel.

It is short walking distance to the gaslamp district, everything is right at your fingertips. Definately a good place to stay if you are on an expense account. Of course you are paying for the location. Everthing within the hotel is very expensive and actually, my feeling, slightly out of line for my taste. One would figure that if you shell out that much money for a room, they wouldn't charge $4.95 per bottle of water and $6.00/hr for internet. Even in the business centre, you had to pay for internet. Particularly when the location is right beside the convention centre and there are probably a significant amount of business people staying there. I found the food and drinks expensive as well.

Although we live in San Diego we were attending summer events (Symphony Pops and baseball) and decided it would be fun to stay downtown and not have to worry about traffic, parking or drinking and driving. The hotel is chic but friendly and very airy. Happy Hour at the main bar starts at 4:00 with half off drafts, well drinks and appetizers. The regular prices are quite steep ($8.50 for a draft beer) so HH is a good time to go. Plus the bay view and nice atmosphere make for a pleasant way to begin your stay. The taps are local San Diego craft beers -- a nice touch, although perhaps confusing for out-of-towners. Both times our room was quiet, clean and comfortable. Our second stay placed us in a Port/Bridge side room on the 12th floor. If you are a light or late sleeper I would avoid this because the Dole boats can be noisy when loading and unloading. I called to inquire about this and the clerk moved us without my even complaining. Since the hotel is large, they do have a good amount of inventory for moving people around. Still, I recommend not chancing it and booking a bayview or cityview room. The bathroom has no tub but does have a luxurious large shower we loved. Towels are big and soft. On our second visit we had bathrobes but not on the first -- not sure why. Nice bath amenities from Crabtree and Evelyn. Large hairdryer in drawer. Room was quiet both times even though the hotel was fairly full. The room doors are heavy and thick, which probably contributes to that. Didn't eat at the main restaurant but did enjoy appetizers and drinks in both the main bar and in the Fox Sports bar downstairs. Service and quality were excellent, plus both are open late. Starbucks downstairs has a lovely outdoor patio. There are many nice places to sit and relax inside and outside the hotel. On our first visit we ordered room service for dinner so we could relax. My husband, who is a steak connoisseur, said his room service steak was the best New York he had ever had. Quite a compliment! Didn't use pool or gym (the gym is indeed free -- I asked) but plan to next time as both looked great. Location allows for a nice walk or run along the bay and easy access to the convention center across the street. The Gaslamp District and Petco Park are just a little jaunt, easily walkable. I like that this Hilton is away from the noise and clutter yet close enough to walk for meals, shopping and entertainment. Really an ideal location for all purposes. The parking garage is easy in and out. When you check in, you inform the front desk that you self-parked and they add the $25/day fee to your account. When you exit the garage you simply hand a voucher to the attendant and off you go! In and out privileges are included.

Did our research so we knew to expect high parking fees. $25 to self park. But the free night made it still seem like a good deal and offset the parking charge. We also knew about the wifi charge. We paid it, but in the future we should just go to a free wifi cafe. We were lazy. The view from our window was EXCELLENT for our boys. 24th floor. They got to see the train/trolley yards, the shipping dock with a load of Dole bananas being put on a huge cargo ship, the bridge and water with sailboats. The boys set their toys up on the window ledge and played and played. Room size was just fine for us, we don't need a huge room to mess up. 2 queen beds. Beds were very comfy and furniture and bathroom seemed new and in good condition. I like that they supplied a BIG blowdryer. Pool was great for our boys since it isnt super deep and they could really swim around. Lots of families so we didnt feel like we were disrupting a \"singles scene\". The location of the hotel on the bay was SO great for us. The boys could RUN and RUN and RUN down the pier length or in front of the convention center. Then just a short walk to Gaslamp area. We had no trouble getting good reasonable food close by with no waiting. There were many good family choices. Broken Yolk for breakfast. Tin Fish was great casual place for our loud family. At night the Hilton lights this big pit fire outside near the water, and there were comfy couches to sit on. It is probably meant to be a lounge-scene, but no one was there when we walked by so we had a nice end to the night, just watching the flames and enjoying the bayfront breeze and lights. The Hilton also was showing Shrek one night and Avatar the next night on the HUGE screen tv outside by the pool. It was free and they also served free sodas and popcorn. I thought that was a cool idea. Didnt bother using the gym (supposedly there is also a charge for that). The long pier is right outside and perfect for a morning run.

Ate in the Vela restaurant twice and thought the food was fantastic and the service wonderful. The bar area is lovely and sitting outside watching the sunset was fabulous.

Not much the hotel can do but you should be aware of this. 2) All beers at the hotel bar were $8.00 except during Happy Hour. Little too expensive.

It was not a bad place to stay. Our biggest problem was the costs of staying there, which made the other stuff that was not up to Hilton standards seem even more frustrating. First the bad stuff: We used Hhonors points, so our stay could be free. We were trying to save for other activities--like dining out and going site seeing. We did do a room upgrade and paid 40 dollars for that. As beautiful as the view in the room was, most other hotels we've been to have been willing to upgrade for free when you tell them you are there on a romantic getaway. On top of that, everything necessary was ridiculously expensive. We paid 20 bucks a day for parking and 20 bucks a day for high speed \"premium\" internet access. We did watch one movie for 15 bucks on pay-per-view one of the nights. Our final bill when we checked out came to 170 bucks, even though we were supposedly getting a \"free\" stay. The decor of the place was not inviting--it was rather intimidating, actually. The lobby felt like the lobby of a hospital. Almost everyone who was staying there with us seemed younger than us (I'm 28--my husband 39). All the older folks seemed a little put off by all the contemporary design as well. I get the feeling that they will have to renovate soon because the style of the place is very *now*. One thing made my husband and I a little ill was the strong odor of sewage coming from who-knows-where as we walked down the hall to our room every night. I don't know if someone had a serious case of the stomach flu, or if we were located next to some sewage pipe. Regardless, it was definitely more than a little rank and we were always nearly knocked off our feet by it. We never complained to the management, though. One not so significant issue was that the consierge was away from her desk more often than not. But there was plenty to the good side of the whole experience as well. We did have to take a short walk to get to the gaslamp district, but it was well worth it. LOVED it there. Balboa park and all the museums didn't take long to get to by car. We highly recommend Donovan's Steakhouse. As mentioned before, prices aside, the room's view was really spectacular. Coronado bridge and island were beautiful sights at night. Other hotel guests have complained of noise, but this was not a problem for us. We slept through the night with no problems. We were located on the ocean-side of the hotel, though.

The large, sunny window made the room seem much larger than it was, and at the end of a busy day-- it was a light and airy place to come home to. Very, very quiet and relaxing! Everything you might need is right at your fingertips including a Starbucks on the premises and a terrific business center. The bed was amazingly comfortable and although the windows didn't open, the thermostat could be easily adjusted for perfect sleeping temperatures. There weren't bathrobes in the room, but when I called the front desk and asked for them, housekeeping delivered complimentary robes within 5 minutes. Perhaps one of the nicest features of the hotel was its proximity to the water. Right out your door literally were walking, jogging, biking paths along the waterfront and two lovely seaside parks.

It was my birthday weekend & I wanted to \"spa\" & simply relax. ISSUE #1: On Friday evening, I called the spa to make reservations for the following day. I wanted the works (e.g. 80 minute deep tissue, oxygen infusion facial, & foot reflexology). Stephanie answered the phone & asked if I would mind being placed on a \"brief\" hold. I said, \"no problem\". So, I waited, & waited, & waited, & waited, & waited until I realized she was NOT going to return to the phone..........& she didn't. Very poor customer service. Unforgivable. My anger was fueled by their Gratuity policy. A gratuity is EARNED not automatically given. It is a privilege that I & I the consumer, ALONE should make. Not the hotel. The thought of Stephanie receiving any portion of my gratuity prevented me from calling back. I simply could not accept the thought. And needless to say, my \"Spa Day\" was ruined, hence so was my weekend. ISSUE #2: On Saturday, I went to have breakfast at Vela and was promptly seated by the hostess & was informed that someone would be there to assist me. Great! I looked at the menu & was ready to order w/i minutes. There was one waiter that whisked by me several times making eye contact with me. I assumed he would be assisting me since he was assisting everyone else in that area. NO. So, again I waited and waited, & no one ever came. Another hostess seated guests behind me & w/i minutes a different waiter walked over to them & immediately took their order. I happened to see the hostess who seated me & questioned the situation. The waiter at the other table happened to be MINE as well. Extremely frustrating. ISSUE #3: Hair in the complimentary room coffee cup. ISSUE #4: The hallways needed to be vacuumed. I do LOVE the modernism of the hotel and the views, location, etc..........but how great can this jewel be if the foundation is weak? I hope they get it together.

You can hear the ships, jets (naval base) from the rooms so some mornings are quite loud - however, our family that stayed at the Hyatt had the same problem - so it\u2019s just an issue if you are staying at a hotel by the water. The lobby of the hotel is impressive and very modern. It was all decorated with Christmas ornaments which gave it a nice touch. Normally, as a diamond member one gets free continental breakfast (well usually just breakfast at the executive lounge but they didn't have one) so you got the choice of one drink and item at starbucks or 10 off the breakfast buffet they offer (which is normally 22 per person). I was a bit disappointed with this as I've stayed in Paris and London and gotten beautiful breakfasts complimentary (and drinks and appetizers at happy hour). The vouchers for the starbucks can be used at any time of the day and also you can get 2 drinks (if you don\u2019t get the 1 food item) and vice versa which is kind of nice. We in the end opted for the breakfast buffet and then paid 12 per person. It is a nice buffet overall with lots of selection. We had drinks at their bar in the lobby which was nice - you also get free vouchers for a food item and when we got there it was for chips and salsa. A bit disappointed in this too - if this place had an executive lounge the happy hour would have had more food available complimentary and drinks. The parking is also outrageous (cost more per day than my rental car). Overall the stay was good - i liked that it was a brand new hotel, we had a nice room.

We were given a room with two Queen beds on arrival. After we went on a tour we checked our reservation which clearly said King. We advised the front desk of this only to be told this was a request and no King rooms were available. He advised us we could try tomorrow morning but there was no guarantee then either. In any event when we booked the travel, the King room was a more expensive option than \"room allocated at check-in\" and was also a non-refundable rate. My wife and I returned to our room to collect the reservation and returned to the lobby. This time a different staff member was at the desk and actually knew how to treat a customer. He checked with house keeping and what do you know? They did have a King Room available meaning the original people at check-in had short changed us and the second person had lied to us. The King room is substantially better in more ways than the bed itself. The other negatives are the internet prices ($14 for \"standard\" and $20 for express broadband). This set a new record in my experience - not even Vegas hotels had the hide to charge that much. Also the lobby is basically on the second floor. To get to ground level you have to use the car park lift. The bridge linking the hotel to Petco Park/Gaslamp seems some way off being completed. It's only a five minute walk to the Trolley stop but there are other hotels better location. And unless you fork out for the bay view, the \"bridge view\" is actually a truck park with the bridge in the distance. On the plus side, the King room is very nice, especially the bathroom which thankfully has a shower not located over a bath. There is also a nice day bed.

The Sightseeing Trolley tours stops at 1 Park Blvd very near hotel. Bay Front Hilton is also right near Petco Park. Misc note. The hotel has no complimentary shuttle. Taxi from airport is between $13-$15. You can take the Super Shuttle for $8.00, tell them the Bay Front Hilton has an arrangement to charge guest $8.00 coming to the Hotel.

Wearing comfy sweats, t-shirt and tennis shoes due to the long flight, I didn't look my best as I got out of the car and entered the hotel. That didn't matter to the valet/bellman, as he was very pleasant and opened the car door for me. We didn't need our bags carried in at that point, and he told us that he would be upset if we didn't let him know how he could make our stay most excellent. Wow, what a first impression. Bonus material: My room was ready too (Sunday). Everyone we encountered from the front desk, to the concierge, maids, and service workers proving food at the conference I attended, were so exceptionally nice it blew my mind. Every worker at all resturaunts and stores had this same pleasant attitude. I'm from the deep South, and we're supposed to be known for friendliness. I was absolutely astonished that San Diego had such a great attitude in general. We don't have anything on these people! The hotel was very clean and modern. My room number was 718 and faced the Dole \"Banana Boat\" that comes in on Mondays and Tuesdays. It was a little noisy, but not bad. It unloads 491 cargo containers, so they work pretty much around the clock to get it back out to sea in two days. Room also faced Coronado Bridge. Be prepared: Parking is $20 per day. When you leave the parking garage, you must turn right and drive 1000 feet before you can make a U-turn. They also deliver a paper every morning. If you don't want it, let them know and they take 75 cents off your bill daily. GPS won't work either, I suspect because its such a new property. I plugged in 100 Park Blvd. and it got me close enough. Walking to the GasLamp was about a 5-10 minute walk, and was pretty desolate from the Hilton Bayfront. I would definitely not walk by myself, but felt fairly safe with one other female. This hotel is the last one on a row of hotels before you get to the shipyard. Beds were comfortable. Good water pressure for the shower. Hot water is REALLY hot, so watch this if you have a child in your room. There's always lots of cool stuff to see from the pool area and front of the hotel. Military ships cascade by, low flying helecoptors, F-18's on practice runs, dophins jumping in boats for Military training, etc. Sunsets were gorgeous too. Overall, a great experience.

Without going in to a super long tirade, my worst experience seem to be with the valet (or lack thereof ) parking and at over $30.00 per night for the service, I would have expected more than to drive up each time and be pondered over by several valets (usually they stood in a posse at the doorman\u2019s podium) and have to flag one down as if I were a Martian arriving in a flying saucer. Not just once, twice, but three times I would arrive have to get out of the car and wave like I was hailing a cab to get someone to park my car.

The only comment I could make about the room - and this is really nitpicking - is that the shower nozzle was standard issue. Given the quality of the hotel, I really expected something more along the lines of a rainfall showerhead; but again this is a very minor point.

I also had the breakfast buffet and while I wouldn't take my family there at $25/head, I felt the quality was very good with an extensive selection of breakfast items. The only real issue I have with the hotel is their checkout policy.

I am a Hilton Hhonors Gold member. I recently attended the Direct Response Expo at this hotel in May 2009. When I found out that the conference was at this hotel I quickly booked the hotel using many of my points. However, I was quickly disappointed. While from the outside the hotel appears beautiful, it lack amenities and service which should be readily available for a new hotel. Normally at a Hilton Hotels Gold and Diamond members are provided 2 complimentary breakfasts (if this is what you choose on Your Way preference). This hotel was so petty that is only provided a certificate for a complimentary cup of coffee and bakery item at Starbucks. The hotel Starbucks is not licensed to make food so they don't even have their hot breakfast sandwiches. I would have been satisfied if the hotel offer this, considering that most Hiltons will provide a minimum of a continental breakfast buffet and upsell you to full breakfast bufffet. But no, they wanted to either offer a muffin and coffee at Starbucks (which required you go down to the bottom floor of hotel and out door around corner) to get a lousy unsatisfying breakfast, or pay $15 for their breakfast buffet (normally priced at $25). There was no option for a $15 credit towards a plated breakfast option. We ended up getting the buffet which was way overpriced, as was everything else in this hotel ($9 bottle of Corona beer and $21 parking). Also note that the hotel provides certificates for a complimentary cracker and olive plate at the bar. Don't worry, there is no value there, as they make there money back at the overpriced bar! Try and get something to eat after 12 midnight, even during a night with a full house! No room service, no food vending machines. They are generous to give VIP members certificates which say complimentary Coca Cola beverages from the machines, only to find out it only works on the 29th and 30th floor machines loaded solely with water! The pool is nothing to impressive and the rooms are a bit small. In fact, I notice a stain on the bottom sheet of my bed prior to go down for the night. The business center is ran by a UPS store, very pricey! No complimentary internet access here. I would definitely not stay at this hotel again for 40k points per night.

I was a bit concerned of the reported construction and location to the shipping yards but it was unwarranted. If your room overlooked this area it could pose a problem, but for us it wasn't an issue. The hotel is very new and its styling is very sparse and clean and simple. We loved the style but for those who like plush, ornate styels they might find it a bit empty. We had a double queen room which was roomy enough. Comfy beds with plenty of pillows. There is a large LG flatscreen TV on top of a six drawer dresser which also houses the in-room safe, coffee maker, glassware and ice bucket. There is a desk, deskchair and seating chair as well. The closet is pretty small, about the width of two suitecases standing upright. The bathroom is nice, but it is all in one room. When traveling as a family it is nice to have the sink and mirror outside the shower area. The towels are large and plush, a nice blowdryer (not like the mini ones connected to the wall) and Crabtree & Eveland shower supplies. The hotel is located just to the south of the convention center. Between them is an art garden and some nice walking paths. It's just a short walk to the Gaslamp quarter (about two blocks) and across from Petco Park. There is some road construction in the area which causes you to have to go up a few blocks to get to the hotel, but once you figure that out it doesn't cause too much delay. The heated, salt-water pool area overlooks the water. They've done an admirable job hiding the shipping area, so unless you're looking for it, it isn't terribly noticeable. Large, over-sized pool towels are available in the pool area. There are plenty of lounge chairs and four cabanas with dual loungers. The area is plenty large so if you want to be away from the pool noise you can still be outside. It looks like they have a snack bar area but it was not open nor did I see the HUGE TV screen in use. Also outside is a large gas fire-pit. A nice place for gathering, enjoying a cocktail. It is located just behind the Fox sports bar which is rather loud. So definately not a family-friendly spot. We found the front desk and concierge staff helpful and the request for more towels and creamer were prompt. The only downsides to the hotel were the parking ($21/day) and wireless internet required a fee.

But, as we've found with most luxury hotels in large cities that cater to business traffic, you can get a great deal on a wonderful room when the business traffic is scarce. We stayed a Fri-Sun night over Easter weekend (family of four) and were very pleased with the value. We booked our room at the Hilton web site and it was cheaper than the usual travel web sites (Travelocity, etc.). (I can't comment on Priceline because I don't use them - I'm funny about wanting to know EXACTLY which hotel I'm getting.) The hotel is immaculately clean, as it has only been open since Dec. 3, 2008 (we asked). I had to ask Housekeeping for two items and they were both waiting in my room when I returned. The staff was very friendly and helpful. To address some points in other reviews, yes, it is really annoying that there is no gift shop open yet and no other \"quick mart\" in walking distance. My husband had to pay $5 for two AA batteries at the front desk. Ridiculous. Self-parking is $21 a day, which in my experience is very reasonable for a downtown spot in a major city. We paid $40-$50 in NY and over $30 in San Francisco. Yes, you do have to walk outside to get to the parking garage...about 100 feet, on a ramp that goes directly from the front door of the hotel into the 3rd floor of the garage. Not a big deal, IMO. If it really bothers you, you can valet your car for $10 more per day that the self parking. My husband and son walked to Petco Park from the hotel and didn't think it was far, at all. You could actually see into the stands of Petco Park from our room. We did pay a bit extra to have our view upgraded, an offer that is made at the time of booking (sort of a standby arrangement - you agree you'll pay the extra when you check in if the upgraded room is available). One thing about the view that is misleading...this hotel *is* on the bayfront. There is a wonderful photo of the pool on the hotel web site, which is lovely. HOWEVER, the photo is misleading in that the pool DOES sit on the bay, however about half the pool also faces the pier where Dole bananas are unloaded. While we were there, there was a freighter tied up and you know what freighters look like. However, I have to say that the hotel (or someone) has obviously tried to make the best of this situation by putting up a kiosk on the boardwalk that tells all about the Dole pier, the capacity of the ships, their voyage, etc. So, your kids just might find this interesting. I did, but I couldn't see the freighter from my hotel window, so maybe that made a difference. :) The Gaslamp district is technically in walking distance, but if you want to venture past the first few blocks, I'd suggest taking your car. The restaurants we ate at were not within walking distance. Downtown garage parking was ridiculous...$2 per 15 minutes...and street parking was hard to come by, especially if there's a ball game. One night (no game) we found a space, on the other, we should have used the valet at the restaurant. At $15 it was cheaper than what we paid at the garage. We did have the breakfast buffet at the restaurant one morning and it was wonderful, BUT we didn't pay for it. My husband had trouble with the tickets he got from the concierge, so they comped our whole family with breakfast. I don't know if I would have paid $25 per person, but the food included an omlette station, smoked salmon, homemade pastries, and some other unusual items along with the breakfast regulars.

It is convenient to the Convention Center and nothing else. This may improve somewhat once the construction finishes but there are still many more convenient hotels. The rooms are nicely decorated but quite small in size for a new hotel. The bathroom was also nice but small, with only a shower stall. The closet is tiny. Internet access is $12.95 a night, which I still think is ridiculous in a nice hotel. My girlfriend's parents stayed in a \"suite\" which was simply a corner room, with no added benefit except an extra window and nicer view. The lobby and restaurant are very nicely decorated and spacious, probably the only positives on this hotel. In conclusion, I've paid less money for nicer hotels and better location, and certainly won't stay at the Hilton Bayfront again.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa ana, ca", "Title": "\u201cGreat clean hotel and good location\u201d", "Author": "bren714", "ReviewID": "UR24691136", "Content": "I just came back from a Valentine's day weekend at the Hilton and it was a great hotel.
