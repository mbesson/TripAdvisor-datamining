The best rooms are at the back of the hotel second floor, these are in high demand and those who give the hotel high scores probably stayed in those rooms !. The service is quite poor, requests generally get ignored they never passed on from one shift to another. The airconditioning might work - maybe it won't. The electrical boxes in each room \"buzz\" when powered up, this has something to do with the energy saver in the fusebox, it will drive you mad. You cannot open the windows - \"handles removed for safety reasons\". These problems reported by many colleagues, so not just the room I had. The hotel is very popular with school parties from UK and abroad, so be prepared for the adolescent to & fro-ing. The breakfast is passable , but dear or dear, don't try the dinner.

At the moment you can tell it's being renovated - lots of scaffolding up - but our room was finished and on the other side to the building, so no problems from it at all. We didn't use the public areas but they looked nice from what we could see from Reception. Checking in and out were quick and easy and we had no problems getting help when our room key stopped working - two minutes later we were in again, thanks to the helpful and friendly staff. The room wasn't particularly big but perfectly big enough (much bigger than the last two rooms we stayed in in London, which cost more!), and very clean. The decor was nice, the tv impressive and the bathroom perfect for us, with a lovely shower and lights round the mirror. The bed was really comfy, with nice, thick pillows. There were a few problems, though. We had to go out and buy a travel hairdryer as there wasn't one provided, despite the website we booked through saying there would be. The shower door was slightly dodgy and kept falling off its runner - nothing major but enough to be irritating after a few times. The main problem was that we were in a room right next to the road, and it was fairly noisy throughout the night. I'm sure there'd be no problem with this in most rooms, but we were on just the wrong side for it, and on the ground floor. Putting up with the traffic noise was worth it for the good deal we got on the room rate, but it wasn't ideal. It was just a shame, as otherwise the room was one of the better ones I've stayed in. In terms of location, I think we chose a bad weekend to visit. The walk to and from the nearest tube (Golders Green) was do-able but not something we wanted to do twice a day, so it was nice to have a bus stop right outside. It's not a particularly long bus journey to the Jubilee line, and once there it doesn't take long to get to the centre, so the location is really quite good. What we found, unfortunately, was that in heavy traffic the bus took nearly an hour to make this journey, and giving up and walking to the tube didn't help much either as the Northern line was closed so we had to take the replacement bus service, which also took the best part of an hour. We stayed on a weekend with heavy tube closures, and I think normally this hotel has a brilliant location, but it's definitely worth checking out the planned closures before staying here because it's a nightmare if particular stations are closed! Overall this is a lovely hotel, and you shouldn't be put off by pre-renovation reviews. I'd definitely stay there again, though I might ask for a room on the other side of the building.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay\u201d", "Author": "Sharon023", "ReviewID": "UR53365029", "Content": "I stayed in the hotel a few years ago and didn't have a very good experience.

The Hotel is STILL being renovated & the public lounge & lobby look quite smart; however, we were in the end of the Hotel that is yet to be renovated (I hope!), the bathroom was literally in a cupboard with double, unlockable doors; the sink hit you as you stepped in & the mildewy shower was to your left & the toilet to your right! I have never seen anything like it in all my travels! The huge TV didn't work & we only had 1 cup for 2 of us! Not all the lightng worked & the double glazing wasn't the best at keeping out the noise of the busy road below us! Furnishings like the the lampshades were shabby & the curtains were partially off the rail! But, the beds & pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable & bedding fresh & clean, it was probably one of the best night's sleep in any hotel of any standard anywhere! Breakfast was nice if you like cereal & toast, tea was rank & coffee not much better! Cooked offering consisted of fried egg in 1/2 slice fried bread with tiny rasher of bacon & similar sausage & some baked beans.
