However one always is trepidacious as the second cup of tea never tastes as good as the first. We worried that our recollections had become sentimental and we were made to feel uneasy by the most recent review on this site entitled 'Never Again'. However it was perfect and far surpassed our expectations and it was the delightful place we remembered. We stayed in two rooms and both were immaculate. The Continental breakfast is varied and the buffet arrrangement meant that one could eat as much as they liked. From various breads, croissants, meats, cheeses, jams ,chocolate, cereals and fruit it was what I expected of a Continental breakfast in Italy. Those expecting a 'fry up' should perhaps go to Benidorm where they would not be disappointed!!

We were guided by Citalia's recommendation that this is a 'favourite' with Citalia guests, who enjoy 'taking breakfast in the pretty courtyard'. I cannot understand why it's a favourite as it is the worst European Hotel I have stayed in. The only thing this place has going for it is the location, (2 minutes' walk from St Mark's Square but nevertheless quiet). Otherise, it was awful. The room was very small, the furniture shabby, the carpet stained and smelly, the shower room (no bath) smelt of damp, and the view from our room was of a roof! The dining room (if you can call it that) comprised two interlinked, windowless rooms more akin to a run-down cafe. The breakfast was appalling - the worst I have ever experienced in a hotel - comprising just yoghurts, a limited range of cereals, tomatoes, pre-packed cream cheese and stale rolls. Our room key never worked properly, and we had to keep going back to reception to ask them to let us in, despite changing the key twice. After all the hustle, bustle and heat of Venice on a hot summer's day, you want to return to a pleasant hotel & room, and the Do Pozzi does not provide that. What made it worse, was the 'pretty courtyard' described in the Citalia brochure was in the process of major refurbishment and was unavailable, therefore you couldn't even escape the room to enjoy a coffee outside. One tip though for Venice in general - if, like us, you want to escape the throngs of people, head for the island of Murano. It is a miniature Venice - untouched, tranquil and beautiful. The only disappointing thing about Murano was the cafes and restaurants close mid-afternoon, so don't plan on having anrelaxing, evening meal on the island.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201chot rooms\u201d", "Author": "ozbill", "ReviewID": "UR21321879", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights late October.

To be absolutely frank, I'm working in the travel trade, so now you can imagine how peculiar I usually am when the matter comes to the accommodation choice. We're a young couple without kids and on a pretty limited budget, and my primary goal was to fetch a nice 3* hotel at a reasonable rate near San Marco (it was our first time in Venice and we wanted to be close to the center :)). Well, Do Pozzi was the perfect choice for us! I booked a double room via the hotel site, it was very easy as the replies from the Reception were prompt and explicit. I also requested the confirmation paper for Shengen visa issue and got it immediately. The reception manager answered all my preliminary questions and our request for a non-smoking room was respected. The hotel is very close to St. Maria de Giglio vaporetto station, but to find it for the first time you'd better get a map and consult it. Actually, the hotel entrance is within a little patio and there's a sign of the hotel showing the direction. Once we found out where it is, we never lost it. When we arrived, there was some reparation ongoing on the facade. I asked whether these works are noisy and the receptionist explained very polietly, that it was their neighbouring hotel making some reconstruction and that the works last no more than up to 5 pm. That was true and neither noise nor anything else ever disturbed us. Our room #21 was facing a little street which was was rather crowded at daytime and in the evening. We did not mind it at all as we were spending almost all the time outdoors, but I assume that older travellers would prefer to have a room overlooking the patio. These ones are perfectly quiet. The hotel building was built somewhere in the XVII century and the room was very nice and clean. I loved the antique window shutters and Murano glass chandelier! The bathroom is small, but quite enough for two. Bath-caps, shower gel, body lotion and sewing kit are provided. There was also equipped mini-bar and TV in our room. Breakfast was served in the hotel restaurant as the weather was changeable and the reparation outside spoiled the view. The breakfast was basic, but OK. The staff of the hotel was extremely helpful and polite, I really loved their attention and positive attitude towards the guests.

The hotel has no sign or markings. You go down a narrow alley which opens out into a courtyard with tables where a nice breakfast is served (cereal, breads, juices- no eggs or meat). A door off of the courtyard leads to a small reception room. We hired a water taxi to take us to the hotel because we feared we would not be able to find the hotel on our own. The taxi called the hotel to let them know we were nearly there and a friendly hotel employee met us at the place where we disembarked from the boat and took us to our room.

The staff are friendly and helpful and our room was always cleaned with bed made whilst we were at breakfast (which itself was good).", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antrim, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel - great location\u201d", "Author": "Chucklers", "ReviewID": "UR5822525", "Content": "Hotel gave good advice regarding the best way to get there via public water boat - responded quickly to emails. Very friendly on arrival, nothing was a problem. Room didn't have great air conditioning but really that would be the only snag. Breakfast was super each morning outside in the small garden. The location is soooo central - less than 5 mins walk to Piazza San Marco with a great selection of designer shops en route! While you are there take a gondola ride at night, know you are being ripped off, but enjoy a period of time you will never forget in your life. The city is amazing because there is no noise from cars! It is so peaceful at night but hiving during the day. Word of warning - don't be fooled into going to the restaurant attached to the hotel - the food is fine but expect to pay double the prices for similar/better restaurants within 150 yards (e.g Euro15 for a parma ham starter and likewise for a shrimp cocktail). All in all this is a stunning city - the water bus system is so efficient, use it to get around. The Grand Canal at night will not be forgotten!

From the train station this hotel is very easy to locate - you just take the proper water bus ($12.00 Euro for 24 hour pass) and get off at the San Maria Giglio stop and then it's a bit tricky to find but as soon as you orient yourself it's no problem. The location was fantastic - about a five minute walk from St. Marco's square and the walk is fantastic - the street that you walk along takes you by Prada, Valentino, Gucci to name but a few - really high end. We stayed in a newly renovated room that was in the same block as the hotel but closer to the water - the room was more of a four star than a three star room - it was very nice, very clean. The staff was super friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was in the courtyard patio of the hotel and very nice as well - good pastries and cappaccino's.

They actually had a turn down service - shutters were closed, curtain drawn and bed turned down. One mistake I made was to have a 7.35am flight to Rome. It is very difficult to arrange water buses and buses to get to the airport on time so I took a water taxi. It was 90 euros for one person!

We booked with Citalia, were met at Marco Polo by a very pleasant rep with excellent english who took us to the Water Taxi transfer stop. The taxi was waiting for us and took us straight away to the nearest jetty to the hotel. We emerged from an alley way into the main street that the hotel is situated on and I swear to god I stopped breathing. If you love designer shopping then you will love do Pozzi's location. More designers in one street than on Bond Street. Contrary to other posts descriptions of staff, all the duty managers were efficient to the point of almost being Swiss, housekeeping were lovely as were the waitresses who served breakfast in the morning. I can only say you reap what you sow. The rooms were small but clean and well equipped, the bathroom very modern and again clean, although the hairdryer was next to useless, no power in it at all. The airconditioning worked periodically, and we were bitten by mosquitos but that's being in a foreign city, on the water, in May. If you want a hermetically sealed vacation experience stay at a travel lodge in Basingstoke! Overall, do Pozzi is in a fantastic location, reasonably priced, the service was fine and I really couldn't find fault with either the hotel or Citalia. Travelling is all about taking a deep breath and diving in and the do Pozzi is ideal for taking in a huge gulp of Venice.", "Date": "May 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warren, MI, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.
