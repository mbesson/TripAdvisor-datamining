For the price, Hotel Delle Regioni fits that like a glove. Its around a 5-10 min walk to the Trevi Fountain and about 10 mins to the Spanish Steps. Everything else I came across given this proximity to key locations would be much more expensive. Furthermore, considering that I was looking for something purely functional - knew that we would be out for most of the day from after breakfast to after dinner, we didnt need something more except for a nice comfortable bed in a clean room. If this is what you are looking for, this hotel may also be for you. The pros: 1) central location - 5-10 mins walk to Trevi Fountain; 10 mins to Spanish Steps, 15mins to Termini, 15-20 mins to Roman Forum. 2) very friendly staff - everyone we came across were friendly and speak English 3) room is clean - very small hotel - only 11 rooms so that probably helps maintain standards. 4) clean toilets - not too many amenities - soap, packet shampoo, hair dryer The cons: 1) small room - rooms are tiny - dont bring a big suitcase - if you have a regular carryon bag, that would work 2) small breakfast area - 3 tables seating 6 so if you are arriving the same time as other guests, you might have to wait or opt to have breakfast in your room 3) small breakfast selection - croissants, bread, donuts, yoghurt, cake and coffee of your choice. Its ideal for those who just want a place to sleep thats quite central.

Also, there is a metro station close by so you have quick access. The people at the desk are very nice and helpful even to us ugly Americans. Breakfast was a good selection of fresh baked goods (not to be confused with homemade) and they can make a wide range of hot drinks. There is free wi-fi in the common area. These are the good points. However, the walls are paper thin and you can hear every little noise. In our case, that was really annoying because we were close to the lobby and right next to the staff's toilet. I'll leave the rest to you. The bed lumpy and my back tightened up so bad that I could hardly bend over to tie my shoes. As can be seen by the photos, the shower is smaller than a phone booth and if your a big or tall person is it hard to get in and out.

We stayed over 4 days, early July. We had our 21 month old boy with us. The hotel is perfectly located, a stones throw from the Trevi Fountain. The Spanish Steps is also close by. The room was ideal, good air-con, cot and bedding lovely and clean. Nice shower and clean towels daily. Breakfast was nice. Absolutely no complaints. The staff were great, always very helpful with giving advice re places to see, eat and how to get there, providing free maps too. They even booked some tours for us and arranged for us to be collected from the Hotel door - ideal, especially with a young child. They recommended a restaurant nearby, slightly off the main tourist walkway to the Trevi Fountain and it was lovely, felt like proper Italy and not just some tourist-filled restaurant. A little tip re getting to the Hotel from the airport if using a budget airline is to get the shuttle with one of the companies, only 4 euros, which drops you at the Termini (main train station). Take the Metro (underground train) from within the Termini and get off at Barberini, which i think is only a stop or two away. The Hotel is closeby but it cannot be seen from the main road (Via Tretone I think it is) as the entrance is up a side street. I think there is a green lit sign 'HOTEL' sticking out which can be seen. When you see that you know that you've found it. Thanks again to all the staff for a great holiday.

However, with just a little more attention it could be a great wee gem. As we were on Via Tritone side it was noisy but that bothered me less than the poor sound insulation between bathrooms. Didn't appreciate being wakened before 6 am two mornings whilst people had their showers for early departures. The noise was horrendous, far, far worse than any road noise - more like having your ear snuggled up to a vacuum cleaner. The other issue was how uncomfortable the bed is. I like a hard bed so shrugged off previous reviewers comments, but this was like sleeping on the floor and most mornings I woke up with a numb hip. My last gripe is the breakfast - not the quantity as you could have as much as you want and was constantly topped up. However, whilst I don't consider myself a health nut, I think the breakfast more suitable for a 10yr old. Very sweet juice drink, sweet cornflakes, sweet unidentifiable yoghurt and a huge pile of pastries and biscuits. How I longed for a bit of muesli or fresh fruit.

This hotel was only slightly more than a city block from the Barberini Metro stop, an easy walk with luggage if you are traveling around Italy via rail. The location is further sublime - all major sights in Rome are very close - we were able to walk everywhere from this hotel, even Vatican city was only 30min by foot. One thing we were not able to find within a block or two of the hotel, though, was a good restaurant or trattoria - we ate most meals down at Piazza Navona. There are a few little dining establishments 2 blocks away near the Spanish Steps, but the are not traditional Italian food for breakfast or lunch - think continental American. The hotel is 50' down a side street north of Via del Tritone; the exterior is not as sketch as one reviewer alluded to if you consider most little hotels in Rome - there are much sketchier establishments that we heard about or walked past. The hotel inside is spot on for the money. Desk staff is VERY helpful and the place was immaculate. Rooms are small, but lets face it - you're in Rome - you're not going to be hanging out in the room. Bed was sufficiently large, but the mattress was very thin and the springs were not that supportive. Bathroom was of decent size, but the shower stall was so narrow I had to turn off the water and open the mini-doors so I had room to soap up. The only other detracting thing would be the AC. Ours did not work at all. It blew luke-warm-cold air all night long; we had to open the windows on a sweltering and humid night. All in all for what we needed during our stay in Rome this was the perfect choice. 2 nights were only E238. That sounds like a lot, E119/night; however, all hotels in Rome are overly expensive.

Firstly i should mention that we booked this hotel through a popular webpage which stated that it was room only. This was not the case as we were told that breakfast was included with every room. Breakfast consisted of coffee (cappicino, espresso, tea, etc), orange juice, croissants, pastries, yoghurt, bread, jam, soft cheese, etc. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. The room was small but comfortable and clean. But the best thing about this hotel was the location. It is just a short walk from the Trevi fountain and we stopped there every night on the way back from where ever we went. The pantheon, spanish steps and piazza navona are accessible by foot. If you want to visit the vatican it is easy to get to via the metro and the metro station is very close tot the hotel. The metro is also easy to navigate and tickets are simple to buy and well priced. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia, USA", "Title": "\u201cHotel delle Regioni + Viviana = Perfect Holiday!\u201d", "Author": "JVCVirginia_USA", "ReviewID": "UR43557414", "Content": "This was our third visit to Rome and our third 'wonderful' stay at the Hotel delle Regioni.

I challenged Viviana every day for restaurant suggestions and she delivered with great recommendations. She was always eager to help and on top of it all, makes a great Capuccino!

The breakfast was great - especially the croissants and fresh coffee. In addition to the above, I think this hotel's best asset is its helpful staff. Everyone was polite and helpful.

Obviously, being on a busy street there is the potential for traffic noise, but our room had double glazing and air conditioning and I slept really well - wasn't woken up by street noise at all. Breakfast was ok - nothing fancy. Great cappucino, and lovely croissants but that's about it. Best of all was the staff, who were friendly and helpful, greeted us by name, and organised transportation back to Ciampino for us.

The bathroom was fine, but the shower was so small, you could not bend over if you dropped the soap!
