{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The last of the greats. I have been coming to the Hawaiiana for the past 20 years. My parents even longer. It has not changed since my first visit, which is what keeps us coming back. Upon entering the Hawaiiana you are in your own amazing tropical world, unaware that the hussle and bussle of the main street is less then a block away. The Hawaiiana gives you a glimpse of what Oahu once was. Every year we see the same faces and are greeted as old friends, always being welcomed home. What a shame that we now have a view of the ugly Trump Tower from the pool area. We recently vacationed with our 4 year old grandson, who is also hooked. I only hope that the Hawaiiana will survive all the changes on the block so that my grandson will have fond memories of the Hawaiiana long into his adult years. We all agree if we loose the Hawaiiana we will not be back to Oahu.", "Date": "Dec 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR199341785", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "WahineAnacortes"}, {"Content": "A Hidden Gem       Cute little room, priced right.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR365629970", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pickd"}, {"Content": "Dont go here, especially if you are military I find it mildly ridiculous that when you check into a hotel that you are asked for your bosses name and phone number, but the military does have a bad reputation so I obliged. Unfortunately for me I found out why, after my friends (who also had a room in the hotel) knocked two outside lawn chairs into the pool and didn\u9225\u6a9b retrieve them. I understand that this was unacceptable behavior, but the response from the staff was a little excessive. Not only did they take my friends 200 dollar security deposit claiming that the chairs were 200 dollars apiece but also took mine. When we protested the fact that they were taking 400 dollars for two outside chairs from walmart that spend all day in the scorching hawaiian sun the owner blackmailed us by threatening us with calling our commanding officer. There was nothing we could do because of the way the military handles all public relations incidents. So in summary be careful, the hotel isnt that great and if they decide to take your deposit (which they can do at any time), it turns a great deal into what you could be paying for a much nicer place.", "Date": "Jul 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR642035791", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lano245"}, {"Content": "The way it used to be My parents and my inlaws had both been regulars at the Hawaiiana and recommended it highly. After a long long flight, when we arrived at the Hawaiiana, I was worn out and looking at the room, I quite honestly wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. The room was typically 50's motel-like with cinderblock walls and spartan appearance.It didn't take us long to see what we had missed earlier. The louvered walls of the room opened into a very pretty garden/pool area. The sea breeze came through the room when the louvers were opened, and the AC was unnecessary. The whole atmosphere was like a trip back in time to when local places with character, friendliness and charm were the norm and the blandness of the big chains hadn't yet killed everything.It was sad seeing that construction was killing off what is left of old Waikiki, but thankfully the Hawaiiana and a few others are still there. What a loss it will be when these last few old school places are finally displaced by the Trump Towers and other such atrocities.At any rate, I'm glad I got to stay at the Hawaiiana while I still had the chance. Next trip to the islands, I hope I can do it again.

Our rooms was on the ground floor right at the pool - probably the best location you could get. But the room was disappointing - really. The walls are cement block - very cold - felt like a prison (sorry). The bathroom was horrific (again, sorry), but it was. There was mold and the sink was so rotted I wanted to run to the local Home Depot and just buy a new one. I also wanted to buy a bottle of bleach and immerse the bathroom in it from floor to ceiling.

After booking the hotel and thinking I scored due to the low $89.00 a night price (last minute and in July), I was horrified to read the reviews on this site about how bad the hotel was. Having no other option since I waited until the last minute, my sister and I traveled to Honolulu and prepared for the worst. When we arrived, the hotel was small but charming, the garden atmosphere was beautiful and the hotel was alive with guests from all over the world lounging around the proptery. Happy, we headed to our standard room which was at the back of the hotel. Bad decision. We entered the room and were shocked. Our view was of a brick wall and the janitor's closet and the decor was horrific. We were right next to the road and it was totally noisy. My sister started to cry (since she only stays in 5 star resorts). So, we went back to the front desk and upgraded to a garden/pool view room on the third floor for only $110.00 a night. Totally worth it!! The room was clean and while the bathroom was very 1970's, it is super clean and HUGE!!! The bed was comfy and the view was nice. We had a large lanai that overlooked the pool. We stayed for 6 nights and had a great time. You can't beat the location (across from an ABC store; 3 minute walk to the beach, Starbucks and Jamba Juice; and just south of Kalakaua), the hotel staff rocked and so did the cable tv options! You can walk right out of your room and be in the elements which feels great. I loved this hotel. It has more charm and interaction then a mega resort (I've stayed in plenty) and the diversity of guests was refreshing! Most were from Japan.

The grounds were lushly landscaped and at night the tiki torches were lit - very aesthetically pleasing. The building which our room was located in was built of cinderblock and the windows and louvers were wood. The AC was spotty as I recall, but the tradewinds are usually enough to suffice. Our kichenette had microwave and fridge. We made many of our own meals and saved $$ that way. The staff was friendly and there was an Aloha feel throughout. We would recommend, even tho it seemed the rear buildings could have used a facelift.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR550423797", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Tommy2pdx"}, {"Content": "Disappointed I just returned from 6 nights at the Hawaiiana and have mixed reviews about the hotel.There is no doubt that the lobby, courtyards and pool areas are above average and well worth the stay...exactly what I was looking for !The rooms however...another story. I was not only disappointed, but totally disgusted, with my room.The room was old, run down, dark and dingy. It smelled like mildew and the kitchenette' was nothing short of revolting...I never used it. Absolutely hated the room and spent as little time in it as possible...choosing to walk around town at night alone rather than be in there.It does look like the new management is sprucing the place up...they are renovating many of the rooms. The rooms across the courtyard all had large windows and french doors...which would cut out the dark, dingy part of my old room. Hopefully they will be updating all of the rooms.One thing to note as well is that many of the rooms do NOT have a lanai. ( or a bathtub )If you want a quiet retreat from the city...then the peaceful courtyards and pools at the Hawaiiana cant be beat. There was no better place to be during the day or in the evening.I would stay here again...BUT only if I was assured one of the upgraded rooms on the second or third floor...with a lanai. There is no way I would ever stay in one of their old rooms again.Make sure to specify that you will only take one of the renovated rooms when you book !The location is excellent....only a block from the beach and a very short walk to the bustle of Waikiki...on a relatively quiet street.Another note....this is a quiet, peaceful old hotel and as such, there is no noice at all tolerated after 9 PM. If you want quiet, it is great...if you expect to go to party at night...stay elsewhere. If you expect Five star service and rooms...don't bother.", "Date": "May 9, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR976938565", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Location and Atmosphere We stayed here many years ago in 1996 after reading about the Hawaiiana in the Frommers Guidebook.
