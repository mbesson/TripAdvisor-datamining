Unsanitary and poor value; Terrible management: I have stayed at Hotel Eureka 3 times in the past because of it's low price, with mixed feelings. But, after my most recent trip to Montreal I will NEVER stay there again. I arrived at night and asked for a room for two people. I was charged $70 for one night plus a $5 key deposit and was directed to a room on the third floor that ended up having a single bed - NOT a two-person room. I asked to change rooms and was then offered a room with a queen-size bed. The bed, sheets, and room were filthy. I asked the desk person to change the bed sheets and they only provided another sheet for us to change ourselves, which wasn't even the correct size. After being sold a room for a two people, and being provided a 1-person room, and then being offered an unprepared room and asked to change the bed sheets myself, I decided not to stay and asked for my money back. The desk person refused to provide a refund saying that it was against the hotel's policy. They had written by hand \"No re-imbursements\" on a receipt that was not provided to us at the time of purchase, and claimed that they did everything within reason to satisfy us. After some time arguing, we left this disgusting hotel and lost the money we paid. We ended up staying at Hotel La Residence Voyageur, which was $80 per night for a clean, two-bed large room with ensuite full bathroom and small breakfast included. I will always go back to Hotel La Residence Voyageur for the value and service.

I was aware that it didn't get the best reviews, but I was cautiously optimistic. Anyway, it did meet my expectations. The only positive thing I can say about Hotel Eureka is the location: it is close to the bus stop, to metro stops, Gay Village /St. Catherine St (2 blocks away). I did see a lot of homeless in the area, but I felt perfectly safe. When I arrived a the \"hotel,\" they made me pay in cash at check-in which I thought was very unprincipled (and wrote on Booking.com that they should include that information as well a quote the entire \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel price\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with tax included). I made them show me the room which was not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but they gave me a better one upstairs. The people at \"reception\" (aka a dutch door at the wall right near the front door) seemed nice enough, but spoke little English. The hotel is old, falling apart, depressing (despite pathetic attempt for cheeriness with a peeling purple and yellow paint job and d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the hallways) and has breakneck stairs (if you have problems with your knees or a lot of luggage, go elsewhere). The room I had was bare bones: bed, sink, mirror, bedside table, desk and TV. The sink and mirror were clean, but the cleanliness of rest of the room and the bed linens were questionable. Therefore, I slept on the comforter and the blanket I brought from home. Besides that, it took a good 20 minutes for the room to heat up (apparently, they had the heat off when people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there) after I arrived and sometimes quite cold during the night. Best of all, there was only one working electric outlet in the entire room which the bedside table lamp was plugged into (this consisted of an extension cord that disappeared into a hole in the wall). Now for the bathroom and showers: they were located down the hall in separate rooms, European style, but are a bit claustrophobic. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind this, but again, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear the last time they had been cleaned and two of them didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have working locks. I was very happy that I had brought my flip-flops for the shower (also, be sure to bring towels, they do not supply them). Finally, one of the shower and toilet rooms are only separated by a partial wall (a 2-3 inch gap from the ceiling). Therefore, if you are in the shower and another person is doing some business on the toilet, you can hear and smell everything. Worst of all, if you are in the shower and not aware of this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the two rooms, you might fear that someone is standing outside the shower curtain and is about to reenact the famous shower scene from Psycho with you staring as the victim. Overall, I wasn't impressed by Hotel Eureka and would most likely gone elsewhere if it wasn't New Year's weekend.

As college students, we aren't too particular about the quality of our hotels, which lead us to a one night stay in this Twenty-First Century tenement. First off, don't let the indication that this hotel is \"downtown\" deceive you. The hotel is located in the Latin Quarter and is AT LEAST a 30 minute walk from anywhere that you want to go in Montreal. When we arrived outside, we recognized that the area was far from ideal, but we were still optimistic. We entered through the front door and found ourselves seemingly trapped in a small room, enveloped by bars that were probably stolen from an old prison and nailed to the walls, where we were greeted by the man who was presumably the owner. Our encounter with this unmistakably shady individual was a much less than auspicious beginning to our stay. If you think you're going to get a rate that even remotely resembles the rates listed on the internet, think again; we paid $135 for a room with one double bed and two \"mattresses\" (actually two small, filthy pieces of textile from 1973 sewn together and stuffed with a centimetre of cotton). In addition to this, the guy asked me for $5 when i requested the WIFI password. I'm not sure he decided on either of these rates until we reached the window. The smell of the hallway (and rooms alike), which was similar to that of a dead animal smoking a cigarette, was amplified by the stifling heat that kept us awake all night (though the stench of our sweat did mitigate the smell a bit). The shared downstairs bathroom was comprised of nothing but an ineffective, barely usable lock and a toilet over which a small window conspicously sat despite being completely painted over with the same paint that was used to paint the rest of the diminutive bathroom around the time of the Watergate scandal. The only slight positive of the entire experience was that the shower, though on a different floor and shared, was relatively new (by relatively I mean that it was the only part of the hotel that's been rennovated since the fall of the Soviet Union). Needless to say, we booked a new hotel the following morning after we all combined for about three hours of sleep. The next hotel was considerably cheaper, cleaner, and the staff was much more congenial.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHotel Eu-reek-a\u201d", "Author": "Clarinda76", "ReviewID": "UR96190204", "Content": "To echo all of the other reviews for this hole - its the worst hotel I've ever checked into. After finding it on Budgetplaces.com I booked it as the photos, list of facitilites and reviews on there suggested it was no frills, but clean and convenient. We had booked 4 nights, and had to pay up front. Just as I finished handing over the cash someone in a room down the corridor began a very loud impersonation of the Meg Ryan restaurant scene in 'When Harry Met Sally'. I asked the receptionist if that was usual, and he just shrugged. The room was neat, but very shoddy and smelled unclean, like dirty sheets. The shared bathroom and toilet were vile. I asked to be moved to a room with a private bathroom, but was told unconvincingly that they were not available. The description I had booked with on the website indicated that we would have a private bathroom, but that it was not ensuite. Neither was wifi available. Both my parter and I felt very unsafe and physically sick being in the room, and spent just 20 mins walking around Montreal before we decided to return, collect our belongings, and check out. Amazingly, the receptionist seemed surprised that we were unhappy with the standard, and did not deny that the hotel is used by prostitutes. We lost our money, but felt much happier checking into the delightful Auberge Pomerol just as few steps away. We were even given a standard room for the price of an economy room.

Well, upon arrival they could not find my reservation - apparently they never got the confirmation from their main site! Partially my fault for not calling to check prior I suppose. As it was already Friday afternoon and opening of Jazz Festival I was worried other places are booked too and besides I was running late for the conference so a decision had to be made quick. They offered me their standard price of 70$ per night which I refused - eventually lowering it to 60$ which I agreed to. When I came back to check in after the conference later in the night I got to see the room: tiny, claustrophobic, run-down, no bathroom, small sketchy sink, barely room for a slanted bed, no screen on the windows so if you want to leave the window open good luck with flies and mosquitoes. There is a tv thank god to catch up on news and World Cup, but no phone and their internet was down the whole weekend - luckily I was able to catch a different free connection provided by a nearby location.

More on bugs: the next day I spotted and killed a big black spider crawling on the wall (maybe I should have let it live to catch bugs but again how will I know it won't crawl on my face at night), and upon my return home I noticed small red spots on my hands and arms in clusters of 2 and 3 - presumably bites of some kind.

My credit card was immediately charged one night by the hotel. I found that strange and figured out what happened as I checked into the hotel. The employee named Johnny and I figured out that the hotel mistakenly assumed my reservation was for June. They assumed we were a no-show. Thus, they charged me that night. Luckily I had printed out a copy of the orbitz reservation as that was the only proof I had that the hotel made the mistake! Johnny printed out a receipt and explained that at that moment of our actual check-in, I would be refunded the money wrongly charged in June and would be charged the entire amount of our stay. I finally got my refund for that incorrect initial charge--only after I filed a claim with my credit card company and emailed the hotel saying it was long after my stay and I never was given the refund to which I was entitled. It proved worth it to keep the paper trail! I didn't think the hotel was in the worst area. I felt it was safe at night to walk around. It was just very noisy! The Berri-Uqam subway stop was a convenient few steps away. (You can easily cut through the Couche-Tard mini-mart located very close to the hotel) Our room was cramped. Barely enough room between the beds and anything nearby. The whimpy ceiling fan was more a noise nuisance and didn't cool us off at all. And the room temperature climbed very high on the hot summer nights! The one small window could be opened but there was barely any breeze and the noise from the streets below would wake the dead--especially on a weekend! The shared bathrooms were always unoccupied when needed. Footwear (flip flops, etc.) highly recommended while showering. Neither the towels nor the linens were changed at all during the few days of our stay. The linen closet across from our room was left opened/unlocked for the first two days of our stay so we thought we were supposed to help ourselves--and that we did. Would I stay here again? Maybe. If I did though, I would bring a big fan or three in the back of our car so we could be cooled off at night. And most importantly, I would again make the reservation via something like Orbitz for the visible fact that their records don't seem to be well-organized. I mean...imagine if we arrived and there were no rooms for us since they had incorrectly assumed our stay was for June. See my pictures and make sure you're prepared to sacrifice some comfort--since you're most likely trying to save money by staying here (like us).", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cNot bad...Not bad at all.\u201d", "Author": "veata", "ReviewID": "UR8370201", "Content": "Hotel Eureka is not in the safest part of Montreal but it is in a very convenient location. My friend and I stayed in Hotel Eureka for 3 nights and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go (shopping, food, bus, caf\u00c3\u00a9, club), and no taxi was needed. Upon entering the Hotel, the scene is quite like a small town house with many, very steep narrow steps (so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not into climbing stairs, maybe this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best place). The receptionist guy was really nice, we were late for check in and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get upset. He gave us our keys and walked us to our room. The room itself was SO SMALL! But, for the price we paid it was fine. We had our own shower and sink and the toilette was down the hall. The shower was so clean; in fact, the entire room was very clean upon arrival. The toilette down the hall was cleaned a few times a day so it never smelt bad or had someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leavings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in there. They do not come into your room during the day and make the bed for you or anything, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even give fresh towels, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure if you asked they would give. The noise level inside the hotel was quiet during night hours but it was a bit on the noisy side outside of the hotel and from our room we could hear it all. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a clean freak so I was a little apprehensive about going to a lower end hotel, but this place was clean, small but clean.

To enter the hotel, you need to ring a buzzer for someone to let you in 24 hours a day (24 hour security). We did have some problems checking in on the first night, because their credit card machine could not connect. After trying for about a half hour, they told me I could pay tomorrow. Upon entering the room, I noticed that there was only a sink, a bed, and a tv that got one english channel. However, everything was very clean, and there were two toilets and two showers in the hallway. My girlfriend loved it and would return in a heartbeat, I personally would rather a hotel with my own shower and toilet.

We requested paying at checkout and he refused. Our room was ridiculously small. They had taken a room for a single double bed and crammed 2 beds into it. Because of this there was no other furniture in the room except for a TV that didn't work and no space to walk or put our things. There was no closet or drawers and the towels were on the radiator because there was no other place for them. The bathroom was in the hallway, which we knew ahead of time.
