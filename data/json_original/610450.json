{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Above Average in the heart of Ubud We spent ten days In Ubud over Christmas 2007/Jan 08 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We booked directly with the Guest House and final rate was correct - no hidden costs. $US60 per day.Our room was a bungalow style with fan and A/C but no TV or phone. Bed was comfortable. Room was well-maintained and the grounds and pool were well-maintained. Breakfast was pleasant, nothing special. Staff were delightful and not pushy. The lady Catur (meaning fourth as in fourth child in Bahasa) was always charming and helpful.Main attraction is location, next to the main temple/palace area in Ubud. Dancing and rehearsals can be noisy but not unpleasant. Puri is on the main street and you have an easy walk to ATMs, cafes etc. Although there are many homestay/ guesthouses around they are often in rice paddies and so a little wet.Ubud is perched along a mountain ridge and so sticking to the main streets is easy walking from Puri.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR899606809", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ChrisandGardner"}, {"Content": "Made to feel at home Stayed here with my two young children and wife in October last year.

We stay here because we love the position. Rooms are not flash, basic, no television, basic furniture, a little shabby. We really don't care as the location next to the lotus pond is wonderful. Gardens are lovely and the pool is really welcomed after walking the streets of Ubud. Breakfast is adequate if not a little boring after a while.

Right on the main street and adjacent to an active temple. The rooms are pleasant but quite basic. The major drawback is the lack of service after breakfast.

Another advantage is that it is beside the Pura Saraswati, which has performances on some nights, and you can peek in for free. However, that's the end of the benefits. The rooms are dirty. The staff just don't know how to do a cleaning job. The bathroom was mouldy and 'yucky', despite the superficial gold fittings. Bed linen was stained, and pillows smelly. Some staff members were very pleasant and helpful. Others were indifferent. The worst problem was the woodwork. The beautiful antique door entrance to the room was being eaten by termites, and the floor below was continuously filled with wood dust and dirt. I asked to change rooms after one night, and this was obliged. The other problems persisted in the new room. Breakfast just bearable. The stay was not worth it, despite the central location.", "Date": "Nov 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR757784082", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Frank-Mozart"}, {"Content": "Loved it! A friend and I were in Ubud for some yoga classes, and we wanted to be close to the center of Ubud so that we could easily explore during free time. The location was great! It is next door to the lotus cafe and the royal temple and gardens. My only suggestion is to request a room facing away from the street if you're a light sleeper. The staff at Puri Saraswati were excellent and helpful at every turn. The rooms were clean and come with a private terrace. The pool is very clean as well. The breakfast was reasonable.

The Puri Saraswati Hotel is a great choice. We stayed there for 3 nights at the beginning of our stay in Bali and enjoyed the quiet - a real haven after the buzz of Ubud!

We were traveling in a group of 9, arrived from Seminyak with no prior booking in Ubud. We paid Rp 400,00 (about US40) for a/c deluxe twin room, and Rp 500,000 (about USD50) for a triple deluxe room with breakfast.

We paid $US60 for an a/c deluxe twin room, daily breakfast and afternoon tea/coffee. (Superior with a/c is $US50). We booked direct with Catur on reservations [----] and found her and all the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. The room was attractively furnished and the bathroom modern. There is a phone in the room but no TV and no fridge though we were able to keep our acidopholous in the breakfast bar fridge without problem. There is a verandah attached on which we had our teas. The pool is in a nice setting and small enough that you could easily strike up a conversation with other guests or not as you please. Puri Saraswati is owned by members of the royal family and I really enjoyed, however peripherally, the family comings and goings - practicing of the gamelan for a big event and preparations for a temple ceremony. I also felt quite safe there as family members live on the grounds. We didn't have an outlook being on the ground level, except onto the central breakfast pavilion and gardens. I imagine the rooms above would have a view of the beautiful temple grounds and gardens that are behind the Lotus Pond next door, and I would ask for that next time. We bought tickets at reception for the Thursday night traditional dance performance by children and teenagers (50,000rp at 7.30pm for about 1 hr and 1/4). As it was the rainy season, a sudden downpour meant we dashed from our seats in front of the stage to a hall at the back (like a scout hall) - but that was interesting in itself and the children were charming and the dances beautifully executed. Before the skies opened, the parade on entry was spectacular as it came up through the darkened garden.  Puri Saraswati organizes cooking classes with Cok Sri, a 50 year old Balinese lady who lives in a family compound on Jalan Raya where the classes are held. She has been to Australia as a member of a Balinese dance tour and has fond memories of her visit that she shared with us. She is also connected by marriage to the royal family, hence the Puri Saraswati association. Her cooking class started with a visit to the markets ( be prepared for the raw meat and poultry section!! most the food you'll be eating in Ubud comes from anyway...). It was about $A15 each in Cok Sri's kitchen and then you sit down with her after cooking for lunch. It was fun and another opportunity to experience a Balinese home. Puri Saraswati also does a ricefield tour early morning, but that was too energetic and too early for us. We did make it to breakfast everyday though and there was a nice variety and enough food, even for my son and his healthy appetite.  All in all, we really enjoyed our stay, particularly the activities arranged through, and associated with the hotel , with the family and staff to the dancers, to Cok Sri, and with the acitivities of the family living there - we felt we experienced an extra community dimension that was more than the comfort and value of the room.
