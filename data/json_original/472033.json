Both rooms were quite small, but clean. The shower in the room I ended up in had the disconcerting habit of changing temperature every two minutes. Breakfast buffet was particularly disappointing. Some cereal, yogourt, croissants. Outside the door was a fruit-stand with beautiful fresh fruit, but our buffet, every day, had nothing but a bowl of canned fruit cocktail. I expect better than that for a room that cost me 190 euros a night. Also, be prepared. Unless you want to spend a lot of money, you will need to take the vaporetto. The hotel's website says 5 minutes to the hotel. It took at least 10 for me, and you need to carry your bags up and down the stairs of 3 bridges to get there.
