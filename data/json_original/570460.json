The no. 32 bus brought me to the edge of the Vatican city and from there I toured at leisure. (Buy your ticket in advance from a tobacconists or booth). The property was nicer than the images I had seen, the room was cool and spacious with everything you could need. Some lovely cafes and restaurants nearby though mostly I bought from the nearby deli and fruit shop and ate on the balcony. I've tossed my coin in the Trevi Fountain so I will surely be back, and will once again choose Residence Fleming.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cToo Far from Rome!\u201d", "Author": "CathyOne", "ReviewID": "UR34298090", "Content": "My husband & I stayed here for 6 nights in June 2009. The apartment was spacious & clean, with a maid service every day. But it is just too far from the centre of Rome. There is a bus that goes to the Vatican, but it is a 10 minute walk to the bus stop. This place is out of the central metro bus & train area. So we ended up spending a fortune on taxis. The Internet access is free & quite fast, but not on the 2nd floor! We had to change our room to the 3rd floor to get good access, my husband needed it for business. The kitchen is small, but adequate - no oven or microwave though. The hot water in the bathroom runs out after one shower & takes an hour or more to heat up again. There is a balcony & they don't mind smoking in the rooms. Be aware that if you stay here, you are out of Rome central & will spend a lot on taxis (not cheap in Rome), I would not stay here again just for that reason.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Fleming", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d570460-Reviews-Residence_Fleming-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$74 - $123*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Guido Banti, 33</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00191</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "570460", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/be/86/ee/residence-fleming-thumbnail.jpg"}}
