{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location, helpful staff. As mentioned it is very close to the nightlife and great for the amazing subway system. In a quiet area, easy walking distance to above. We thought it was retro rather than dated! Clean and comfortable. The desk staff were incredibly helpful and were happy to keep our luggage when we went off to Kyoto and Mt Fuji for a couple of days.", "Date": "Jul 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR493549547", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fishgirl20"}, {"Content": "Would NOT recommend! If you are going to spend this kind of money you deserve a better hotel! After paying over six hundred dollars to stay at this hotel you would expect not to have to pay for the pool. But we were informed it was 1000 yen per person, per day! That is roughly $9.00 per person. A ridiculous amount of money for any type of hotel pool. Then to top it off they do not exchange your towels everyday! Instead you get a new one every third day. I'am sorry but once again for this price you would expect more. The rooms are small, dirty and the beds are VERY uncomfortable. Only plus side to this hotel is the location.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR457144246", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jimkeri"}, {"Content": "The best of the 80s The Roppongi Prince Hotel must have been some hot stuff when it first opened in the 1980s. It has some very out-of-date, but surely impressive at the time, decor. The room I was originally taken to, on the 9th floor, smelled like an ashtray, and had been sprayed with something very strong and floral to cover it up. I am usually not to picky about having a non-smoking room or a regular room, but this was too much. The non-smoking room the moved me to on a lower floor was cleaner, but still too dirty for this price. The carpet had all kinds of stains all over it, and some kind of artificial floral fragrance still lingered quite heavily. That being said, the design of the hotel outside of the rooms was very nice and interesting. The rooms themselves just need a makeover. Given that, I thought this hotel would have been better if the price had been lower. Someone needs a reality check.", "Date": "Jan 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR447012185", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "cassissoda"}, {"Content": "Comfortable and good value We just spent 5 nights at the Roppongi Prince. At first we had mixed feelings, but after staying at another Tokyo hotel later in the week, we became very grateful that the bulk of our nights were at the Roppongi Prince. When looking back, the main bad thing about it is that it is kind of dated and tired looking. THink of a Holiday Inn class hotel. Clean and comfortable, but nothing eye catching. Carpets are worn, lobby is a wierd pink color and there are no restaurants or bars to speak of in the hotel. But the location is fun. Roppongi has a lot to offer and it is very centrally located. We walked to many neighborhoods from there and it was a really easy walk to 2 subway stations. The room was good, however Caution: ask for a re-done room. Our first room they showed us had stained carpets and smelled like the bathroom. They moved us up a floor which had brand new carpets and we were very happy. Room was a comfortable size because it had a separate room with a desk and a very large closet so we were able to unpack and keep our suitcases out of the way. The bed was a very comfortable king size bed. They had CNN in english. The breakfast was decent. The service was helpful and friendly. We paid $150 a night including breakfast and feel it was a very good value. I would recommend it. Later in the week we stayed at another hotel, which was unbearably small, so we were pretty content with the Roppong Prince hotel", "Date": "Dec 5, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR934314255", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "tripdetective"}, {"Content": "Nitelife Stayed here for 3 nights. It is located about a 5-10 minute walk away from the heart of roppongi. This area is the nitelife of tokyo, nightclubs, dance clubs, lounges and bars, variety of restaurants. This is why we stayed here, go out to the wee hours and just walk back to the hotel. The room is an average size and clean. Bathroom is clean, average size. THey have a nice pool but never used it. No in room safe. Hotel staff very helpful, all of which i encountered spoke pretty well english. It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the subway. Not near a train station though, but that was not an issue since the subway is so well connected across the city. No view from room, but who cares. When u r in tokyo there is so much to see outside. tip:If you are lookign for nightlife, shinjuku is also very good. Much more vast, filled with loads of ppl at night and much more visually intense than roppongi but focus seems to be more restaurants, karaoke bars, stores, and bars. So depends on what you are lookign for.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR517838790", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "redsilk"}, {"Content": "Good location, ok facilities The interesting architecture makes this hotel appear more stylish and chic than it really is. The clientele is very local - businessmen and groups of young twenty-somethings taking vacations together mostly. The cool-looking pool was often empty - and we found out why on our second day in the hotel. Even as a hotel guest, you are required to pay (can't remember the amount but it wasn't just a couple dollars) to use the pool facilities. Also, the sides of the pool are clear plexi so people eating at the pool cafe and restaurant behind it can see you swimming. The room was a good size (for a budget hotel in Tokyo) - a tad smoky, bathroom was small but adequate. The included breakfast was great - very wide range, full of choices and tasty (but don't eat the eggs if you're used to Amercan eggs - they are a bit on the spongy side). The location is what makes this a good stay. A little up a hill in Roppongi, on the quiet side, the surrounding area is quiet and calm. Yet, a short walk down the hill and you are immediately in the middle of Roppongi crossing, the epicenter of Tokyo's yound nightlife (tons of bars, clubs - not the sleazy red-light ones like in certain parts of Shinjuku!). Overall, a good price, good stay, subway close by, nice staff.", "Date": "Jul 22, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR607612601", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Immer wieder!!!   showReview(11357971, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR345206731", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d301366-r8108278-Roppongi_Prince_Hotel-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "301366", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
