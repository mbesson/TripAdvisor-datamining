The rooms are really clean and cleaned every day, you have the TV with the Turkish satellite but also English speaking chanels. Because it's not a big hotel, all the staff is here for you at any time you need. Breakfast is really good - Turkish breakfast of course - and the situation of the hotel is perfect. You are just 50m for Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, and the street is really quiet and peacefull.

We stayed on the top floor and had wonderful light from the many windows and felt like we had privacy after such busy days in the city. The bed was extremely comfortable and the heat worked well even in the winter. The shower was nice and hot, but the jacuzzi was a bit of a disappointment, as it was very small and the hot water did not last to fill it, making it only luke warm. Everything else about the room was very modern and comfortable. The internet was very reliable. The service was excellent - staff helped us call a taxi one day and arranged a rental car for the next part of our trip. We felt very safe and always happy to return there after a long day.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cFond memories\u201d", "Author": "george-eric", "ReviewID": "UR123870804", "Content": "I stayed at the Seven Dreams twice in 2010 and was bowled over by the welcoming attitude of the staff; nothing was too much trouble. The hotel itself is a mixture of the good and not so good. The reception is scruffy and the carpeting going up the stairs was dirty and quite sticky underfoot, but the bedroom and bathroom were immaculate in fittings, furnishings and cleanliness. The restaurant was not open when I was there, so breakfast was taken at a sister hotel, the Seven Hills, 100 yards away. What a way to start a day, the most superb buffet you could imagine, together with stunning views of the Sultanahmet area. I will certainly return to the Seven Dreams, but I do think it is a little overpriced for what it offers.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and staff - need to work out kinks to become boutique\u201d", "Author": "at12am", "ReviewID": "UR93915916", "Content": "Seven Dreams has great potential but need to work out some kinks to become a nice modern boutique or apartment hotel. It is more like a B&B then a hotel. It has 2 rooms on each floor of the 3 floors. The suite on the top floor is actually a larger room with a partitioned bathroom, not enclosed for privacy. The tub is beside the bed, exposed. It works for couple but may not for others. Here are the Pros and Cons. Pros: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Very nice contemporary d\u00c3\u00a9cor and HUGE beautiful bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Clean and soft linens \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Great friendly and accommodating staff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Good quality maps, helpful service \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Good location to major attractions in the Sultanahmet area (next to Hotel Uyan, 7 Hills Hotel, Four Seasons) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Breakfast was fresh (served to you in the street level terrace, not buffet style, same stuff as Rast Hotel but looked fresher); each portion is large so may share instead Cons: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Since it is not quite a hotel, there is some loss of privacy when guests of the restaurant are within 5 ft of your door talking loudly as they pass by; also there is no door latch or bolt lock, so anyone with the key can enter the room when you are inside the room \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Room safe is not bolted down so it can be carried away \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Staff is not hotel trained so cleaning can be hit and miss (although they are very friendly and very responsive to requests) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Some odour and noise from restaurant (esp when your room is next to the food elevator to transport meal from ground kitchen to the rooftop) from 9pm to midnight \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Roof top view is not as nice as claimed because the view is dominated by nearby rooftops of similar heights, most of Aya Sofya and small strip of the sea. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No elevator may be a problem for some who have mobility issue Unfortunately, I will not recommend this until they have resolved the restaurant issue. However, I might eat there for the staff service.

The location of the hotel is amazing, just around the corner from the Blue Mosque and the Ayasofia. The view from the roof is incredible, looking out at the Bosphorous and the Ayasofia. In the hot weather, the roof is especially nice, as it provides more of a breeze. The staff was super friendly and very hospitable. They were happy to help in any way, and always had a smile. The room was so comfortable. The bed was so soft and the linens were very fine. The windows are huuuge so they let in lots of natural light, which makes the rooms feel even more spacious. The air conditioning was quiet and definitely necessary at this time of year, which was great help with a good night's rest. The restaurant En La Luna, was simply fantastic. I had yogurt kebab and later on I had a fantastic dish which was lamb wrapped in eggplant and cheese with rice. Both meals were some of the best food I have ever had.

Dreamy!\u201d", "Author": "CassandraUae", "ReviewID": "UR69203093", "Content": "My husband and I literally stumbled onto this small awesome boutique hotel in Sultanamet after our pre-paid 3-night (very expensive stay) at the Ceylan Intercontinental in Taxsim was up. We had decided to stay in Instanbul a few more days to sightsee, and attempted to extend. The hotel was fully booked so they basically threw us out. In all fairness to the Intercontinental, the concieges agree to store our luggage and did call around to find us another hotel; however, the rates they quoted us were phenomenal, so we decide to leave on our scheduled flight -- that night at 12:00 am. Before we left and since we had so much time on our hands (8 hours; check-out was 12 noon), we decided to take them upon their offer to store our luggage and decided to see Sultanahmet on our own. We headed first to the Four Seasons and the taxi dropped up off a couple of blocks or so (as the street - Cankurtaran Mah) leading to the FS is a beautiful, shop-lined, walking street (not to mention uphill) from the hotel. Both of us were breathless after walking half way up the hill to the FS, we spotted this amazingly inviting, shaded side-walk cafe. The tables were draped wth white table cloths and the love-seats were covered with beautiful turkish fabric with big cushions that served as armrests. We make a mad dash to the and feel into the comfortable seating. Before we could catch our breaths, a smiling and welcoming face appeared to offer us cold drinks. What we did not know at the time, that person was the owner, known as \"Celi\". We ordered drinks and two hours later, lunch! The food was great served by two of the warmest, welcoming waiters you'd ever want to meet. After lunch, we were so comfortable, my husband mentioned that he was tired and could sit there all day until our flight that night. One of the waiters overheard his comment and mentioned it to Celi. Celi's friend, Marshallah, appeared from his carpet business across the street a few minutes later, and, in perfect english, and not in a pushy way, explained that the Seven Dreams was a boutique hotel which had availability and suggested that my husband just go upstairs and take a nap! We thought this was a God send! It took us all of fifteen minutes to decide to hop in a taxi, go retrieve our luggage from the Intercontinental, stop by the airline office and change our flight and return to the Seven Dreams, which, I must mention, was all arranged by Seven Dreams owner, Celi, his friends and his employees! We took a long nap and then awoke to have a great dinner at the wonderful rooftop restaurant! Celi explained to us that we were in 1-4 minutes walking distance from all the from major sites that we felt we would missed in Istanbul -- Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Cistern and the Topaki Palace -- what a perfect location!! We even had a view of the Sea of Marmara! Once in, it was difficult to tear ourselves away from our suite with the oh-so comfortable king sized bed and crisp white linens! The room was a charming, newly remodeled second floor walk-up halfway from the outdoor street terrace and the roof top restaurant! It was well appointed equipped with a large turkish jacuzzi bath and awesome separate shower with an amazing big showerhead! We even had a balcony that overlooked the intersection which we sat outside late nights and people watched! We found the large room to be quiet, but could faintly hear the prayer calls from the beautiful Blue Mosque a few steps away -- my husband, a musician -- loved it! On rainy days, I did all of my shopping from the outdoor terrace and only had to walk across the street to tell them what I wanted and pay! Because we were staying at the 7 Dreams, they gave me good prices, packed it well for travel and delivered the items to us right on the terrace before we left! The merchants in the area are all good friends -- like a big family! They included us as family and made us feel special and welcome - Hi Marshallah! (Marshallah is pres of Galata Art and Carpet Gallery just across the street where you'll get the best selections and prices in town!) Needless to say, we loved this little hotel, the staff and the owner -- not to mention the prices! If Celi keeps up the fantastic service, the family atmosphere and the care and personal attention given to his guests, the Four Seasons (which we never made it to) should watch out!!! Cannot say enough good things about this hotel and HIGHLY recommend to everyone really interested in enjoying the cultural and historical aspects of Istanbul through the eyes of its proud people! When you book, say hello to Celi and the gang from us!!", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cYou won't regret picking this hotel\u201d", "Author": "detraveler_7", "ReviewID": "UR66215906", "Content": "This small boutique hotel is an excellent choice for Istanbul. The location is perfect since it is very short walk from the major sites (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, and the Topaki Palace.

Seven Dreams has a nice rooftop balcony with very good food at reasonable prices but the view is mostly the Sea of Marmara. Seven Dreams is considered an annex of the Seven Hills hotel so you can have breakfast at either location if you want to see another view. We liked the breakfast at Seven Dreams better. We found the room to be quiet and slept through the morning call every morning except the day we forgot to close one of the windows completely. It was surprising what a difference that made so the windows must be great. We did hear some noise from the stairwell from people going back and forth to the rooftop but that ended early. The bathroom had a very nice shower stall with good water pressure. We had a suit room that had 2 sinks and a Jacuzzi tub. The room also had a mini-frig and a safe in the closet. The King bed was very comfortable.
