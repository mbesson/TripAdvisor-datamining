{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good stay at the Hotel Nizza We visited Hotel Nizza as a family, on our way to and from Lapland, taking in the Christmas Market. The hotel was chosen with price and proximity to the market in mind. We walked there each day, and found the personal attention we received from staff wonderful.The hotel itself is old, but comfortable, clean and well run. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there.The proximity to the red light district is only an issue if you head that way. As all our travels took us away from that area, it was not even an issue.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR143523910", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "KayceeDubai"}, {"Content": "A real gem! Hotel Nizza is a real gem of a hotel just three blocks from the main train station in Frankfurt. What a pleasant surprise after our 11 hour flight to find this pleasant, charming little hotel tucked away on a quiet street but within walking distance of the main train station. The rooms are large and bathrooms are nice. The rooftop garden is an added bonus. We toasted our safe arrival in Germany up there with a glass of wine and some snacks. The staff is friendly and helpful and the breakfast was beautifully presented with many choices of delicious cheeses, spreads, yogurts, various breads, and coffee drinks made to order. We stayed here both at the beginning and the end of our trip. We enjoyed playing pool in the large recreation room available to guests.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR659993536", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TrixieTraveler"}, {"Content": "Loved the Nizza I stayed at this wonderful family run establishment for 4 nights in May. Everytime I returned to the hotel, I felt like I was coming home. The staff is so friendly and helpful and the hotel was just lovely, with a beautiful roof garden. The breakfasts were also delicious. The rooms are huge and airy (not air conditioned), but the rooms in the back are very quiet and it was not a problem to have the window open. The hotel is near the train station and red light district, but I did not consider that a problem, and it did not feel dangerous at night. The only odd thing was not providing a bar of soap, only liquid pump bottle. Not a big deal, but I do prefer to use a bar. All around, a great experience, and I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "May 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR703953875", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kpmirk"}, {"Content": "Hotel Nizza- a real treasure! I have stayed at numerous hotels in Frankfurt over the years, and none even remotely compared to to the wonderful Hotel Nizza. It is located only a few minutes walk from the Alte Oper and the pedestrian shopping area, and 2 blocks from the waterfront promenade along the Main river. Once inside, I felt immediately the tranquility and sense of well-being that a good hotel should provide. My room was spacious, light and airy, and the rooftop terrace was a glorious refuge from the hustle-bustle of the city. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was wonderful, and the service impeccable. In short, I plan to stay at the Nizza every time I travel to Frankfurt, and I highly recommend it to all travelers.", "Date": "May 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR664652172", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dhviola"}, {"Content": "Nizza - great place I stayed at the Nizza while covering the Frankfurt motor show two years ago for the BBC. I loved coming back to the hotelroom, with its stripped floors and antique furniture, large bed, large room, friendly staff. A perfect antidote to boring business hotels, I almost felt I was visiting a friend in the city, so when I'm going back to this year's show in September I'll be in the Nizza once again.

Close to central train station and just a walk across the river to the museum embankment. Located near central stations means red-light district, run-down area and lots of suspicious-looking people around. But don't be afraid, it is not actually dangerous, just needs to get used to. I stayed twice in a room with private bath, but the shared bathrooms are amazing as well - as large as a standard hotel room.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR246363098", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Gernereiserin"}, {"Content": "Always Stay at the Hotel Nizza I adore the Nizza, with its turn of the century (19/20th) appeal, huge shared bathrooms, and friendly staff. (They offer private baths as well).The Nizza is very close to the bahnhof and offers a generous breakfast; large, clean rooms; and a sort of Turkish design inspired gemutlichkeit that I adore.I have booked rooms there with ten friends a summer or two ago and will stay there again next year. You have to appreciate the rakish natuire of the near-Bahnhof neighborhood, but it is convenienmtly located to the Museumsufer and Sachsenhausen. A great value.If you have any bohemianism in your soul, stay at the Hotel Nizza.
