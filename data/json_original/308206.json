(It was lovely.) I had to fly back to Dubai the 15th, but this time I went by myself (I just flew in last night). I booked my flight and hotel through Expedia and since it was only going to be a short visit, I didn't bother checking into hotels, I just booked the cheapest one. I figured a \"hotel\" with the Le Meridien name attached should be lovely... WRONG! The cab driver from the airport to the hotel, had never heard of the hotel and didn't know where to find it. After driving around for almost an hour in the busy traffic through the city in a not-so-clean or friendly neighborhood, we finally pulled down a dark dingy alley where we reached the front door of this \"hotel\". While the doorman and gentleman at the front desk were very friendly and tried their best to make me feel comfortable... it was impossible to do because I was already upset about driving around trying to locate the place and found there was heavy traffic and construction work being done in the streets right outside. I tried to stay positive but when I got to my room I almost wept because all the furniture was old and run down. The walls had marks and different color stains on them and the kitchen utensils provided in the studio apartment were all used and dirty. The walls were paper-thin and I could hear everything that was going on, on in the apartments on my floor. It wasn't until I was resting on the bed, trying to relax when I smelled cigarette smoke being blown into my room through the AC vent from my neighbors room! I picked up the phone to call a different hotel and noticed there was cigarette ashes in the cradle of the telephone receiver. I was completely disgusted, packed up and left immediately. This was definitely a lesson for me to never book the cheapest and to ALWAYS do my research FIRST.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly Good\u201d", "Author": "allisoniain", "ReviewID": "UR7251678", "Content": "I didn't expect much of this appartment hotel given its price and location. I was surprised on the upside. Very comfortable with a big bedroom and living room plus ample sized kitchen and bathroom. Kitchen is fully equipped. As I had a seventh floor room I also had a good view across the rooftops of Deira. The hotel is just off Al Nasr Square in Deira, Dubai and this tends to be where the \"riff-raff\" collects.

The building is extremely old and the room I was given had cockroaches in it. Upon discovering these, I was offered another room on a different floor, however I didn't feel that the residence's cleanliness standards were up to scratch in general. This doesn't feel like a Le Meridian property and I was extremely disappointed. After a lot of effort, I was offered to be moved to another apartment block. However the management were unable to get a taxi for 1 hour and I ended up having to walk to the new place. What if I'd needed to get to the airport? The location is pretty horrible - a very old part of Dubai and not recommended for tourists. This doesn't even feel like a 3* establishment - I hope Le Meridien make urgent improvements that are clearly necessary to restore this place to a suitable standard.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cby Le Meridien, but not at all Meridien\u201d", "Author": "Hartzmtn", "ReviewID": "UR6233565", "Content": "There was no review of this place, so I thought it was new and it said By Le Meridien, so I booked it on Hotel.com.

The staff was very nice, location as expected, but... the bathroom was terrible, the shower was a small shower pan, the shower curtain was too high and wider than the shower, hence no way to avoid flooding the entire floor, not up to anything Meridien should put their name on, even if they did put out the nice little soap, etc. No wonder this place isn't on the Meridien web site. The bedspread was new as shown in the photo, but the telephone was old and too dirty to want to put near your face.
