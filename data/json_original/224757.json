I was very pleased. The first trip I was on the third floor in a king room with an office center (that means a desk in the corner). The staff is polite and helpful, and I booked through orbitz. This is a no-frills hotel, but it had some amenities that I didn't find in much more expensive rooms. I had a microwave and a fridge, as well as a little coffemaker. In my book those are pretty valuable. If there was a downside it's the color scheme of the bedspread and curtains, but hey...for 54.00/night I can ignore that. The hotel is fairly quiet, I didn't experience any loud noise or issues with traffic, even though it is right off the freeway. I'm told that this isn't the safest of areas, but what I took that to mean was don't walk around outside alone at night.... so I didn't. Otherwise it didn't look 'ghetto' to me...there was a McDonalds less than a block away, as well as Burger King, Taco Bell, Carls JR, a QT station and several other things that made my stay pretty easy. I had to travel a bit for better food than that, but it was fine. My second stay was in the same type of room but on the ground floor, and again I had no issues. I wish they had better linens and towels, but the price was a huge factor here since I was staying for an extended period of time.... so I can make do with thin towels.

Very convenient to 1-10--less than a minute away. The neighborhood is best described as \"seedy\" and a number of homeless people and transients are close by at night. When we first arrived at about 11PM, the doors were locked and we had to bang on the window to have someone let us in--this took 4-5 minutes with some \"concerning\" people close to us. I'm a big city guy, and even I wasn't very confortable in the parking lot after dark. The access road was in very poor condition with dangerous suspension-crushing potholes. The facility itself is OK. Clean, nice common areas. Rooms are small (no big deal) and are about what expect you'd expect at this price point. However, the lighting in the rooms is dim and inadequate, which made our room look like a prison cell when we arrived late. Much better in the morning. Two major issues: there is no continental breakfast--just coffee. So if you want to get something light to eat (bagel, pastry) you have to walk to a convenience store a block away--a real annoyance. There is no public computer or printer, so if you don't go through the hassle of bringing your own, you're stuck. The front desk will print a boarding pass if you give them the confirmation number (when they get around to it) but you can't check email if you don't have your confirmation number so there's no other way to print--my friend had to check in at the airport.

Willetta St. at the front of the building rather than rooms which face the Interstate (which has the constant drone of passing traffic). Avoid connecting doors between rooms \u2014 unless you need them. We had an end room on the third floor and found the soundproofing between the floors adequate (you could just hear water flow in the room above). A gap between the bottom of the room door and the carpeting (inevitably) admitted noise from the corridor. Except for the brief whine of a housekeeper\u2019s vacuum cleaner in the morning (after 9 a.m. on) and the occasional door left to slam closed by another guest, we did not find this a problem during our stay. Note that housekeeping will leave only one sachet of shampoo in each room; hence, you will have to ask for extra from housekeeping in the morning or from the reception desk when housekeeping has finished servicing all the rooms. Guests would find it beneficial if the Accor chain could manage to provide: two sachets of shampoo in each room as part of standard provisions instead of one, Do Not Disturb signs to hang outside the room door, channels TCM and AMC in addition to the (limited) selection offered, and a free Internet terminal in the lobby for those people who do not travel encumbered with a laptop computer. On the positive side, this particular motel did have good staff overall, a 24-hour automatic coffee machine which also dispensed hot chocolate and hot water for tea, and a morning newspaper left outside the door. We found useful the McDonald\u2019s a 1-2 minute walk across the road. You can also find a Mexican restaurant and a supermarket in a shopping plaza you can walk to conveniently at the NW corner of 51st Avenue and W.
