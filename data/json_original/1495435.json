When we got home we checked the bank account and weren't surprised to see we had been charged twice, the second time much more than the original booking cost. We sent an email to the hotel with copies of bank statements proving their mistake and explained they need to refund the larger sum as it was their mistake, so they replied saying sorry for the mistake (which had left us a bit short on cash for the rest of the trip due to paying for the hotel with our spending money) and the money would be refunded within 15 - 20 days. After 1 month still no refund but they insisted that they had made the transfer then finally after another month of emails and complaints we recieved the money but not the full amount but too fed up to claim the rest back. Shocked that an apparently respected hotel not only made this mistake in the first place but also took so long to sort out such a simple matter, well nearly sort out!", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGood quality\u201d", "Author": "arifmetika", "ReviewID": "UR116521522", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for only 4 days and had nothing to complain about.

But for our unpleasant surprise we were received in this 4* hotel Venera Turkish bath without soap, water and pilling, only relaxing. We we stayed 10 min. in the sauna and 10-15 min in the Turkish bath, relaxing. We have asked the woman (Marina) when she will start the Turkish bath she told us that our package is only this, if we want the full procedure that we had to pay 60dollars. We are on 100% sure that they lied us because there is no Turkish bath only with relaxing on the stones. However, we have not received the paid service, they have not returned us the money and for sure we will not return back into this hotel. All our friends will learn for this hotel, for their awful behaviour to us. My suggest is to be very careful if you stay in this hotel.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "Maribou3", "ReviewID": "UR105582877", "Content": "My family and I chose this hotel for our Easter visit to Istanbul. We booked a triple room and we could not have been more pleased with the size of the room. It had views over the Bosphorus, a small living room which helped us feel very comfortable moving around in the room and a good sized bathroom. The sheets and towels were changed daily and the breakfast was plentiful and served on the 8th floor, with great views once more. The location was not the absolute best we could have had but it was close to the tram, only one stop from the Bazaar and two from all the Sultanahmet sites so overall, it was very convenient.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "wellington", "Title": "\u201cLarge modern comfy rooms but terrible location\u201d", "Author": "RickE58", "ReviewID": "UR62689653", "Content": "This is definitely not a location for first time historical/cultural tourist. Mesihpaca is a virtually All-Russian environment and is not reflective of Istanbul. The street is totally lined with Russian speaking clothing shops and deserted on weekends, making it rather unsafe for a female tourist to walk come night. Grand Bazaar is 900m away; while the rest of the historical sites (Aya Sofia, Blue mosque etc) are about 1.5-2.0 km away whereas they are all within 500m if you stay in the Sultanahmet area. The hotel however is rather new and modern: and we were given the quadruple room instead of a triple as there was a busload of Russian inbound tourists. The room was huge ( some 50 sq. m) and the beddings were clean and comfy, while the bathroom was reflective of a new 4 star quality. Being on the 5th floor, we could just see over the opposite 5 storey shops for a glimpse of the sea. However, the air-cond control is fixed to 25 degrees Centrigade and can be rather uncomfortably warm and stuffy. The room windows can be opened slightly (as it had a safety latch) but the noise from the street would be unbearingly loud with service trucks and what not. The hotel staffs are rather impersonal and most do not speak a word of English. As we stayed 3 nights, we were given a free buffet dinner, however; food was average with a biased towards vegetarians. Free wifi was absolutely useless as the speed is so slow it timed out for any webpage that has timeout feature and the other big negative was that the TV had only about 8 channels - all of which are Russian channels except for one with English songs and that being a recorded one which repeats about 10 times a day (according to my teenage son). The'Laleli' tramstop is 200m away uphill to the north of the hotel. By the way, forget about the swimming pool at basement 2 level - it measures about 3 x 3 metres! and the water is not warm enough. The hotel would do better to have a spa pool instead. Oh, and yeah, there was ONE treadmill.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cPosition of hotel is ideal for both business and city break\u201d", "Author": "sumarLondon", "ReviewID": "UR61304089", "Content": "Hotel is very good.
