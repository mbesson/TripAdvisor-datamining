My purpose for being in London was to attend an intensive seminar during the day and later into the evening. I knew this would leave me tired and ready for bed when I returned. It being my first visit to this area I thought it best to pre book accommodation. So before I left home in Ireland I booked a B/B from the internet that reviewed and looked OK.(sadly not tripadviser.ie) Luckily, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a deposit because I ran from there as quickly as I arrived, it really was a kip. I walked a short distance down the street to Whiteleaf. The reception area seemed nice and the receptionist was friendly. Although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the room because it was not ready the receptionist showed me a look alike. Happy with the value I made the booking with full payment. I trusted the receptionist enough to leave my bag in his safe keeping until my return in the evening. Whiteleaf was perfect walking distance to the venue where the seminar was being held. Returning at approximately 8pm I was disappointed with my assigned 10foot by 8foot box room, not at all like the room I was shown and not en-suite. Being tired and exhausted I was happy that the bed had spotless clean sheets. A smell of dirty feet filled the air every now and again. Making myself comfortable I checked if it was safe to leave the window open, which I did and got into bed and fell asleep only later to be awoken with noise that I thought was outside my door but was in fact the noise and breath of a man with his head in my window. Jumping up and shouting at him to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he let go of the window sill that he was hanging on by and disappeared making a soft thud noise as he landed on the flat roof below. I sat on the bed for a moment in disbelief. When I got courage I looked out the window and saw the man crawling in a window to the hotel, that window lead on to a stairs landing below my room. Looking down from my room window the flat roof and window was approximately 15 to 20 foot drop. Before going to sleep I had checked this and presumed it was safe to leave the window open. In shock, bemused and in disbelief I got the courage to leave the room and report to reception. Not alone was I in shock, bemused and nervously looking for support I was further shocked that I was laughed at and made to feel I was dreaming. I was also told that it was my imagination. My inner strength is not quick to fear or am I easily alarmed, in fact in the immediate aftermath I laughed at the incident to family and friends. Proof of my strength, some would say foolishness, is that I stayed a further two nights in Whiteleaf much against my husband, son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orders to get out. Twelve months on the joke has become fear and has changed my attitude to sleeping with the window open or the light off. I realized my fear of sleeping with the light off and or the window open when on my own. Yes I am now scared and I know this could happen in other hotels; however, I would never stay or recommend Whiteleaf to others. To this day I am left wondering was the thief known to those in charge, with their flippant response I intuitively felt this happened before. I think if I had to get support at the time and if responsible people in charge of Whiteleaf had to show concern this incident would not have left its mark so deeply embedded in my psychic. The message I take from this is that irresponsible ownership and workers of Whiteleaf do not care for their customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health but are happy to take their money.

The location is great! easy access to almost anything especially west end, rooms are a fair size, bathrooms are nice and clean which more important than anything else , they dont really have top of the range furniture but fair enough to read and write. BEST part they provide wireless broadband internet free of cost UNLIMITED. Staff Service was good, i had no problem what so ever during my whole stay, Breakfast is standard, not much of variety but nice to start your day. overall if your trip is for shopping ,sightseeing or a gig or football i would strongly recommend this hotel; however, if your coming to London for relaxation and to stick around in the hotel, then this wouldn't be your best option.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jeddah", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "bright_mercury", "ReviewID": "UR84197615", "Content": "This is a beautiful luxury small hotel in Bayswater.

We questioned him and he told us that since we were only 4 people, we didn't need the extra bed. Well, we paid for a six person room, so needless to say we fought him on it and kept the 4th bed. Bad start. We began to look around and found light fixtures with exposed wires hanging on the wall, our blinds were broken, the shower door didn't close and the shower didn't drain. They brought someone in to fix most of the issues which wasted about 2 hours of our time. Later in the week, the power to all of the outlets went out. When it's late and you are exhausted from walking around all day, the last thing you want is some stranger roaming around your room looking for a breaker box. It took them 3 hours to decide that they didn't know what was wrong with it. We didn't get power back until the next day and we had to go up to a vacant room to get ready in the morning. It was also very noisy on the 1st floor. There was always loud banging around 11pm, we assumed it was because they were cleaning up the Indian Buffet downstairs.

Where do I start! I have never in my life experienced anything as bad as the Whiteleaf Hotel! When we arrived in the taxi it looked nothing like the pictures on the internet. However, it was 5:30, already getting dark and we figured we hadn't much chance of finding alternative accomodation. We entered the reception which was rough to say the least, gave the receptionist our reservation number and she asked for payment immediately (\u00c2\u00a3260 for three nights - double room). This was our mistake, we should have viewed the room first. Our room was on the top floor, up a rediculously narrow staircase - dirty mouldy unpainted walls and smelly, disgusting carpet. We entered the room, dropped our bags and sat on the bed. It was then we realised what we were in - the curtains were hanging off the window, the plug fitting and light fitting had obviously been pulled off the wall leaving gaping holes and wires hanging out, the bathroom had a huge hole in the ceiling, blackened and rotten from condensation, the bedcoverings had cigarette burns all over them and the sheets looked wrinkled - as if they had just been smoothed over. It was then that we noticed that the door had obviously been broken in in the past. The door-jam was shattered and someone had nailed a piece of timber to replace it - no wonder we had trouble opening the door in the first place. There was a hand-written notice on the inside of the door stating \"management will not take responsibility for any items stolen from this room\"!! We also noticed that the smoke alarm was covered with a plastic bag - a minor detail compared to the rest! After discussing our options we decided that neither of us wanted to stay here so we left our bags in the room and left the hotel to find somewhere else to stay. We found a lovely little hotel down the road - the rooms were small but well kept, and it costed \u00c2\u00a360 less to stay!! We walked back to the Whiteleaf, got our bags from the room and went to the reception desk. We explained that we were unhappy with the room and that we wanted a refund. The receptionist refused to give us all our money back and said that we would be charged for the first night, because that was their policy! She also informed us that we should go online to Booking.com to cancel our reservation so that they would not charge us! We found an internet cafe the next day and tried to cancel the booking but found that it was 'in the past' so could not be cancelled. I'm waiting for my credit card statement... Here comes the worst bit of all... My partner noticed red lumps on his skin on the following day - like hives, really itchy and red. We assumed it was just some kind of allergic reaction. He got some lotion from the chemist which calmed it down a little. We flew home a few days later and he was sitting watching tv and scratching his leg at the same time. He felt something 'give' and moved over to the window for a better look. There was a small white maggot on his finger tip - alive! I was nearly sick at the sight of it. We only sat on the bed, imaging if we had slept in it! The place was crawling. If you have any sense, do not stay here, there are better options for less money! Our trip to London started on a very bad note.

I had noticed a few brown-reddish coloured bugs near the bed a day before but had assumed they were harmless and had come in through the window. A little research and i discovered they were bed bugs! Several bites on my feet and elbows got badly infected. I kicked up a huge stink and they offered to spray the room. I reluctantly stayed in the room for one more night. In the morning i found a half eaten mouldy hamburger and chips in a take-away tray under the sink! I demanded a refund but was told it couldnt be done under any circumstance. They gave me a bigger room with an ensuite for the remainder of my stay. Only problem was the shower didnt work and there was a rear door that was rusted and water damaged with a huge hole. This let in water and freezing cold air at night. In summary - my worst hotel experience ever. Go easy on the weedy scottish guy with glasses.

We had booked an apartment and were not staying at the hotel itself. When I rang, pointing out their terrible reviews I was reassured that these were exaggerations and things were now good - the place was clean and certainly had no bugs or cockroaches.The apartment was a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Initially it looked OK - big (huge) rooms, 2 bedrooms and a living and dining area plus a kitchenette with a fridge, microwave, oven and toaster. Nice furnishing - all Ikea, TV worked and carpet clearly fairly newish BUT it had not been hoovered - no problem I thought there was a vacuum there but no bags - no one arrived with a hoover after I asked so I had to go and fetch someone. The fridge didnt work - nt only that but it stunk inside like gone off milk, inside the cooker was filthy and there were mouse droppings behind the fridge (old ones admittedly). The owner told me the fridge was an optional extra (it was on their advert)and he couldnt get it fixed that day - promised to get it done the next but never did. He also tried to tell me they only put people in the apartments when the hotel was full - not true I had specifically booked an apartment . He then tried to offer us a free meal - we declined because by then I suspected that the reviews on this site were accurate and didnt fancy eating there (likewise we never ate the breakfast s we had paid for in advance). I felt sorry for the staff one told me they worked 7 days a week, another said they only had one vacuum cleaner for the whole place including the apartments. The staff were nice but didnt bat an eyelid at the mouse faeces - seemed as if this was a fairly average complaint to them. The beds and linen were clean - they gave us loads of extra towels and the bathroom was clean and everything worked but the sofa had collapsed at one end - there were long hairs all over the carpet and bits of food everywhere (including under the bed). It felt as if this was a refurbished apartment about to start falling apart - I wouldnt go back as I suspect it will be dissolving into ruin in the same way that the hotel itself seems to have. I find it bizarre that they have this great venue, really nicely sited and a fab size but the owner does not appear to want to maintain it. My advice - look at your rooms first before you pay (they ask you to pay in advance - dont), they will ask you to pay cash - dont (dont know why they do this but it felt dodgy), read the reviews and do not assume they are all written by hygiene freaks or super fussy travellers who are laying it on with a trowel - they are not.
