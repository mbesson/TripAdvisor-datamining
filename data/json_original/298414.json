I stayed in a twin share which was located on the 4th floor. The elevator was so slow I challenged to beat my friend up via the stairs. We both arrived at the 4th floor from ground at the same time, with out me running. I then dreaded using the elevator knowing I could walk just as fast. Our room was neat and tidy. Just big enough for two people and luggage. There was no remote for the tv or air con so they were both either on or off. There was no phone. The bathroom was the smallest I've seen in a hotel. Every time I was in there I was sure to bump an elbow. But in saying that, it was still a bathroom everything worked fine. The hotel only gave us one key, I ask for another one and they said they could hand us another one that couldn't leave the hotel if one of us came back on our own. Neither of us had to use this option but it was good to know it was there. There was a vending machine on the ground floor as well as a computer with free internet access. On the first floor had the kitchen, eating area, laundry and shared rooms with the shared bathrooms and toilets. Even though I didn't use any of these rooms I have taken pictures to share. Central station was only a short distance away. You can pretty much get a train to anywhere from there. Along the way there was restaurants and lots of places to buy food. Darling harbor and china town was only a short walk away.

Rooms range from old style (a box from the 70s with a window view of a brick wall and shared bath) to nicely done well equipped rooms in the three star hotel style (of course with en-suite bath). I stayed in one of those rooms for two nights before joined by a friend to share one of the twin deluxe rooms for four more nights and the basic room was ok and definitely a step up from a hostel. The location is within reasonable walking distance of Sydney's main downtown attractions and close to several rail transport stations for easily getting to Bondi Beach, King's Cross or other more distant areas. Staff was very friendly and helpful and with 24 hour reception. For those on a budget, it is a good value for the area and though the lower end rooms need paint, they are clean and ok and the shared baths roomy, lots of hot water and clean. A fan is provided, no A/C. The deluxe rooms are with A/C and are on a par with other area hotels but at substantially lower cost. WiFi is available in the rooms but was not very reliable or fast. If you have a laptop and are going to be in Sydney for a week or so, spend $20 for a 2GB USB dongle from Optus, it works great anywhere, even in a taxi. Free Internet is available on a hotel owned computer though it is often in use by others. The hotel is close to Chinatown and in an area with many good mid-range restaurants and the World Square Shopping Center that has a large grocery store, electronics and phone shops and many clothes shops. There is an elevator unlike many of the older area hotels so getting to the room with baggage is not so difficult. There is a communal kitchen though it is pretty rough. Do not lose your key, there is a $100 charge because they have to change the lock! There is no downstairs bar (as is the case for many lower cost older hotels in the area) so no noise.

This is not a hotel, but a hostel. \u00c2\u00a0 A friend booked the hotel room for us online but failed to notice that there was an option for smoking and non-smoking rooms, we subsequently were placed in a smoking room. Even if the room was non-smoking, cigarette smoke from the smoking rooms lingers in the communal areas (besides this the rooms are poorly ventilated, windows are filthy, the sheets are dirty, the carpet stained and generally everything is dated). As my girlfriend is severely asthmatic we simply could not stay in the room so after 1 night (of the 3 we had booked and paid for) at 7:30 the next morning we asked management if we could get a refund. To be fair, the receptionist did offer a room with an en-suite which was a non-smoking room, but it was $40 which we were not willing to pay considering that smoke still lingers in the communal areas\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..The manager was willing to refund one day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money but not two; he suggested that we return and see the manageress. This was understandable; after all it is not his fault that the hotel is dirty, poorly run etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I appreciated how frustrating it must be pursuing a career in such a poor hotel. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 We returned to see the manageress who agreed with her duty manager regarding the refund; which again was understandable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after all it is a business. I asked if we could meet in the middle and split the costs, which the manageress declined to do. What is not acceptable or understandable is the atrocious, aggressive, abusive, and ignorant customer service offered by the reception staff. At NO POINT was my girlfriend or I aggressive or abusive, however the receptionist saw if fit to scream at the top of his lungs for several minutes hurling abuse whilst we, in a very civil manner, tried to argue our point. I cannot stress enough how rude, aggressive and abusive the receptionist was and I assume still is. His reaction was totally disproportionate and under no circumstances should someone like this work in any industry that deals with the general public. The manageress was not able to handle the situation and seemed visibly shaken at the manner in which her receptionist was acting (but still never did anything about it). When we attempted to raise the point how unacceptable the behaviour of the receptionist was he called the police or at least pretended to do so\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..great way to treat paying guests?!! \u00c2\u00a0 Please do not stay at this hotel; it will ruin your Australian experience.

However a few things you should be warned about as you may want to think about other options if any of these matter to you. 1. I was in an end room, 1A, that faced the Wentworth St intersection. It was SOOOO noisy all night and day. I shudder to think what it would be like at peak hour, but I was there on a weekend and it was simply unceasing. 2. the room was so stuffy and hot. No fan. Had to have windows open so that made the traffic noise worse. There were no screens and the inside light was a fluorescent so I had to watch the tv in the dark in case of mozzies and other yukkies. Luckily none came in this time, but i can see potential to be eaten alive by mozzies. 3. the windows led out onto a roof for the below floors that connected all surrounding rooms, so it was not safe (in my view) to leave the windows open when out, meaning the room stayed very stuffy while I was out all day. 4. this room was quite far from toilets and most toilets didn't have soap, but they do provide it in your rooms with the towel. 5. they don't provide cups/glasses!! OK am i going mad or is that really weird for a place that provides a communal kitchen and a fridge in the room?? I ended up taking a saucepan from the kitchen and filling that up with water so i could have a drink by my bed! On the plus, they have a deal going with the Wilson's parking nearby on Goulburn St for $20 per day (incl night) which could make a huge difference, esp being a CBD location.

Staff were very rude to the point of being really insulting (there were many examples of this). Staff could not even show courtesy in speaking and spoke in grunts.

The only pleasant service was from the very hard working housekeeping staff. This place is a real let down, and bought down my whole Australian experience. I think someone in the Tourism industry should no something about this place, or risk creating a negative view of Australia and Aussies in general.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cIt was acceptable\u201d", "Author": "tusoo", "ReviewID": "UR12364605", "Content": "I booked the standard room for three nights.

But when i arrived at the hotel, i didnt really know what was so bad! Sure, my room did have the smell of smoke inbedded into its flooring and walls, and the room didnt have a phone or a kettle, but it was perfectly acceptable. The shared bathroom facilities werent that bad. It was clean and that was all that mattered. The location was great as it is in the CBD and is a mere 5 minute walk to Central Station. It is also near a lot of convenience stores and restaurants so you would never have trouble finding a place to eat. One thing that did kind of annoy me was the traffic at night. At night, you can hear the police and ambulances ringing down the streets, the loud voices or drunkards and party goers. The noise doesnt quite dull down. But, the hotel was quite reasonable. A bit expensive for the quality, but nonetheless, average.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cdo not stay at this hotel- worst experience ever\u201d", "Author": "Valeska26", "ReviewID": "UR10707042", "Content": "My experience at Central Private Hotel (Sydney Central On Wentworth) was the worst experience I have ever had staying at a hotel in my life (and I've travelled a lot!). I booked the room for 2 nights on a website. I was intending on having my sister stay with me on the first night and my brother stay with me on the second night. There was no information on their website indicating that this would present any problem. When I arrived at the hotel, I asked if it would be possible for me to pay extra to have both my siblings stay in the room with me across the two nights. The hotel receptionist shook his head (no verbal communication). I then asked him if it was possible to pay for a bigger room to enable this to occur, and he again shook his head. It was a struggle getting him to actually speak to me. He referred to the \"registered guests only\" signs that were splayed throughout the reception area, and made me sign a form where I listed one person as the registered guest (so I listed my sister). On the second night, I went to take my brother up to my room to stay with me. The male receptionist yelled out at me \"Registered Guests Only\". I explained that my sister was the guest the previous night, and that my brother was the guest staying with me tonight. He said I could not do this, sarcastically adding that \"its not musical rooms\" and that it was \"TOO BAD\",When I calmly told him that I found his service to be quite rude, he replied by saying \"THAT'S LIFE\". I was so offended by the rudeness that the staff had shown me since my arrival that I did not wish to stay anymore. When I told the receptionist I wished to check out due to the rudeness I had experienced by the staff, his response was \"WHATEVER\". I asked him to explain his rudeness to me given the usual customer service principles followed by hotels. He did not respond. I said that I could not see the problem in having my brother as my guest the second night and that there was no information on the website that changing your registered guest for the second night was not possible, otherwise I would not have booked. Their response was \"We can't put everything on the website\". I explained that i had come down to tell my siblings that I was pregnant and to stay a night each with them. I showed them my brother's i.d. to prove he was my brother. My brother asked if we could check out and then check in again with him named as the registered guest and they said that it would cost me another $89 to do this. The hotel staff also told me that \"YOUR PROBLEM IS YOU JUST DON'T LISTEN\". I checked out, again letting them know it was due to their rude treatment as I did not feel comfortable staying at the hotel. The next day I rang the manager.. She said that she \"could not see the issue\" when I described the rudeness shown to me by her hotel staff. She also said that she thought that I was just annoyed because I didn't get my own way with the room situation and so I was causing a fuss! I explained that my issue was the rudeness of her staff. She said that the staff had written in their logbook that I \"harassed\" them for an hour. I explained that I was in fact only there for 20 minutes maximum, and could prove this by the call logs on my mobile phone. I also spoke respectfully to her staff despite their treatment towards me. She said \"Why would I trust you when I don't know you. I've known these men for 20 years so I trust them over you\". It made no difference when I said that my brother and sister were there as witnesses. She refused to provide me with a refund, and even suggested that maybe i was just being over-emotional due to being pregnant!!!! I have never been made to feel so unwelcome staying in a hotel in my life- they had no understanding of customer service principles, in fact, it seemed they felt that they were the ones doing a favour to me by letting me stay at the hotel (forgetting that I was in fact a paying customer!). The allure of this hotel is its cheap price, but I have stayed at cheaper hotels around the world with far greater customer service.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sydney Central on Wentworth", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d298414-Reviews-Sydney_Central_on_Wentworth-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$92 - $163*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">75 Wentworth Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "298414", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/46/b6/46b6665ceb01c32da5208d22db01a7211large.jpg"}}
