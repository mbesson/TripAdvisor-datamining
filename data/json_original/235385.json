Finding an apartment for my daughter was the goal and so I wanted a hotel close to public transportation. I am glad we decided to stay at City Suites. The train station is right next door and you can connect to all the different lines that will take you in every direction. Noise wasn't a problem for us but maybe that was because our room didn't face the train platform. Regardless, the hotel is very nice, the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful and the rooms provided plenty of room with two separate areas, each one with its own flat screen TV. There is free wifi, a mini bar, refrigerator and all the other usual amenities. The free continental breakfast offered everything we wanted and was well maintained. There is coffee and hot water 24/7 and fresh cookies in the afternoon. The lounge with fireplace provided a quiet spot to read and relax. I have only two complaints: Housekeeping often didn't get to make up our room until quite late in the afternoon even though the \"Housekeeping Please\" tag was hung on our door early each morning. The wall air conditioners were old, a little noisy and didn't quite cool down the room to my satisfaction. The ceiling fans helped but I like a REALLY cool room.

It also close to things like a frozen yogurt shop, a Jamba Juice, a Potbelly, Ann Sathers, etc... --There is a lovely \"living room\" where we spent time relaxing - coffee and tea all day, a microwave, a fireplace and cookies in the afternoon, it was very cozy and comfortable. --A basic breakfast is included with the room and wifi is free! --The staff were really helpful and eager to please!

The hotel is conveniently located next to the red line stop at Belmont. We called ahead and requested a room on the quiet side of the hotel and of course when we checked in the only available room was on the side next to the train tracks. The room was comfortable and clean but we defiantly heard the train all night long.The suite consistent of two rooms, the living room had a couch, mini refrigerator and a desk. The king bed and pillows were comfy. There was an all night party going on in one or two of the rooms on our floor which also spilled out into the hallway which went on until about 5 AM. So between the train and the party we didn't get much sleep the first night. The staff at the front desk agreed to move us to another room on the quiet side for the rest of our stay. The new room was very quiet however there was a problem with heat, it wouldn't turn off so it felt like we were in a sauna. Our trip was in the middle of December and we had to run the air-condition on high to keep the temperature comfortable. Seems like a big waste of energy. The hotel offers free wireless in the rooms and also free breakfast.This was a big plus and the breakfast was really good and consisted of juice, milk, coffee, hot tea and hot chocolate, cereal, fruit cups, yogurt, doughnuts,Danishes, muffins, hard boiled eggs and Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches.

The room had several snacks and beverages (non-alcholic as well as alcholic) and it operated on a honor system. You report only what you had consumed. Nobody was there to monitor what you took or did not take. Very impressed. The best thing about this hotel is one of its staff member named Ben. On our very first day, on the way to hotel, my daughter had left her cell phone and ipod in the cab. Needless ot say, it was a stressful moment as we did not know how to go about retrieving it. Ben was there to calm us down and went above and beyond to help us locate it. Besides the hotel itself, I was extremely impressed by the citizens of Chicago. The lady who had found my daughters phone went out of her way to call the contacts on my daughter's phone and even dropped the phone and ipod to our hotel when she found out where were staying. Unfortunately, she did not leave behind her name and contacts, so we could not thank her personally. So, lady, whoever and wherever you may be, a BIG THANK YOU to you. You have definelty restored our faith in humanity and have indeed represented the city of Chicago in a very positive light. As for the location of the hotel itself., This hotel could not have been more ideally located for people who likes to explore a new city using Mass Transit. Its located right at the foot of the Belmont CTA red line, yet there was no noise from this at night. On our last day in Chicago, we decided to explore the neighborhood by foot and and were amazed at the vibrancy and diversity it offered.

The bellstaff was very helpful in delivering our bags, but unfortunately the parking situation is less than ideal because its in a garage a couple blocks away that requires a access wand (that is $200 to replace if something happens to it). Hopefully you don't have the misfortune of losing it. Just a minor complaint as there is not much the hotel can do to improve this except valet service, which is expensive. Breakfast was also crowded and mediocre. The pastries were gordon's food service quality at best and the coffee was absolutely terrible. The 7/11 microwave breakfast sandwiches didn't help to sell the quality either.

Upon entering our room at the hotel, we discovered that the room was hot and stuffy. We turned the window air conditioner on, but nothing happened. I called the front desk and requested a room change, since we wanted to relax and did not want to have repairmen in our room. We had just arrived and it was very early (a little after 3:00), but we were told that we could not change rooms because \"the hotel is fully booked.\" I pointed out that most of the evenings guests had certainly not arrived yet, but the desk clerk was very abrupt and would not budge. We sat awkwardly in our room as the repairman tested the air conditioner, removed it from the window, and then went to get another (used) one to install. Then we turned it on, unpacked, changed clothes and went out to get a meal. Upon our return, the replacement air conditioner had also stopped working. We called the front desk, and magically, they could now move us to another room. So we re-packed and moved. The several hours of needless annoyance got our trip off to a very bad start. Finally, the air conditioner worked in the new room, but it made an assortment of loud and annoying noises during the night that kept waking us up. We assumed that complaining about it would be a waste of time, and just reconciled ourselves with sleeping badly for our stay. The night before checking out, we called to get a late checkout and were told to call back in the morning. In the morning, my wife called to request late checkout again, and the desk clerk said, \"No later than noon!\" and hung up. At 11:20 the desk clerk called our room and rudely informed us that if we did not leave soon, we would be charged for an additional day. I was furious at the lack of service and the extremely rude and inconsiderate way we were treated, and it started the day very badly. I have never been treated with such disdain at a hotel, and the attitude seemed to be the norm for their desk clerks. I hope they re-evaluate their customer service training. I need to note, however, that one person there was extremely friendly and helpful. The bellman, Brian, was sent up to help with the replacement of the air conditioner, and he--unlike everybody else at the hotel--\"gets it.\" He was extremely personable and seemed to be genuinely concerned about resolving the problems so our stay would be enjoyable.

This hotel has served me the best for all my Chicago trips. I say that because this was my second stay, but it sure won't be the last. Let's start with location as this little boutique hotel is situated on the edge of Boys Town in the heart of the Belmont area. It is conveniently located next to the Belmont El Train stop on the Red Line. It is within walking distance to lots of great restaurants for eating, tons of shopping in the Belmont area, Wrigley Field, and, of course, Boys Town where many events happen all year long. During this particular trip, Maket Days was the main event, and with the hotel being so closeby, we were able to party and drink up the festivities without worrying about having to catch a cab or bus back to the hotel. Being so close the Red Line that runs 24 hours a day made it very convenient to travel downtown or other parts of the city. I don't think you could ask for a better location. The hotel itself is excellent from its cute covered doorway to the large mirrors that line the hallways to the welcoming lobby and staff. The hotel clerks and bellhops were always friendly and jovial, and I can't remember a time when I didn't pass by without hearing a \"Hello!\" or some other greeting. The maids were also very friednly and helpful, and they always made sure I had coffee when I requested it, which is a plus in my book since I drink it all day long. Like the lobby, the elevator, staircase, and hallways were always kept clean. The room was small but had a very plush queen size bed with a window air conditioning unit, two night stands, a business desk, a tall armoire for clothes, and a decent sized flat screen tv. I have to say that I loved how comfy the bed was, but it really made for a sore back in the morning. The bathroom was very nice with shiny white tile and glass block in the shower, which contained fragrant set of shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner. It also had fragrant lotion for those who need a little moisturizer to start their day. As for downsides, the room was on the side facing the El Train. So, one would think that noise was an issue, but I did not find that to be the case. Sure, I could hear it, but the noise was not overbearing, and the air conditioner actually drowned out most of the noise. I would also point out that the room came with very thick curtains to block out light, but since they were so long, they also covered the air conditioner. I'll just try to post them up around the air conditioner next time.

We could view the L Train from our windows, but rarely heard the train itself; the A/C maintained some nice (but not abrasive) white noise. The station was right next to the hotel. 2) The room's design and amenities were fantastic; containing a lot of modern features, from the flat-screen TV and mounted DVD to the glass block windows in the bathroom. The awesome-smelling eucalyptus shower gel/shampoo were provided via dispensers and the shower head and pressure were great. 3) The service at City Suites was much-appreciated. The front desk clerks were friendly and welcoming; we rarely got past the front desk without a greeting from either the bellhop or the clerks. They were informative and very helpful. A light continental breakfast with assorted cereals, pastry and juices was provided. The only disappointing aspect of my stay at City Suites unfortunately had to do with the quality of sleep there. Don't get me wrong; the bedding was comfortable with its down comforter and several pillows. However, the reader should note that the mattress is an EXTREMELY plush pillow-top. I woke up each morning with a slight backache; if you have back problems like I do, it may pose a problem for a long-term stay.

However, if you do, take the 77 bus that goes directly up and down Belmont Ave. and runs quite frequently.
