It is set on the cliff nicely and has ok food, although not fabulous. We came there without reservation for two nights, agreed to thier set price even thou standard is to bargin a little for randoms like ourselves. As honeymooners, nothing was special here. I hurt my hand surfing and wanted to leave after one night. They refused to not charge us for the 2nd night, eventually gaving us half off, but I couldn't believe how rude and wrong this was for a couple who just happened to show up one day when they hardly had any occupancy in the slow season (Nov) to charge us 40US dollars for leaving. I think they where only 20 percent booked! In my opinion, I would stay at the cliff resorts and take business elsewhere due to there rudeness, lack of selection of food. Good for maybe a night and surf session, don't waste your time here more than that thou. To bad that this was one of my less memoriable experiences in Bali. Head west and avoid the kooks there.Tom34, San Diego.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR171374668", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mesaloc"}, {"Content": "Son unos ladrones con avaricia   showReview(13164515, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR534420674", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Castordeepblue"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303953-d633540-r8738771-Uluwatu_Resort-Uluwatu_Bali.html", "HotelID": "633540", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
