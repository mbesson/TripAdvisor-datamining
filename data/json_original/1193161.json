Aside from the very last morning at 6:30 when the water was acceptably hot, it did not get more than lukewarm. And this while air temperatures were down to nearly zero at night in this uncharacteristically chilly April. On one of these nights the heat in the hostal was not turned on. I alerted the manager, who suggested that many people had been using the hot water that morning, but even at off-peak hours, it was only tepid at best. There were in any case hardly any guests besides us. Unfortunate because the establishment is otherwise clean and friendly and the location is perfect. At this price-point I don't expect luxury, but a reasonable supply of hot water is not too much to ask for, I think. Next time I will seek accommodation elsewhere in the same area.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, Italy", "Title": "\u201cClean, Safe, Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "CarlyAlexandra", "ReviewID": "UR126724020", "Content": "Great location right by Sol, the city center. The hostel was so clean and the staff couldn't be more helpful. They gave us maps and were available in the hostel at all hours, unlike other hostels where the staff in no where to be found. We got the room for 35 eur for the night last minute, and it was a great value in my opinion.

The rooms are not flash but quite neat. The receptionist is helpful and can speak good English, even booked a taxi for us for the next day when we had to leave at 4am to get to the airport. The hostel is very close to the metro, literally 2 mins walk. The area is ok, at night is full of dodgy people on the streets and outside the metro but seemed harmless. Maybe just dont walk around by yourself. I lost my camera in madrid and have a feeling it was stolen from my handbag in this area as it can get a bit busy, The place is only a few stops to the city. Very close to La Latina, good for tapas... very lively place. The only problem we had was that we got to Madrid pretty early 7am and the hostel didnt open til around 9am. No one opened the door even when we kept pressing the door bell, We had to wait around 2 hours in a cafe. Otherwise good hostal and will probably stay again.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFor the price - excellent value and location\u201d", "Author": "CoxG", "ReviewID": "UR47718634", "Content": "Friendly owners and although the hotel was pretty much full - didn't have a problem with queuing for the shared bathroom.

Its on the fourth floor (has a lift) so when looking for it on the street look up! The owners and staff were lovely. It is not a fun hip hostel so if thats what you want stay elsewhere but it is perfect for a couple or for a nice relaxing and quiet stay. We had a plasma flat screen TV too!
