{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Small, simple hotel close to beach We stayed 6 nights here with our family with 2 kids aged 4 and 5 in August 08 after arriving from the airport. We rented an Ambassador Suite with 2 large bedrooms, 2 bathrooms with bath and shower and a living room.The hotel is quite small in the Southern end of Sanur, but was in walking distance to the centre of Sanur. It was on a quiet road very close to the beach (1 minute walk).We thought the value for the price was great. We paid around USD 50 for the family including taxes, high season surcharge and continental breakfast.Although most people seemed to only use the kitchen for breakfast, the Indonesian fare on the menu was very modestly priced but surprisingly good.The swimming pool was large, with a shallow end - great for kids. The service was friendly and good. We saw many families with (smaller and older) kids.In sum, a great bargain! 2 things that could be improved - the continental breakfast was very simple indeed and the ground floor apartments are a little dark (but that is quite normal in Bali).", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR471720909", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cwolf22"}, {"Content": "Sympatique hotel familial   showReview(22262727, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR604693322", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "danjov"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d1153442-r19629589-Hotel_Palm_Garden-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1153442", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
