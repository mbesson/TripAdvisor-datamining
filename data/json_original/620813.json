{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cheap but no where near cheerful A ground floor apartment. Well heated in winter. Meanly furnished and not cleaned properly. The towels were old but freshly supplied but just couldn't be sure about the bed linen and that is an uncomfortable situation. The last guests had left their mark - in the toilet bowl, so that certainly hadn't been cleaned. Meanness and cheapness ran through the grain of the place and we were relieved to leave. Now we understand why they insisted on taking the full payment in cash when we arrived. Not even shower gel or shampoo in the showers. The washed plates and glasses from the last guest still on the drying rack and the waste bins unemptied. These people do not deserve to have clients and if you read this you can assist by ensuring that they do not get any more.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR937756398", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Tatsfield"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d620813-r11684119-City_Quartier-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "620813", "Price": "$123"}}
