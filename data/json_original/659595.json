We went over everything twice I was told I would have a beautiful lake view. I informed Cari that our party of 6 included my 70+ yr old Parents. First issue we noticed upon arrival is that this resort is kind of hidden and not to many places around it however shopping and dining are within a few miles or a little more depending on what your looking for. As far as our beautiful lake view, well, that turned out to be a corner unit with one view of the pool and another view of trees. I hardly had any view of the so called lake. Next issue, the lack of towels for 6 people staying for 8 days also the bare minimum of cooking pots and pans again for 6 people. Next issue, master bathroom had mold around the entire shower area.All this was discussed at time of booking and I was assured that \"you will not have any problems here at all \" . Next issue, 3 of those nights we had someone above us banging, clanking and running what sounded like a vacuum cleaner in the middle of the night sometimes at 2am. I had to call security about the constant noise level above us. I must say that most of the issues with towels and pots & pans and the mold they took care of pretty quick. One of our toilets was flushing really slow and plugging from just a few squares of toilet paper, maintenance had to come a few times to correct problem.On our last day the pool was closed for some issue that we had no clue what it was. The game room is a joke, there are about 3-4 arcade game that are outdated and work intermittently. The 2 billiard tables are another joke, the Que balls have huge chunks missing from them. All Star Vacations refund us $260 for our troubles. We feel they could have refunded us more for our troubles but during the middle of the week Cari gave me an ultimatum to pack up and leave that day with a full refund or shut up and enjoy all the crap we misled you to stay here. When I'm paying a premium price and I'm told wonderful things about the property and their not up to the expectations I was led to believe, well I think anyone else would also be unhappy about that. If you do decide to stay here, make sure you go over everything or get it in writing and make sure you get the very top floor if you don't want any noise issues from above. The good about this place is that the condo was pretty clean and service was pretty good for problems. They did offer to move us into a smaller condo with one less bed for the lake view but we needed that extra bed for us. I would recommend other places before I would stay here again.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cReturning in June!!!\u201d", "Author": "humblebee4", "ReviewID": "UR126649697", "Content": "I can't wait to return June 15-19, 2012.

The decorating is so pretty, and not all outdated like a lot of other vacation homes that you get when you need a full kitchen and laundry room. The countertops in the bathroom and kitchen are granite and the fixtures are all very nice. It's super clean. I've read reviews about bad housekeeping and ant problems but we have never experienced anything negative at all. There is no daily housekeeping but you get a free mid-week stay if you stay 6 nights. But there are plenty towels and soap and such to last a week. And since there's a washer/dryer, it's not a problem to wash a load if you need to. The pool is HUGE and never crowded. We've never been there and seen more than 2 people besides us. This is why it's great that it's a \"small\" resort with only 2 buildings, 5 floors each. It's very close to Disney and there are shuttles provided if you want that. We always just drive since it's so close so we can come and go as we please from the parks. Even when we don't go to Disney, we love to stay here. There are restaurants close by and it's not far from any of the main attractions. And you can't beat the price.

This trip was a splurge, so I was trying to save $. I got anxious after booking it because the pool looked super small and I found a sister resort of theirs that had a water park, but this was uncancellable at that time. Also it was more than I wanted to spend ($259/night but it was a 2 bedroom condo with 2 bathrooms) and I think you can search for owner-done rentals and get a cheaper rate. But, the reservation wasn't changeable after that. I should note that I am used to staying in 4 and 5 star resorts. They did let us check in an hour before our check in time, because the room was ready, and that was nice. The front desk people were nice. The condo was clean when we checked in. Elevators were very slow, we were on the second floor. The carpets had some stains near the dining table and that was gross. There were fake flower arrangements and a few of them had chipped ceramic pots. The rooms could definitely use touching up in terms of paint and everything - it was showing its age and the decor looked like it was issued the same for every room and needed updating. The first bedroom was SUPER TINY and had glass block windows that didn't open, the windows were connected to the hallway and it was very noisy there - and there were numerous loud guests who yelled from the hallway. It freaked us out that the windows didn't open and that room was very stuffy. It had a twin size trundle bed. This room would NOT be good for adults. The other bedroom was further in and had a king size bed and seemed clean enough. The toilet closet for the master bedroom was creepy with horribly depressing lighting so we all avoided this toilet. The master shower (which we all ended up using for no particular reason except that it was a stall shower and easier to use vs. the other bathroom which had a bathtub shower) had mold buildup around the door which grossed me out. The water pressure was HORRIBLE and I called to see if they could come adjust the showerhead to make the water pressure stronger, they said they would send maintenance, but they never sent anyone or called us to say they couldn't send anyone. The master bathroom also had a jacuzzi tub, which we were excited about. Well we used it just once, and after that there was no hot water for the 3 showers afterwards, so we all had freezing cold showers...not fun....ridiculous. The kitchen was well equipped and nice with granite counters and great storage space. The fridge and freezer were clean. The condo is well located with huge supermarkets nearby. The balcony had just enough room for a table and chairs and a side view of the fake pond. The washer and dryer were REALLY OLD and made SO MUCH NOISE when using them, we couldn't believe it. The dryer would keep going and never stop until you stopped it, there was no automatic turnoff which was odd. It was cold for us at night and we asked for extra blankets, which they brought, but they were very thin cotton blankets which didn't do much of anything. The \"resort\" ended up being jam packed and it was impossible to find parking right near the building, we just had to walk a little more. There is a deli with some foods and they will deliver to your room and the guy was super friendly. We called and got a burger with onion rings that was ok, but the grilled chicken wrap was inedible and we threw it out. We also got fried mushrooms and mozz sticks which were gross. When I finally visited the deli I was surprised at how sparse the offerings were and it was depressing in there - I bought some microwave popcorn, a beer and some gum. There were some dvds for rent but they were all pretty old. The deli people were nice. We didn't get to swim in the pool but there were some families enjoying it and it seemed fine. We were just too busy during the day and then tired when we got back to the room. There's another resort right before Lighthouse Key on the same side and it's the Holiday Inn Vacation Club or something like that. It looked really nice but the reviews sound like there's a lot of pressure to see the presentations, which is a huge turnoff. All in all, I guess I would return here if we were kind of desperate...the best thing is that there was a lot of space in the common area. But I'd like a place with a bigger pool, maybe a jacuzzi, and real room service. It kind of felt like a sub par place to stay but was just good enough for us not to feel yucky or trashy. I read enough reviews to know not to trust the free shuttle service - sounds like a complete nightmare - I did book a brand new car through Enterprise through the hotel's website, for only $35/day which was the cheapest price I could find. I definitely recommend getting your own car because you will end up spending more on cabs/getting frustrated and wasting tons of time.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geelong", "Title": "\u201cLuxury for economy price\u201d", "Author": "Pink_bear19", "ReviewID": "UR122979631", "Content": "Stayed with family here in January 2012 for a few days and loved it.

Kitchen was fully equipped with large fridge and the convenience of washer/dryer in our apartment was great. We also all managed to successfully connect to wifi without any issues. The only complaint (and it doesn't actually relate to the accommodation) is the free shuttle service to Disney. Our shuttle going out was 25 minutes late and, despite having booked, we had to call and check when we came home as he was 20 minutes late (and we weren't sure he was actually coming). He then took a large detour as he drops off at other hotels quite a way apart so it took us ages to get home. Add to this the fact that the shuttle times aren't that convenient - I think it would have been easier to drive ourselves or get a cab.

The accomodations were very nice and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to anyone wanting a nice place to stay while visiting the activities in Florida such as Disney. There were two issues that we had there though. One issue is that the WiFi wasn't very reliable at all. Even the Ethernet connections (2 total in the condo) weren't working. I needed Internet connection in case my job called me with an emergency (I'm the IT guy). I contacted the tech support and they were very responsive. Though the WiFi never really worked reliably one of the ethernet connections did start working so I used that. I had to keep the laptop at the kitchen because I only had a three foot cable. The other issue was due to the fact that the resort is next to a major highway, Rt 192. So there was the constant sound of cars and trucks going down the highway until late evening. I'm from the city (Phila., PA) so being close to a street is not a real big deal. However, one thing that I really want when I go on vacation is peace and quiet. If you want peace and quiet (like I love at Amishview Inn in Bird in Hand, PA) then you should be aware of this. The Beacon Deli on premise was very nice. They had more types of food than I thought they would. The staff there was very friendly and helpful too. They even tried to accomodate my wife when they found out that she was allergic to gluten. I thought the arcade was very lame. The games there looked really old. They used tokens instead of quarters. There wasn't really much I could play. To my surprise there wasn't even a pinball machine! For shame. How can you have an arcade without the standard pinball machine. The swimming pool was very nice. We were fortunate to be there during a time when there weren't many people at all. There was also Karaoke on Thursday nights (if I remember correctly). That was anoying to be honest since our building was next to the activities and I wanted peace and quiet. Another thing that I really liked about Lighthouse Key was its location. It was relatively close to everything. We went to Kennedy Space Center, Flights of Fantasy, Some Disney parks, The Holy Land, and restaurants. Overall Lighthouse Key Resorts was a very nice place to stay. If you don't mind the noise of cars and trucks as background noise (you are not right on the street--perhaps a couple hundred feet) then you will be very happy with Lighthouse Key.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flushing, New York", "Title": "\u201cThe best one out there!\u201d", "Author": "Cathleen K", "ReviewID": "UR117682440", "Content": "I took care of the reservations and found this place online for my dad, and stayed here also with my sisters and a friend.

Loved that we had the ability to do laundry over our vacation! Can't say enough about what a convenience this was! Although, I must say that the washer and dryer are very loud while operating. The appearance of the suite was good. You could tell that some of the furniture was beginning to wear, but nothing too serious. Loved the master bathroom, and the beds were very comfortable. Absolutely loved the balcony as we enjoyed having dinner out there with good views of the Kissimmee/Orlando area. The service was ok. Check in was easy and we were able to find our suite easily. We had our suite cleaned mid week and the cleaning job was sufficient. The resort has an awesome pool, but needs to be cleaned more often. There was one day when it felt like we were swimming in a stew of dead bugs though. This was corrected the next day. The hot tub could use some stronger jets, but overall it is still nice. I found the bar service to be slow at times. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad service - the staff is great, but they could be a little more attentive. The cable in our building was out for most of our stay (Sunday through Thursday) due to a converter box that had gone bad. The staff offered to loan out some DVD's at no extra charge and kept the pool area open an extra 2 hours to make up for the inconvenience. Nice offerings, but when you're on vacation, you expect everything to work and if not working, be fixed more quickly. The resort is beautiful and the buildings and landscaping are well maintained. The only \"eyesore\" is the abandoned construction on the property. It's not a bother, but needs to be mentioned. The theater and gym on property are also great amenities. The Lighthouse Key Resort was a great place to stay for our Disney World vacation. The price per night that we paid was definitely worth it as you get tons more than what Disney offers at their resorts for a higher price.

We normally stay on Disney property at the Animal Kingdom, Beach Club, or Polynesian Resorts; however, we planned to visit other Orlando area attractions on this vacation since we took the Amtrak AutoTrain (had our vehicle with us). After much research, we decided to stay off-property at Lighthouse Key Resort and Spa to save some money to allow for the extended vacation (May 1-17, 2011). We rented a 4-bedroom villa on the 5th floor and we were so happy that we did!!! Services: We were greeted warmly at the front gate upon our arrival and directed to the lobby concierge to hold our luggage. We arrived early because we needed to pick up another party member at the airport. En route to the airport we were phoned to let us know that our villa was ready for occupancy two hours earlier than anticipated. Prior to our arrival we were aware of the \"Green\" policy of the resort and the resultant limited housekeeping. That fact was welcome to us since we prefer to maintain our privacy during our vacations and don't feel the need to change linens/towels daily (though we had the ability to wash them between housekeeping days, as needed). The front desk graciously held several packages that were delivered to the resort for us. Each day that a package arrived, we received a phone call to alert us of its arrival and the hours available for pick-up. The front office staff were always very friendly and accommodating. The Villa/Rooms: The villa was exactly as pictured on the website! It was astonishing to note all of the care that was taken to decorate and maintain the unit! It reflected understated tropical elegance, a style similar to that done by Tommy Bahama. I won't reiterate the layout or features of the rooms since the website photos show exactly what we anticipated and found; however, I will say that the beds were very comfortable, with firm mattresses and comfortable covers (similar to what you would get on-property). Each of the bathrooms had plenty of body, hand, and wash towels. Nice quality facial soap, body soap, shampoo, and lotion were provided initially and during each cleaning in each bathroom. The two master bathrooms had jetted tubs (VitaBath, I think). I used it on one occasion, but found the jets to be too noisy late at night. They are very nice though in that the water level doesn't need to be very high in order to use it and that you can add essential oils to the bath while using the jets (unlike Jacuzzi bathtubs). Amenities: The kitchen was fantastic - Beautiful countertops, nice appliances (though I prefer gas stovetops to electric), and ample storage space. It had all of the ordinary kitchen needs: dinnerware, utensils, glassware, knives, blender, cutting board, pots/pans, potholders, towels, wash rags, a new scrub pad, handwash dishwashing liquid, and sample-size dishwasher powder. The dishwasher was a bit loud, but we just ran it when we were headed out for the day. None of us used the spa services, but two of us used the exercise facility and found it to be very well maintained with all of the essential equipment (all Precor), hand weights, and towels. We toured the theater, which was nicer than pictured online; but we didn't have time in our plans to take in a movie. All of us enjoyed the pool on three of our evenings: It was small, quiet, and restful after a long day at the parks. The sign to the pool states \"no outside food or drink allowed,\" however the poolside food establishment was never open when we visited it. We didn't need any food at the pool, but I did wonder if we were allowed to bring in something when the eating establishment was closed. I never inquired further about it. Location: We absolutely loved our location! We were about 3 miles from Disney's main gate, 10 miles from Sea World, and about 15 miles from Universal Studios. I read reviews about traffic congestion on 192, but we didn't have any issues with it during our stay. The resort was very accessible from both the Amtrak AutoTrain station and the Orlando airport. We prefer to eat at local establishments during vacations. Two dining places that we researched off-property and enjoyed were rated well on yelp.com: 1) Jerusalem Restaurant had a very authentic feel and wonderful food. Service was fast and very good. 2) Flippers, a local pizza place near Super Target was very good. I especially liked their chicken Caesar salad. The manager (owner?) was honestly concerned with customers having a wonderful meal and enjoying his food/services. DO NOT try \"Passage to India!\" I've never had such a horrible meal! Relatively expensive, yet served/prepared by people who could barely say the names of the dishes, let alone make them with authenticity. If one of our party members hadn't insisted that we stay and try it, I would have left immediately. What I liked best: Wonderful low-cost vacation off-property. Privacy Location Villa amenities Staff friendliness (They were very happy people...all of them.) What I liked least: Loud dishwasher (but we ran it while we were away) Loud laundry appliances (but it has a door to the room to shut out the noise) View from the balcony (abandoned construction- but we had hardly any opportunity to use it anyway) Overall, I would definitely stay at this resort again when visiting Disney and/or other area attractions.

We had a 3 bedroom unit. The unit itself was perfect for us as we all had our own private areas and plenty of room . The unit was like new and very clean. Nice kitchen area, bathrooms, etc.. Photos are accurate on the web site. This is a different feel than you would get at a huge resort. The place is relatively small. Pool and \"club house\" areas were nice, but nothing over the top. Reasonably laid back and quiet, a good place to decompress after the intensity of the parks. They have a bar and a small deli at the pool which was nice. The gym is also decent sized with a good range of equipment. We also used the pool tables and had fun. No cost for any of this except for drinks/food which were very reasonable (i.e. not Disney-like). The location is decent in proximity to Disney given that you have to drive (we did not use the shuttle). It took us about 20 minutes door to door (30 minutes to Universal). Not a big deal. There is some traffic and a bunch of lights on 192 (the road that the property sits on). The last day we took 429 (highway very close to the property). That is probably a quicker way to go (avoids most of the lights), but you have to pay $1 for a toll. We were able to get low season rates because we booked the week prior, this made what would have been a very good value an excellent one. The property and adjacent area itself can be pretty or ugly depending on which way you are facing. Nice lake and view from the pool. However, it looks like they stopped construction at roughly 20% of the units when the crisis hit. As a result there is are large open lots, not landscaped in any way. This takes away form the place a little, it will be much nicer whenever they finish the whole thing, but this will also make the central areas more crowded (you are able take advantage of this now). Also, you have a nice view of the trailerpark-esque community that sits maybe a quarter of a mile away. We had debated staying on property at Disney or Universal, but that would have either left us in very cramped quarters (not good with teens) or been prohibitively expensive.

The property has two large swimming pools. Oh ladies, you can enjoy the spa while your husband enjoys the pool. The kids can gain exposure to the huge arcade room. This place can be compared to a palace with the palace hospatality. There were days I didn't even want to explore Orlando- but just stay indoors.

I will never even consider staying anywhere other than Lighthouse Key Resort when in the Orlando Area. Cons and Least Like: The day I had to depart!

It did start out bumpy and I was mad; however, Eric at the front desk went out of his way to help us out. Here's the break-down of our stay: The Room: To make a long story short, our top floor room we reserved in March was given away, and they placed us in a third floor room. I was not happy about this at all! I don't know who is to blame... someone at the front desk or the reservation people. We reserved a 4 bedroom 3 bath room. We had the paperwork with the room number we reserved on it, and the room was given to someone else earlier in the week. I had read reviews on here about hearing the people above you. We were placed on the third floor in the same type of room. The reviews about hearing the people above you are very true, but it's not too bad. (If you are sensitive to sound like I am, it will drive you nuts.) Luckily, the people above us had kids so when we got back each night they were asleep. The downfall is they were up every morning by 7:00am sounding like they were running a marathon... needless to say, I was awake too... That's why I wanted the 5th floor! Eric at the front desk was very nice though, since we didn't get what we paid for, he comped us a night and refunded our early check in (because our room wasn't ready on time.) We were also given a free lunch for our entire group (we had 8 people) at their deli while our room was getting cleaned. The sandwiches were very good. The Internet: This was another complaint I saw on here. When I tried to hook up to the wireless it did not work. I called the number the front desk told me too, and got the same story of \u201cwe have an engineer working on it\u2026\u201d They told me to call back in an hour if it wasn\u2019t working, so I did. This time I talked to someone who knew what they were doing. My Windows was blocking out their server, we did a few quick settings changes and it worked perfectly! I called back the day we left to change the settings back to normal. Cleanliness, Value, and Location: This place is very clean and nice. It is practically new and is kept up well. Since we stayed a week, we had a complimentary cleaning on Wednesday. I believe this resort was well worth our money! It is near Disney and SeaWorld. There are grocery stores nearby; we went to a Publix that was a mile up the road. There are lots of restaurants too nearby. I would highly recommend this resort. Just beware you may not get the room you request. The Spa: My niece and I got pedicures the Tuesday of our stay. The spa is very nice and clean, and our toes turned out great! The spa staff was very nice and friendly.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockbridge, Georgia", "Title": "\u201c2nd Stay\u201d", "Author": "landry1", "ReviewID": "UR69585518", "Content": "Last year our family took a sort of reunion trip to Disney and we stayed at Lighthouse.

Our only complaints this trip was that we were given a room with an inoperable jacuzzi tub which was something my husband and I enjoyed on our previous stay. Also the knob on the dryer in the laundry room had to be manuvered to work and once the dryer started it was very loud. We called the front desk but no one ever came to check on it. Also, we noticed that every music channel was available except for BET which we would have like to watched at some point. Lastly, the young lady who checked us in was not friendly at all. She did not give us a list of amenities or services as her co-worker was doing with another couple checking in at the same time. Although we were returning customers, I feel she could have been more welcoming.

We used our II membership and traded into a 2B/2B. Reading that the 2nd bedroom had a twin bed w/ a trundle, we contacted the resort and they allowed us to buy up to the 3/3 for a reasonable fee. We booked this resort before our previous trip to Orlando In Oct of 2009. When we arrived in Orlando, we visited the Resort just to check it out. The staff allowed us to tour one of the suites, as well as walk around. What we saw was impressive and we where excited. Let me say that not many resorts will allow you to do a quick, self guided tour, this was truly awesome of them. Suite Condition ~ Gorgeous d\u00e9cor, very, very clean. Everything was brand new. This resort is breathtaking! The rooms are huge, and I mean huge. It is a quiet resort. We never heard our neighbors, but we were on the top floor. 3b/3b ~ consists of 2 master bedrooms and a 3rd bedroom with 2 twin beds: Master bedroom # 1 ~ King size bed, a desk w/a lamp that has a DSL plug, flat screen TV (had to get that serviced, which they fixed the next day while we where at the park), nice bathroom with private toilet, double sink w/typical counter space, Jacuzzi, glass wall shower, large walk in closet and a dressing area with full length mirrors. Master bedroom # 2 ~ King size bed, (no desk here as the space saved went to the bathroom) flat screen TV (we had to re-set this TV nightly by unplugging and plugging it back in), big bathroom with private toilet, double sink in a very large vanity with draws galore (very nice!), Jacuzzi, glass wall shower, large walk in closet and a dressing area with full length mirrors. Bedroom # 3 ~ compared to the other rooms, this one is much smaller, it has 2 twin beds, not many draws and the closet is smaller. There is a TV. Beds & pillows ~ high quality and very comfortable. We all got great nights sleep every night. Kitchen ~ very well appointed. beautiful counters, cabinets and appliances. We lacked nothing in the very large kitchen. There is an island where the sink and dishwasher are. Island also had a counter w/stools and a DSL plug. Living room ~ one couch and 2 chairs. Very pretty, but would have preferred 2 couches for a 3b/3b unit. Nice big flat screen TV. Patio ~ decent size patio w/table and chairs. It is not screened in. We had a view of a lake, Orange Lake Resort (their poolside activities are all we heard during the week. Sounded like they were having a great time over there, not bad/too loud). In the distance, each night we could see the Epcot fireworks at 9p and Magic Kingdom's at 10p. Laundry room - there is an actual laundry room. This allowed us a place to put our dirty clothes before we got around to washing them in the full size w&d. They did supply a small amount of detergent. We have learned to bring our own and drier sheets. Timeshare presentation ~ we were never asked. Check-in/out ~ service was immediate! Service ~ everyone was nice. Not outgoing, but pleasant. Pool area ~ clean, quiet and not very crowded. The pool area has 1 hot tub, 1 U-shape zero entry pool that was a perfect temperature, and 1 smaller lap pool that is cooler. There are no other outside activities, so if you like lots of activities, you will not get it here. There is an ice-cream/sandwich shop and a pool side bar. For this reason they allow NO outside drinks or food. I think this ends up hurting them. If you let people bring in snacks and non-glass/non-alcohol drinks, others that may not have any will see, get hungry/thirsty and buy. Activities ~ There is a theater for watching movies. We never used this. Fitness Center ~ Very nice. Big with a wide variety of equipment and free weights. I used it almost every morning and never encountered more than 1 or 2 other people at a time. Wi-Fi ~ this is where they need improvement. We had poor Wi-Fi. We got the resort across the lake (Orange Lake) better than Lighthouse Key's Wi-Fi. We finally had to borrow a DSL cable from the front desk. There where only 2 places to plug in, a plug on the kitchen island, this is in a fine location, but it did not work. The other was in the lamp on the desk in the 1st Master Bedroom, this is the only place we could get consistent, reliable to Inet service. Business Center ~ well appointed. Printed out 5 boarding passes in 3 minutes. Grounds ~ Resort is on a lake. It appears by the scale model they have they plan on putting in a beach, for now it is a marsh that you cannot go to. There is not much landscaping, but what is there is pleasant. Location ~ About 30 min's and 2 tolls from MCO (bring about $5 in change to drive to & from the airport, and a bit more if you plan to go to the beach). 5-10 min's to WDW, 20-30 min's to Seaworld and Universal. No tolls to get to the parks. Resort is on the west end of Irlo Bronson, so it is a little farther to restaurants than most of the other resorts on this busy, tourist strip. Summary ~ This Resort is Spectacular. We love to try different resorts, but we really want to get back here as soon as the timing works in our favor. NOTE - this is a Timeshare. You may or may not get items like coffee, soap & shampoo and there is no housekeeping unless you pay for it (we did get a mid week housekeeping service that included making the beds). This is no reason to grade them low.

We have been travelling the US for 2 weeks, and viewed this as a \"refresher with our own space again\". The rooms are large, and everyone has their own space here, which is great. Everything is fresh and new. The gym is excellent, the pool is great too, and there is an excellent games room. For families this place is excellent, and particularly excellent value for money. It is close to everything. Disney is 15 minutes (dont bother with that though, read my review on disney), NASA an hour, Discovery cove 20 minutes, and there are shops everywhere, with food galore. The negatives, and these are our experiences. We had a bottom floor unit, and the elephants upstairs were the biggest annoyance. It is hard to understand why a building that is a resort wouldnt be constructed with slab floors. We found this very annoying, as you could hear everything from upstairs. I did compain, and could have been moved to the top floor, but I declined as the persons were moving out that day. So if you are staying, request a top floor. The other really annoying thing was the wireless internet. It is not up to scratch, and the resort \"doesnt handle their internet service\". So you have to deal with their provider. We had 2 PCs, and neither could work at the one time. We spent 50 minutes waiting before we gave up. Then tried later and spoke to someone \"well get an engineer to look at it and call back\". No call back, and it wasnt fixed. I just went and got a cat5 cable, and we used cable the time we were here. I normally judge all places by \"would I come back\".

It takes forever to get into magic kingdom when you dont have a Disney bus drop you off up front. The other parks are not so bad and I dont think it would have been so bad if it was not such a busy weekend.

The pool area was nice with plenty lounge chairs available. There's a poolside bar, as well as, a deli/store. We were given our room assignment and rode over to Building 1. We decided to keep the luggage inside the car since we didn't see a luggage cart. When we got to our room we noticed the latch lock was placed on the outside so the door wouldn't close all the way. We hesitated but pushed to door open. To our surprise, the room was occupied. We apologized to the guest and proceeded back to the front desk. The elevators aren't air conditioned. We told Eric of our problem. He gave us another room. I must also mention that my brother and his family travelled along with us and was first given an occupied room also. We got to our room. I must say I was impressed. It was nice 3BR/3BA. The room was clean and well stocked. The patio area was also nice. We were on the 5th floor and did notice a trail of ants out there. This is a minor problem that didn't bother me. The kids enjoyed their time at the pool between theme parks. We also played billiards in the gameroom. The gameroom also had a handul of arcade games along with an air hockey table. XBOX 360 consoles are available at the front desk with a credit card hold. You must bring your own games or rent them from the onsite deli/store for a fee of $5/day. They also rent DVDs for that same price. Besides being sent to an occupied room, my gripe came on Wednesday when we were due to have a complimentary mid-week cleaning and restocking by the housekeeping staff. On Thursday, I called the front desk to inquire about this to Eric who said he would radio housekeeping to check the status and get them over to us. Well, Friday came but housekeeping didn't. I called the front desk and requested to speak to a manager and was told that one wasn't available. I went on the tell them that I wanted fresh towels. They bought them over right away and called to confirm that it was done. Otherwise, I didn't have any major issues. Everyone we came in contact with in passing offered a smile.

The condo looked just like it does on their website. It was super clean and non of the 'complaints' on here seem justified to us. The ant problem must of happened at some point as a man did come in mid-vacation to treat any potential recurrence but we didn't see any. The kitchen is large so can appear somewhat understocked. As for the area not being too good - it seems to us to be up and coming with plenty of new restaurants and supermarkets. (Longhorn steak house had people queuing out of the door every night). There were a couple of old motels which should be pulled down now but other than that it was super. From the condo to Disney parks was appoximately at 10 minute drive, depending on traffic - the 192 can get busy. There was a shuttle service to the parks included in the $7 a day resort fee but the schedule didn't suit our needs. You do have to pay $12 parking at the parks daily so some people may wish to consider this. The pool and pool area was clean and well maintained.

While out shopping, we got the call the unit was ready and upon arriving, we discovered a plate of maple syrup under sink on the bottom of cabinet. There wasn't any dish detergent, dishwashing soap (were told there would be), no potholders or dishtowels and therefore had to use bathroom towels, and also, the tile floors were sticky. We called the front desk to complain about the syrup, floors and pillows, and were told by the clerk that she gave out the last pillow the day before and someone would come up to clean the floor...which he did and trust me, he spoke very good English. So there were 4 adults using 3 pillows - and one of the guys gave his wife his pillow and used the big round bolster pillow and suffered a stiff neck the next day!

So after a sleepless night, and eating in shifts, we stopped at the front desk before heading out and asked to speak to a manager. The clerk said the manager wasn't in and asked if she could help. We said no because we didn't get anywhere with the front desk and wanted the manager. She said he would be in the next day and gave us his card. We didn't stay at the resort that night and called the front desk upon arriving back at the resort and called the front desk asking to speak to the manager as we wanted to complain. When the manager came on the phone, we asked him to come to the unit and gave him a list of what was wrong. He apologized and said that the \"no more pillows was no excuse\" as the front desk clerks could have left the desk and gotten more pillows. To try to make amends for our atrocious first night, the manager threw in an extra cleaning and changing of sheets. We went out for the day and came back to 6 pillows and a cleaning which included a large frying pan and also dishwasher soap. We also had to call down a few days later after housekeeping had cleaned the unit that day for more toilet paper as both bathrooms were almost out and there weren't any other rolls left. Also, the website said this was a \"Mike Ditka Resort\" and we found out from the manager that only 4 units in the whole resort were managed by his company.

We had some concerns reading reviews here, but saw enough positives that nothing else lured us away. We were disappointed to be given a 1st floor unit, and told no other was available. We had 2 other disappointments which I will talk about later in this review. Overall, we were all extremely happy we chose to stay here! The pictures you see are true to what the place looks like. The pool area is spacious, and the little store is cute and has some limited food. The game room overlooks the pool area and is a good idea for rainy days. We found the location to be easy access to Disney (thanks to a shortcut we found on a Disney website). Being right next to Orange Lake Country Club makes it very easy to find first time in. We don't mind the busy 192 area that someone else complained about, because our shortcut made travel to the park easy. You are very close to Animal Kingdom at this location. The staff was great. From check in to everyone we ran into, they were all friendly and accomodating. Special note- the woman at the gate was just so friendly and always so happy, it was a delight to drive in and see her there. The accomodations were lovely, and extremely spacious. As an extended family traveling with 5 adults and a 6 yr old, we appreciated all the space we had here. The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans, utensils, though as a previous poster noted, there are no teflon type pans. Also there were no dish towels, so do bring a couple of your own. We were lucky, being Florida residents we drove and could bring whatever we felt we needed. There is a Publix very close by, and a short distance away there is a Walmart on Rt 27 that we went to, it wasn't far. If you stay more than 4 days you are given a mid week \"refresh\" of linens, towels, papergoods, but we passed on that. We'd rather have no strangers in our room and make our own beds. :) (no daily maid service, though I think you can request for additional charge) We did get one call to go to a time share presentation at 8:30am to save $100 off bill, but we passed- simply no time with our Disney visits. No pressure whatsoever. Our two issues: 1) No bedspreads on the twin beds. It made the room look \"unfinished\" and just not right. When we asked we were told they did not have any to put on. Upon checkout, we spoke to the manager about this and he indicated they are going to be moving to the look many hotels have- fresh white linens on the bed, no spread, just a mini spread (sorry I dont know what they are called though I have seen them) at the bottom of the bed. That's great- but when you have someone walk into their bedroom for the first time, it is a disappointment as it is. (side note- most of the units have trundle beds in the 3rd bedroom so be sure to request the units with twin beds if you have an adult or are concerned about trundles.) 2) Wi-fi. Access was ridiculous. You MIGHT get in, but could never stay in. They give you a number to call for problems, and you stay on hold for 30 mins with no one coming on.. We made calls on 3 different days and finally gave up in frustration. The manager did say that they are thinking of getting some wires so people could connect hard wired if they have issues, but that didn't help on this visit when 2 of our party needed access for work. The only other somewhat negative comment is that the living room seating is for 5 people. A 3 bedroom unit should have enough seating for everyone. (6 at least) Since we were mostly at the parks it wasn't as important this time, but a return trip would hopefully include more relaxation time Our issues did cause some frustration, but overall were small issues when you look at the big picture. No place is perfect, and these issues don't make us feel negatively about Lighthouse Key at all.

The 4 bedroom condo was wonderful. The rooms were very spacious and the beds were very comfortable. There are flat-screen tvs in every bedroom and a very large one in the living room. The 2 main bathrooms are quite large, with separate areas for toilet/shower/bath/sink and the third bathroom was compact (in comparison) but was fine. The front desk staff was very friendly and quite accommodating to several special requests we made. The bar and deli staff were also quite friendly, and the deli guy (from NY) makes THE BEST deli sandwiches we have ever tasted...at very affordable prices. We ate two nights at the deli, poolside, and it was quite pleasant. The units all have wifi...which worked perfectly while we were there. Recommendations to management: These were fairly minor details, but things that could easily be \"fixed\" to make the units even better. 1. There is one small trash can in the kitchen and a miniscule one in each of the three bathrooms in the \"toilet\" room. PLEASE add some trashcans to the bedrooms!! 2. The living room has a nice size sleeper sofa and two simple chairs. There is plenty of room, and we would have really liked, to also have a loveseat or an additional small sofa in the living room. The chairs are just not that comfortable. 3. There were a couple of lamps in every room, but I think they all had 25 watt bulbs in them. We purchased higher-wattage bulbs for the stay, and it would be nice if you used the higher-wattage bulbs in all the lamps and overhead lights. Again, these are relatively minor issues.

Our view was fantastic as we could watch the sunrise each morning over Orange Lake and its resort. Most nights we watched the fireworks (from our balcony) at Magic Kingdom and Epcot (and over the entire week, we witnessed the hatching of 2 baby cranes below us, along the shoreline). The heated outdoor pool and hot tub were great, but the kids especially enjoyed the arcade, the movie theatre, and billiard room. Because we had booked through a time share company (and had agreed to do a 90 minute time share tour), our rate was half price! The tour was not at the Lighthouse Key however, so the place we toured looked like a dump compared to the Lighthouse. We were very impressed with the layout of the rooms, the decor, the 4 tvs and the use of an XBox for the week. The pool deli shop rents the games for $5, so the kids enjoyed that. The resort was very clean, with well manicured lawns and friendly staff. Mid week, our room was cleaned and tidied, with fresh towels, soaps (and our dishes were washed too). Very close are grocery stores like Target and WalMart, and the roadways are very well marked and attractions are very easy to get to. Lighthouse Key Resort will be a tough act to follow! One final note, the resort has 2 buildings so far, with a total of about 80 units. A model of the resort is found on the second floor above the lobby, which shows that the resort has grand plans to continue into the next phase of development, with several more buildings planned for sometime in the future.

For us this is a great, economical location for a long weekend at the Disney parks. It is absolutely more cost-effective than staying on property plus it is a condo so you can put the kids down for an afternoon nap without having to tip-toe around the hotel room. The drive to the various Disney parks took approximately 20 minutes in the off-season. Pros: It was clean and brand new. Easy access to the parks. Absolutely no solicitation regarding the purchase of a timeshare unit. Cons: We rented a two bedroom however the second bedroom had a twin bed with a trundle. Unfortnateley we had assumed that the second bedroom would have two twins that could be pushed together similar to what we experience when we rent a condo at the beach. So keep that this in mind. Also, there are only 2 buildings that have been completed the rest is just flat land where they stopped building. Didn't impact our stay at all but it shows you the impact of the recession. As for the comments in previous posts, we did not see any ants but also would not expect to see ants in Feb. You will notice that those posts were from summer stays which is the rainy season and, thus, probably the cause for the Nearby construction would also stir up ants. As for the comments regarding lack of daily maid service, we initially had concerns about this as well because the condo we rent at the beach has daily maid service. I got over it when we were told by a friend who has a timeshare that the once a week maid service is standard for timeshares. Oh well. We were there for 3 days so we simply put the towels in the washer and dryer. The facility does provide a single use supply of TIde (and diswasher detergent as well). If we were to come again, for longer than a weekend, I would bring detergent from home (or buy at a local grocery store). We weren't able to access the wireless internet but also didn't try contacting the phone number given to us at check-in if we were to have trouble connecting. The cable channel line-up is limited. They assume that since you are on vacation that you won't need your monday morning dose of CNBC or Bloomberg. We didn't try the spa but I have heard from others here locally that it is very nice.

Our purpose was to stay 5 nights while visiting Disney World, and another night due unforeseen airport issues that arose at an airport hotel. Everything at the Lighthouse Key Resort and Spa was fabulous. There were seven in our party. Service was great. They were prompt and answered our needs whenever we called. The address is 8545 Irlo Bronson Way. They aren't the ones that have the Mike Ditka website. I believe perhaps Mike Ditka's is the same condo location - but it's contracted out to a different service office - perhaps some of the units are owned and serviced by Mike Ditka's and some are owned directly by Lighthouse Key Resort and Spa. The service - we confirmed, is on-site where we stayed. The three bedroom Grandview was spacious, we had two ECVs that were needed but did not require a handicap room. And there was still plenty of room for our party. We saved hundreds of dollars by shopping at the local grocery, and still were able to eat out for signature dining events special events at Disney. We rented two cars from Kissimee. Once you know where you're going, getting there is truly a breeze. Traffic really isn't all that bad, and we went at peak holiday season. There were no problems getting into the park - unlike the rumors they didn't close once on us. Tip - get to the park early at opening or pre-opening if possible, and use the FastPass. Also, www.touringplans.com or one of the other tour guide plans, e.g., www.tourguidemike.com that you can find on the websites can help to plan out the best times to go to which rides and to prioritize ones that suit your needs is essential. Mousesavers.com was also helpful, and Disboards.com too. Can't say enough about the place, it's gorgeous, clean, saved $, did own laundry for free (there is a washer and dryer in the 3-bedroom condo unit). Also note - the service for cleaning/towels is on the 4th day or so. We'd read some of the reviews so we bought a roll of paper towels and 4 rolls of toilet paper to prepare. I also had bought a box of tissues mid-week just in case. We bought our own powder laundry detergent and powder dishwasher detergent. There is a one-time use only powder detergent that comes with the unit until you can go out for more. Honestly, for the seven people, there isn't really a comparison to on-site in terms of the space, value, and luxury of the place. We played billiards the first night we got there for a few minutes, and we used the two master suites and whirlpool tubs and showers. The decor is really wonderful. Wish we had time to go in the pool, whirlpool, but were really at DIsney. We did ask for toilet paper on the day they cleaned because there wasn't a refill in one of the 3 bathrooms, and they were accommodating right away. We read about the ants review and kept everything clean - it is the South so there will be more ants there - we didn't have problems keeping everything clean (rinse then dishwasher the dishes, don't leave out the maple syrup on the counter). Once after having orange juice, waffles, toast and eggs for breakfast we did see four ants near the sink/syrup when we returned - but some of the maple syrup had been on the counter, which is understandable. After that there was nothing. The trash, you can take out daily there was a common trash disposal area nearby outside in the hallway, we made sure that if we left trash in the trashcan in the kitchen for the day it was tied so it wouldn't be open food, but we pretty much just took it out daily (down the hall outside) and there were no problems at all. We did get a call about the timeshare, but we said no and were left alone. On the balcony of one of our suites we were able to see the Epcot fireworks our first night in, which was cool. After that we spent much of our time at the parks. From my point of view and the description in the AAA tourbook, this is a Condo rental, so you would expect it to be like a condo rather than a hotel, but there is on-site personnel there, so it's better than what we might expect.

Then the keys were \"disconnected\" 3 days, and they took almost and hour to bring new keys so we can enter our villa. Another thing is that they have charged us one extra night, that we paid when we made the reservation.

I had read a few reviews on this website (after I had already booked- lesson there I think) about problems with housekeeping but as some of you will probably think too , I hoped that people were being over particular.After 3 days of the same towels we went to reception to find out what we could expect from them.They told us towels would be changed every 3 days and I assumed linen after a week.Well I was wrong everything was hit and miss and when I complained was told that I was receiving this quality of service because I booked from England via a website not directly and the only way they could offer such a good deal (believe me it wasn't that good) was to do so by not offering a proper maid sevice.I was told I could get one but would have to pay. I complained and eventually as a gesture they offered to provide linen the following day. Once again a promise they did not deliver upon until we complained again. As I read this sounds like this is all we did but the standard of customer service was atrocious made worse because standards in USA are generally excellent. Anyway to cut a long story short after an infestation of ants (that really didn't seem to faze anyone so I assume must be a common problem)and just when we thought this truly could not get any worse on the last day we had to pay a resort fee that amounted to \u00a350 for the provision of such excellent facilities!

The accomadation is fantastic with good ample size living space and everything you could need. When we arrived we checked in the staff are very helpfull and informative. The pool is actually smaller than it looks on the web site but it certainly did the job to cool off and relax after a long day at the disney parks! You also had no trouble getting sunbeds as there are plenty and while we were there it never actually got that busy, there were always plenty of clean towels and the pool area is imaculate, there is also a small pool and a small hot tub, the pool area is open till 11pm. There is a small deli (shop) by the pool area which sells all you need if you dont manage or forget something at one of the bigger supermarkets nearby. You can also get drinks for by the pool there if the bar area is not open. The shop rents dvds and x box games at 5$ a night not a great choice but if you want something for an evening in its fine. The resort does state that there are x boxes in all the appartments but when i enquired as to where ours was we were told they have now been taken out of all the rooms because they kept getting pinched! We were given one from the front desk which you can keep till you check out. The bar area is nice and the staff are friendly and they make fantastic smoothies. Both the bar and the deli provide food like sandwiches, salads, paninis, pizza or burgers for a poolside snack they are not cheap but the sandwiches are huge! The resort provides a free newspaper (usa today) delivered every morning, the only negative i had which really was not a big issue was the housekeeping, when we arrived the appartment was spotless but you do not get them everyday (i think it was every three days) and they letterally just make the beds (not change sheets) and clean the bathroom area. But whenever they came to us it was always late afternoon when we were there so i told them not to bother as i dont like it when im there and im sure they only done it at that time to get tips! They do do a service where you can have the beds changed and a full clean including hoovering but they charge and i thought it was expensive for what they do so i made full use of the laundry room myself which was great as i came home from a three week holiday without spending two days washing as i had none. The resort is not far from everything and the trip to most disney parks never took us more than 20 mins. The Wal mart is about 20 mins away aswell but just 2 mins away is a Publix supermarket which sells everything you need and was no more expensive than the bigger chains, there is also a Walgreens pharmacy opposite the resort which again is like a supermarket it sells everything including milk and is open 24hrs. There is a Mcdonalds opposite and a lovely restaurant called Hoolihans which served fantastic food, there is also a pizza hut next door and hundreds of other eateries just minutes away. On the whole i really enjoyed my stay here and would return, i had a pedicure in the spa but did not have the time to try anything else but my experience was nice they were very friendly and profesional, the spa treatments were not cheap but no more expensive than you pay at home and certainly a well needed bit of relaxation time! There is also a gym but i certainly did not have time to use that but it looked well equiped. The apartments are well kept and the air con is a welcome relief there are also ceiling fans in all the rooms for a bit of added extra. The kitchen area has everything you need if you want to stay in and cook. We were really lucky and had a balcony area over looking the lake and every night at 10 (if we were not out) it was lovely to sit out and watch the magic kingdom fireworks with a nice cold glass of wine. All the apartments have wifi connection and both the living room and main bedroom had dvd players, all rooms had lovely big tvs. In the main building on the first floor there is a computer room next to the spa there are two computers both with internet, you need your room card to get in but they are free to use.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cInteresting Resort\u201d", "Author": "DJT...DJT...DJT", "ReviewID": "UR19124674", "Content": "This is an interesting resort as it cannot decide if it is providing hotel service or a condo service.

In the end, we chose Lighthouse Key because of amenities and price. Although this resort does not have a water park, it had everything else at a great price. The rooms are spacious and beautiful. We got a three bedroom that slept eight - if you include the pullout bed in the couch. Pefect for our two families (three adults and four children). The floor plan allowed us to spread out - with much more space than we have ever experienced at any of the Disney resorts. The bedrooms are located in the corners, with a huge living/dining area and modern kitchen. The two larger bedrooms are both master bedrooms with HUGE bathrooms and closets. The third bedroom is smaller - with just enough room for a trundle bed and a TV. The bathroom for this bedroom is located just outside in the hall. A Publix grocery store was about a mile away. We stopped the first day we arrived and loaded up on groceries. The well-stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dishes) allowed us to cook many meals, saving us hundreds and allowing us to eat much healthier than if we had eaten the standard hamburger-and-chicken-strips fare that's the staple of all Disney parks. Our 8,7, 6 and 5-year-old children loved the fact that we could swim in two pools, play in the arcade, borrow an X-Box (free - although they did put a holding charge on our credit card until we returned the system), and rent movies and games. They only cleaned the room twice in five-and-a-half days, but this was plenty for us. We were able to wash all our clothes with the washer/dryer in our condo on the last day, so everything was clean upon our return home. The deli at the resort serves great food (get the birthday cake ice cream) and the bar at the pool makes for a great way to unwind at the end of a busy day at the parks. Be prepared for the $35/day resort fee charge on top of your room rate - this seems standard in resorts in Orlando. Also, they did try to contact us for a sales pitch on a time share. But since we were out at the parks so much, they only were able to reach us once.

We stayed here for five nights in a 4 bedroom suite. It was absolutely beautiful and huge! There were seven of us, two families which included 3 teens and four adults and there was so much room. If you think the pictures look good you should see it in person! I cannot say enough about the stay. The two master bedrooms were beautiful with huge, huge bathrooms and fluffy big towels. The Queen bedroom had plenty of room and the fourth had an Xbox 360! There were five TV's! They turned down the beds, had the TV's on, closed the drapes and left lights on, when we came in at night it felt like we were home. The pool area was beautiful, the bar and food at the pool were both excellent as was the service. The couple that operate the pool and bar were very nice and my strawberry margarita was delivered to me poolside, I thought I was in heaven for a moment or two. Check in was a snap, as was check out and Tabitha and Kara were very helpful with any questions or problems. We had some straightening out to do with billing since we booked through Orbitz and had two families with two separate reservations and Tabitha and Kara were the ones to figure it out for us so we didn't have to change suites. If I had to pick I would say that the 4th bedroom is listed both on Orbitz and on the hotel website as \"twin\" set up but is really a trundle bed and when you pull it out it's separate. It leaves absolutely no room to walk in the room. We thought it would be twin beds. The only other thing we weren't crazy about was the traffic on the road the hotel was on, it was pretty heavy. We've always stayed on Disney property and didn't deal with traffic but after 20 years of doing that this year the prices went through the roof with Disney for one small room for each family so we decided we needed to change our plan.

I found it online and booked directly through their website for the best rate. We booked a 2 bedroom but were upgraded to a 3-bedroom (though we didn't need it as we only had myself, my husband and our 4 year old daughter). The kids room is small, but it has a trundle bed and my daughter loved having her own TV. There is a Nintendo 360 (I think that is what it is called!) in this room and it has it's own bathroom. The kitchen is well appointed w/ everything you could want. The 2 other bedrooms have large bathrooms attached w/ a jetted tub in each and a shower stall & double vanity. The beds are king-sized in each. The living room is rather \"proper\" not so comfy for watching the super-huge plasma/lcd tv, but it was ok for when we used it. The balcony was very nice, we had a view all the way to the Disney parks and we could see the fireworks (we were on the top -- 5th -- floor). During the day you can see the \"triangle\" of the Dolphin hotel, the \"Everest\" ride & the top of the \"Tree of Life\" at the Animal Kingdom. There were a few draw backs to staying here... it is very new and I think our unit was \"underused\" I know that is a weird complaint for a hotel but there it is. There were cobwebs in the track lighting over the bar, many lights were not working, there was a coffeemaker but no pot so we just drank instant coffee, and my jetted tub did not work--bummer! Just a few minor inconveniences, otherwise we were very pleased with the service, every staff member greeted you with a \"Hello\" and a smile, even if just passing in the hallway. The pool area is fabulous, nice workout center, an arcade for kids (and husbands & wives!!), and a movie theater showing new-to-dvd movies, I think \"Ratatouilee\" was playing one of the days we were there. The security gate made us feel super-safe as there was always sirens at least once a day, being from Maine we don't hear that very often and it was reassuring. All in all a great place to stay--one last bit--this is a \"fractional ownership\" property--where you buy more time than a timeshare but no one ever bothered us with a sales pitch or a call to attend a seminar or anything.
