{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good hotel I stayed in this hotel with a group of friends. We all thought the hotel was very good. We enjoyed the breakfast, which was of a high standard. All of us also enjoyed our stay and would return to the hotel when next in Frankfurt. The hotel is outside Frankfurt, however easy to get to via train our taxi (approx. cost of taxi 18 euro from train station). The hotel is very clean, next to the river. One may walk into Frankfurt along the river, distance approx 1.5 KM , which is a pleasant walk.

Breakfast was amazing, good for the morning after! Hotel has wonderful views if you are on the right side! Pool and sauna are also a nice relaxing. As this hotel is not in central frankfurt cab ride is chaep and train station is not far. (10-12 mins walk). The only thing that the Hotel could have done better is had AC in its rooms, as we were there in the summer it was extremely hot! Otherwise a wonderful hotel. 8/10!", "Date": "Aug 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR371825659", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "natural_mystic82"}, {"Content": "For the Business Traveler Some of the staff at Golden Tulip are exceptionally friendly and very helpful.

This was a spacious room, which was a bit on the basic / clinical side as far as furnishings were concerned. Front desk service was outstanding, with the in-house restaurant staff being rated as good to very good. The food at the restaurant was average, with the 'Argentinian filet' steak being good and the buffet generally having great selection but to be avoided due to the poor taste of the various items (this assessment was confirmed by a colleague).On the downside the rooms do not have touchtone phones available so it is not possible to make calling card calls. The laundry charges are outrageous at 2 Euro per pair of socks, 4 Euros a shirt, and upwards from there! The hotel is also pretty far from the underground (10 minutes walk, which can be miserable in winter) and there are no decent restaurants within walking distance. The sauna, pool and healthclub were all closed for the full duration that I was there.On the plus side it is located right on the banks of the Main river and there are beautiful walks all the way into Frankfurt (3 miles away) along the river bank. There is also an interesting barge lock about 100m away from the hotel that is fascinating to watch.All in all a reaosnable quality hotel at a reasonable price but a bit far away from everything.", "Date": "Dec 7, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR741385920", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Nicht beeindruckt   showReview(11668460, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR381039010", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel mit internationalem Klientel in guter Lage   showReview(11401011, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR711222004", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "ottimo per i viaggi d'affari   showReview(11392818, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR898832615", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d269071-r21931227-Golden_Tulip_Frankfurt_Offenbach-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "269071", "Price": "$210"}}
