We stayed here for the weekend of April 20th-22nd 2012 to go see Amsterdam and Keukenhof Tulip Gardens. We chose this hotel due to the reviews...unsure why they are rated so fabulous. The entrance was a little difficult to find, and walking around the area to get to it looked as if we might be staying in a third world country. The cost of the room for TWO NIGHTS was almost 350 euro....looking at this price...we thought this was going to be a pretty nice area and hotel. We were wrong. The area this hotel is located in is very shady and ghetto....not the type of neighborhood I would like to walk around in at night. There is nowhere to eat breakfast in the area (this being why the hotel charges you 15 euro per person for breakfast) except for a small Middle Eastern bakery filled with mystery meat and fish pastries. The hotel staff is not very helpful at all. They do not explain anything and upon arrival they grab a map off of the counter and circle the hotel and draw a line (this whole thing happens in about 3.4 seconds). No one explains anything and their info on where/which buses is not accurate or understandable. There are minor things like the dust and dirt on the glass area above the coffee cups, but that did not really bother me too much. Needless to say, when we do this again we will be staying in Leidesplein...it is a more open area, lots to do, many food choices and seems to be a lot safer. On a positive note, the bus runs very close to the hotel and it is only like a 150 to 200 meter walk and we were able to buy a bus/metro travel card at a good price from the hotel. Also, I guess it is positive that nothing happened to either of us on our trip. Bottom line, if you want somewhere with food choices and closer to the city with attractions....this is not the place.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, South Australia, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel just not in city centre\u201d", "Author": "Cheryll M", "ReviewID": "UR128213290", "Content": "Clean large well furnished rooms.

No over the top reception area but all you want, clean and tidy with helpful staff and good rooms. Our first quad room 251 (beware all quad rooms are by the lift - people noise occasionally a problem rather than the lifts) was rather narrow so accessing the free in room safe was quite a challenge! The beds were comfortable, the shower room clean and tidy, and tv had BBC1 and BBC2 although many channels were in English anyway. Also there was a kettle with tbags and coffee - beware - no milk! Unfortunately we were cold. Our heating / AC didn't seem to work so on the second evening we went down to reception who couldn't do anything but gave us extra covers. The following morning they kindly moved us to room 250 which was excellent. It was way more spacious with a bathroom instead of shower and slightly different layout which just worked much better. Far superior to our first room. When we checked out, our bags were stored and then when we returned in the afternoon before getting our bus to the airport, staff were more than happy to make us each a cup of tea for free which was just what we needed. There are 2 computers in the reception area so you can do your online check in for flights there. Wireless in the hotel was free and worked well in bedrooms too. Breakfast was all excellent, there were even sausages (see someone else's previous gripe!), but we tended to have the pastries, cheeses and meats and special breads. Coffee was really very good for a hotel. As hardened expresso drinkers we thought it was about the best we have had, far better than the usual insipid filter coffee. And you could have several cups with no problem. However, the fruit juice needs sorting out - orange juice was just completely flavourless. All in all, if you aren't bothered about the hotel being beautiful from the outside (it isn't) it really is very good giving you all you need for a comfortable city break.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ZAGREB", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel away from the center\u201d", "Author": "_G_o_g_a_goga", "ReviewID": "UR127535532", "Content": "The hotel is a bit away from the center but the Metro and tram are close.

Booking presented many diffculties, but we finished up at the Best Western Blue Square. The hotel was said to be cheaper because it was outside the centre. It was supposed to be a short tram or bus ride from the centre. The first problem was finding the hotel. We were taken to the Best Western Blue Tower which is about 4 tram stops away. When we arrived a visitor was being directed to the Blue Tower. Apparently it happens all the time! What on earth is the Best Western group doing with two similarly named hotels so close together in Amsterdam. An ergonomic disaster waiting to happen! The hotel is well served by bus (to Central Station) and tram (Dam Square and museum district). Each trip costs almost 3 Euros and takes 30 mins. If you want to do a tour with coach pickup then you have to be ready at least one hour before departure, again a long way out so first pick-up. Get a day card for about 7 Euros and give it lots of use on the excellent public transport system. The hotel is actually set in a fairly quiet principally Turkish area, lots of restaurants but nothing obviously tempting. Food at the hotel was acceptable both for dinner and breakfast. The choice for a la carte at dinner was a bit limited. Coffee seemed particularly good (quality and value) whether in the Restaurant or the Foyer Bar. Probably because of the prices the hotel seemed to be popular with school parties. Not really a problem but the restaurant was overwhelmed at times during breakfast. The condition of the hotel was excellent and it was well-appointed. Things seemed to work fine and it was clean The only faults I found were low flow in bath, (use the shower to fill), and broken indicator lights around the lift. The bedrooms were well-equipped, the showers particularly good. The outstanding feature was the friendliness, helpfulness and knowledge of the staff. Go for a room at the rear and ask for a bath (most have this after a tiring day in the city) On balance its a pity about the distance out, because this hotel has many good facets.

Our room was quite large with a view to the rear of the hotel overlooking a wide canal inlet. Staff were helpful in assisting us with public transport from the hotel into the city centre (approx 20 minutes by tram or bus - very easy to use - we bought a 3-day pass from the Central Railway Station).

Having arrived at the airport and then got the connecting train to the city centre, we eventually found the right tram to get us too the hotel. We were surprised by how far the hotel was from the city centre which was a problem in itself due to having to pay for a bus or tram each time we wanted to go to the centre (at cost) but probably our own fault for not looking into this more beforehand! Still worth noting though. Upon arrival at the tram stop, we soon felt like we were in the wrong part of town and probably the place locals would avoid was the impression we got.Bit like some parts of the Uk. Run down and dated buildings and lots of shops with arabic signed food shops which means travelling back to the centre if you want food. The hotel itself, from the outside, is like a soviet union communist style tower block. The room itself and general hotel decor was like a throw back to the 80s, at least decor style but was at least clean enough which for me is the top priority. The bed was good enough, the tv worked and all the lights worked. The main problem we had was noise night and day. Not from outside but from (we think) the air conditioning unit in the room which was very loud and had no obvious way of turning it off. Not great if you had planned on sleeping. We also got woken up very early one mornign when the fire alarm went off followed (10 minutes later) by a false alarm announcement. Overall a dated hotel, crap location with zero in the way of local amenities i.e. food shops, & expensive for what it is. Pay more and find a nicer hotel closer to the centre but will add that Amsterdam itself was a huge let down. Great if you go there for the 'coffee shops' but we stayed a week and struggled after 2 days to keep occupied.

The hotel is in a Turkish neighbourhood and I think this is an asset, There is a nice market in the nearby square, shops, indoor mall, restaurants and bakeries nearby. Also a Turkish supermarket on the square, you have to try the breads and olives. We like to shop and travel like \"locals\" so taking the tram and buses to the tourist spots was a pleasure.

Due to a big conference in town, the choice of hotels was slim and we had a large group to accommodate. The Blue Square would not have been our first choice as it was so far from the city centre but they were able to take all of us and the rate was quite reasonable. If you are going to be stuck on the outskirts of Amsterdam, you could do a lot worse. The #7 and #14 trams as well as the #21 bus all picked-up just a block away for a 25 minute ride into the city centre. Rooms are large and well-appointed by European standards (we stayed in a double room for two nights and then moved to a triple when part of our group headed home). The beds were spongy soft but comfy and the pillows somewhat lumpy. Lighting was okay but the bedside light which is designed to have three settings so one person can read while the other sleeps, had only completely 'off' or 'on'. It was also missing shades but a call to the front desk remedied that situation quite quickly. Lighting in the bathroom was only adequate. Housekeeping was a bit remiss. I've noticed lately that hotels are taking 'green' living just a bit too far at times. Tightening up beds using the same linens is fine with me for a day or two but leaving used utensils like coffee mugs and spoons is not. And the extra pillows we found in a cupboard were soiled with old blood spots. We left a note to have them exchanged but that never happened - nor did they ever provide pillow cases for the extra pillows. Ugh! We have to give the receptionists a hearty round of applause - it appears that their job description not only included checking people in and out but they also act as bell captain, concierge and general trouble-shooters. When we arrived our room wasn't ready and the gal at the front desk got a key and showed us to the luggage room and helped us stack our suitcases within. She later helped us to retrieve them as well. When I had a problem with my TV remote, the guy from the front desk appeared with a replacement apologizing for the wait as he had several phone calls and check-ins. They did a great job and all spoke English quite well. Breakfast is offered at the hotel but for an astounding rate of 15 Euro per person at the time of this review. We found a lovely bakery down the street and later stopped at a grocery store just off the tram line and were able to provide breakfast for ourselves for four mornings for a total of 10 Euro for all three of us. Since there was a coffee maker in the room, this was definitely worth giving up eggs and sausage for a few days! I was actually quite surprised that they charged for breakfast as most hotels I stay at in Europe include a huge breakfast with your hotel stay. A couple people in our group asked if they could just get coffee one morning and were told it would cost the whole 15 Euro to do that. A trip to the front desk and a chat with one of the 'Jack of all Trades' Receptionists provided each member of our group with some coffee gratis. One thing that can be said about the Blue Square (besides their awesome reception staff) is that they had the very best Wi-Fi I have ever had in any hotel anywhere in the world and it was gratifyingly free. If you must stay on the outskirts of Amsterdam, the Blue Square is a good choice. The tram is 2.60 Euro and you can buy your card on the tram when you board. If this is your first trip to Amsterdam and you are planning to see all the sites, buy an iAmsterdam card - they come in 1,2 and 3 day packages and not only do you get entry to most of the museums, you also get free public transportation. At the time of this review, the 3-day pass was $59 and I nearly got double the price out of it. A very worthwhile expenditure.

The hotel is in the outskirts of Amsterdam, but is only a very short tram (number 14, 7) or bus (number 21) ride away, the drivers all know where the hotel is and were quite happy to let you know when you need to get off. The hotel itself is a converted office block, hence the strange look of the place, and is much nicer on the inside than the outside. The reception area is very smart and also contains the bar, also on the ground floor is the restaurant where the buffet breakfast is a must, with fantastic choice of hot and cold food. The hotel is a doughnut shape, with rooms facing either into a courtyard, onto the street or onto a canal behind, we were in a room facing into the courtyard and was very quiet and still very private. The rooms were large and had fairly nice dark wooden furnature, not the usual cheap built in stuff that you would usually expect of a chain hotel. The bed was one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in. The en-suite bathroom was adequate, and the shower was amazing and was huge. All in all the room was fantastic and could not fault it. The only thing we were disappointed with was the evening meal in the hotel, We only ate in one night, and the choice was limited and expensive, and to be honest was not great. There is very limited places to eat without going into the centre which is worth it, as the choice is fantastic, although be prepared, amsterdam is a very expensive city. There are a number of shops in the small shopping centre next door including a small supermarket, and gorgeous bakery. As for getting around, I highly recommend buying GVB travel card which allows travel on the local trains, trams and most buses, you can buy these from reception and only arounf 18 euros for 4 days, which was a bargain, and by far the cheapest way of getting about.

However, it then exceeded my expectations.... in a really good way. My first thought after walking into the reception area was 'Fancy', a huge change from what we had been used too on our tour. When me and my boyfriend walked into our room we had been put in a room with two single beds, not that I cared too much, a hotel is only a place to rest your head. And an awesome rest it was, the beds were amazingly comfortable, and the pillows were by far the best on the trip. The bathroom was very small, but the shower was amazing, good temperature control and water pressure. Another suprise from a European hotel. The staff in this hotel were friendly and more then wiling to assist me with any questions I had. From memory they have a free wireless network in the hotel, they also had computers for free use in the reception area. So tick tick! The breakfast here was pretty good, once again, better then other hotels I had stayed in. It was right next store to an Aldi and other supermarkets, pharmacys etc, which came in handy. Despite this hotel's close proximity to public transport.... is it a long way from the center of town. It took us 25mins + to get into the center, which put a bit of a downer on trip, and was a huge pain when you were tired and ready to hit the hay. Another bad thing about its distance from the center of town, was that after the trams stopped running at about 12.30.... the options to get back to the hotel were limited. We didn't quite get the bus system, and some people we were with got ripped off by taxi drivers because we had no idea about what we were sposed to pay to get back to the hotel. So despite all it's good points, the comfort and great amenities, I was there to enjoy and experience Amsterdam, and I felt that maybe its distance from the center of town didn't allow me to take advantage of my short time there as much as I could have, or would liked to have. So if you are looking for great service, comfort, security and all that jazz at a reasonable price, this place could suit you.

The reception staff were very polite and friendly and very helpful when we had a problem with our security safe (although some were more helpful that others!)The hotel bar lacks atmosphere but is the same price for drinks as the pubs in town which i think is pretty unusual. There are no bars or restaurants nearby that are worth going to and i think that is a bit of a drawback as it meant we had to stay in the very expensive city centre. There is a supermarket close by which we did find useful. The Hotel is on a very easy bus and tram route (21 bus from central station, 14 tram from dam square, 7 tram to the Heinekin experience), just make sure to get off at plein 40-45 as this is the closest to the hotel. Also worth noting is that you can buy a transport pass from the airport when you arrive you allowing you free travel on the buses, trams and metros for the duration of you stay plus your train to and from the airport, this makes it an awful lot cheaper to get to and from the centre when you are staying a bit out of town as you are here.

Our room was never made, linen was never changed, used towels were never replaced, and the list goes on. Even the coffee pot and shelves were covered with dust. When my wife called the lobby, she was told the maid cleaned the rooms every three days. When they sent a maid to deliver fresh towels, my wife inquired again why the room was not cleaned, the maid stated they were \"very busy\" and normally clean it every day. She did offer to clean the room. Since it was past 9pm, we declined. Couldn't get a good night's sleep. People were opening and closing doors loudly during the middle of the night. Breakfast was bland and average. Comparing it to the \"three-star\" Best Western West in Oslo, the breakfasts in West totally blew away this so-called four-star buffet.

The hotel does look a bit dodgy on the outside but looks really are deceiving!! The hotel is beautifully new and spotlessly clean. The rooms were all very modern with enough space to put your baggage down- which is something to say for hotels in Europe.

There were a few works still going on but they were no problem and did not affect us. The rooms are furnished with what seems quite expensive furniture though not really my taste. It was almost like antique furniture. Staff were nice and the girl who checked us in spoke 4 different languages to different guests all very fluently. I would def recommend BSH it was a bit of a trek out of the city but easy enough. Take the 13 or 14 from centraal sit back and relax.

The building really could use a coat of paint outside. It looks pretty bad at the moment. The inside and the rooms are completed but there are some issues to be worked out. I had a dead desk lamp, the phone could not dial an outside line (fixed during stay) and the free wireless internet was not working. The room itself looked great, so did the bathroom and the view from room 288 was fantastic. I had a powerful hot shower, flat screen tv and a new bed. The hotel offers a free breakfast which I enjoyed. Hot foods were scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms and tomatoes. Fresh bread, cheese, deli meats, yogurt, fruit, orange juice and an espresso machine for coffee were also available. Tram 14 and 7 stop about a half block from the front door for easy access to downtown about a 25 minute ride each way. You can use tram stop Plein 40-45 to access the hotel.", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cNice blue\u201d", "Author": "daniu", "ReviewID": "UR19203862", "Content": "Well, getting to Blue Square Hotel from Central Station was quite a task considering it was my first time in Amsterdam. But the good tram network in the city ensured that I got to the hotel in Slotermeer within 30 minutes from the city centre. Was pleasantly surprised when they upgraded me to a double room. The hotel is very new and the room is nice and neat, with a LCD screen tv mounted on the wall. Room size was relatively big for city standards. There's free Wifi which worked perfectly, while the tv showed quite a number of european channels, including BBC! The hotel is about 20 to 30 minutes to the city by tram...tram stop is right outside the hotel. Trams 7, 13 and 14 all connects the hotel to the city. There's a neighbourhood mall just 2 minutes walk from the hotel. They have quite good stuffs there, including supermarkets, clothing stores, pharmacy, cafes etc. There's even a flea market right outside the mall on weekends. Interesting to see what Dutch people sell in their local markets. All in all, a value for money hotel, far away from the crowd of the city.
