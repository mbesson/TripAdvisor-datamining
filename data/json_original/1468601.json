I have been going there for the last 3 years and i can tell you this: for a great value in an excellent location, this beats everyone hands down. The staff at reception are great, they helped me whenever I needed directions, advice, etc. The room I stayed in was fine. It had a comfy, hot water, a sink, and even a TV. And for the price, you cant really get that in this location. Now, if you want to spend more, than you'll get more. Simple as that.

(In retrospective, there was a good reason Sipahi Hotel had rooms available when everyone else was full, as you''ll see below!) The location is not bad: the \"hotel\" (I place the word within quotes because this is at the very most a hoStel, not hotel) is on a side street close to the Cemberlitas tram stop, and just a few minutes walk from the Grand Bazaar. It is also 1 tram stop away from Sultanahmet (for the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia), 2 stops from the Sirkeci train station and 3 stops from Eminonu ferry dock. It's approx. a 15-20 minutes fast walk through the back streets to the Spice Bazaar (also called the Egyptian Bazaar). I asked for a room with private bathroom and was shown room #202, which is on the second floor, with a view to the back of the building. On the positive side, the room was light, with 2 big windows, and high ceilings. However, the 2 beds were squeezed so close together that you could hardly step between them. The power outlets seem to all be pulled out of their sockets for some reason. The furniture looked dingy. The bathroom was moldy, with rusted faucets and a shower looking so nasty, I had to use my rubber slippers to step in. On my first night there seem to be no hot water. On the second day I learned that you had to leave the water running for a VERY long time (15 minutes) to be able to get it above lukewarm temperature. Also, I quickly figured out that the shower faucet had the cold and hot water reversed (hot water is on the right, marked with a blue rather than red tag). The fact that the room is at the back of the building makes for a peaceful enough night, when the other hotel guests don't make noise banging doors or talking out loud, that is. Breakfast was standard (which means cheese, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, hard-boiled eggs), although a little on the scarce side. I only got to have breakfast there once, as I had an early flight, and despite the promise that a coffee and a small bite would be waiting for me, there was nothing. By then my expectations of Sipahi were so low that I didn't even bother to wake up the sleeping help on the lobby couch, and was just relieved to be leaving this so-called hotel. In all fairness, I need to add that the price was probably adequate (70TL), although I had seen a similar room in Sirkeci for 60TL (which turned not to be available after all). I would have preferred to pay more for better accommodation. Considering all this, it's no wonder that I was asked to pay upfront; the only place among the dozens I spent the night in all around Turkey to do so!
