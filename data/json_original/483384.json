Nice comfortable spacious rooms. Good quality of food despite 'fixed group' menus. Easy to get into Venice - I can remember getting to the Fusina terminal then catching a waterbus to St Marks (that was the case then, but since 2000 the vaporetto service goes to Zattere). Check out the up to date vaporetto timetables - with the exception of Lines 1 and 2 serving the Grand Canal, quite a few of the 'giracitta' service numbers have changed (from 2/11/11), although not a great difficulty for 'old hands' in Venice! Don't be afraid to ask the vaporetto staff for help!", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poland/Katowice", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel for few nights stay\u201d", "Author": "CatherinneP", "ReviewID": "UR116462568", "Content": "I was in this hotel last year, and I have to say, that in this price is not bad.
