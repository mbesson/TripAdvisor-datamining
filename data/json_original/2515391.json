There are actually 2 Holiday Inns on Aurora Ave., so some of the other reviews I've read are meant for the other one, as this is not close to the Space Needle or downtown like the other hotel.

We were offered the use of the breakast area off the hotel lobby for our birthday gathering of 13, but ended up in one of the rooms to have birthday cake, and that worked out fine for our group of ages 1-1/2 to 87. The 12-yr. olds loved the small pool. My husband and I used the fitness center, which overlooked the pool area. The fitness center is very small and the equipment old and very noisy, but it worked. There is nothing to clean the equipment surfaces between users (like the standard squeeze bottle and paper towels in most gyms now). The equipment should be updated. We appreciated the included breakfast, which was fairly standard, and checkout was a breeze with our bill slipped under our door the morning we left. The free parking was fine, and it was easy to get to the freeway (I-5). We had some reservation issues prior to arriving (not the hotel's fault) but were helped with sorting it out by the General Manager, Mr. Oh. Thank you very much! My only complaint is that this not an entirely non-smoking hotel, and we had booked non-smoking rooms, but you have to walk through the smoking rooms hallway to get to the non-smoking rooms.

The front desk was helpful in giving us directions to Pike's Market and also arranged shuttle surface to our cruise ship at a reasonable price. The downside and upside to the hotel is its location.

We are from another resort area, Myrtle Beach, and so are very familiar with a little traffic like you might experience with this hotel location so it was not a problem for us. We LOVED this hotel! The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. It is very clean... even the hallways ALWAYS smelled so fresh and pleasant! The beds were very comfortable, too. There are fresh baked cookies and WONDERFUL coffee in the lobby nightly... we enjoyed these often after a long day in the city! The breakfast room was filled with so much to choose from! Scrambled and boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, cereal, oatmeal, cinnamon rolls, orange juice, milk... you name it... they probably have it! The pool is small, but the kids didn't mind! I do wish they would put up some sort of noise absorbing materials to lower the decibels a little... it got extremely loud in this room at times. The Northgate Mall was very easy to find from this location. A big plus for us shopaholics! I would like to recommend to this hotel that they find a way to have guests use the parking lot more appropriately... the lot can handle the vehicles for the tenants if there were not so many of them double parked. This caused a problem on our last night there... my sister was going to park and come up to say goodbye, but had to just drop us off instead due to having absolutely nowhere to park her very small Subaru sedan.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cCigarette smoke everywhere\u201d", "Author": "canadatrav", "ReviewID": "UR17236710", "Content": "We booked this hotel as it was reasonably priced, and the hotel we were staying at was booked. We stay exclusively in Holiday Inn hotels, so we figured this would be ok, despite the reports of the location on Trip Advisor. Even though this hotel is a little north of a very commercial part of Seattle, we really didn't have any problems with the location, as most of our site seeing was away from this area. This appeared to be a newer hotel, but had the oldest beds out of any HI Express we have ever stayed in. They were so worn out you could hear the springs every time you moved. The biggest disappointment for us was that this hotel is not smoke free. If we would have known this we most likely would not have booked there. Even though we were in the room farthest from the smoking wing we could still smell smoke in our room (as I'm sure any non-smoker could) which was quite unpleasant. Not to mention we weren't thrilled about having our children exposed to the smoke. We have nothing against smokers, but the hotel would probably be better off to have complete floors smoking or non-smoking, so the smell doesn't travel down the hallway. Two other minor inconveniences were the fact that there is only one washer and dryer for laundry and no business office (just a computer by the front desk). They do have a good size dining room for breakfast in the morning which was nice.

Here's the sequence of events - I register at the front desk and then go up to our room only to find that our keys don't work. So I walk down and the clerk reissues another, without even an apology. I go back up again and find out the Fridge/MW we asked for was not available in our room. I go back down, again, and the clerk (with an unforgettable name of 'Junior' and a very unprofessional attitude) says that only the King suites had them, despite what the Hotel website says. It's almost as if you are in a East European Student Hostel and not a 'business-traveler' hotel as Holiday Inn Corp positions ts 'Express' brand as. I then ask for a King suite since we were promised a Fridge/MW, but he says that they don't have any available. I insisted that with a child traveling with us, that was an absolute necessity, and after about 10 minutes of back and forth, surprise, surprise he miraculously finds one! He then asks me if the earlier room was clean and if we had used it (we didn't even have time to unpack!!) and then asks that I return the keys to the earlier room immediately, which involved another trip up and down to get my wife's key. I almost decided to quit at that point. Anyway we were tired from a long flight and decided to stay. So after a total of 3 trips back and forth from our room, we finally settle down. The stay in the room was pleasant enough, though by the second night one of our keys stopped working. I decided not to bother asking for a replacement again.

I think the Holiday Inn might also have a restaurant too but I can't remember. We paid for a basic room but got upgraded to a suite, so we had our own little kitchen with a fridge, kettle, microwave etc - which was very handy. There is no restaurant or room service in the hotel, but they have a menu for surrounding takeaways who will deliver to your room, so that was great. We got lovely pizzas from a near-by takeaway. I HAVE to coment on the breakfast bar!!! I don't usually eat breakfast at all, but I was at that breakfast bar every morning without fail. They have loads of stuff and you just go up and help yourself (so if you have a big appetite you do very well out of it cos you can take as much as you want!).
