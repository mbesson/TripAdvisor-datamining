Last weekend when we were in town for my husband's MBA graduation, we thought of Sofitel again. Unfortunately, our experience began its steady downhill descent when we settled into our room only to find that the AC was not working (normally in March this would not be a problem, but it just so happened that temps were pushing 80 that day). We would have to pack everything back up and move to another room. Even after politely asking the manager at the front desk whether they would offer us anything to compensate for the hassle, he insisted that they could do nothing more than the exact same room on another floor. Nothing. Tip to hotel management: if you don't maintain your temperature control units properly resulting in guests having to re-pack all of their belongings to move to another room, then you'd better be prepared to offer them something - an upgrade, and if not, at the very least breakfast on the house. If this had been the only issue during our stay, then we might possilby consider returning. Maybe the front desk manager was just having a bad day. But during our stay there were a host of other issues including the wireless internet not working (and even worse, the hotel not being able to offer a solution other than waiting until the next day when the whole system apparently reboots), returning to the room in the early afternoon after being out several hours during the morning to find the room still not made up, the safe in our room malfunctioning. The plumbing also leaves something to be desired - the water pressure in the shower was weak, and it felt like they were rationing hot water. There are some good things about this hotel. The location within Gold Coast is convenient. But fortunately, there are plenty of other hotel options in the neighborhood which we will certainly choose over Sofitel the next time we are in town.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barberton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in great neighborhood!\u201d", "Author": "LovinMexico7", "ReviewID": "UR126329364", "Content": "We stayed over St. Patrick's Day weekend and had a wonderful time.

This hotel was wonderful. After reading reviews I booked a room here for my St. Patty's Birthday.

I saw Devon Seafood right on the corner - where we had our 1st night dinner reservations- excited to see it so close to the hotel. The hotel lobby is beautiful - and check-in was easy and front desk people were wonderful wishing me a Happy Birthday. My room was on the 24th floor - light oak - spotless clean and flat screen with Bose radio player with plug for my ipod and Android / Pandora music hook ups. The bed was so comfortable - and just had a top comforter. The location was great for getting out - just a short walk to Michigan Ave. - and to Rush street - where I can enjoy Tavern on Rush / Gibson's Steakhouse / Morton's / Ditkas / live music Jilly's Starbucks - and Pancake House and all the fun bars and restaurants on Rush.

I've stayed at one other Sofitel before (Manila) and loved it, so this was my first consideration. The available rates were slightly less than my two other choices (the Peninsula and the Waldor Astoria- WA had an Auto Show special rate that was super cheap), but when I called the hotel directly, they gave me the breakfast and parking package because I asked for a deal and part of my stay did qualify for that package. Also, I believe we were upgraded to the next room category free of charge. Awesome value. LOCATION: It was ideal; it was easy to find, and there were plenty of places to eat within walking distance, as well as a nice little grocery store on the same block just around the corner. Plus, our view from the 22nd floor was very nice! SERVICE: Every person we encountered was very friendly and courteous, and if applicable, very helpful. The only person that disappointed me was the man that checked us out- we didn't receive the 2nd breakfast credit each day (which was $20/person), but the bill that I received wasn't detailed enough to show that. I simply told him that I didn't know why our bill was over $60 more than it should have been. He was unable to find the error, and since I was holding up the line of people checking out, I resigned myself to call back that evening when they may be less busy. I did over-pay upon check out, but the man I spoke with that evening was able to correct the mistake and refund me the difference. To his credit, though, the man who checked us out did show quite a bit of patience for what must have just looked like a young woman who wanted to get out of part of her bill. ROOM: Our room was a little weird since it was in the corner of a triangular building. It could have been a little bigger. The bathroom area was fairly large though. The bed was very comfortable, but after three nights, my back was a little sore from how soft it was. My husband was fine, though. It was also one of the least noisy places we've stayed in, especially considering its location. The toiletries were nice- L'Occitane verbena shampoo, conditioner, etc, as well as nail files, bath loofah, and emergency sewing kit. FOOD: The breakfasts were fantastic, especially since we were given the credit for the full American breakfast regardless of what we ordered. I had the brioche French toast, which was very good, and the Maine lobster omelette was ridiculous. It had a whole lobster claw (without the shell) on top, and more lobster in it than many tails I've had! My husband had the lingonberry waffles, which were exquisite, and the super-fluffy buttermilk pancakes. Our last morning we ordered room service breakfast and both had the delicious apple-cinnamon crepes. The spreads were simply amazing. We were served French pressed coffee, unlimited juice, and had a basket of croissants (regular, raisin, AND chocolate, as well as some baguette rolls) along with our breakfasts. The bacon was awesome too. I would definitely recommend the bacon! BAR: The bar was decent. It was definitely upscale, but nothing stood out about it. I enjoyed the champagne flight while my husband enjoyed their large selection of Scotch. The apps were a good value- relatively inexpensive yet good quality. Overall, I felt our stay was an exceptional value. Unless I decide to spend a fair bit more on our next visit, I will surely book this hotel again.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cAlways a solid experience\u201d", "Author": "PassportAlwaysOnHand", "ReviewID": "UR124939798", "Content": "I have been doing a bit of business in Chicago lately, and I stumbled upon the Sofitel through Expedia, which I use quite frequently.

The silver platter also included a hand-written birthday card from the manager of the hotel and Saratoga and Perrier water, all at no additional charge! I was blown away! The bathroom also far surpassed my expectations! It had wonderfully soft white robes and slippers along with French shampoo, conditioner, and body wash that all smelled fabulous. The Bose sound system was amazing, but I think the very best part of our entire stay was the bed. I honestly don't think I have ever slept in a more comfortable, soft, perfect-in-every-way bed.

That being said, the odd lines are intriguing and add to the hotel's sophistication in a way. Our room, a suite at the end of the building, was lovely with good views of the city and parts of Lake Michigan. The floor plan was large with a lot of unused space (again, think trapezoid). Nevertheless, we enjoyed all of the space, and the quiet, 30 floors above the city. Unfortunately, I must echo the comments of another review who said their suite smelled of body odor. Ours did too, particularly the bed. The linens had definitely been washed, but I could not get past the b.o. smell, which is why I cannot give this hotel five stars.

The finish-out is most definitely not high-end...cheap fixtures, carpet, and other furnishings are noticeable, especially when compared to other newer Sofitel properties in Europe (including the fabulous new Sofitel at T5 at Heathrow). The mattresses are low-end (and the down duvet used as a mattress pad can't cover that up). I like the fact that the shower and tub are separate, but the shower stall is so tiny that it is almost not worth the effort. The plumbing fixtures are low-end American Standard that could have been purchased 10 years ago at Lowes. The \"luxury\" rooms are very small (even for Chicago standards) and their layout is not well-designed. Plus, the rooms were very hot. I set the thermostat to 65 and was still hot while sleeping. The decor is terrible. Maroon paint and carpet...really? They were trying for a warm contemporary style but failed miserably. The entire hotel feels dark and unwelcoming.

They really seem to know how to pamper their guests. Our stay at the Sofitel in Chicago was for a Bears game and we only were there for a weekend. Cleanliness: The hotel is exceptionally clean throughout the lobby and common areas. The room was no different. We had a bathroom that we felt safe enough not to use shower shoes and carpets vacuumed and room cleaned seemingly twice a day. The second cleaning of the day, the staff closed the blinds and turned on some music on the bose alarm clock. The first night that they did this, we were a little confused but we figured out what was going on lol. Location: Awesome location, close to shopping, restaurants and a small tavern that I managed to close down on one of my nights. One thing though....Chicago is my home town so I am used to it but downtown near Michigan Ave gets very busy and sometimes violent. While we were out shopping, we passed by two fights and then one at the tavern. So just be mindful and be safe. Room Service: Sofitel breakfast in Moorea was good and pricey to the tune of $120 per morning. Sofitel American breakfast in Chicago was even more AWESOME and much better value. We ordered fried egg whites one morning and scrambled egg whites the next....guess what...they did it right each time. Every meal was fantastic! Sleep Quality: Beds were soft and pillows were stiff....for me. My wife slept like a baby that was drugged. Me, I tossed and turned and woke up with a stiff neck and a headache. Preference really. I wouldn't knock the Sofitel for my weird sleeping needs though. Overall: In comparison with the W in downtown Chicago, Sofitel was right there in every category if not better. My next visit home will be difficult to choose my next stay. I intend to try most, if not all of the luxury downtown Chicago hotels but I feel like I may be compelled to return back to Sofitel.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cFine location for visit to Chicago\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR120608625", "Content": "The hotel is located at an excellent downtown location for visit to Chicago.

The gross: Hideous magenta carpets in the rooms that seemed crusty with several years' (at least) worth of your room's previous tenants' skin cells and god only knows what else.

The weird: The suites are huge but awkwardly arranged -- there seems to be more space than they know how to make use of.

The rooms are extremely small (even compared to European hotel rooms). The decor looks dated, especially the red carpets. But, most importantly, the rooms were noisy.

I am not sure if it was a water heater, bad pipes, or just someone taking a shower, but it was loud enough to wake me and keep me awake. This was terrible, since I was on Pacific time, so it was like being woken at 4 AM. When I spoke to someone at the front desk, he was extremely rude and said that no one had ever complained about noise in the hotel. This is the most ridiculous and unsympathetic response. I was given a quieter room after speaking to the manager, who was very nice. However, the next morning at 8 AM, housekeeping banged on my door wanting to clean my room. This was extremely odd. It seems that they don't want their hotel guests to sleep in or relax, at least I never was able to. Also, although Sofitels are famous for their comfortable beds, the mattress in the first room felt old and worn. They just add a pillow top to it, which actually didn't even fit well.

I even asked to see other rooms and that was no help either \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The manger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response was not much better to my situation (maybe since they were fully booked?) he was not very apologetic and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much to help the situation. I found his attitude was not very empathetic All in all, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a bad hotel, but it could have been better.

All expectations were met but for a couple of issues. Booked on their web site for a great rate, when I called the hotel to make an adjustment to the booking they actually found me a lower rate with more perks. Great! Somehow those perks didn't make it to the front desk and I had to remind them of the picnic and late check-out included in our rate. They made it happen with no issues, but I had to have the charge removed at check out, because again, they didn't enter it correctly into their system. To be sure the front desk happily took care of all the issues, but it would be best to not have to double check every detail. Beautiful room with an amazing view of the Hancock Tower. In room service was spectacular. We both found the bed to be too soft for comfortable sleeping. I got used to it, but my wife never did. This will probably have us looking for a different place to stay next time. Another irksome quirk that I can't blame on the hotel is that we had virtually no service from AT&T in our room on the 21st floor. I can't understand it as the hotel isn't surrounded by huge stone buildings to block reception. It was just another unfortunate negative of our stay. Lastly I am always offended to stay at a hotel of this caliber and be charged for in room internet access. I know most hotels charge for this service, but really, what year is this? A better hotel should offer this as part of its services. To sum up, this is a very nice hotel with an amazing location. Some people will find the beds to be like sleeping in a cloud. Those people will love their experience. If you need more support you might want to check with the front desk and see if they can accommodate you.

The suite is 700 square feet and is definitely worth the extra money. The view on the 29th floor was amazing. You could view the Hancock Building and Lake Michigan. Then there was the bed. You will feel like you are floating on a cloud. This was the softest bed I have ever experienced. If you don't like soft beds, then you may want to request a firmer bed type before arrival.

When I got to the front desk, I was informed that the rooms were actually ready, which was a huge bonus. The room decor isn't really my style - definitely European influenced - but objectively speaking it's very nice. The TV is a new HD flatscreen, the bed was soft, clean and comfortable and the bathroom was huge. Bathroom had a separate shower and tub, and pretty soft towels considering what you normally get. Not really sure what else I could ask for. Though oddly laid out, the gym has all of the machines and weights you'd want, and they had fresh fruit there all three days. Really nice touch. Wish it was 24 hour. I found the service a bit perplexing; for the most part they were extremely friendly and helpful. A woman happily offered me an extra complimentary water when I asked, and the doormen recognized and greeted us with a smile every day. The only thing I found odd was the daily service. In the process of fixing up the room, they often re-arranged, folded or straightened my stuff. Felt sort of like my Mom came in and was scolding me for leaving a shirt out or not organizing my toiletries. Still not quite sure how I feel about it, but it sort of made me laugh. The bar & restaurant seemed fine, though I was looking for more Italian beef sandwiches, deep dish pizza and cheap beer than sweetbreads and the high class fare served here. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this property for anyone here on business or pleasure.

I selected the Sofitel in downtown Chicago after comparing prices amongst all of the upscale hotels. The Elysian was very expensive, as well as the Trump. I probably would have picked the Palomar, based on positive past experience with that property in Philadelphia and #3 ranking, but they were completely booked. I wanted a hotel that was (1) Upscale (2) Ranked high on Trip Advisor and (3) Close to the Water Tower. The Sofitel is a 4 \u00c2\u00bd star hotel, and ranked 8 on trip advisor, with an acceptable / competitve price point. It was a 5-8 minute walk to the Magnificent Mile, close to the Water Tower and John Handcock building, making it the winner. Booking: I personally have had good experience booking on hotels.com, and use that site. However, in this case, after I had booked, I realized that you get a better deal on this property booking directly on the hotel website, rather than a 3rd party. I did read from another reviewer this same experience, and that reviewer regretted not booking directly from Sofitel, because you do get a better deal. Bottom line? If you are going to book this hotel, book on Sofitel.com. Check In: When we arrived, we were greeted with a prompt bellman, friendly and professional. Our check-in was seamless, zero wait and accurate information on their records. The female that handled our check in was very kind. I asked whether she had any rooms with double beds, and she said that they did, and for the exact same room, and features, it would be $40 more per night X 3 nights. It seemed unfair to charge more money for the same room, and square footage for double beds, so we declined. Parking: Parking is at cost, which we used. I did ask if there was a way to get parking waived with a coupon, or an online deal to join their newsletter, but she said that there was no way. Although disappointing, it is understandable, and we proceeded to our room. Hotel Vibe: This hotel has a dark and sexy feel to it. The lobby is dimly lit, and has a sensual feel. There are candles burning throughout the property, with tall, glass containers and vases. The hotel is trendy, modern, sophisticated, and has sort of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark and mysterious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd kind of a feel about it. Room: The rooms here are a lot nicer than the pictures, which did the property no justice. Everything is chrome, and all fixtures are buffed to a high polish shine. It has all clean lines of modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor, a white bathroom, and a bed to die for. It is a featherbed that is literally one of the nicest beds I have ever slept in; it was incredible. You do have a nice flat screen TV, although I felt like the channels took a long time to load. There is plenty of space for all of your things, and closet space. It has 2 bathrobes, a hairdryer, 2 pairs of slippers, and huge makeup mirror. We were pleased. I will say, I was also glad that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay more for a better view. Once we saw the view from the room, we were happy we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upgrade. Extras: As described by a different reviewer, I also liked the Evian water delivered to the room at night. They do nightly turndown service, like most hotels of this star rating. What I LOVED and appreciated were the umbrellas provided at this hotel. It did rain on the Friday night that we were here and it was amazing to have 2 free umbrellas to use on our night out. My hair didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get wrecked, so thank you! Drawbacks: The rooms, although lovely, are not spacious. The hotel is not super warm and inviting, but rather, chic, sleek, upscale and sophisticated\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6bordering on cold? I am not sure. It was my style, personally, but I can see how this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be for everyone. Also, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch anything in the fridge because it is sensor monitored. If something moves, you will be charged. It did appear on my bill from just touching an item, but checkout went smoothly and they happily took it off the bill without issue. Value: I think the value is great, for a nice Chicago hotel. It is less expensive than its competitors and does deliver. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say you are going to find a ton of extras and perks here, nor special touches that you would find at the Palomar property, but it does the job, and you can bet on a good experience. Points of Interest: They have the nicest, little library that is very chic and cool. If I had been traveling alone, I probably would have gone down and enjoyed it. This hotel is perfect for: Young couples, romance, trendsetters, jetsetters, business, and solos. This hotel is not great for: Families, those looking for giant rooms / kitchens / amenities and extras.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery impressive hotel with luxury service and amenities\u201d", "Author": "2tampuh2", "ReviewID": "UR98738047", "Content": "Stayed for a night at Sofitel and was impressed with the service from beginning to end.

Looking through reviews, we figured that the Sofitel would be a nice place to relax. It turned out to be very disappointing. Rooms: Our room was unbearably dry! I could not breathe properly during the entire stay. Granted, it was winter... but I had no problems breathing the outdoor Chicago air. I would wake up in the middle of the night because the air in the room was too dry. I ended up placing wet tissues under my nose just to help me breathe. I am very picky about cleanliness, so this may be acceptable to some people. When we first arrived, the beds had what looked like other people's hair (perhaps pubic), maybe 5-6 strands scattered around that I could find. At first, I questioned whether or not the sheets were cleaned, but I realized that the sheets and bedding had a lot of static--- so I'm guessing that they were washed, but some hairs were never able to come off in the wash. Another issue was that on two different mornings, starting around 9AM, we would hear small hammering sounds from nearby. It sounded like it came from an adjacent room next to us (maybe some sort of construction or renovation?). Definitely not what I want to be hearing when I want to sleep in and relax! Location: Probably the only thing I liked about the hotel. It was in a good location -right next to Michigan Avenue, and about a 15 minute walk to Navy Pier- one afternoon we had a pleasant walk from Navy Pier back to the hotel. Service: When I needed to resolve an issue over the phone about my reservation, I was told to leave a voice message for the reservations manager. I'm always hesitant about leaving voice mails, but I was reassured that she was \"good at checking her voice mails\", but after leaving a detailed message, I never received a callback.

We wanted to be close to the action since it would be cold outside, the location turned out to be just OK, not as close as I thought. Walking into the lobby I was overwhelmed by scent. It was obnoxious and neither of us ever got used to it. I have asthma and couldn't get out of there fast enough. The reception staff and doormen were extremely standoffish, we didn't even get a glance when we walked in and the receptionist didn't say hello, she simply said \"Name?\" We had been up early that morning and the flight wore us out so the first thing we wanted to do was take a quick nap. We had booked at Deluxe High Floor room because we wanted to avoid street noise. We had a room on the 18th floor but it may as well have been the first because it sounded like we were right on the street. We even heard the subway going by. I went to the desk to ask if they had a fan and she was defensive right away and asked what I would need that for. I told her the noise from the street was louder than we expected but hopefully a fan would take care of that. She said she didn't know if they had a fan but if they did it would be sent up. Fine, awhile later the fan showed up. Didn't help, but at least we tried. Not only was the noise a problem but the bed was atrocious. It was beyond horrible. There was a feather topper on it apparently to try to conceal the lumpy, awfulness of the actual mattress. My husband had never had a back problem but woke up with one the next morning. I didn't sleep more than a couple hours our entire stay. The second night after they did the turn down service there was a brochure for purchasing the SoBed....we got quite a laugh out of that. The only friendly face we encountered during our stay was the bellman hailing us a taxi to the airport. The redeeming quality for the hotel was the bathroom - it was amazing. I believe there are good views in the hotel, we did not receive one but we went to the 34th floor and you could see the lake - beautiful. Overall the hotel was pretty & clean but I wouldn't receommend it because of the bed and the noise.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe Sofitel should be #1 rated in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "Coffee4Kate", "ReviewID": "UR88978178", "Content": "What an amazing experience!!

We booked a Luxury room with a king bed on an upper floor and were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was wonderful. The hotel is very impressive from the outside and the staff the the front counter could not have been more helpful, Marie thank you and also Jackie the Concierge. Our room was not ready but they stored our luggage as we went to explore the city armed with maps and information provided by Jackie. Upon our return to the hotel we were delighted with our Junior Suite, the views from the room were unbelievable and there was so much space. The desk area was a two sided one so great for both of us to work at. Large comfortable bed and the standard Sofitel linens, doonas and bathroom products. Good size bathroom with separate shower and bath. Had room service one night and it was very good. Turndown service provided complimentary water each night and there was also free internet. Only issues we had was with the bar staff, after our wonderful experience with the restaurant staff and bar staff at the Sofitel in Washington DC we were disappointed with the service in the bar. Very slow and this was put down not to the waitress but the barman who was supposed to be making the drinks, he seemed to be more concerned with chatting to the single ladies at the bar than attending to his duties, also he was quiet noisy. The bar area was a little dark for drinks early in the evening, but after such poor service here we decided not to eat in the restaurant and instead went over the road to the seafood restaurant which was exceptionally good, McCormack and Something (I think it was called). Also tried the little diner/cafe down the road from the hotel, turn right as you go outside the hotel door, for breakfast as another trip adviser writer had suggested, lovely little place and great food but HUGE portions so you may only want to order a shared portion.

Here's the breakdown: Negatives: The room decor and style is very random. They attempted to provide a contemporary/urban style... I believe. Instead it appears very outdated and cold. The lobby is nice, but does not have the grand/classic/elegant feel that a lot of downtown Chicago hotels provide. The lobby is very dark and on the small side. Front desk staff not willing to provide any complementary upgrades of any sorts. Location not as centrally located as I would have liked. Rooms do not have free wi-fi. Positives: Room is very clean. The beds are heavenly!! You'll feel as though you're sleeping on a cloud! Bathrooms are beautifully done and include both a shower and soaking tub. Robes and slippers were a nice touch. Views are okay. Our room had a perfect view of the John Hancock building. Self parking garage is available right next to hotel if you want to save a few bucks. Small eateries are available behind hotel on both corners that made grabbing a coffee and small breakfast sandwich very convenient! Doorman, bellhop, concierge and housekeeping were all top notch.

It was our 4th stay at this marvelous hotel that we have come to think of as \"home\" more so than any of the other upscale hotels where we've stated. The staff are most professional and friendly, the accommodations high-quality and the location is hard to beat. We arrived about 12:30 pm, left the car with the valet and the luggage with the bellman. However, Mrs. D wanted to put her jewelry in the hotel safe. Alas, since the Sofitel has safes in each room, it does not have a lobby safe. But, the Director of Security offered the use of his personal lockbox behind the lobby of the hotel, which we gladly used. We spent the remainder of the day shopping. The Front Desk staff called me on my cell when our room was ready to occupy. They had fulfilled our request for a high-floor room with a view of the city. While the rooms are still easy on the eyes, I think it's time for a rehab/redecoration. There were some small stains on the carpet in our room and some marks on the trim and walls, and the piping on the edge of the black leather lounge chair in our suite was worn white - nothing to be upset about but at a four-star hotel, I expect better. We had loved the Sofitel beds in past visits but the one in this room has seen better days. We both awakened with sore backs due to the soft bedding and lack of support. Also, I found it odd the bed lacked a top sheet - I would have sworn there were top sheets on our prior visits. We liked being able to Le Bar - what can one say...excellent drinks (generous pours) in pleasant surroundings and a tray of marinated olives and crisps to nibble while imbibing! We sat outside because the weather was so nice and service was excellent inside our out. We did not dine at Cafe des Architects, but did enjoy a room -service breakfast that was very good and delivered on time and hot. I really liked the Sofitel coffee, but was disappointed when the croissants served to us were too dry. Mrs. D liked her omelet and my yogurt/berry parfait was delicious and cold.

The Sofitel is a polished, modern, hip, yet comfortable hotel. More sophisticated and grown up than a W or the Dana. I stayed 3 nights in a very nice suite. I appreciated the great windows/light, comfortable furniture and best designed and functional storage/luggage areas I may have ever seen in a hotel. The bathroom was also very spacious and featured Hermes toiletries. (Overall the rooms/hotel were not as plush or refined as a Four Seasons, but perhaps equal to Park Hyatt or similar.) Standard rooms though very nice, are certainly less impressive and I actually would probably select the Dana Hotel for their excellent basic amenities/rooms, if my budget did not allow for a suite. The best and most unexpected feature of the Sofitel to me was the wonderful lobby restaurant. Daily breakfast was included in my package and to my delight, it was impressive and delicious. We also enjoyed an amazing 5 course dinner, thank to the very talented and charming French head chef that went out of his way to make us an incredible meal. (I apologize for forgetting his name!) Service and food all around was fantastic but if you eat one meal there, I have to say the breakfasts really stood out. It's worth a special trip even if you are not a guest of the hotel. One of the best I have had in Chicago! On the weak side, the fitness facilities are limited and there is no on-site spa/pool. Also, I never received a chocolate tray that was supposed to be included in my package, but the over-the-top meal provided by the chef more than made up for it. I am extremely picky and a self proclaimed hotel snob. Overall, I was very impressed with the Sofitel and will be glad to return.

My Mom was convinced the artwork showed people jumping to their deaths from skyscrapers - It was all a bit funky and not in a good way.

We stayed in a Prestige Suite and took part in their Air of Romance package. I usually stay in Marriotts, SPG hotels when I get a chance so I had debated over getting a suite at the W. Based on the reviews from TripAdvisor, I decided to go to the Sofitel for the luxury experience. I'm glad I listened to the community because the reviews are consistent with the quality of the rooms, service and overall experience. Every time you contacted either the front desk or room service or any other place, they were attentive and prompt with your needs. So the service is great and I would highly recommend it. As for the rooms, the suite was simple modern European elegance (that was my initial reaction to the room) which was very nice and what I was hoping for. It wasn't a darker modern look, but more neutral colors so it made us feel more lively (I think the color of the room makes a difference). Anyways, the standout of the room were 2 things...the bathroom was \"gianormous\" with it's marble floor, deep tub and it's clear glass doors leading to the toilet and stand up shower (i'm not sure why they have a glass door to the toilet...perhaps it was a conversation piece). The 2nd point was a vanity desk for my wife...she enjoyed it because it made it easier for her to get ready in the evening. As for the view, it wasn't anything spectacular, but it also wasn't something that I was looking for...again, the room was key for our night. As part of our day, we had a masseuse recommended by the Concierge at the Sofitel. They provided one from Windy City Massage and one of the packages they sold was a 75 minute massage where they would show the couple how to give a massage to each other. The experience to do that was worth the price for our romantic Valentine's day. If you ask me if I would pay for that service again, probably not as it was a one time thing to make the experience unique. I bring it up in this review because the Sofitel had suggested it and I was pleased with the unique experience. Afterwards, we had dinner at Cafe Des Architects. The decor was definitely remarkable and eye-catching. The food itself (it was fixed price menu) was definitely flavorful and I was surprised it was of high quality even at a hotel. In the morning we had room service, again, I enjoyed breakfast in bed. The quality of the food is very good and I would recommend eating room service breakfast. Granted there's a price to pay, but i think as once-in-a-while splurge (especially for a Valentine's day event) it's worth the experience. Overall, if you are looking for a refined luxury experience with attentive service, then check out this hotel especially for a romantic relaxing night (or weekend).", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe most comfortable bed i've ever slept in...\u201d", "Author": "SungirlFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR57517049", "Content": "I lived in Chicago for 7 years before moving to Florida 2 years ago.

Breakfast was delicious and gorgeous and we could order whatever we wished from the breakfast menu. And there is French Press coffee! The chocolate experience was a tray of mini desserts of different types which was brought to our room upon our request. I almost half expected to see some type of extra charge upon departure, but no, I was pleasantly surprised by a zero balance on the bill. I can't say enough good things about the Sofitel. If I had anything bad to say or any improvement to suggest, it is that there is no coffee maker in room. Therefore you must get dressed and ready and leave the room for coffee or get room service (either way you sort of have to face the world before coffee). Certainly not a major complaint though.

This time, we decided to take advantage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love chocolate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package, which entitled us to a free third night, breakfast for two at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 des Architectes for all three days, a chocolate treat one afternoon, and a late check-out (4 pm) on the last day. This really was a great deal. 1. The hotel: Check-in was fast, efficient, and friendly. Our room (we decided to upgrade to a luxury room on an upper floor) was located on the 27th floor and had a gorgeous view of the Hancock Tower with a little sliver of lake next to it and a larger view of the lake above the 900 North parking garage when we looked to the left. One of the walls of the bedroom is a wall of windows, so a nice view makes a real difference. Our bedroom was decorated in very neutral tones: Lots of beiges and off-whites with a few touches of rust, and a modern painting in pastel colors. The furniture is modern and made of light wood. The bed is comfortable: The King size mattress has a very fluffy mattress topper that makes it feel like you are sleeping on a cloud. The duvet is warm and the sheets are a high thread count cotton. There is a light on each side of the bed and a Bose radio-alarm clock on one side. The flat-screen TV is large, and the Francophone station TV5 is one of the channels available. The large closet with mirrored doors lights up automatically when you open it. There is a safe in there, and a fridge in the cabinet under the TV (with very little room for storage). Two robes, two pairs of slippers, an ironing board and iron are also provided. There is no coffee-maker in the room, but when we asked for an electric tea-kettle, it was delivered within minutes. Similarly, no wine glasses were provided, but they were brought when we requested them. We were even asked to specify whether we wanted white or red wine glasses. Nice touch. Two bottles of Evian water are brought to your room at night. One more detail: Although USA Today is always available on each floor next to the elevators, it is possible to request delivery of a different paper. Many choices are provided. The bathroom is large and luxurious: large shower, separate tub, single sink with lit-up mirror and plenty of storage below it, magnifying mirror on the side. L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane products are provided, the towels are thick, and a quality hairdryer can be found under the sink. Be forewarned that the unusual bathroom doors do not lock (but provide complete privacy nonetheless). Everything is in good repair and impeccably clean. The rooms are well insulated and very quiet. This all makes for a very relaxing stay. 2. The restaurant and bar. Breakfast at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 des Architectes is pretty amazing. The creativity of the chef shows in the presentation as well as the taste of the food. I ordered the cherry wood-smoked salmon and sesame bagel with chive and lime cream cheese twice, and the crabcake Benedict once. The crabcake Benedict was a bit of a disappointment (I missed the smokiness of Canadian bacon and did not much care for the fishiness of the crab in this dish), but the smoked salmon breakfast was a delight both to the eyes and the palate (See picture). My husband ordered the ham and gruy\u00c3\u00a8re cr\u00c3\u00aapes one morning and found them excellent. He had the egg cocotte proven\u00c3\u00a7ale the following day and was less thrilled. On the third morning, he chose the \u00c3\u20ac votre sant\u00c3\u00a9 breakfast, an egg white, mushroom and spinach concoction with a light tomato coulis (See picture), and really enjoyed it. I should mention that all the egg dishes also come with a basket filled with croissants, pains au chocolat, breads and apricot pastries, and that the coffee and tea are excellent and nicely presented. These are all very hearty breakfasts indeed. We also had lunch at the restaurant on the last day. We both took the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Executive lunch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is a combination plate with four little serving plates on it (See picture). Our choice was tuna tartare (excellent), a salade lyonnaise with poached egg, bacon and croutons, a small beef filet with a single pomme dauphine, and two little dessert bites on the last plate. It was perfect. Our experience at the bar was a mixed one. We went there one afternoon to take advantage of the chocolate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153go\u00c3\u00bbter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that came with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love chocolate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package. The bar is a very pleasant space, which made the long wait for our treat a non-issue. The treat, however, was a disappointment: 6 bite-size chocolate pastries (so three bites per person), served with three espresso cups filled with three different kinds of chocolate milk to be shared. It just seemed stingy. Tasty but ridiculously small. We decided to stay in the bar and have drinks. They were served with olives and bacon-flavored crackers. Glasses of wine start at $12, and cocktails are $13. To summarize: All in all, I strongly recommend this hotel. The location is wonderful: A two-minute walk takes you to Water Tower and 900 North. If you are looking for deals, Filene\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Basement and Marshall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are not far. The Museum of Contemporary Art is close. Oak Street Beach is 10 minutes away. Holy Name Cathedral is 5 minutes away. There are lots of wonderful restaurants and numerous bars in the vicinity. There is a parking garage right behind the hotel ($32 a day) which is a slightly cheaper option than the parking provided by the hotel, I believe. The hotel itself is luxurious, well-run, and the staff is helpful and friendly (A special thank-you to the three concierges and all the front desk employees who never failed to greet us with a smile.). The rooms are quiet and comfortable.

I booked directly through the hotel online and could not book a double bed room, but a quick phone call to reservations fixed that up.

Lastly, I liked that the provided a lot of little things that travelers tend to leave at home (cotton swabs, nail file, sewing kit, etc.). The food in the restaurant was really delicious. Also, the customer service at the hotel was wonderful, everyone always smiled and said hello to you which was very refreshing. The concierge was helpful as well.

I paid $440 for 2 nights in a luxury king and that included breakfast for two daily, one cocktail per person one night and a $100 food and bev credit. GREAT deal! The hotel: Our room was 3012 and it overlooked the Hancock tower and you could see a bit of the lake on either side. The room was a decent size with a king bed, two side tables, a desk and a chair. There is a large TV (we never turned it on) on the dresser that housed the mini bar and storage. Don't forget the mini bar has sensors so if you remove something you will get charged for it! There is a closet with mirrored doors where there is an ironing board and iron, as well as a safe. The bath is VERY large and nice - all marble - and it's quite unusual that there is a shower and a separate tub! The tub isn't very deep, but I'd say this is a real benefit for people traveling with children - and those who just want a little soak after a long day of shopping! Products are L'occitane and they replace them daily! I know a few people in prior reviews said they had a problem with hot water - but that was not the case with us on our three day stay. The bed was soft and comfortable with a feather bed under the fitted bottom sheet. The unusual thing I wasn't fond of was that there isn't a sheet between you and the comforter. I'm someone who usually takes the comforter off, so obviously this wasn't an option for me!! Not sure if you have the ability to request one...we didn't bother, but it was a bit strange. Because breakfast was included, we ate at CAFE DES ARCHITECTES three times - and each time it was very good. There are several breakfast items to choose from and if you order any with eggs, you get a choice of toast or a pasty basket. The pastry basket has 5 or 6 items in it and it's excellent and fresh! Their coffee is wonderful and they are constantly topping off your glassof juice. I ordered two eggs and chicken sausage one day, a waffle another...both were very good. We had a drink at LeBar one night and there were lots of people in there and the bar menu looked quite good as well. Outside the hotel: I'm not sure why people get so worked up about the fact that it's called \"Sofitel Water Tower\" but it's not ON the water. The location is fantastic. It's a 3 block walk to Michigan Avenue (one thing to note is if you are taking your daughter to the American Girl store, it's a super easy walk there.) Shopping galore - everything from Louis Vuitton and Gucci to H&M and Filenes's Basement...so defintiely something for everyone! It's about a 6 block walk to the left to get to the lake and a little farther to the right, but it is very walkable. It was freezing when we were there this past weekend so we walked Michigan Ave but opted to cab it to the Chicago Institute of Art. Rush Street is just a few blocks away and Division is another 4 or so blocks, so you aren't far from that area as well. We didn't have any solid plans...knew we wanted to check out some museums, do some shopping and eat good food. One of the restaurants we made a reservation at was Ditka's, and we were very happy to see we were only 1 block away!! If you like a good steak and like Frank Sinatra-ish music, get a reservation after 8:00 and get a table upstairs so you can hear John Vincent sing. He's sooo good! And the food was great too! The other restaurant we ate at was was Table 52. Just wonderful!! Yummy, yummy comfort food in a lovely, homey settting. And no matter how full you are, you must get their Hummingbird Cake for dessert! AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Though we didn't have a car, we did see it is $47 to park at the hotel! OUCH! They do allow pets for an additional charge. Overall we were very happy with everything - especially with the deal we got!

There are so many good things about staying here, I hesitate to write something bad, but balance is always good too. First of all, in our room the phone, sink, and lamps were broken. Secondly, they had a hard time charging me correctly for the room and breakfast, I had to get the bill fixed twice. Another issue I had is that as a member with preferred status, I was supposed to get upgrades, some free drinks, etc. I was offerred none of it. No big deal really, except I asked at check in and the agent looked at me as if I were speaking another language but promised to look into it. The next day I asked someone else and they said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we no longer do that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd even though I know that is not true. Upon check out I was asked how everything was, and so I again explained my concern and was told apologetically that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offered these perks. Another time I asked the concierge where I might find the nearest branch of my bank and she sent me a mile down Michigan Avenue. The next day I found one a block away on Chestnut. The breakfast we ate twice at the restaurant was good, but harried both times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they sort of hustle you in and hustle you out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not very French.

This is not the first time I have stayed here and all I can say is that the general \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the place has gone downhill.

This time, I was there for five nights. I do love this hotel. But having become a connoisseur of hotels as of late, there are a couple of minor things that prevent me from giving the Sofitel Water Tower 5 stars. But let me start with the good stuff... * Super comfortable beds. * Great Bose alarm clock. * Robes and slippers provided. * Excellent gym for a hotel. People have noted that the gym is small...I've stayed in a lot of hotels and this was pretty good for a hotel gym. 6 of 7 treadmills. Three cross-trainers. At least one exercise bike. A lot of free weights and some weight machines. Also, the gym is free, unlike at the Sheraton where you have to pay. * Lovely little bar. Even when I lived in Chicago, I would come here for martinis and cocktails. I just really like the vibe. * Super clean. One thing I tend to notice is hotel wear and tear on walls and carpets. My room was pristine. The gym walls were pristine as well. Facilities is really doing their job here. * Great Aveda bath products. * Free coffee and croissants in the a.m. No one seems to mention this, but it's there in the cafe. (Unless I was supposed to pay and didn't realize it.) The first morning, I asked if they had any tea and they said yes, what kind. I asked for mint tea and a few minutes later they brought me my own pot of REAL FRESH mint tea. It was awesome. Good croissants too. * And lastly--and this might sound silly--but the baguettes at breakfast were fantastic. Because I live in London and spend a lot of time in France, I eat a lot of baguettes. The Sofitel's baguette at breakfast was amazingly crunchy on the outside, yet just the right amount soft on the inside. I had to ask if they make it themselves on site, and they do. So, the main thing that prevents this from being a slam-dunk for me is the lack of free wireless. Even if I had just gotten a free 10 hours or something, I would have given this five stars. But the fact that I had to buy the T-mobile package was really annoying. The other minor quibble was the consistency of housekeeping. One night, during the turndown service, they didn't leave me any bottled water. And during the regular morning service, one day, they forgot to replace my bath products so I didn't have any conditioner left. Also, I'm a sucker for when they lay out all your beauty products on a towel on the sink--I see that a lot at higher end hotels--and they didn't do that here. In short, this wasn't five-star housekeeping. Although it was good and very clean. So...you really can't go wrong here.

So, with such a lot going for it, it is a pity to report that there were some negatives that badly spoiled my visit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. A few minor negatives to start with - No kettle, tea or coffee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too posh for that, which I find annoying and pretentious. Waking up early I like a cup of coffee before I dress and leave to face the world (and that includes going to a hotel dining room) - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor that some hotels (generally better ones) consider that too common for them. When I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve asked, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been brought a cafitierre and kettle before in better hotels than this, but given the level of comprehension and friendliness I'd encountered at check-in I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fancy my chances so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother asking. - A minifridge you cant put your own water in, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of those spring-loaded things that automatically bills you if you even move one of the bottles already in there. Annoying, but as noted in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the ac was good. - Slightly soft bed with only feather mattress and pillows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I prefer non-animal bedding products but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an option. And then the real problem, which is the reception and concierge staff\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. - Check-in was about as limp as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve encountered. She struggled with my fairly simple English surname, and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been taught to repeat letters spoken to you, so it took longer than it should for her to understand my fairly simple surname. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153E?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No A, for Adam\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153E?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No A\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd,.. Painful, and heaven help people with less common surnames. I suspected she was French, as the A/E thing can happen with native French speakers and my French is awful so I'm not being anti-French. No welcome, no explanation of any facilities (are there any? After leaving I heard there is a fitness centre, but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t told so wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware of it), and she was already walking away when I got to ask a question \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is breakfast included in my rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which met with a simple \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, but you can buy it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.or no, but there are nice cafes nearby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd., and she was gone, so lucky I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any more questions. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like gushing welcomes, but basic hospitality is important and it was absent. - Checking out I asked for directions by public transport to the airport. The receptionist informed me that was no public transport available, the only way to get to the airport was by taxi, it cost \u00e2\u20ac\u0153about fifty bucks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and I could get one from outside. I explained that I prefer not to travel in motor cars / automobiles (no good reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like them) and had never been to a big city airport that couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be accessed by public transport of some form, be it a train or a bus (I'd arrived in Chicago by train, my first visit there, so it was a genuine question I needed an answer to). Again he insisted it just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible. I said I found that simply incredible and said would go to the internet machine nearby and find the route myself, at which point he went to confer with a colleague and returned with a nicely printed out direction card for the simple, cheap ($2.25) and quick (1 hour door to door) route from the hotel to O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare via the metro. No \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just learned something\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or sense that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d learned anything that would help him serve future customers, just the same blank, limp, half-baked, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a damn attitude I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d already encountered there. I wanted to pay cash (gives me a better exchange rate) and that request was met as though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d said something a bit weird. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid cash in other American hotels, no issue at all, but to this person it seemed odd. He went to check that it was okay, and I was transferred to another staff member who took my money. She was the same as the others - no engagement, no energy, no understanding that transactions can be courteous and friendly and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be monosyballic and no-eye-contact- got-over-with-as-soon-as-possible affairs. That was the tone throughout the hotel. As I say, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m personally not hugely into excessive friendliness or fakeness, but the staff at this hotel are on the wrong side of the line and I felt they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually understand that I was a paying guest who happened to be paying their salary for the time they were dealing with me. It may be they are all new and inexperienced and just lacking in confidence dealing with foreigners, but if that is the case they need some training. It got worse, although I only found out after checking out. My brother, who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contact me by cell but was planning to check into a nearby hotel with friends, had arranged to call me so we could meet up for dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not seen each other for a long time. He called the hotel only to be told I was not staying there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was actually waiting in my room for his call and stayed in, checking for messages! He repeated my surname several times (he found that they don't know the basic technique of repeating each letter to confirm if its mutually understood - he speaks very clear south of England English, as do I, so it's not as though we have heavily accented English that could have thrown them). He then asked if they would do a search on my first name, as there couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that many people of that name staying. He was transferred now to the front desk, who simply declined to search by first name, in a sort of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorry, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd limp kind of way, which reminded me, when I was told about it, by the half-baked way I was originally \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greeted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when I checked-in. So he thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not checked-in and was worried about where I was. We met up the next day as I tracked down his hotel via a friend so we did get to meet up, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d missed the dinner the previous evening and one friend I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to see as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d left town in the morning. I returned (I had to collect my bag from the concierge en route to the airport) and asked the concierge if I could see the duty manager (it was early evening, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the hotel manager necessarily to be there). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Duty manager?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said incredulously, as if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never heard such a term and needed it explaining. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, the manager who is on duty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, do you have an appointment?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, I have a complaint \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do I need an appointment to make a complaint?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is over there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (he pointed to the guy near him on reception). Appointment indeed! What absolutely second-rate impertinence. The manager couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find any record of my stay on their system, and it was only when I produced my receipt that he explained what the problem was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been booked in, unbeknown to me, with my surname and first name reversed. He said that should have been sorted at check-in. He agreed, however, that this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain why his staff had declined to search for me by first name as well as second name when asked to do so by my brother. I complained to him not just about this, but the general poor quality of reception and concierge service I had received \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of them was standing nearby and was literally gawping at me as I spoke to the manager, too poorly trained to understand that this type of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153audience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can only exacerbate a difficult conversation. Professional front desk staff know how to behave and with the exception of the manager the people at that front-desk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a clue. The manager recovered the situation with a fulsome apology, and, I have to hope, an understanding that he needed to sort out some staffing issues. He made a courtesy reduction on my bill which made me feel his apology was a sincere one and this retrieved the situation so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider staying at the chain again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I explained to him I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in other accor and Sofitel hotels outside the US and always experienced good service in the past. So I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel as if I can actually recommend this hotel at the moment. I am returning to Chicago next year and I'd like to stay, but I'd want to know the staffing situation had been sorted out. Currently, there are staff who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that they should know the names of their guests, that they should be prepared to look at a simple list to locate a guest when someone wishes to speak to them; they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be phased when someone wants to pay in cash; they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that part of their job is to briefly summarise available facilities; they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that it is provocative to ask a customer with a complaint if they have an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appointment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to speak to the manager who is on duty a few feet away; they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that there is a metro to the airport and that it is wrong to insist that you can only there by taxi. This catalogue of half-baked, rude and ridiculous incidents involves several staff, not just one, so I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a total culture change they need \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if I was a high-up person with accor I'd consider closing the place for a week and training up new staff. I would repeat, however, that the manager was professional and courteous and did apologise for the errors, so there has to be some hope there I suppose.", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant\u201d", "Author": "worldtravellerplus77", "ReviewID": "UR41072546", "Content": "Was really surprised with this hotel.

The location is superb: 2 blocks from the red line, 1 block off Mag Mile (not on it!), and walking distance to everything. Bus to Boystown (#36) is 1/2 block away on State Street. I was greeted on my very late arrival by a very friendly and accommodating front desk staff who happily granted my request for an upper-floor room. The lobby of the hotel is dark and very soothing; like walking into a calm retreat. The halls of the guest rooms are also darker toned. I never saw a maid's cart except my last day, when I was checking out late; I dont know how they do that. Every staff member was so polite and courteous, from the concierge on down. Housekeeping was excellent. I got a refrigerator in my room at no extra charge. The bathroom is spotless and very spacious, with a nice corner glass shower. There is EXTRA ample storage space for clothes and shoes in both the closets and dressers--unusual these days! Best of all, the room was extremely quiet and the bed was a dream, and I am very picky about those things. Special kudos to the very busy concierge who nonetheless gave me knock-out directions to everything I needed (I dont remember her name, but she was working Friday 9/5/09 late morning). Ok, if I had to say something negative, it is that the 'gym' is about the size of a broom closet, but I have very low expectations of gyms in hotels, so it is par for the course.

I have found that booking a suite in a Sofitel is not cheap, especially bearing in mind that we used to spend $40 per night for a motel room when travelling with the kids. However returning to a Sofitel suite after a hard days sightseing is an absolute pleasure. Their beds really are like marshmallows.The Water Tower Suite was much larger than our New York Suite and a real thrill. 17 floors up with glass walls was a bit of an eye opener for this Brit. The lounge was large with 2 couches, desk and a large 40\" widescreen Plasma, mini bar, and footstools. The bathroom was my wifes favourite, separate bath, shower and WC, glass doored inside, with all amenities. When I rang housekeeping about our hairdryer a new one was brought within 10 minutes. We took advice from trip advisor members and avoided an apparently expensive hotel breakfast instead grabbing a bagel etc nearby. We used 'Tempo', almost next door, once for breakfast but found ther portions just too big to handle and a bit of a waste of money for the average UK appetite. We ate at the hotel on our last morning and wished we had eaten there more often, especially the basket of pastries. I urge you to eat there early in your stay, I wish I had. Buy a 'Go Chicago' Card for at least 5 days, excellent value. Use the Italian restaurant on Main St, opposite 'Chilis' its cheap and magnificent. My only complaint about the Sofitel , and I raised it with them so have no qualms about listing it here, is that they expected me to pay for Wi Fi even when paying $300 per night for a room! Get real! For the cost of a cup of coffee I could go to the ING Cafe across the road or Starbucks around the corner and get it for free! It's time premium hotels started to be realistic about this, and to be honest it left me with a bad taste in my mouth that after taking $300 per night, excluding breakfast, they would hook up with a service provider and try for another $7.50 per day. In conclusion the room was great, the location was excellent, use the Chicago Card, do the walking tour for the architecture, visit the Frank Lloyd Wiright studio and tour and you'll relish your time in Chicago.

I've stayed at the Sofitel in Washington, DC, and have been impressed by the chain's balance between being hip and being a functional business hotel. The Chicago Water Tower location succeeded on both fronts. The lobby is dark and the decor is pretty hip without being too minimalistic or trying too hard. It's going to be hip for a guy who's used to staying at the Westin or Hilton but for a guy who's used to the W, it's gonna be more businesslike. Check-in was efficient, and the front-desk staff address you by name and ask if you have stayed with them before. Rooms are fairly spacious, with a very comfortable bed and decent toiletries from L' Occitane. Desk space is pretty good, and there is good closet space for longer stays. Rooms are quiet, and you have a good amount of privacy and quiet, even though you're in a fairly busy/hip area. The bathroom has a separate tub and shower, so you can take your shower while your girl soaks in a tub. Room service was decent. I had some kind of club sandwich with some tasty fries. There is a minibar in the room, which is reasonably stocked. I think there is ice service on all floors, as well. When checking out, I realized I had one bag too many and might get stopped if trying to do everything as carry-on, so while checking out at 4:30 a.m., I asked the concierge to ship my computer bag back to me. No problem, they said, and they directed housekeeping to pull the bag and e-mailed me the tracking number soon after. A very nice touch! I would definitely come back here.

I'm someone who is fortunate enough to travel fairly frequently in the U.S. and I go to Europe twice a year. I get to stay in some in very nice places, but this hotel is probably my favorite. i guess I like this place because it's rather upscale, but not in a stuffy way. The building itself is one of the major positive aspects of staying here. It is a beautiful, contemporary high rise. The rooms I've stayed in have always been in immaculate condition and have very nice, spacious marble bathrooms. This is a hotel that may not be right for everyone -- the design aesthetic is very modern. It also doesn't seem to offer rooms with twin beds. The rooms seem to all have king-size beds. But if having two beds isn't a requirement and you don't want traditional decor, this place is hard to beat. Everything about the physical facility of this hotel is really very good. I noticed on this stay that the door to my room has rubber seals around the door frame and a seal on the bottom of the door to help control noise from the hallway. I'm here in mid-July and the air conditioning in the room is great. I can set it to nearly frosty, if I want. There are a lot of elevators for a hotel of this size and I've never had to wait for an elevator for more than a few minutes. Compared to some of the hotels I've stayed in Chicago with problematic older buildings, this place is just immeasurably better. This evening I had dinner in Cafe des Architects, the hotel restaurant, and was very pleased with the good food and gracious service. The prices at the restaurant aren't cheap, but for dining in a first class hotel the prices seem very reasonable. I've found breakfast here to be very nice and the staff seems fully aware that you may require prompt service at breakfast. I've found good prices for this hotel at the Sofitel web site. I'm currently staying here for about $215 per night, for three nights, with a special deal for a $50 dollar hotel credit for dining, etc. The room I'm in is a deluxe king on a high floor with a terrific city view. Compared to other places I've stayed in Chicago, this seems to be a very good deal. A lot of the major chains with hotels in Chicago are as expensive, or more expensive, and they have lousy, outdated, rundown old buildings. There are, of course, some very nice ultra high-end hotels in Chicago. But for those of us who don't want to spring for the cost of the Park Hyatt or the Peninsula (both of which are in the same neighborhood as the Sofitel), I think the Sofitel Water Tower is a really good deal.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Great Location\u201d", "Author": "1OffTown", "ReviewID": "UR34628717", "Content": "We stayed at the Sofitel Water Tower in Chi-town for our anniversary weekend. I chose this hotel after a month of researching many hotels in the area. We had heard from people that the Sofitel in DC was a very nice place to stay and after reading the reviews on this one we decided to try it. The lobby of the hotel is very nicely decorated and the staff was helpful. Our suite on the 33rd floor had a good city view and the modern style of the room was pleasant as well (I am an interior designer and pretty picky about decor). We also liked the fact that the plasma TV was on a swivel so we could watch it from the sofa, or from the bed. The bathroom was nice, and although the shower was a bit on the small side, I enjoyed the L'occitane (French I assume) spa products offered. The icing on the cake for me though was the bar in the hotel. The atmosphere there was like no other, I could have stayed in there the entire time and they make a great dirty martini. The only complaint I can think of is that the waitress in the bar area couldn't find the NBA semi-finals on the TV in the bar area. She searched for a while then came and told us that she guessed they didn't have TNT. We were a bit shocked because we had just been watching it in our room before we came down. That was certainly minor, so it just goes to show you how well we enjoyed the hotel. The location was great as we were able to walk up to Michigan Ave in about 2 minutes and we walked to the Navy Pier in about 25.

Although I lived in Chicago for six years, I've been away for nearly as long. Therefore, I assumed from the hotel's name \"Sofitel at the Chicago Water Tower\" that it was actually in the Water Tower Building. That of course is the Ritz, and the Sofitel is actually a block or two away. When we got up to our room, I was a bit disappointed as I had imagined a true suite with a separate bedroom where we could put our kids to sleep and close the door. When I called the front desk, they indicated that they did have such rooms, but it would be a $50 upgrade/night. We decided to do it, even though we were already paying over $200/night. I'm very glad we did. The the second room was much larger, and we did end up putting the kids to bed and spending the evening talking with friends. One of our friends was pregnant and ended up going into labor that night right in our room. We were able to get her over to Northwestern very easily while her husband went and grabbed the bag with all of their supplies. The comforts of the room were very nice to have in that situation. The only disappointment came when we called housekeeping around 1 PM to have them put sheets on the rollaway bed so our daughter could nap. They indicated they would bring them right up. I called again after 20 minutes, and they seemed surprised that I wanted them right away, but assured me someone was on the way. The concierge even called five minutes later to see if someone had brought them. Unfortunately, we still didn't have the sheets. After ninety minutes, we still didn't have any sheets and it was too late for her to take a nap. I called the manager (Jeff) later in the day to explain the situation. He was very apologetic, and assured me that he would personally make sure the sofabed was made up before we returned from dinner.

The hotel is a bit mis-named since the Water Tower is at least 5-6 blocks away and you can't even see it from the hotel, but that is fine. The hotel is close enough to the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave to be convenient but far enough away that the traffic is light and the pace is a lot quieter. It is across from a lovely small park and just a few blocks from the nightlife on Rush Street and the condos and rowhouses of the Gold Coast. So a very nice spot to be. Our room on the 30th floor had a commanding view and was very nicely appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable and inviting. Modern art, a flat screen TV, a large desk and an lounge chair with footstool completed the room. The bathroom was very nice with lots of marble, nice lighting and nice amenities. Bring your own washcloth though as they only offer little mitts that may work well in the large tub but are not much use in the shower. Things that were missing that were a little surprising at a hotel of this caliber were a morning newspaper and no in room coffeemaker or free coffee in the lobby. And while the complimentary bottles of Evian water that accompanied the turndown service were welcome, so would have been some chocolates or mints. Check in service was very professional with the desk clerk even walking around the counter and into the lobby to welcome you and hand you your key card. We had an even numbered room and while it had nice city views, we suspect the views would be better on the odd number rooms since they would face Michigan Ave and Lake Michigan. A very nice place to stay. In the neighborhood we would recommend Bistro 110 and Devon Seafood Grill for closeby dining and the Lux Bar off nearby Rush Street for breakfast starting at 8 am.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSplendid location and overall feel\u201d", "Author": "BrentD", "ReviewID": "UR34024877", "Content": "I had booked this hotel directly in November of 08 as a gift to my 11 yr old son for one of his Christmas presents. He had always wanted to go to a Chicago Cubs game, and I had never been to Wrigley Field, so really we both got to experience something we have had to yet. Let me start by saying I have stayed in 5 star and 2 stars in my life. I travel all over the world, and you can check my reviews of most of my recent travels. I have rarely complained and feel am a good source for travelers. I chose this hotel due to its' reputation, location and service record. I feel I am not too picky, but do ask that if you tell me you can provide a service, that one should adhere to it. Upon booking this room, I requested a king bed and roll away for our 11 year old. Was told in Novemeber that this would not be a problem over the phone. I then in March called again to confirm our reservation and again requested that there be a roll away for our son. A lady named Bianaca emailed me that \" there would be no problem in getting a roll away and there was no problem\".I also kept a copy of this email. So, I was rest assured upon driving 4 hours thand arriving at 11 am all was ok. The hotel itself is wonderful. I felt it was a cross between a Sofitel and a \"W\" hotel. Very modern, angular and clean. Valet was wonderful, and service was very good throughout. Upon entering the vibe was relaxing. Outdoor eating area, inside bar and lounge. Very nice, again like a \"W\". We were greeted promptly by the front desk, and I was given a room right away. Impressive as we were early arrivals. I also asked her to verify that we needed a rollaway. She seemed surprised, I showed her my email, etc...and said no problem. I said we were in no hurry, as we were to get a bite to eat, and got shopping on Michigan, and anytime before 9 pm for the roll away would be fine. We went to our room on the 25th floor. Fast elevators, very clean. Entered our room, it was well appointed, huge bed, plasma, electric powered blinds, and a marble bathroom, that was to die for. The bathroom was 9 by 14 feet and had a tub, huge walkin marble shower, and nice toiletries. Well stocked towels and refridge. Very happy with the room, but the mirrored closet doors kept coming off track and closet space was minimal. Room safe was easy to operate and the provided robes and slippers (altough not used by us) were a nice touch. We unpacked and went down to the restaurant in the outdoor area of the hotel. Very nice, nice kids menu, mostly French. Lunch with drinks(wine) was around $150. Not bad for 3 in a nice hotel and area. We then went off and did some shopping etc. Came back to the room, took a shower and went down to watch the fireworks on The Odyessey ship that we had booked months in advance. After that we went back to the room at about midnight, and there was no rollaway. We called down to the front desk, and they stated they don't have rollaways at this hotel. I said that cant be, I have confirmed twice, along with an email, and again that morning with the front desk. Lets say, we didn't get our rollaway.We set up our son on the floor next to us best we could. The next day we went to a Cubs game, but on the way down I spoke with the concerige, stipulating this whole story once again, telling her I don't want an upgrade, I don't want anything free, all I want is to explain that I was deeply dissapointed that we have been lied to about the rollaway. She then said they DO have roll aways, and I told her, it is beyond that point, our son has made his \"nest \" on the floor and I just wanted them to know I was not happy with the \"run around\" and wanted to just \"vent\" and wanted nothing in return. We ended up going to the game, shopped and came back and took showers and went to Hugo's Frog down the street on Rush. Very nice, simular food to Morton's but a laid back atmosphere. Great service and nice vibe. Came back to the hotel , and room service got us extra towels, turned down the bed and made our son's \"nest\" a little nicer.(Thank you) That was a nice touch. Check out and valet were extremely fast. I must give a big thanks to Heather to whom was working with us throughout our stay and some prior. What a great person, and asset.

There is a breakfast place on the corner of the block called 'The Goddess' which serves good coffee, filled croissants, bagels etc. We also visited L'Apetitio many times which is a fab little Italian deli at the bottom of the John Hancock Centre (5mins walk from the hotel on the Mag Mile) - they have yummy toasted sandwiches, croissants, muffins and coffee and you can fill up for a lot less than the cost of a hotel breakfast.

There is something about the Sofitel chain that I feel makes them really wonderful places to stay around the world. I usually stay at Sutton Place Hotel or here and this hotel is better. It's just something they do that makes it better than a lot of other 4 star hotels. Rooms are oh so clean - no dust that you might find in other places. Bathrooms are PRISTINE. Size of room is large but the design still makes the room cozy - just a different feel than your standard avg. hotel room. The hallways and elevators are beautifully decorated and the view from the 17th fl is amazing! The beds have featherbeds so their uber comfy and rooms offer plenty desk space if you are working. The hotel charges for wi-fi in rooms but Tmobile is cheaper per day you can get too. There's a level of quality that makes this hotel my fave in Chicago. There are other cuter more boutique hotels that actually fit my style but Sofitel has for me always been clean, service friendly and consistent most importantly. I like that the staff is courteous, helpful and friendly - professional - w/o trying to be your friend which some hotels do.

I probably spend an average of 15 nights per year there and have never been disappointed. The location is great - just one block from Michigan Avenue, Water Tower Place, and Two blocks from the high end fashion on Oak Street. Also easy walking distance to Gibson's, The Whiskey Bar, Level night club, Le Coloniale restaurant, and the really rowdy party district up at the end of Rush Street. You will not hear a sound once inside your room. The staff is very attentive without being pushy (I can cary my own bag, thank you). I am often surprised when the parking valet or one of the desk staff remember my name even when I haven't been to the hotel in several weeks. The lobby is spacious and modern and has a great vibe. A very international clientelle stay here. The rooms are well appointed, I believe they all now have flat screen HDTV. The feel is luxurious contemporary and the bed is perhaps the best anywhere. Just crawl under that big Frette comforter, pile up the pillows, and you'll never want to leave. Bathrooms are fantastic. Cream marble and blonde maple finishes. The best designed vanity mirror/light anywhere. Good shower pressure (some bathrooms on outside walls can take a long time to get hot water in winter months) and very nice bath product. All rooms are of a nice size. The upgrade to \"executive\" (or whatever they call it) gets you a larger work desk and small seating area. Most of these rooms also have a separate tub and shower. If you splurge on a suite, ask for a room ending in 01 or 08. The 01 rooms are on the triangular point of the hotel and have a nice living area separated from the bedroom. Each of these rooms is somewhat unique, as the corner of the building expands the higher up you go. The 08 rooms are even larger still and have an even larger bathroom with separate toilet room, shower, bath tub (no Jacuzzi) and lots of room to spread out. Unforttunately, over the years, many highrise buildings have been built around the hotel, and lake views are very limited. There are still some great views of the city. Le Bar downstairs is a very good spot for cocktails and often has great scenery no matter what your gender or orientation. You can also get dinner served here from Les Architects, the hotel restaurant. Les Architects has always been a good restaurant. However, they brought in a new chef aboout a year ago and the quality has improved significantly. Some VERY good food here. If you want to camp in the room without using room service, there is a Potash Bros. market just behind the hotel and a very nice wine and gourmet food store as well. If you have stayed at the Sofitel in Rosemont near O'Hare and were unimpressed - so was I. The Water Tower Place location is 100 times nicer. I also recommend The James hotel in this same general part of the city.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas TX", "Title": "\u201cBest place in downtown chicago, and i've tried a few\u201d", "Author": "dottie dog", "ReviewID": "UR27399984", "Content": "this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago, and I've been to this hotel at least 4 times. the rooms are clean, wonderfully designed and comfortable.

The room had everything except a coffee maker. If you need coffee in the morning, you can get complimentary coffee downstairs in the restaurant downstairs (which happens to be very good) starting at 6am. If you are on a tight budget, don't look to the hotel bar to save any $$. It's good but expensive. I agree with everyone else--the Tempo cafe at the end of the block is the place to go for a hearty breakfast. Please note, they only take cash. There is also a Starbucks around the corner. For dinner, I highly recommend walking a few blocks to Pizzeria Due for their classic Chicago deep-dish pizza. It's about $10 and you'll have to wait 30 minutes. It's worth every minute!

I have had the privilege of staying at a number of hotels across the world, including fantastic hotels in Las Vegas, but I can honestly say this was one of the best hotels I have stayed in.

Everything was nearby including Jazz Clubs, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153famous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pancake House and also convenience stores.

The beds were like a giant marshmallow, fantastically comfortable and the rooms were so quiet it was the best sleep I have had in a hotel (although I am not sure whether or not we had guests next door). Hotel Bar - Comfortable with a selection of beers, cocktails and food, although it is not as hip and lively as their website makes out. Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This was second to none. First class including concierge, reception, and bar staff. In fact there were literally dozens of staff on hand to assist with anything including holding the main doors open for you. The only criticism was that the room keys constantly malfunctioned, denying entry to the room. Other guests experienced this too and I was told by reception it is because they become de-magnetised if held next to a mobile (cell) phone. Well this has not happened at any other hotel and I never carry my mobile phone when on holiday, so this was not the reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so this is something for them to address.

The reception/lobby/bar area is very spacious and grand, it is all so chic and contemporary inside it's gorgeous. In the evening and and night they light scented candles throughout the lobby which smell divine.

The room was a generous size, with a generous size bathroom and it was all decorated to the highest contemporary standard. We had a chaise lounge and a flat screen TV too. The best part of the room though has to be the bed. I have never slept in a more comfortable bed in my life, it was amazing. The hotel itself has a great location, it's just a few minutes walk from the John Hancock Centre and the Magnificent Mile. I was a bit concerned after reading a couple of negative reviews that the staff were snooty if you didn't dress the right way or look monied. We are just 2 regular 30-somethings who dress very casually in jeans and t-shirts and we had just got in from an 8 hour flight so didn't look great. The staff were very friendly and pleasant and they were throughout our stay, very helpful and pleasant. It's excellent value for money for such a high-class standard of hotel. I have relatives that live in the Chicago area and they have friends and family who have stayed in other 'major' hotels which are more costly and a lesser standard than this.

Here are our observations: Positive: 1. The hotel is located in the very upscale, beautiful Gold Coast of the city, two blocks from Michigan Avenue, and also a few blocks from the beach. 2. Every aspect of every management and employee-level worker at the hotel was professional, gracious, friendly and accommodating to a fault. 3. The hotel interior is beautiful, modern and elegant without any hint of excess or phony snobbiness. 4. Our room (27th floor) was spacious, extraordinarily clean, and ethereally quiet. We had a view of the city and Lake Michigan. The bed was by far the most comfortable we've ever experienced, and the marble bathroom with separate shower was purely decadent. All of the usual luxury-level hotel amenities were provided, including the usual toiletries, a very powerful hair dryer, robes, slippers, iron, ironing board, fully-stocked minibar, large electronic safe, 40\" flat-screen TV, a desk with hookups for internet, etc. 5. Some niceties were provided upon our arrival, including a cheese platter, fruit, chocolates, and bottled water. 6. The restaurant (Cafe Des Architectes) provided wonderful service and abundant , 5-star food. Our room came with breakfast included. When we opted to have only coffee one morning because we had brunch plans elsewhere, we received a $30 credit on our hotel bill for not eating, a very thoughtful (and virtually unheard of) gesture. 7. The bar (Le Bar) was also very accommodating for late-night drinks, food and desserts. It was crowded and hopping until 2am nightly, yet we got a table and fast, friendly service both visits Negatives: 1. There was no coffee-maker in the room. We were quite surprised at this, considering the plethora of other amenities offered. 2. Contrary to what we were led to believe, the hotel charges $10/day for internet access. 3.

The lack of a coffeemaker was perhaps a slight inconvenience, but honestly, it's Chicago -- there's a Starbucks on every other corner. The location is within walking distance of many restaurants and shops (only a block and a half away from the Ghirardelli chocolate shop -- a great plus for any chocoholic :)), including all the craziness of Michigan Avenue. We found the staff to be very friendly and polite. The only problem we encountered was a miscommunication between the front desk and the valet one morning when we wanted to pick up our car. Somewhere between our call to the front desk and the front desk's call to the valet, our request for our car was lost and we ended up standing outside for several minutes, wondering if the valet had lost our car. But as soon as we returned to the front desk to inquire about the delay, we were offered an apology and the valet rushed our car out to us very quickly.

I appreciated the 24hr gym with the tv screens fitted to all the cardio equipment, and the free fresh fruit (apples & bananas) in the gym was a nice touch. The \"turn down\" service in the evening was also a nice gesture - bottle of evian water each, and re-making of the bed. The \"business centre\" downstairs with free internet access came in very handy. The staff at the front desk and doormen were generally very helpful and friendly. There were only 3 faults i could find. The first (minor one) was that housekeeping only left enough shower gel/shampoo for one person daily even though there were two of us in the room! The second was that heating was controlled by a vent which was a bit noisy, so needed to turn off the heating at night or else the noise from the vent would keep you awake. The room still remained reasonably warm though. And the third, most significant one, was that their restaurant downstairs, had virtually no vegetarian options for breakfast or evening meals!! However, we found an excellent vegetarian restaurant about 10 min walking distance called \"Karyn's Cooked\" on 738 N Wells Street. The food was so amazing we ended up having most of our meals there!

Skip the hotel's breakfast offerings and head to Tempo's. Check in was quick and uneventful. Our room was on the 22nd floor and had a nice view of the Hancock. But the only downside of the room was this nasty noxious cleaning spray housekeeping uses - and they visit your room twice a day. Each time we'd enter the room, this poisonous cloud of orange smelling cleaning would attack our senses. If we had stayed longer, I would have probably called down and asked for our room not be to cleaned. Oh, this is the reason I'll never stay there again: $9.95/day internet access. [-] T-Mobile access that you have to constantly log back in to. The beds were comfortable, but the robes were not.

I was expecting a very high standard considering the website and the masses of positive reviews on TripAdvisor. It's situated very well: short walks to the main shopping areas and great bars/restaurants (gold coast). It is a very modern and clean hotel with an impressive lobby, albeit very dark and glossy! The room did not \"wow\" me and my friend when we checked in. Having paid over $950 for 3 nights (room only) I was expecting a larger more luxurious room. For two girls sharing, there was not enough room for all our luggage. Having said that the bathroom was immaculate with a great fog free mirror, the bed was extremely comfortable and nice touches such as Evian water at turndown was nice. The decor was modern, clean and tasteful with a cool chaise longue in the corner of the room. We used the room as a base, so didn't see much of the hotel, apart from the very small bar for a quick drink one evening. (Lots of city type customers and extremely noisy). As a Brit abroad I miss having the opportunity to have a hot drink in my room first thing in the morning and at bedtime, and I refuse to pay room service prices for a cup of tea or coffee. But Starbucks are a plenty! We did ask the concierge for some advice on things to do inside (as it was bitterly cold) and some of the information was not correct, with regards to museums etc. I would advise checking the websites of museums and art galleries before you travel. It will save you unnecessary taxi rides and long walks! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. It does what is says on the tin! After having completed an online hotel questionnaire I was emailed directly by the manager with regards to the room size and have been offered an upgrade on my next stay. Its worth telling hotels what you think of them as soon as possible, so they can rectify problems quickly and keep you as a future customer. One further piece of advice for British travellers - if you plan to present your debit card at check-in, the hotel will want to take a refundable amount off your card. They wanted to charge me $1000 for a 3 night stay, which left me reeling (and also short of a lot of spending money!) Fortunately the check in staff only charged me the minimum of $125.

Not even equipped with flat screen televisions. Hubby commented on that right away. So odd. The sitting room was all 'art deco' and was not very 'welcoming' really. Would have been perfect if we had been hosting people for drinks or something, which we were not, but the area was not very comfortable to just 'hang out in.' The TV was placed so far away from the couch that faced it, that the whole scheme of the 'sitting room' didn't make much sense. The location of the hotel is good. It's a couple of blocks from the 'top' of the Magnificent Mile of shopping, but not far from everything if you are up to a walk and are in good health. Definitely go next door to the Tempo Grill for breakfast. It's fast and very good! The highlight of the Sofitel is the excellent concierge. One of them (named Jackie) actually got us an extra last minute ticket to a sold-out Second City show (we had tickets but needed one for a friend.) All of our interactions with the concierge at this hotel were top notch. All in all, it's a nice hotel. It's well decorated and very attentive staff. However, the little things like not having a view of the lake (from most rooms,) not having a daily newspaper delivery, and not being right on the Mag. Mile, are detractors when you are paying what we were paying. I don't feel like I wasted my $$ but I do feel that I could have gotten more for less (if that makes sense.)", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westlake, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cClean, beautiful and friendly\u201d", "Author": "velvis", "ReviewID": "UR8454466", "Content": "It is one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed at--and I'm very picky.

She made up for the others, although the laissez-faire trait came out a tad---oh to be in Paris again. The room was decent, not huge but deluxe in many ways. The doors to the bathroom were double wooden doors, the bath itself was huge and opulent. The desk could have been more functional, in more of a \"glad they thought of that\" sort of a way. The concierege was outstanding. Overall, I liked this place, The Millenium Knoickerbocker I stayed at a while back was horribly old and noisy and just below par for what she should have been. The Peninsula nearby has to be one of my all-time favorites in Chicago. That place has it all-modernity, cleanliness, service, coolness---just a great place.

The room was simple and modern, but very pleasing to the eye. We were on the 10th floor with a view of the buildings (Hancock tower was viewable) and a small courtyard/park next to the hotel.

Full size hair dryer was supplied (not the connected to the wall mini kind!!), separate tub. And there are speakers in the bathroom so you can hear the TV in the bedroom! Magnified mirror in the bathroom (helpful for shaving to my boyfriend!) along with a live bamboo plant in the bathroom. The lounge is nice, very modern with a good vibe, but currently allows smokers which was a disappointment. STRONG martinis, but very attentive service to go along with it. Great atmosphere. Didn't eat at the Cafe des Architectes but hear it's very good. There is a small adorable boutique shop that is just adorable and has wonderful items available including soaps, lotions, jewelry, intimates and novelty books.

Arrived at Midway & took the train to the hotel (had one super easy transfer with elevators for luggage and got off at Chicago and walked all of a block to the hotel), as a matter of fact we pretty much exclusively used public transportation all weekend except for one night to dinner. The weather all weekend was not to be beat, so of course that helped the overall experience\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we checked in with ease. Got a really sweat deal on the Sofitel website that included breakfast for two in the $275/nite cost & it was well worth it!. To my surprised we were booked on the top floor, 32nd. Fabulous views, request this if you can. The room was immaculate, bathroom was over the top with all the marble and oversized shower. And most importantly the bed was comfortable, not the best I have ever slept on for this price, but the feather top made it nice. The only complaint here would be that they did not have down pillows, most hotels at this level do. But honestly that is the only thing I can find to complain about. This is a very international hotel with guests from all over the world, which makes it fun and interesting. The lobby and public spaces are modern but very comfortable. The bar was hopping every night, very much a lounge setting. I did use the wireless for my computer and they use T-mobile at $10 a day, this is not included in the room fee (they also have hard wire connections). The highlight was started each day with breakfast (for no additional charge!) everyday. Its not one of those insane buffets, you order from the menu and literally whatever you want. Order eggs, pancakes and French toast? Yup, they take it all off the check at the end. They have indoor and outdoor seating as well. Oddly enough, I got a message on the phone one afternoon that our breakfast was comped because we had to wait a bit that morning to get our order taken and were sorry for that. that is the act of a hotel that takes its business seriously. The only issue I had was that when we checked out all the tips I had left at breakfast were wiped out along with the food costs, so I had them add the money back to my bill as they apparently all pool tips. The service at the hotel was quite attentive, from the restaurant to the doormen, with one exception\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. We have found that one of the best ways to see almost any city is on a bicycle, and Chicago is no exception. We covered so much ground in one day it was insane, and you are not so exhausted at the end of the day you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit up for dinner. So the bed hotel incident was when we came back to the hotel at one point to grab something one of the valets coming out of the garage with a car almost took out my boyfriend on the bike, it was so close he had to drop the bike in front of the car and get out of the way, the guy just did not look before he pulled out like a bad out of hell. No one was hurt and I am not all that sure the valet understood what happened as his English was rather limited. That was the only issue, there are a lot of people coming & going in that area, their entrance is fairly tight, so they should just be more careful in general. So, the bike tour\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6first I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about the Chicago Greeter program! This is a service the city offers where you can hook up with someone that lives in Chicago that will give you a personalize tour for free! Who better to show you the town than the locals?! You can pick from a variety of tours or request your own, which is what I did. We asked for a bike tour of neighborhoods. You can certainly get these from the bike touring companies (and I have done those before) but nothing beats the personal service and touch of this program. Aside from its FREE, as in their service if free and the bike rental was free, insane! They get the bike from the same company everyone else rents but the fee is waived through the greeter program. Who knew! We took the train down to the park and walked the rest of the way. Marshall was there waiting for us and we got on our way. Interesting to note on this Chicago Greeter program \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they like you to book at least 2 weeks in advance and it was needed for the custom program I requested (no big deal) but they all have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greeter on demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (or something like that) on the weekends, so you can go in there and get someone if they are available. I think there are like 200 volunteers in this program, many of them retirees, and its just a really fun way to learn more about the city as opposed to some canned script. We toured around for about 2+ hours and saw much of Chicago that I had not seen before. Again, on the bike you can see all of Grant and Millennium Parks in a fraction of the time to walk it, and stop along the way when you like. Also, what is fabulous about Chicago is Mayor Daley and his serious commitment to biking as transportation. There are bike lanes on streets, racks on all buses, bike route map for the city streets and bike directional signs on the streets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it makes a big difference. You can really feel comfortable that even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the city you can make your way around without being too intimidated. From there we then rented the bikes for another 4 hours (this we had to pay for) and rode all over the place. We trekked out to Wicker Park and Bucktown, we definitely got the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153neighborhood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel out there. Walked through a mass of eclectic shops & had a bite and headed back through Lincoln Park (lots of nice shopping) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very nice area. Then through more parks and out to the shore and then returned the bikes. It was awesome fun! So much we would have never seen on foot alone. For highlights on the weekend we went to one of the most expensive restaurants of my life, Spiaggia, but the food & service was pretty darn excellent. They do courses, which I love, because you get to try so many flavors without being so full you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t breath at the end of the evening. The waiter even suggested a great wine that was under $100, no small task when bottles went as high as $800+. Was a great way to kick off the weekend on the first night. Around the corner from the hotel on Rush St is Downtown Dog, a take out hotdog place that is just the bomb, always have to hit that when I go to Chicago. One night was dinner up Rush Street at Carmines (I thin) it was really late when we ate so finding a place was not that easy, food was great, I have been there before as well. One night we headed south of the Loop to the Chicago Firehouse in search in steak. This place is nice, an old firehouse that has been restored, very cool space & also has outdoor seating. The food as good, not over the top fabulous, but the change of scenery was nice, apparently Mayor Daley moved down to this emerging part of town and hangs there a lot. Our waiter Noel was excellent, has been there since they opened, the service all around was quite good. And closed it out with a game at Wrigley field! Great fans and the mini-stadium seating on top of the houses surrounding the ball park was something you have to see in person!", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cModern, clean and fun\u201d", "Author": "Trav_Junkie", "ReviewID": "UR8217051", "Content": "If you're gonna stay in downtown Chicago, you're likely going to pay over $200/night.

I was a little nervous when I initially read a couple of adverse comments regarding security in the rooms, however this was never an issue. We were on the 26th floor and had a glimpse of the lake which was very pleasant, the room was very spacious, a wonderful large bed, very comfortable and a superb bathroom with a separate walk in shower. The location is excellent, within a five minute walk of Bloomindales, Macys, loads of restaurants and bars. The beach is also within easy walking distance. We used the fitness room in the hotel which was small but adequate. There is a small business centre on the 2nd floor which provides free internet access, great for keeping in touch and online check in. A good tip I read on Tripadvisor was to become a Sofitel Loyalty Customer, you get a free drink on the house which could be anything you fancy, my wife had a champagne cocktail for $14! There are also one or two other little extras like late check out. We did not eat in rthe restaurant as there is a wonderful little deli about 50 yards away called Guess, I think, next door to Cru, which was excellent.

From there on... Room: The Deluxe Suite was nice, but not as \"deluxe\" as I had expected. Some of the furniture and the walls had signs of wear and tear. There was not enough closet space for people who are travelling with a lot of stuff (2 suitcases), and we had to place clothes just about everywhere. At some point we even had to use the cupboard that contained the mini bar to store some clothes. The bathroom had a nice glass enclosed shower, but a very small bathtub.

The next day, the maid cleaned the room, but did not touch the glasses. Maybe washig glasses is not part of their duties... Value: We paid about $400 per night for the suite. I don't feel that it was worth it, primarily because all the suite gave us was a little extra room, but no extra bathroom space, no extra storage space. I do not feel that this was a great value for money. Cleanliness: No issue. We did not find anything wrong in this department. Overall: A very nicely decorated hotel, with a near perfect location.

The hotel was nothing extraordinary. The front desk was cordial but not particularly friendly, knowledgable or helpful when asked about the town, or for recommendations for dining or sightseeing. We were given a standard room \"with a lake view\" - between buildings. Be forewarned that the walls of the room are thin, and the water pressure in the shower is adequate but not particularly strong. The most disappointing part of our room was its cleanliness - or lack thereof. The carpet was dirty and furniture was dusty. I informed both the front desk and housekeeping and asked if it could be addressed while we were out for the afternoon - both were defensive and argued that the room was clean, but they would \"look into it.\" When we returned in the evening, it looked exactly the same - dingy. We had breakfast in the restaurant (Cafe de Architects) one morning. While the food was good the service was slow and we had to ask for coffee refills every time. As for coming and going - it was interesting. While there appeared to be at least 3 or 4 doormen, bellmen or porters available near the front door at a given time, rarely did any of them open the door or acknowledge arriving or departing guests. This has an interesting effect inside the hotel. Once guests are inside, they could be subjected to \"random checks\" by \"security personnel\" who were NOT in uniform and did NOT identify themselves (i.e., badges), but rather aggressively ask to see room keys with the assumption that visitors were vagrants or squattors. When I brought this to the attention of the manager, she shrugged and said that this was policy. While I can appreciate this measure of consideration, it is not handled with the tact or discretion that I have seen in other hotels of this caliber.

Last weekend, I took my wife there for her birthday and we stayed at the Sofitel. I chose to book a room there after reading all the great reviews. After staying for two nights, I can honestly say the Sofitel is a bit overrated. First of all, we spent $260 a night for a cityview room with a king-size bed. We were on the 20th floor, but the room was very small! It was decorated nicely, but my wife and I were pretty unhappy with the size of the room. It was honestly one of the smallest, if not the smallest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. We didn't let that ruin our first evening, however. The next morning (my wife's birthday), we woke up and when trying to brush our teeth, realized that there was no COLD water. For some reason, there was only steaming, scalding water - too hot to even shower in. We called down to the front desk and they sent up a maintenance person. After about 20 minutes, we called back down and asked to change rooms because we wanted to get ready to leave out for the day. The person at the front desk told us to wait a few minutes and they'd call back. After 20 more minutes, the maintenace guy finally fixed the problem and as he was leaving, the front desk called up to tell us we could switch rooms. I informed them that it was too late, but we'd appreciate some type of credit to our account due to the inconvenience. The woman said all she could give us was about $20 off (not much considering we paid $250 a night). The rest of our experience was okay. Oh, except our bed didn't have a sheet on it! We had to call house cleaning to bring one up! Here are some other observations- The GOOD: Very quiet hallways (not a lot of kids running around), good room-service, nice views, large bathrooms The BAD: No connected parking, SMALL ROOMS, not-so-great staff, loud heating/cooling system, over-rated restaurant and over-crowded bar. I just don't see why the Sofitel is so highly rated.

It's just a pity that there is no pool in a new hotel like this one. The bar of the Hotel was very cool and it was the place to meet the Chicagoans. The Breakfast at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 des Architectes was also top. The pastries were like the best in France And nothing to say also about: -the eggs benedict with bacon or crab cakes or just simple -the omelettes -the Belgian waffle -the fruits Just perfect! The deco of the Sofitel is breathtaking. The location is just one block from the magnificient mile (Water Tower Place, Bloomingdale's, Tiffany & co, Ralph Lauren, Armani Exchange, Saks, Neiman Marcus, Apple Store, Nike Town, Nordstrom...) and two blocks from Oak Street (Prada, Tod's, Herm\u00c3\u00a8s, Diesel...) ...and walk away from the major interesting sites of the city. The Check-in/out was with no wait. The information of the Concierge (especially of Heather who spoke French) were very good for all sightseeings and restaurants. The staff of the Sofitel is always with smile and ready for a lot of little attentions that makes your stay the most pleasant as it can be.

No marathon for me :) and I would not have picked a high priced weekend if I had known, but I had booked my airfare first to accomadate a work schedule. I don't mind the crowd so much as the high rate of $275/night, and that was WITH a corporate discount, else rack was over $350. Anyway, I did think it was worth the higher rate because some of the other 2-3* hotels were at least $200. I traveled alone, for a pleasure trip away. FROM AIRPORT: Booked a car service called American Chauffeurs for $42 with tax, one way, about 30 minutes. Taxi would have been about the same. Checked shuttle in advance which would have been about $25 one way but was worried about the longer wait time and drop offs at various hotels. CHECK-IN: The bellmen were quick to bring my luggage in and wait for my check-in. It was right before the 3pm check in time and no issues. I had requested a higher floor which they gave me on 24th floor. The elevator was quick and quiet--ie did not hear rattling and movement if you had a room near it, because it is also setback a bit from the hallway, by design. Clean, sleek, dark, but you could tell right away it was new, modern, and sophisticated. Many of the guests were European (I could hear Dutch, French) and I think there were a few conferences that day from the posting in hotel lobby, but this did not interfere--you could hardly notice because those areas were well concealed. HOTEL LOCATION: Perfect, a block from John Hancock Observatory and the north end of Michigan Mag Mile. I shopped at Filene's, H&M, Marshall's, MaxMara, etc. Some designer bargains to be had at Filene's so look thoroughly. DINING: Loved breakfast there at Sofitel's only restaurant, L'Architecte. It was about $15 for a selection of eggs with meats, and the best basket of french pastries and breads (chocolate croissants, baguette mini, danish, muffin/scone, etc). Or you could get waffles, crepes. Came with fresh squeezed juice and coffee in your own karafe/pot brewed individually. Great service!!! Did not try room service though. I also ate at TEMPO's the diner a few doors down, which was ok, much cheaper (about $6-10). I had asparagus omelette there with coffee and toast for about $9 which was ok. But for $5 more, try Sofitel food! I did like the fact that Tempo is 24 hours so you can have much more there (sandwiches, etc) for cheap. BISTRO 110: Walked there, around corner from Michigan , and food was good, nothing spectacular, other than the bread being served with full roasted garlic cloves. Had oysters as an appetizer, Artichoke dish, and tried the creme brulee for dessert, which is average. Moderate pricing, about $35 total. GIORDANO's PIZZA: Ordered delivery to try a small deep dish, and calamari. Very good, very fast. About $20. BELLA BACINO'S: Ordered delivery when I was at in the loop at Hotel71 (right next door) and while the thin pizza was decent, it would have been better if HOT or a bit more warm. The service was horrible. They forgot my order, I had cold calamari, and the desserts creme brulee and tiramisu were melting away. Promised delivery of 30 minutes and it took 2 hours plus two phone calls with the manager to ask when they left (response was always--15 minutes ago). All this for $30 and I can't recommend unless you dine in there I guess. LE COLONIAL: Vietnamese, I thought, but it is definitely geared for Amer/French and if you are expecting the REAL deal, you will be disappointed. The salads were geared towards American tatses, like using lettuce greens vs. the true style of all julienned carrots and super thinly sliced cucumber mesh. Nice atmosphere--all business types when I was there and not a single Asian person except myself, so you know this is not home cooking when you don't see natives. The Pho was ok, missing the typical meat variation, and the thiet nhuong was served not in the typical rice noodle bowl fashion but on a plate on top of thin banh hoi. Very expensive at $50 for appetizer salad, main dish, and banana tapioca dessert. BACK TO HOTEL: BATHROOM, BED, ROOM: Clean, clean, clean! Spotless. Tub separate from shower. Nice water pressure. The bed has the greatest fluffy pad and feather down duvet. It turned cold that weekend, like 45F at night and 55F daytime, so I had the heater on and it worked wonderfully. Always as hot as I wanted --no limit setting, like with other hotels who give you Warm and Cool, this has actual temperature settings. Never heard much from anyone--the rooms were quiet, the doors didn't shut too loudly, and the views were good, with the large windows. The rooms seemed very small to me, but you don't expect so much space in a city. There was a separate lounge chair and desk area next to the king bed. Turndown service included Evian water and temperature card. Great modern safe to set your own code. I did not use the mini bar nor the internet this time. STAFF: Easy checkout. Very professional people. At times, it did appear there were a lot of bellmen who could have helped some of the folks open the doors as they carted in their luggage...this did not happen to me but I did notice that as I sat in the lounge/lobby waiting for a friend one evening. Mainly business people or those in their 30's and above. Everyone always smartly dressed. Few families here, or if they were here, I didn't notice any kids running around like you have at other hotels. BAR: It was vey popular and busy, even late! It seemed people who were not staying at the hotel, also frequented this spot so it must be a gathering place for friends to have drinks. Nice ambience, and I did not try any of the appetizers here. Other Attractions: I visited Art Institute, $12 admission and about $7 cab ride away. Also, Architectural boat tour with First Lady Co. for $25 and about $6 cab ride away. John Hancock was within walking distance of Sofitel, $10 admission and the best view!! In summary, I would stay here again in a heartbeat, if I could get a discounted rate. Nothing super special that is a MUST SEE in this hotel, but so comfortable and enjoyable that I have to give 5 stars.

We chose the Sofitel based on reviews here and being #1 in the popularity index. We weren't disappointed but we weren't \"WOWed\" by any means! Having said that, by Chicago prices this hotel isn't so bad for what you get. We chose the deluxe rooms where you pay a little extra for a higher floor and we were on the 28th. Good views over the city where we weren't overlooked by neighboring buildings. The room size was okay - I'm not sure how it compares with \"non-deluxe\", but we weren't in Chicago to spend all our time in the hotel! It had a chair with footrest so you could open up the blind on the very large window, sit back and look out over the views if you wanted to. There was also a desk where you could work, but unlike most hotels nowadays, internet connection was an additional $20 for the 3 nights we would be staying. This should be included in the price and not additional. There was enough hanging space, a safe, iron, TV etc, and of course the bed... One thing we were looking forward to was trying out the bed especially after reading all the reviews which mentioned the bed! So jumped onto the bed and.... what are all the reviews talking about!!!??? It may not seem like it but I'm not a hard critic but the bed was.... just a comfortable bed as I would expect in any hotel. No better, no worse. Bathroom was large and clean. If you're going to stay in the room with a non-spouse, beware that the two \"French window\" style doors to the bathroom have a gap in the middle and no lock! So you may want to sing or whistle to remind the other person(s) you're in the bathroom! Shower was great, didn't use the bath. There is a volume control in the bathroom too where you can hear what is on the TV from a speaker under the sink unit. Hotel was clean. Hotel valet parking was $37 a day additional - parking in Chicago is expensive wherever you go. Check in/out was quick and easy.

After checking-in, I was initially a bit disappointed because the room seemed a bit smaller than what I was expecting based on the online photos and I was placed on a lower floor (after requesting an upper... I know, someone has to stay on the lower ones). Overall, the front-desk service was helpful (had one little communication issue with no resolution on the part of the hotel), the basic room was exceptionally clean (lovely bathroom was spotless), bed was very comfortable, and the rest of the hotel property was nice. During our stay, a window above the front entrance shattered and they had to divert people entering the building to a remote side entrance near the bar. No big deal, just inconvenient. Also, I noticed the \"S\" on the Sofitel sign at the top of building had burned out and it looked tacky to see \"-ofitel\". The bar was always hopping and there was a wedding party that added a little additional racousness. On the positive side, we really appreciated the close proximity to Mich Ave shopping, the 24 hour cafe and coffee shops around the corner, and the pleasantly surprising nice meal at Cafe Luciano which was just across the street.

My daughter and I took turns bathing in the beautiful tub, which featured an array of lovely Roger & Gallet products. There is also a separate, enclosed shower stall and separate w.c.

In the other direction are chic boutiques and neighborhood grocery stores. Two restaurants within walking distance: Le Colonial (Vietnamese) and Carmine's (Italian w/sidewalk dining).

The hotel and its common areas (lobby, restaurant, bar) are sophisticated and extremely well-kept.

The hotel rooms are modern and simple in design - great colour combination with lots of light coloured wood including the headboard and bathroom doors. The bathroom is spacious and luxurious - separate bath and shower areas, lots of light coloured marble, plenty of counter space, more than enough big fluffy towels and lovely French bath products. The bed was very comfortable with a special touch -two duvets on the bed - one under the sheet for a really comfy mattress and one on top. However the pillows were overstuffed and not that comfortable. My biggest disappointment was the lack of a coffee maker in the room. If we wanted coffee we had two options. We could order from room service - very expensive once you add on the $3 delivery charge and the 18% service charge! Or we could make a trip down to the restaurant for free coffee that you could take up to your room in a paper cup - not the same as drinking your first cup of coffee from a proper cup while still relaxing in your pyjamas! Seems to be quite a shortcoming for a luxury hotel. Don't spend extra for a room on one of the top six floor - not worth it.

The lobby is chic and more open than some other Sofitels, with a three-story atrium. The front desk staff was very helpful (I was checking in early) and made a room available to me by noon on a sold-out weekend. And it had an amazing view over the John Hancock Center, Mag Mile and Lake Michigan! If you've stayed at other Sofitels, you know what to expect in the rooms: colorful, contemporary and comfortable. The carpet was rust-colored, which was very different but attractive. There was the trademark color-swirl painting on the wall, nice glass-topped bedside tables and a large work desk. There's plenty of drawer/closet space and robes in both the closet and the bathroom, plus a CD player. Speaking of the bathroom--heaven. Large, with a soaking tub and separate shower, shelf space and a large counter. Marble everywhere--and even a bamboo plant! The toiletries are also top-notch French products. As has been noted in other reviews, the bed is almost dangerously comfortable. Plush to the nth degree with better linens than I recall from other Sofitels.

Didn't eat at the restaurant but did have room-service breakfast which was a little overpriced but tasty, attractively presented and delivered on time to the minute.

There's also a subway stop two blocks away. If you're into views, here's a tip: Go to the Bar on 96th at the top of the Hancock Center.

Standing at the corner and gazing at the hotel, I booked the rate. So, just 15 minutes later, I walk back into the Sofitel, up to the same desk clerk, and state my name and that I have a reservation. She was as cold as she could possibly be. So, after all that trouble, was it worth it? The lobby is very hip and trendy, and I could not help but notice the half-dozen \"security\" men in dark suits with earphones lodged in place standing all over the place. I sense that they're placed there more for atmosphere than any real purpose. The room was of modest size, with a king-size bed and a wonderful down comforter. The pillows were plentiful and comfortable. The bathroom was large and nicely appointed. Everything was clean and well-kept. Would I stay here again? Yes, but only if I could get a good rate. I would try any of the Kimpton Hotels first, however, as they're equally lovely, with comparable rooms, with better prices. And their front-desk staffers could definitely serve as an example to the Sofitel clerk.", "Date": "March 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat all around package\u201d", "Author": "rfc_traveler", "ReviewID": "UR3250790", "Content": "This is really an outstanding hotel.

The service was outstanding. The only damper, in fact, on the whole trip, was the fact that my wife had her wallet stolen while shopping at Filene's Basement on Michigan Ave. If I ever find the idiot who did that (not a whole lot of fun getting back through airport security for her without an ID), I'm going to see how they like trying to pick on me instead of my wife.... But I digress. Anyways, the hotel staff was wonderful, trying to help us in any way they could. The location is unbeatable.
