Despite the mob scene of visiting almost any city during spring break, the Ritz provided a respite from the chaos outside the hotel. Our rooms, although not cheap, by 5* status they were reasonable enough that we opted for the club floor, which proved to be a smart decision, as we were able to have breakfast as part of the rate, in addition to a few lunches, and even dinner in the club lounge. There were more than adequate snacks for the kids. We felt like the lounge became our home away from home. I can't say enough about Fabian, the Club concierge and the rest of the staff, who could not do enough for us. They guided us to the right restaurants and even were able to secure tickets to a sold out art show The rooms were spotless, beautifully appointed with a fine view of the Sony Center and Potsdamer Platz. Bathrooms were equally clean with glass enclosed shower and an additional deep tub, and double sinks. This was our second trip to Berlin, and, because of the hotel and its staff, most satisfying.

We had 2 interconnecting rooms. Our rate was really reasonable and included buffet breakfast. We loved the hotel. The location is fantastic with the train station right outside the front door. We hit a little bit of wet weather and so when we wanted to get to the shopping centre which was close by used the underground walkway from the train station to the shops. One night we felt like a movie and across the road was a cinema that showed all movies in English. It was only about a 5 minute walk to the Brandenburg Gate and other really interesting sights. We basically walked everywhere and at the end of the day after lots of walking caught the train back to the hotel. We arrived just before New Years Eve, across the road were Christmas Markets where we went most nights after dinner for a pretzel or other treats. Our rooms were extremely comfortable. We had a room with a king bed and then the second room had two double beds. The bathroom is massive with lovely shampoos and soaps etc. The rooms have DVD players and if you visit Concierge they have a selection of DVDs that you can take up to your room to watch (there is no fee for this). Not a huge amount of English speaking movies to choose from though. The rooms are quite spacious with everything you would need. There was plenty of room for us all, our children were 18, 16, 13. We were always warmly greeted by staff as we either left the hotel for the day or upon our return. In the mornings near the lift there were a selection of biscuits/treats that you could take with you. My youngest son loved the main restaurant for breakfast because behind the front counter were jars and jars of sweets. If you asked the staff member behind the counter they would fill up a bag of sweets (of your choice) for you to take...there was no fee for this. So my son had a bag of sweets to munch on as we toured around Berlin. It was a nice touch. The buffet breakfast was nice, it had basically everything you could ask for with cheeses, sliced meats, salmon, hot food, crepes, breads, fruits, pastries etc. My only minor gripe is the fruit juices, at most buffets that we have been to, you can go up and pour a fruit juice whenever you liked. At the restaurant you had to ask staff for one, if the restaurant was busy it could sometimes take a while to get a juice. The main bar area was nice with a piano play and singer most nights. It is not a huge bar so a lot of the time we had trouble getting a seat and had to sit in the foyer area. The bar prices, like most hotels, were pretty pricey. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast so I can't give any comments on their lunch or dinners. There is a small indoor pool which we used after a long day of walking. The hotel doesn't offer free wifi but around the corner from the hotel is a Starbucks which we would frequent daily to get emails etc. If you are going to Berlin for New Years Eve this is a great hotel as it is so close to the Brandenburg Gate where all the action is. Highly recommend the hotel for a really comfortable stay, where you feel welcomed.

I noted with dismay that ever since then its position had been continually sliding ever downwards! I really had hoped that the recent spate of less than good reviews was down to overly particular guests or the occasional bad experience, which can happen even at the best properties. As I\u2019d booked it through a third party agent (I would advise using a price comparison web-site as I got a far better deal than if I\u2019d booked directly with the hotel) and paid in advance there was no turning back! Before I launch into the full review, I will note that the best thing about this hotel is the breakfast. It is superb, and any criticism would only really come down to very personal taste and would be nit-picking. Everything is catered for \u2013 a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, including berries, and cereals. Lots of different breads, rolls, and even bagels, and a toaster so one can toast whatever selectiong one wishes; there is also an equally large array of jams/conserves to enjoy with the bread. There is a good selection of cold cuts, fish, high quality cheeses, as well as the usual American style hot buffet complete with omelettes made to order. As if this isn\u2019t enough, crepes, American pancakes, French toast, and waffles can all be made to order (at no extra charge). In short, this is an exemplary hotel breakfast in both terms of quality and variety. The service was usually attentive with glasses regularly topped up, but once it started to get busy (around 9.30 onwards, especially at the weekend) one did notice a drop in attention to detail, as well as a queue snaking its way into the bar area. If you are going to stay here, make sure you have breakfast included as it is the major redeeming factor of this property!! Upon arrival, a fur caped doorman opened my taxi door, and swiftly removed the luggage and welcomed me to the hotel. If only things had continued like this\u2026 The girl at the front desk was polite, but far from welcoming as the doorman had been. Things went wrong when she asked for my voucher; I explained that whilst I had booked through a third party I had e-mailed the hotel directly to confirm everything was as it should be and they had never mentioned the need for any voucher. She was very persistent and went away to ask someone else, and still insisted on the voucher. I advised that I could probably dig out an email once I had access to a computer and print it off for them. She still wasn\u2019t really satisfied, and a little huffily said that they would contact the travel agent for another copy. To add to this, I had been travelling since 4am that morning; whilst I did not expect the hotel to specifically know that, the front desk should always be wary that most travellers will always be somewhat weary from their journey! I\u2019d have expected that she\u2019d have checked me in and then contacted me if I had indeed needed to provide the voucher (which as it turned out I didn\u2019t). A bell boy showed me up to my room and was extremely friendly and professional and showed me the various features of the room, how to operate touch-panel light switches etc. This was a thoughtful touch, and much appreciated. The room itself was an huge letdown (I will discuss the rooms in more detail a little later) and the double glazing was far from top quality and a hissing noise could be heard where the window did not seal fully on the hinged side. I complained about this, and they advised someone would look at the window whilst I was out. I returned and the problem was as before and there was no note explaining what had happened. I went to shower and get ready to go out; the box containing the vanity kit was empty which I was not best pleased with. I spoke to the duty manager on my way out and he assured me he would resolve the issue with the window. I returned from dinner, still no note and the hissing sound ever more apparent. I called the guest service department yet again (I am sure they were bored of my calls!!) and they advised that maintenance considered the noise to be normal. I am not someone who requires complete silence, but it was a very particular noise and the room otherwise was pretty quiet so it would\u2019ve been rather noticeable. The next day I returned and was offered a change of room, and a complimentary upgrade, which was a thoughtful gesture. They sent someone up to help with my luggage, the very first room I was showed to smelt very strongly of stale cigar smoke, so that was not going to work! Then I was shown another room which on first impressions seemed to be fine. Whilst I was getting ready to go out for dinner I noticed a tapping sound coming from the entrance/air-con unit. I called guest services who promptly sent up maintenance who advised that it was just fan noise from the hotel\u2019s central air-con which would stop at 10pm. This would of course have been acceptable to me, so I left it at that. I returned long after 10pm to find the air-con grilles covered in duct tape, and the tapping sound was still apparent in the hall. I called for a manager to come and speak to me. He arrived quickly and offered to move me yet again, bearing in mind that I had moved rooms 3 times already I was not best pleased, but left with little alternative. The final room was at least free of irritating noises. Now a little bit on the rooms themselves\u2026 Like the rest of the hotel they feel extremely dated. Given the hotel only opened in 2004 I found it staggering how 1980s in style the d\u00e9cor was; 1980s style geometric \u201ccascade\u201d chandeliers in the corridors, and lots of similarly naff touches. The carpets in the rooms are now worn very thin; if one treads in the corners where hardly anyone walks, one can feel the original deep pile. The furniture is functional, but ugly again. The bathroom is also extremely dated in pink marble, and has some simply bizarre features. The bathtub features a separate hand-shower attachment which is supplied disconnected to the water outlet, and one has to fiddle around to connect it; why?!? This property was built in 2004, bath-tubs have long had retractable handshowers \u2013 hardly a cutting edge solution! The separate shower cubicle had a peculiar corner \u201cseat\u201d which no adult would be small enough to use! Also, the marble counter-top has a glass upper layer, presumably with the intention that the marble isn't marked so easily, instead hard water marks form around the edge of the basin as well as chips showing as light reflects off of the glass; it is yet another bizarre feature as marble on its can always be re-polished and filed down whereas this would need a new glass \"upper\". The beds are made up as standard with a duvet per person i.e. two single duvets on a king bed which might be the local style, but in an international hotel a single duvet as standard and two upon request would be sensible - I had to ask for one duvet in each of the rooms. The lighting was very poor in the bedroom, which is fine for \u201cmood\u201d lighting, but there was no overhead light to make it bright. Even the bathroom could\u2019ve done with being a little brighter. The touch panel light controls are backlit by bright blue LEDs which do give out quite a bit of light when all the other lights are off and curtains drawn. The rooms were completely devoid of any thoughtful touches. The so called spa area was diabolical. On their web-site they advertise it as a La Prairie spa, it no longer is. They have a few treatment rooms but these are all locked up, unless one books in advance and they order in a therapist as there are none employed full time in house. The pool is literally the size of a postage stamp; the jet stream - which would\u2019ve enabled one to swim more than two strokes before having to turn - was not functioning with enough power to be effective. There is also a Jacuzzi, and sauna area with a hot and not quite so hot sauna. Most people went straight from their rooms to the \u201cspa\u201d in their bathrobes so changing rooms were not an issue\u2026 On my last day I was only given a late check-out until 1.30pm (I did not need to leave the hotel until 5pm) which was fair enough and the front desk had advised that I could use the changing facilities in the spa to shower. Foolishly I had never bothered to inspect the changing rooms whilst I had had a room of my own; this proved to be a big mistake!! The changing room is tiny, has a wall of lockers, and a loo and basin in a small cubicle together, and that is it. The shower that is across the corridor from it (how does that work?!) was out of order so the only showers available were those in the sauna area or by the pool. Hardly convenient. Furthermore the changing rooms open directly onto the pool area, so if you are stood in the wrong place people sat by the pool would get a full view into them! Again, given the hotel was built in 2004 the spa area is very poor indeed. Other than the breakfast, there was very little I enjoyed about this hotel. How this property has consistently made it onto CN, T+L, etc. lists is truly beyond me, it just goes to show that those lists are really worth very little. Externally the architecture and style is very impressive, but internally I was staggered that a modern, purpose built hotel should be so un-user-friendly, and so clumsily conceived. The service was best from the door staff who without exception were friendly and welcoming. I think that the Ritz Carlton branding is this hotel\u2019s own worst enemy; it raises expectations above what one would be happy with at a Marriott (directly around the corner), Hilton, etc. and it fails to deliver. The fact that this property sells its rooms at a discount through various third parties, again highlights that this is not a property at the top of its game. Berlin itself is a fabulous city, and I would like to think it has an equally fabulous city centre hotel\u2026 The Ritz Cartlon certainly isn\u2019t it!", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "knubjr", "ReviewID": "UR124665109", "Content": "Stayed here from Thursday Feb 2nd 2012 - Sunday 5th 2012.

Pure luck - the hotel was completely full and I guess they had nowhere else to put me. But much appreciated anyway. What I liked even more were the staff: all genuinely friendly and helpful, from the concierge (who could speak not only excellent English but also threw in a bit of Greek when I confessed I spoke more Greek than German...) to the very welcoming doorman, to the receptionists, to the lady who brought Earl Grey tea bags and showed me how to use the coffee machine in my suite. My stay wasn't long enough to explore the hotel fully or use the restaurant, but my room (or should I say rooms) were spotless, very well insulated from street noise, and had every known creature comfort. I counted about five TVs, at least three phones and one chandelier. My only gripes about the room - and this is really clutching at straws - is that for a hotel in the business district it wasn't very modern-business friendly. it was very hard to find an electric socket to plug one's phone charger or laptop into, particularly in the bedroom and even in the study (where there was a fax machine, TV and phone no less but no obvious spare socket). I ended up unplugging lights and moving furniture to do it. This is by no means a problem unique to the Ritz Carlton though, it's pretty universal wherever you go. Secondly, I was disappointed that there is no free wi-fi in room - there's a hefty daily charge. Again the RC is not alone in this: the bigger and flasher the hotel is, the more likely it is to charge a fortune for internet access. When so many boutique hotels offer it for free, why do these hotels persist? I was also impressed by two other small details: that the restaurant the concierge booked us a table in already knew that we were going to the Philharmonic, and so served us suitably briskly without even having to ask; and that I booked room service breakfast for 5am as I had an early flight, and it arrived absolutely on the dot, piping hot.

We were not disappointed! Aside from Berlin being a fabulous city, the RC was a warm and luxurious place to call home for the week. The staff is incredibly warm and friendly.....and we particularly hit it off with Terry, who man's the door, as he and my bf are both jazz musicians. I was concerned that there might be a pretentious vibe at RC, but that was so far off from what we encountered. Everyone was truly lovely and down to earth. We found an amazing deal at booking.com (250 euros/day) that included the buffet breakfast, which typically goes for 38 euros/per person. The buffet was amazing....unlimited freshly squeezed juices, lattes, cappuccinos, espressos, etc, and crepes made to order, eggs made to order, sundry lox and herring, assorted cheeses. fresh prosciutto, yogurts, exotic fruits,,etc. The room was spacious and immaculate, and elegantly furnished. We loved the feather bed and having a doorbell alert us to any visitors. The dark chocolate treat every night was a sweet touch :-) The bathroom was huge, and we loved the quad music system with music piped into the bathroom from the DVD player in the main room. The bathtub was a wonderful treat as was the shower. The water pressure was perfect and there was no shortage of hot water. Location was stellar as well...albeit Berlin is 8 x's the size of Paris so be prepared to metro it or cab it. It's a 10 minute walk to the Jewish memorial, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. All worth visiting. Postdamer platz is right out the front door, as is Sony Center. We saw a fabulous concert of the Berlin Philharmonic just a 5 minute walk from RC.

The hotel is absolutely beautiful and in an excellent location but I must assume that the focus on business travelers rather than 2 professional women from Manhattan traveling for pleasure is not their preferred focus. I stay in Ritz Carlton hotels as often as I can because of the total experience but definitely felt that most of the staff seemed inexperienced and awkward. I say most because the Manager who handled a major mishap and one of the bartenders were of the RItz Carlton top quality ilk and I appreciated that. Upon check-in, the staff at the front desk seemed confused and wound up putting us in a room that was already occupied. After attempting to enter the room (I should add that the presentation of the room key in lovely card stock with the room number written beautifully was a great touch) several times, an angry (and rightly so) gentleman opened OUR room door dressed (thank goodness) in a Ritz bathrobe with an icy glare! With no words spoken, he pointed to HIS room number and we showed him our room key envelope on which the same number was written. He then slammed the door in our faces. Honestly, I totally understand his reaction to the disturbance. Stunned, my SIster and I laughed it off and lugged our bags back to the reception desk. We explained what happened to a staff member who quickly summoned a Manager. Upon hearing the situation, the Manager whisked us away to the bar to have drinks \"on the house\", ook our luggage from us and moments later, presented us with a new envelope containing a key to a beautiful junior suite. The upgrade was appreciated and the fact that the room was unoccupied was quite a relief this time around. The second exception to the odd service provided by the RItz in Berlin was the very thoughtful \"Happy Birthday\" cake slice (with a candle) and birthday greeting card from the staff that was awaiting our return to the room on the afternoon of my Birthday. That special touch coupled with the service in the bar and subsequent upgrade due to the first guest room mishap, were truly appreciated. What I found surprising was the lack of assistance from the Concierge desk (only general info that one would know from reading a guidebook introduction was provided), consistent misinformation about the hotel's business center and the overall sense that the each staff person that we encountered seemed thoroughly taken off-guard and ill-prepared for basic questions. In summary, I think that if one is traveling for business or does not need concierge assistance for a pleasure visit, then this hotel is perfect. As a well-prepared traveler who requires minimal guidance from a concierge with the exception of seeking info on the surrounding area of the hotel and \"in the know\" info about special events, I would have appreciated better service from the hotel. The RItz Carlton family of hotels is known for a luxurious overall experience and this particular Ritz needs to improve its customer service to be on par with its family members.

Being from America, I am used to great customer service and nice immaculate rooms, especially in a five star hotel. Both of our requirements were met by this hotel. We loved our Executive suite. The breakfast the first morning was fantastic with crepe/pancake bar, omelette bar, seafood, and all other typical breakfast foods you would expect, American, British and European.

If we hadn't have been in the main breakfast room the day before we would have never known about the crepes, omelettes and other items as they were not in the annex dining room. We had to order it all through the waiter. That took a while but no complaints, the service was great. Two negative things 1) We wanted to do room service one night but we didn't like the menu offering at the Brasserie Desbrosses and it was expensive for the type of food they offered. But the resturants across the street in the Sony Center were good (and my husband loved the cheaper prices). 2) The hot water in my sink, one of three sinks in our suite, took for ever to get hot even though I had just used it and turned it off only a second ago. So I opted to waste water and energy by keeping the hot water running while I brushed my teeth and washed my face.

So we didn't need our car. When she wasn't cooperative we just stayed in lovely pool area.

Our flight arrived quite late, and the room was guaranteed with our credit card, so we had no issues. The hotel lobby was decorated festively, with a large Christmas tree and homemade gingerbread house of the size of a small child. Our son loved both seeing the house as well as the train which ran on tracks encircling the house. To discourage looting from the gingerbread house, the hotel offered up baskets of chocolates for passers-by. Quite festive!! The hotel also had a small games table for kids, which our son loved, and also 2 miniature Mercedes cars which he pedaled around the lobby. Our room was spacious, even with the rollaway bed added. We had a king sized bed with a soft mattress topper and warm covers. The TV, which had ample foreign language selections (although not much for children) stood on a dresser across from the bed, which also housed the mini-bar. Our son was greeted with a small basket of candy, which he enjoyed. Free glass bottles of water were replenished daily. We also had a closet in the hall to hang our clothing, and an ironing board and safe were included. The room overlooked the neighboring building, so not much of a view. The bathroom was large and comfortable, with both a tub and shower, as well as a double sink. Somewhat unusually, the shower and toilet were enclosed behind the same glass doors, not really a problem except feet could get wet when visiting the toilet. Toiletries and amenities were plentiful, including robes and slippers. Breakfast in the cafe was spectacular. Selections were various and of excellent quality. We particularly enjoyed the made-to-order waffles and crepes, omelettes, and shaved prosciutto. Even the cheeses, fruits, and breads had quite interesting selections. And our request for foamed milk for our son was met instantly! A breakfast package is strongly encouraged. Our only word of warning is that the cafe filled up on weekends, spilling over to another room which wasn't nearly as nice. Wake up early on weekends to ensure a seat in the cafe. The location in Potsdamer Platz was excellent. We were directly across the road from S and U Bahn train stops. The Sony Center and shops were also across the street. A Vapiano restaurant (Italian chain) was on the next block, a particular favorite of our son. And a Christmas Market was in the square, giving us some fun in the evenings before we retired.

The concierge staff is particularly exceptional, with a great deal of experience and a graciousness that is in stark contrast to the sometimes \"correct\" but less than warm concierge desks in other Berlin properties. Food and beverage is exceptional. Room service is always prompt and well prepared, with even late night orders maintaining a very high level of preparation. Berlin offers an incredibly competitive hotel scene, with a broad range of choice at the high end, often at good value. And it is a large city geographically. The Ritz offers an experience that I believe is the equal of any to be found in the city. It is very traditional in design and architecture, but with a contemporary, \"unstuffy\" approach to service.

My favourite suite is the Grand Suite and they are very spacious and superbly designed with magnificent bathrooms. We had booked access to the Club Lounge whch really is like a hotel within an hotel and what makes it truly memorable are wonderful staff over seen my the charming Fabian. The lounge is small and intimate and offers a very good array of food and drink throughout the day. The hotel has only one main restaurant which is a French style brasserie called Desbrosses. It is a large restaurant and features items from the original restaurant reclaimed from France. The food is good and the menu contains some interesting dishes. Service is generally good but you can be forgotten about if you sit outside. In my opinion the hotel would benefit from a Fine Dining restaurant and I was personally disappointed when Vitrum closed. It is nice to be able to dine in a different restaurant to where you have had breakfast. Service throughout the hotel is very high and you genuinely feel that nothing is too much trouble. A great hotel is more than a beautiful building with luxurious surroundings it is also about the quality and sincerity of the service and this is what makes the Ritz-Carlton Berlin a truly great hotel, not just in Berlin or indeed Germany but one of the very best in Europe and beyond. It is my belief that this excellence comes from the top and Mr Petrovic, the hotel's General Manager, more than supports this belief and is a truly great hotelier.

It's high class and therefore quite expensive. But you do get a lot for your money. The welcome is friendly, the bags are immediately taken care of and at the reception you feel, the personnel is well trained. The regular room itself is large and furnished with (almost) everything you need. The Bathroom is also very large with a separate shower cabin and a separate toilet. The bathtub is also inviting for an hour to relax. Everything seems to be furnished with with marble what gives the bathroom a very luxurious impression. The kind size bed is comfortable and, as requested, you can get feather-free pillows and duvets. You have lots of space, also to stow your bags and cloths. A minibar is available as is a TV and DVD player. What I did miss (and did get on request) was the tea-making facility. This should be generally available, I think. You can use the internet through an available cable if you have your notebook with book. In the times of tablet pcs and iPhones you need to have a wireless connection. And this is my only negative point in the room: You may have access, but it's expensive and not very customer-friendly. In a hotel like the Ritz Carlton this should be offered free, in my opinion. The breakfast at the inhouse french brasserie is amazing. You can't eat everything that's being offered here. Incredible what you can choose from. But the whole thing has its prize: EURO 38 for a breakfast is incredibly, too - even by acknowledging whats' being offered. Because you do not have much choice: The available continental breakfast offers not very much at a high price of EURO 25. And if you pick all the ingredients of your personal favourite breakfast separately it's far too expensive, too - and you reach the EURO 38 immediately. So the buffet is truly the only alternative. And when you do come for breakfast, without being asked what you REALLY want, the buffet is automatically being charged. The whole experience here is good, but you do not really feel like being in Berlin. It feels more like New York or Chicago. It's a Ritz Carlton branch right out of the catalogue with the same look and feel as everywhere else, so nothing really special. The big plus is the location at the Potsdamer Platz, though.

The breakfasts in the hotel restaurant were plentiful and the dining room had a very nice atmosphere. The location is fantastic - for anyone who wants to be in the thick of it in Berlin, Potsdammer Platz is a location that is hard to beat with so many of the main sites within walking distance and one of Berlin's main railway interchanges 30m from the door of the hotel.

Though price was higher than for a normal room, surely this amenity was worth the incremenable cost. Also the friendliness and kindness of the staff in the lounge made us feel as if we were really coming home every day after our sightseeing. Though hotel is close to Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, Checkpoint Charlie and a good shopping mall, nonetheless, staff in the lounge provided detailed helpful advice on how to travel on underground and by bus to points near and far, i.e., Potsdam. Small negatives: It took four hrs. and two phone calls to have a sink drain adjusted in our room. Also the toiletries in the club rooms were just ordinary and not of the higher quality one might expect from Ritz Carlon.

It was our third stay at the hotel and that alone should tell you something. We arrived rather late at night (after 10 pm) but the Club Lounge staff was still waiting to greet us, offer us a drink, and get us checked in. The gentleman who helped us was extremely helpful and efficient but also perceptive enough to know that we were exhausted after a long trek from California. We had everything we needed very quickly. Our room (we were lucky enough to have a corner suite) was beautiful. It had a large living area with a couch, chairs, a TV, desk and bar, along with its own half bathroom. The bedroom was also quite large looking right down at the Sony Center. The bed was huge and very comfortable. (One minor complaint was that the duvets on the bed were, at times, too warm. Given the lack of a top sheet we had temperature issues. Had we asked, I am sure they would have addressed it for us, but again, very minor.) The main bath had dual sinks, a shower and a separate small tub. The floor to ceiling white and grey marble was beautiful. As indicated above, we did stay on the Club Level, something we highly recommend. We took full advantage of the five daily food presentations as well as the drinks. Although a continental breakfast is laid out in the lounge, the team is more than happy to get you eggs or meats and cheeses. The breakfast and drinks alone made the Club Lounge worth the extra money. Plus the fact that wi-fi is included, makes it all the more worthwhile. We also took advantage of the Curtain Club bar one night (notwithstanding the free drinks in the Club Lounge). They had an amazing variety of choices and provided a very comfortable seating area. The spa was also wonderful although the locker areas were a tad small (but more than adequate). We both had massages, which were perfect after all of our tourist endeavors. Although we didn\u2019t use the pool, it was a nice area to sit before and after our treatments. We found the hotel to be very well located. Most sights are within walking distance and if not, we had no problems finding taxis. I must give high praise to the Concierge team. Prior to our arrival I asked about a guide/driver to take us to Sans Souci and Potsdam. They arranged for \u201cTill\u201d (not sure I am spelling that right) who picked us up and gave us a great tour. I hope they pass along our praise and that they recommend him in the future. Service was excellent on all fronts. We were never waiting for our room to be made up or for turndown. Staying at this hotel is a bit like a fantasy at times. You never know what will be going on while you are there. Last trip a group of the Saudi royal family was there during our stay; watching their motorcade come and go was quite interesting. This time, on one evening as we were leaving to go to dinner we walked out of the elevator into the reception lines for a formal event \u2013 DreamBall to be precise, complete with formal gowns and paparazzi across the street. When we left Berlin the entire hotel was secured with barriers \u2013 we never did figure this one out but it was election day so assume it had something to do with that. In short, it is always interesting from the people-watching perspective. One final note: the hotel rolled out a new marketing campaign with pictures of the various staff members posted throughout the hotel. I love this touch and very much enjoyed looking at all of the different poses.

One of the best features was returning to the Berlin RC every night after a long day of touring. The staff are superior -- there is a real team atmosphere there -- and very knowledgeable about restaurants in every price category -- from off-beat pubs to upscale establishments. They know how to get everywhere in town (and out to Pottsdam -- a historical day trip not too be missed.) We did not stay on the hotel's club level, but were very comfortable nonetheless. Food in the hotel is expensive, and I would recommend going out for meals -- but a drink at the bar when it opens each night at 6pm (with quite a dramatic flair) is a fun indulgence. Vapiano -- right at the corner near the hotel's front door -- is a great spot for casual pizza and salads. All in all, would highly recommend the Ritz.

I left my home on Monday July 4th at 8am towards the airport and arrived to the hotel Tuesday at 1pm, that means 29 hours after I left my home.

They didn't tell me the room wasn't ready, they asked me for a telephone number. And they told me two times that the check-in time is after 3pm. I asked in a very good maner for a room, i spoke to the reception manager and he told me that he can't do anything. Imagine the situation of being completely destroyed after 29 hours flight, almost falling asleep, dirty, and in a city that you don't know at all. And without a room, and it wasn't 7am, was 1pm. This caused me a very bad first impression, and during my two hours stay in the lobby, I wrote an email to the hotel manager explaining this situation. He wrote me back right away, with very nice words and saying that he deeply apologizes for not meeting the high-quality service level that the hotel usually offers. He sent me fruits to my room and gave me two nights for free whenever I would like to you them. This said, I must admit that it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed.

However, this looks to be repaired fairly well. What seemed like a great experience upon check-in quickly turned into a strange series of events, my partner and I wondered if we were in an alternate universe. A day after check-in, we decided to go to the Club Lounge after a day of sightseeing. We attempted to use our key cards to gain access to the club level, and found out it wasn't working. We went downstairs to inquire about this, and the reception staff was less than helpful. We were told that under no circumstance were we told we had Club Lounge access, and that we should have been grateful that we received the \"double upgrade\" from a \"standard room to a suite\". Moreover, the staff indicated that we were \"already given internet access for free, and we had a 170 Euro / 200 Dollar credit\". So, in almost no time, we were made to feel like unwelcome moochers versus welcome guests in a moment by the staff, when we were the ones (upon check in) surprised by the offer of lounge access (which is NOT given to anyone just because of status) and the upgrade (which is NOT given to suite holders) upon check-in. I guess the ignorance or incompetence of the staff upon check-in allowed them to offer us too much, and then cover up their error by stating that we were making it up. Needless to say our experience with the staff did not improve when we called down the next day to ensure our check out time was still 3pm (as promised upon check-in, but again, many other promises were made). Reception staff made the off-the-cuff/rude comment about \"3pm is very late\", and after a sour look from them, confirmed that was our check-out time. We skipped breakfast the first day for sleep, so our first experience with the buffet breakfast was on Easter Sunday. Breakfast was not in the restaurant, but a mishandled mess of an event in the lobby/lounge. We were told to sit \"anywhere in the bar or surrounding area\", even though the area was not set up with silverware/glasses/plates/etc. Then we were given sour faces for sitting in the bar area (as told by the staff), and moved to another area. If I had to pay the 38 Euros for breakfast after this experience, I would have felt very cheated, as many of the items that are supposed to be on the buffet were not. The next day (Monday), breakfast was in the Restaurant Desbrosses, and this was a 180 degree turn from the experience the next day. The buffet was expansive, and included all that was promised. A caveat to those visiting - make sure the buffet is in the restaurant vs. in the lobby or other dining area - otherwise, you can spend 38 Euros somewhere much better. I was hoping for a better experience at this hotel, as I was very impressed at check-in with the staff and the welcome I received. This quickly turned into an experience that made my partner question loyalty to the Marriott/Ritz Carlton frequent guest program (as a Platinum member), and me question the true quality of this hotel. I certainly hope this was a one-off problem due to junior staff working over the holiday weekend; however, this will make me think twice about where to spend my money in the future as well as the true value of brand loyalty.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent in many ways\u201d", "Author": "zigmund", "ReviewID": "UR103211447", "Content": "I stayed in one of the Club level rooms on the 10th floor over a long weekend and enjoyed every single minute I was there. In fact, I spent more time in the hotel than I would normally do, not because Berlin was boring (far from it) but because the hotel really was so welcoming. Food & drink was available throughout the day from breakfast starting at 0700 until the end of the evening service at about 2100. I found myself having breakfast, heading out for a few hours, returning to the hotel for some food, a small siesta, a swim and then heading out again, then back again for a little something and then heading out again. I could certainly have got food elsewhere around Berlin, but it was just so nice in the ritz Carlton and it broke up the day in a nice way. The staff were very attentive without being over the top, very friendly, greeted everyone by name, remembered drinks orders from the night before, etc . . . There are a number of hop on-hop off bus routes just across Potsdamer Platz and you can get tickets for \u20ac15 or \u20ac20 depending on the company. They all seem to go to more or less the same places. The location is brilliant - on the walk to Checkpoint Charlie (about 10 minutes) you pass \"The Topography of Terror\" which is an exhibition which pulls few punches, the Gropius Bau museum, and a few other interesting places. A few more minutes walk and you are at the Jewish Museum. Right outside the hotel is a \"small\" (maybe 10 sections long, so actually quite a big bit compared to the rest) remnant of the wall, so if you want to get your photo taken at 'the wall' you get that ticked off your list easily. In the other direction you can walk to the Brandenburg Gate in just a few minutes and then either head off to view the Reichstag/Bundestag or Unter den Linden. Of course, if you don't feel like walking the Potsdamer Platz U & S Bahn stations are right outside the hotel and provide great links to the rest of Berlin. The swimming pool was a bit small, but I don't know when I was last at a city centre hotel that had a big pool. Also, the air conditioning didn't seem to work. I had it set at maximum cold and maximum blast for the duration and yet the room was never cold. I wasn't too bothered and didn't pursue at the time. I will definitely be back.

The room has all the amenities that you would expect from a five star hotel. Service: very good in general, but can be patchy in some areas. For example, the gentleman who checked us in was extremely curteous, efficient, and amiable, whereas the lady who checked us out was a bit distant and cold. The same applies to the staff at concierge - one gentleman was genuinely warm and helpful, and the other one was a bit aloof albeit knowledgeable. What impressed us the most was a tall, black gentleman at the bell desk. As we departed in the very early morning with our car, he ensured that we got all our luggage onto the car, did not leave everything in the room, and gently placed two bags of croissant and bottled water in our car (knowing that we wouldn't have time to have breakfast yet).

The recreation area, however, is quite small, although it is beautifully decorated. For example, the whirl pool can only fit 3-4 people max. at a time. Another problem is that the pool/sauna area is not regularly maintained. Thus, we couldn't find big towels in the locker room, and the used towels were thrown everywhere.

The staff were also excellent, especially the concierge who was very helpful and recommended a fabulous Italian restaurant to us. It was one of the best I've ever eaten in. The location is good. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Brandenburg Gate and also has an underground stop right beside the hotel. There are a number of shops and restaurants nearby in a rather large & modern plaza. I also found the doorman to be extremely helpful, I wish I could remember his name. We did not eat at the hotel so unfortunately I cannot comment on that but I can say that it was a 5 star experience from start to finish and would go back just to sleep in that bed again! One word of warning though.. Be very careful if you are using the train system to get to the airport. We followed the map only to find that the train did not travel to the stop which was stated on the map & as a result we missed our flight home.

We stay at many luxury hotels and I am very familiar with the Ritz brand. I, for one, have seen a general reduction in Ritz values and service over the last couple of years and the RC Berlin was a good example of this. It wasn't that the hotel was at all bad, it simply was lack-lustre. We found this Ritz a frustrating blend of high quality and helpful service mixed with lower standards and inadequate staffing levels. There were also evident signs of the impact of the current financial situation in the hotel. Here are some examples: We arrived late in a cab. The hotel knew we would be arriving at around 10.30pm but there were no porters/ doormen waiting outside, leaving us to carry our luggage up the steps into the lobby. Once inside, there was a gaggle of porters falling over themselves to carry our bags the 6 feet from the revolving door to the reception desk! Having checked in - and been greeted by a very charming member of staff from the Club Floor - we went to our rooms and waited almost 30 minutes for our bags to materialise! Despite the fact that nobody else was checking in at the same time. On another day, I gave up waiting for service at the Curtain Bar after more than 15 minutes during which my presence was not acknowledged by two staff members behind the bar. I cannot think of any 5 star hotel anywhere else I have been, where bar staff wouldn't notice new customers coming in and sitting down after moments, let alone 15 minutes! The staff looked like they couldn't cope (even though the bar wasn't busy) and had no real idea of what they were doing. The Club Lounge was pretty much closed on a Saturday night at around 9.30pm and its lunch offering on the Sunday was absolutely woeful. On the other hand, the receptionist who originally checked us in was excellent as was the manager at the Club Lounge; the rooms themselves were beautifully appointed with a very high standard of finish and extremely well maintained. I didn't find the service warm or personal and there was no acknowledgment of my husband's birthday even though we are RC regulars and the hotel were advised by our TA in advance. I wasn't expecting a bottle of champagne, but a note or a slice of cake? Would that have been so hard? For what I paid it still wasn't bad value but frankly I would rather pay more and get more consistent, higher level service. It was a shame as we had looked forward to trying this Ritz and it wasn't as good as I had expected.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cRitz Carlton Berlin\u201d", "Author": "alunsford", "ReviewID": "UR50245935", "Content": "The hotel was phenomenal.

Adding more to that next evening we discovered that wedding is far from being over and was planned to be continued into 2nd night as well (at least 2am as we being told)! Seeing that as unacceptable (with wife and child being unable to sleep night before), we have contacted hotel staff to check if we can be relocated to a room father from ballroom (our current room being on 6th floor above). It turned out that all Junior Suites were located in the same wing as the ballroom. Being desperate we were considering a downgrade just be moved to other wing: but to our relief were offered free upgrade to Bellevue Suite located on upper floor in other wing, father from ballroom.

We are regular visitors to 5* hotels but were still blown away by the Ritz-Carlton. The beautiful lobby makes an excellent first impression and from the moment you arrive you are provided with teh most impeccable service. We had requested a king sized bed in a non-smoking room and were immediately shown to a beautiful room. However it became apparent from when we entered the room that a guest had smoked there (it was barely noticeable but not ideal) before we had the chance to say anything the concierge was on the phone requesting we be moved. Within minutes new key cards were brought up and we were taken a to another room down the hall which smelt fresh and clean. The room was impeccable and the mini bar and bathroom were very well appointed. The hotel offers a pillow menu from which you can select your prefered pillow(s) if you are not happy with the quantity or selection offered in the room. If you decide to stay heer I can not recommend the bath butler service highly enough. You need to give the desk about an hours notice but then a maid will come up and run the most luxurious bath for you leaving you with a selection of fruit and champagne to indulge in whilst you soak. Truly the most amazing bath I've ever had! We came down late and missed breakfast so we were invited to order in the curtain lounge instead, the food was excellent and once again the service we received was flawless. In summary what some of the negative reviewers say is right , yes you get exactly what you would expect from a 5*, this does mean that some of those quirks (and disappointments) you get in other hotels which make for funny or eventful experience are (thankfully) missing, but if what you are looking for is a beautifully appointed hotel with impeccable service then this is pretty much as good as it gets.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cgood but not great\u201d", "Author": "zarknyc", "ReviewID": "UR26689984", "Content": "i value the ratings on tripadvisor and i've been to berlin a few times in the past few years, but i don't really understand why the ritz carlton berlin got such raves. the location is as good as other luxury hotels, but it wasn't effortless service like the adlon or the regent. at the price i was paying, the staff shouldn't be trying to pinch every extra penny from me, like wanting to charge extra for an english newpaper? or charging me to access my email in their business center? no luxury hotel does that to my knowledge. my room was beautiful, the amenities were nice, the breakfast was incredible! but the hotel was half empty (probably from the economy) but wouldn't i be more likely to spend more at the hotel if i got a room upgrade or even an english newspaper?", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cA real Perfection\u201d", "Author": "Bearcito", "ReviewID": "UR26236399", "Content": "Everything was just ideal starting from our arrival - very friendly and helpful staff, clean room (not too big, but quite OK), excellent service, and lavish buffet breakfast.

Ritz Carlton Berlin stands as one of the main competitor for Berlin\u2019s Luxury hotels market - along with other \u201cOld Grand\u201d like The Adlon Kempinski, The Regent Berlin (managed by Four Seasons group), Schlosshotel im Grunewald - or even the new comers such Hotel de Rome (Rocco forte group) and the Mandala Hotel (part of or design hotel). One thing that most agree about this property is \u2013 THE LOCATION \u2013 which is conveniently located at the prestigious Postdamer Platz \u2013 simply just a step away from the business and government district, shopping, cultural venues and other popular attractions. As we arrived in from of the hotel entrance street \u2013 I noticed the lack of immediately assistance at the front entrance \u2013 probably because it was Friday (week-end) and there are many arrivals \u2013 with a short wait - we was able to gave the car key for to the valet person (who seems in hurried) \u2013 and a doorman assisted our luggage immediately as we approached the check-in desk. The check-in went smooth \u2013 the agent is professional \u2013 scored only 80 points, as the agent missed to inform us regarding our room package benefits and our requested arrangement. On the other hand \u2013 the agent was successful fulfill our request regarding the 2nd room booked for our guests. The curb side check-in was provided as the agent guided us to the elevator (unfortunately did not mention regarding facilities hours \u2013 ex. Breakfast time, spa etc.). Our room is located on the High floor \u2013 overlook to Beisheim Center. In the room I found a welcome card well placed next to a chocolate amenity . The room lavish with wonderful dark red wood panel mixed with the golden sand colors \u2013 along with yellow, green and gray tone fabric \u2013 giving a bit a bit Prussian style feeling of USA glory 20\u2019s art d\u00e9cor. The Bathroom has a good size \u2013 with separate standing shower and a bathtub (all in sand brown/pink marble). A small walk-in closet was well design - making it looks lovely even for its small narrow size. The highlight of the hotel facilities is the \u201cLa Prairie\u201d spa \u2013 adjacent to the gym and small sparkling heated swimming pool. The spa is small but lovely \u2013 I managed to have a massage treatment, which I rated it \u201cacceptable\u201d - 70 points. The spa is well put \u2013 include with the sauna and whirlpool \u2013 one thing that I noticed clearly \u2013 they only have one agent in the morning \u2013 who is also a spa therapist \u2013 so there is only limited treatment time available. The breakfast was served in Brasserie Desbroses \u2013 which has lively, casual ambience. Breakfast is buffet style \u2013 the food quality and options are great (life cooking station and pastry counter). There are few downsides. First - the services were a bit slow, (ex. in replacing the coffee or removed used plates). The staffs appear professional \u2013 but missing the WOW factor \u201csmile and attention (abilities to fulfill guests need in advance). Second - I understand that it is a brasserie style setting \u2013 but, for the luxury hotel standard I think a table clothes/wears are necessary. I rated 85 points for food and 70 points for services. Overall \u2013 I did enjoy the stay at the Ritz Carlton Berlin. Overall services provided just right on the standard. Certainly they are some rooms for perfection.

The rate was company based and included breakfast. At arrival I was welcomed by a doorman who also took care of the luggage and guided me to reception. As I was the last arriving guest that evening, the receptionist knew my name before I could tell her and checked me in very friendly. I was told that I got a very nice room and was guided to the elevator, only - not the room. Room 629 was a standard room with no special sight and quite far away from the elevator. According to the floor plan it was the same size all standard rooms had. I couldn't imagine why that room was a special one. However the room was very comfortable and spacious, the bathroom had a walk in shower, bathtub and a separate toilet. Turn down was already done and a complimentary bottle of water was given. A welcome notice of the management or fresh fruits were not in the room. The luggage transfer to the room was short in time. I wasn't informed about the breakfast times from the staff so I searched for a directory, but didn't find any. After requesting one, it was delivered to the room. A paper was brought to the room next morning and shoe shine was done correctly. One had to get up not too late because breakfast was offered until 10.30am, only - even on saturdays and sundays. The breakfast was served in Brasserie Desbroses and both days it was an annoying experience. It seemed as if the Ritz Carlton philosophy ends when entering the breakfast restaurant: One first was asked for the room number (not the name) and had to sign a bill before entering the restaurant. As I told the staff that breakfast was included in my room rate and I would not like to sign a bill, I was told that everyone has to sign it and it will not be charged if breakfast is included. This dialogue wasn't friendly at all, the restaurant was overcrowded and the staff seemed a bit confused. A guidance to a free seat was missing as there were problems with the service in general (used plates were not brought away, used cutlery wasn't replaced and on sunday the ordered hot chocolate wasn't served). There was no table wear, just a paper placemat which informed about the breakfast price (38,-- Euro; one of the most expensive breakfast rates in Germany). The breakfast itself was very good, there were plenty of choices, a life cooking station and the products were of high quality. At 10.30am the staff did start to prepare the restaurant for lunchtime. All in all the lodging aspect was acceptable - but The Ritz Carlton Berlin is one of the most expensive hotels in Berlin and there might be higher expectations at the service level (especially at the breakfast restaurant).

The front-desk staff take you in hand the moment you arrive and ease you gently into a more comfortable way of living. In this regard, I would expecially like to thank both Maya and Louisa, two of the Ritz Carlton staff who embody the highest standards of customer service. The bedrooms in the Ritz Carlton are of the highest calibre, havens of comfort in a frenetically lively city. Only the sound of the New Year's firecrackers could permeate the soundproofing of the windows. When the time came to say goodbye to this marvellous hotel, I left it reluctantly, secure in the knowledge that I would return in the future. I arrived in the Ritz Carlton on the evening of the 31st of December, just in time to see the fireworks display in the Tiergarten close by the Brandenberg Gate. After the show had ended, I got back to the hotel in about five minutes, ready to sample a few glasses of their champagne. The atmosphere was very convivial, with everyone willing to imbibe the \"gemutlichkeit\". The hotel is just across the road from the Sony Film Theatre (which shows all its films in English without German subtitles). The young, mostly German audience, are so knowledgeable that, for the most part, they have no difficulty in understanding the nuances and witticisms inherent in the English language. They were laughing out loud at Woody Allen's \"Vicki Christina Barcelona\". More importantly, however, the Berlin Philharmonic is about 600 metres away from the hotel. It accommodates about 2,000 concert-goers and, although I didn't get to see the Philharmonic itself, I saw superb performances of the \"Ode to Joy\" and \"Carmina Burana\" by the Czech Philharmonic and Choir. Some of the tickets for the Berlin Phil are very reasonably priced and I intend to return in March to see Sir Simon Rattle and his orchestral colleagues in action . The Ritz Carlton is famed throughout Berlin for the quality of its buffet breakfasts. Though they're not inexpensive, Berliners travel from far and wide just to partake in the sophistication of the repast on offer. There's a bakery in the restaurant itself and, needless to mention, the selection of breads is out of this world. They also offer a wide variety of cooked dishes, as well has hams and cheeses from all over Europe. Avoid this hotel for breakfast if you're obese or have a sweet tooth, because the temptation to munch on some of their fruit-based pastries is simply irresistible. As for Berlin itself, I think it's right up there with Paris, London and Rome as a uniquely inspiring European city. You can't help but be conscious of the old East-West divide when you're there. Echoes of the bitter-sweetness you experience when you see Venice for the first time. (I was moved by the photograph, on the railings of the Tiergarten, of a young eighteen year old East German girl, who had been mown down by bullets when trying to escape to the West in 1989. Incredible to think that these atrocities were perpetrated less than two decades ago.). But, emotionally, it's also difficult not to be moved by the immense transformation that has taken place in the city over the past two decades. Whilst there, I took the ninety minute double-decker bus ride through the main attractions of the place.

The hotel is very nice and makes a nice first impression, staff very friendly and helpful as would be expected.

We love the Four Seasons and this was our first Ritz Carlton and were excited to see how they compared. While the Ritz Carlton is very nice it is decorated in an over the top stuffy style, my grandma would have LOVE it! The staff were very nice but there was just something missing compared to the treatment we had received at the Four Seasons but it is hard to put your finger on what it was. On one occasion we had had in room dining (which came with a card that said the \"trolley\" would be picked up in one hour.) Upon leaving the room we called to let them know that we would like our turndown service while we went for an evening walk. Upon return we came to a room which had had its turndown service but they had left the stinky trolley sitting there to greet us when we got back a couple hours later. On another occasion we were lounging in bed with the \"do no disturb\" light on and had a knock on our door. I peeked through the peek hole to see a hotel employee standing there. Overall though this is a nice hotel and from what I understand standard Ritz Carlton style. We did have a nice stay and the location is perfect.

But the Ritz Carlton Berlin is by far my favorite hotel I have ever stayed in. I often find excuses to schedule myself layovers in Berlin when I travel just so I can try to book a room. I always stay on the Executive level as I find this is well worth it. Their breakfasts are massive and luxurious with increadible selections of fruits, cheeses, meats, nuts, and pastry items. Fresh orange juice and grapefruit juice is there as well. During the day they can make small sandwiches and salads which are excellent. Between breakfast and lunch I usually save mone eating in the lounge. The rooms are really spectacular for both business and leisure. Each room is equipped with a large flat screen telvision as well as an all region DVD player, so I could watch DVDs I brought with me in my room. From a design point of view, a wood-floor entery way with substantial closets, armoirs, and minibar give way to a carpeted living area with great space lovely furnishings and one of the most comfortable beds in which I have ever slept. The large marble bathroom has the best rainfall shower as well as seperate tub (this is one of the few tubs I know is clean enough to take a bath in). The staff are always excellent, while valuing professionalism over overt warmth, they are friendly and get the job done. Concierges (particularly Cairina and Thorsten) are excellent. There were some disappointments on my last stay. First, the quality of the food from room service was hit or miss and I really preferrred the food from the executive lounge. Furthermore, I could not get internet access in rooms on one side of the hotel as the design of the building blocks the WiFi signal. I had to change rooms to deal with this problem. I was then awoken at 8 o'clock in the evening say they needed to do repair work on my room (what I don't know). However, I was upgraded to a grand suite which was spectacular and a half bottle of Moet and Chandon was waiting for me with a hand-written note from the concierge apologizing for all the problems and thanking me for my continued busienss. One other disappintment: I was scheduled to leave the hotel on the day that President Medvedev of Russia was scheduled to arrive at the hotel. Despite the fact that German Federal Police began to close various parts of Pottsdammer Platz from early in the morning, the hotel would not tell me what was going on as they did not want to give away the \"secret\" of their VIP guest. His security etc., shut down Pottsdammer Platz and the lobby of the hotel for roughly 45-75 minutes. As I attempted to leave i was stopped. I very nearly missed an imporant connection to Munich for a business meeting because of this. Traffic around the Square was paralyzed and only because my train was delayed 45 minutes at Hauptbahnhof did I make it in time. While the hotel did send a bellman in a hotel car with me to the station to try to ensure I made it (which I eventually did), I was disappointed that staff were so secretive. Had they simply sent a note to all guests that an event was taking place which could cause delays during certain periods I could have changed my plans and avoided such problems. I have come to expect more from this lovely property. While it is difficult to discuss value when you are paying 300-400 Euro a night, comapred to what other hotels charge in Europe I am always happy to pay the roughly 350 Euro it usually costs to get a club room.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "belgium", "Title": "\u201cExcellent all round\u201d", "Author": "topsmed", "ReviewID": "UR16021017", "Content": "After staying at the Regent, I found the Ritz Carlton to be in the same league but with a slightly more relaxed atmosphere.

The restaurants were all good, and I enjoyed the tea lounge (very large selection of loose-leaf teas) and the Curtain Bar.

The service and courtesy from all of the staff really made this hotel stand out - including the reception staff struggling with the Ryanair web page to check us in online for our return flight (obviously not many guests at the RC demean themselves by travelling on such an airline, and I have to admit this is the last time I'll use them).The contrast between Ryanair and the service at the RC really does show you get what you pay for.

For a city centre hotel, the whole experience is one of calmness and an escape from the hustle and bustle outside. The other major plus point of the Ritz Carlton is its location - right on Potsdamer Platz, making it close to transport links, food, shopping, entertainment and the excellent Gemaldgallerie along with several other galleries and museums. There are plenty of dining choices all around in all price brackets. I can thoroughly recommend 'Vox' restaurant at the Grand Hyatt nearby for a special occasion. Superb quality at reasonable prices (for the food) but \u20ac11 for a bottle of mineral water was a bit steep - especially since the \u00a3 has slumped against the \u20ac in recent months.

From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by friendly doormen, and an abundance of chandeliers. The lobby is reminiscent of something you might see in Versailles, as another reviewer noted. Although I am a young traveler, I remain open to a variety of taste levels, including those that are more traditional in style. That being said however, the Ritz-Carlton Berlin has taken opulence to another level, which I often felt imposing throughout my stay. Firstly, let it be said, that service, comfort and quality were all exceptional, and delivered in true Ritz-Carlton fashion. I felt however, that the design of the hotel was more conducive to hosting dignitaries, than it was a place to relax. I tend to enjoy a hotel, which caters to a variety of purposes, as I feel most newer Ritz-Carlton's do. The service at this property is fantastic, and typical of most Ritz-Carlton's. Despite the language barrier, communication is excellent, and the staff was superb. The location of this hotel was quite central, and adjacent to the modern Sony Center. Just blocks away from the hotel are Berlin's most historic attractions, as well as the city's famous shopping street. The rooms were well appointed, but again opulent and quite gaudy. Rich woods, gold colors and frills were all used in the decor, to make the rooms appeal more to the liking of a king, than a Ritz-Carlton guest. We enjoyed a club-level deluxe room, which was spacious and allowed us access to the Club lounge. The lounge features were nice, but not as generous as others I have seen. There were three food presentations each day, including breakfast, lunch and a combined evening hourderves and dessert. I felt that many of the items were repeated each day. As with the rest of the hotel, we felt quite intimidated by the Club environment. Given our younger age (mid twenties) we were often given the \"look\" in the lounge. The Ritz-Carlton Berlin is a great hotel, but may only appeal to a limited audience. Given the opportunity to visit Berlin once again, I might decide on another hotel. Rarely have I had this opinion on a Ritz-Carlton property, and I've stayed in several worldwide. If you desire opulence and grandeur, this very well could be your hotel of choice, as it still upholds all the traditions of a Ritz-Carlton.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "IL", "Title": "\u201cElegant old-style posh hotel for the 'ritz'!\u201d", "Author": "john017", "ReviewID": "UR7428204", "Content": "O.k, so i didn't exactly fork out the 500 euros per night for this hotel, we stayed complemenary since my freind, a journalist, was doing a story about the hotel. although the service is beyond service, the food excellent and the rooms stunning, i didn't feel that comfy there, but that's probably because it was me, not used to such luxoriousity. every time you enter or leave the hotel, it's a big deal with the doormen opening and closing the doors for you - that's not for me, just leave me alone. you canno't be annonemous at this hotel. while we stayed there, we saw presidents of countries, diplomats and royals. this is cleary a hotel for the rich and famous. the rooms are amazing, with stunning furniture and the most amazing bath and WC i ever saw. they are large and spacious. the location is great at the western part of the city, in potsdamer platz, right opposit the marriot and the sony center with IMAX 3D, and a starbucks around the corner.", "Date": "April 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newcastle-upon-tyne", "Title": "\u201cpure luxery!\u201d", "Author": "beniboi", "ReviewID": "UR7347563", "Content": "Well first off. we didn't book to stay at this hotel, we were soposed to stay at the marriot nearby but our first night was double booked, so they upgraded us to this hotel, not that we were complaining, and then we had to be upgraded to a deluxe room because there \"standerd\" rooms were fully booked... so yea we felt like we like stars! the staff are very friendly, couldn't do more for you, the rooms were huge, very confy beds, and an extremly posh bathroom. they also supplyed posh toiletries ( la prerie or somthing like that) so of course we took them as were getting free desinger stuff! the location is excellent accross the road from the sony centre which was very nice with bars and the like. the breakfast was very good as you would expect, set in a french resturant very nice. choice was excellent. we were sad when leaving back to the marriot in the morning... but as you can read from my marriot review that it's as good as the ritz which is a hard thing to do! so the only thing we can't comment on is the price payed because we got this for free almost.", "Date": "April 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerset,England", "Title": "\u201cFaultless.

We arrived at 9 am on a Friday morning and the first pleasant surprise was that we could get our room immediately. We had booked a deluxe room which was very spacious with windows on two sides. The room was impeccable and it is very obvious that a huge amount of money has been put into the construction of this place. Personally, I would have preferred a more modern design instead of the old-style chic but the room, the bed and especially the bathroom remain a true delight. Fantastic bed and fantastic shower. We were quite surprised to find an old-fashioned box of a TV set but we didn't turn it on at all during our stay. I'm not a big fan of the Ritz-Carlton toiletries and would have preferred the Bulgari products. The rooms are really quiet and we didn't hear any noise at all. It was only at breakfast that we realised that the hotel was, in fact, VERY busy. The first morning we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table for breakfast and everything was rather stressful including the service. However, the quality of the food is outstanding. The staff is excellent and they truly seem to care about what they are doing. The only thing we didn't like about the place and which really needs improvement is the gym. If you only use cardio machines you will be OK but if you want to do some weight training you will VERY quickly run out of options. There is basically just one seated row and one chest press machine + some dumbbells. This is simply not acceptable for a new hotel of this standard. Furthermore, the gym is right next to the gym which makes the air too hot and too humid for a good workout. We liked the central location on Potsdamer Platz as it is very convenient to commute both to the western and eastern parts of Berlin. Many attractions are within walking distance.

They also provided a bottle of champagne in the room. While the facade of the hotel is not any special the interiors are very luxurious and opulent. I definitelly not like modern, understated and minimalistic design-hotels but despite that the Ritz was a tad too much even for me - crystal chandeliers everywhere (including bathroom), all in polished wood, marble, too many bold colors. The room itself was a bit small yet included all amenities of a fivestar hotel, marble bath, bedside control panel (A/C, light, curtains, do not disturb) and the hotel is new so also all furnishings were in best state and all was of course perfectly clean. The bath had La Prairie amenity, separate shower, separate toilet, two types of bahrobe to choose, the option of Bath Butler etc. The Spa is also a great place to relax, with a gym, wide range of La Prairie treatments and a pool and whirlpool. The pool is quite small, actually the whole area is not very spacious and if there would be too many guests it could be unpleasant (but there wasn't so it was OK). All the staff is very courteous, there is a fine dining restaurants though I did not try it as it was closed for summer holidays. The Ritz together with the Adlon are the best hotels in the city. The Ritz is newer, more opulent and has better value/money spent ratio (espec with the Club lounge amenities) while the Adlon has a more appealing location, more understated (but still very luxurious) decor and more prestige being a historic hotel.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCannot fault it\u201d", "Author": "Dunn", "ReviewID": "UR6604236", "Content": "It's true, this hotel is excellant.

The room is spacious (working desk with ink-well and old-fashioned nib), the bed is a dream (yes, they have a pillow menu to choose from), the marble bathroom does have a heated floor (if it is not warm enough for your taste, ask housekeeping: they will turn it up), the TV cabinet also houses a DVD-player as additional entertainment option.

But all this would not make the Ritz-Carlton the extraordinary place it is without the Ladies and Gentlemen working there. My company hosted a four-day client event at the Ritz-Carlton. One evening, we had a special guest (a well known up-and-coming German actor) invited for dinner outside the hotel. We returned and settled for drinks at the Curtain Club. You know, they don't close as long as there are guests... and the night became longer and longer with drinks and talk. At two thirty in the morning, the actor and one of the top managers felt like playing a round of chess and they asked the bartender if he had a board. When he declined, the actor off-handishly said something along the lines of: \"...that's kind of weak, I thought this was a luxury hotel...\" A quarter of an hour later, the night concierge had found a set of figurines. He also downloaded the image of a chess-board from the internet and had it printed on canvas... so the guests got their game of chess, which lasted until six a.m.. ...going above and beyond the usual duty of a bartender and a concierge is what makes the Ritz-Carlton so special. Needless to say, everyone in the entire group learned about the famous chess-board... ...and this was not the only time the staff at the Ritz-Carlton proved to be the heart and soul of the hotel.

And it seemed to me, they really meant it - that was not just the result of good training. The room was spacious,nicely decorated with lots of cherry wood, the bed perfect, everything could be operated by a touchscreen panel - even the curtains. The club lounge offers three food presentations and drinks all day long. The staff on the club floor is just perfect! They will know what your wishes are, before you tell them. And they will remember your name. The amenities are chosen with a faible for details and a sense of humour: You will find a \"Berlin pancake\" (some kind of filled doughnut) in your room, which is a wellknown specialty of the town. At night I did not only find a handwritten greetingcard, but lavender too. In the bathroom you will find candles and fresh orchids! The location is convenient: at the Potsdamer Platz, close to the Philharmonie, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag and adjecant to a wonderful park, the Sony Center and a mall. I can highly recommend this hotel!", "Date": "December 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cfantastic\u201d", "Author": "tottie", "ReviewID": "UR4222061", "Content": "Have just returned from a 3 day stay at the Ritz Carlton Berlin. This is a fantastic hotel. The service was exceptional. Stayed in a Club Lounge room -which is certainly worth the extra few euros - complimentary drinks from 6am to 10.30pm, breakfast, lunch and nibbles in the evening. The lounge is tastefully furnished as is the rest of the hotel. The room was spacious, the bed very, very comfortable and the little extras ie water, donoughts and a present from St Nicholas were really appreciated. Ate at Debrosses which was lovely - the portions were enormous. The next evening ate at a French restaurant called Le Piaf - recommended to us my Alexandra in the Club Lounge. This was in Charlottesburg and thoroughly worth the 15 euro taxi ride. The whole stay - though brief was fantastic - any bad reviews on this site take with a pinch of salt. RC number one as always - thanks for a wunderbar time.", "Date": "December 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "mjmsf", "ReviewID": "UR4072200", "Content": "My partner and I just returned from a week stay.

Don't let the overt opulence of marble.chandeliers and some of the worst paintings in the history of art deter you! Time Out was not inaccurate when they described RC Berlin as 'Versailles meets Vegas.' My wife and I were lucky enough to spend a week here being gloriously pampered in the Club Lounge on the 10th floor. We had the holiday of a lifetime. This was our 6th Ritz Carlton experience and every time we just have the most unbelievably spoily package. Ritz Carlton is the epitome of customer service. The hotel is alive and has a buzz to it that reflects the whole shock of the new that symbolises the reclaimed no man's land of Potzdamer Platz. As the chill out music gently supplements the champagne and vodka cocktails. the visitor can look out on the changing colours of the Sony Centre and soak up this whole spectacularly arty and radical urban environment. As remnants of the wall are encased almost directly outside the hotel. one senses a whole new commercial and stylistic vibe that confronts that old cold war misery head on. Yeah chandeliers. bring em on. How do you like them? More, more, more! If you do have wet liberal misgivings about the opulence here or more likely a distaste for the overtly vulgar or 'chav' then check out the Adlon Kempinski that surprisingly tops the tripadvisor chart. After RC we found the Adlon mundanely 4 Star. Parochial, old school and snobbish, guests and staff alike. Tired and dull. we returned to Ritz Carlton happy to be back within the sparkle. Berlin is a must see. Great Art galleries, steeped in history, good food and beer. Take a river cruise along the Schiffe. check out Check Point Charlie as a matter of duty (grubby, cramped and full of students) but. be sure to reward yourself afterwards with some steins of cold Budweiser (Prague brew naturellement!) and be sure to try the Currywurst. The Tea Gardens are very peaceful and beautiful too with ducks, statues and bridges. RC has 2 fabulous restaurants. The Sunday champagne and lobster at Desbrosses is surreal in the sense of an upmarket French restaurant theme park uprooted piece by piece from its origins. Vitrum is one of the best restaurants in the world. My wife described it as a cacophony of taste. I asked for the best steak in Berlin and was more than met with that request. The Club Lounge has free internet access and 2 laptops available. The service is nothing short of stupendous. We were deluged with gifts from morn til night. Fruit bowls, poems. pictures. sweet concoctions. the list is endless regarding the staff's commitment to ensuring the best . Breakfast was excellent with decent bacon and scrambled alongside the usual RC delicacies. Champagne and chandeliers. Oh yes. ich bin ein Berliner!", "Date": "October 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAll's well that ends well\u201d", "Author": "Rumpelstilzkin", "ReviewID": "UR3788530", "Content": "I stayed at the Ritz twice, at the end of July and a week later in August. It was not a problem-free experience. I had decided on this hotel in large part due to the spectacular-looking pool and fitness facilities(check out their webpage). So, I get to the hotel after a long train ride. At check-in the reservation agent upsells me on a more expensive room which I hate but reluctantly accepted. I get to the room and ask the porter how I get to the wellness area and the pool. He gives me a startled look and explains that both those areas are closed for renovation. The hotel is barely over ONE year old. So, I go back down and ask why this was the first time I had heard anything about it. The folks at the front desk claimed it was supposedly sent to me via email but I double-checked and no such information was ever provided. They did, to their credit, remove the upsell amount and let me stay in the room. Nonetheless, I was sorely disappointed. Otherwise, the hotel was fairly empty and the service was pretty good. They had some excellent people working the nightshift who seemed to know what they were doing and cared. The location is good and the breakfast spectacular. The staff is large and generally efficient and careing. I will stay there again, hopefully with a working wellness area.", "Date": "August 18, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Ritz-Carlton, Berlin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d289019-Reviews-The_Ritz_Carlton_Berlin-Berlin.html", "Price": "$204 - $421*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Potsdamer Platz 3</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10785</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "289019", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/34/5d/41/the-ritz-carlton-berlin.jpg"}}
