We have stayed at this hotel twice in 2006, march and june.We liked this hotel. We had a 1 bedroom suite with a kitchenette.There is a refridgerator, toaster oven, microwave, coffee makerright in the room. The area was spacious and clean.The staff is quite friendly, and the office personnel spokeenough english to help me with whatever I needed to do.The front door is guarded 24/7 and locked. The location isin the heart of the reforma district, near the u.s. embassy.There is plenty of restaurants nearby, and I felt quite safewalking around the area. I also stayed down the road atthe Mission Reforma hotel for a couple nights. It was alsopretty nice, but I am going to stay at the Reforma suiteswhen I return there in a couple weeks. It was a bit more to myliking. I will try to add a couple pics later.", "Date": "Jul 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR228540445", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mrnewt"}, {"Content": "Empty I stayed in this hotel a few years ago. The hotel is in a great location on Reforma Ave. Within walking distance I found some really cool places to hang out, shop, drink!, do whatever. The hotel itself was super clean..my suite was very nice... 2 bedrooms, kitchen, dining room, and small living room. There was no a/c unit there, so at times i did get a little hot, but I guess a/c is un-common throughout Mex City. The whole time I was there, I never saw any other guests, ever. Only the security guard at the front door who lets you in, and the rotating staff at the front desk. The hallways, stairways... all white, with some cool art located throughout the place. I have only been to Mex City once, and this is where I stayed, so I can't compare it to other hotels there... hotel employees were very friendly. overall I had nothing to complain about.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR390364626", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Un des plus MAUVAIS rapport Qualit\u8305 Prix de MExico   showReview(19496067, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR537956576", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "xblh"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d281708-r12576902-Hotel_Suites_Reforma_374-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "281708", "Price": "$112"}}
