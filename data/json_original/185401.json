The rooms are nice, though not large, and kept very clean as was the bathroom. Service at all times was 1st class and very friendly. Cabs were available to anywhere in the City with the prices posted in the lobby which was very handy. A few minutes notice to the concierge near the door was all that was necessary to book a cab. Also was able to book a cab and driver for the day at a very reasonable price to take our group (my brother, his wife and I) to Cuernavaca Mexico for a nice day trip in a comfortable manner. Much easier and relaxing than renting a car and driving and figuring directions on your own. Mexico City is not for the feint of heart if you are not used to that kind of driving. Probably the nicest part about this hotel is the location. The Zocalo is right at the heart of Mexico City and you are within walking distance of all kinds of nice restraunts, shopping, archaeological sites (pyramids and temples next to the cathedral), the national cathedral, and many other things nearby. Also is very close to the airport. I have traveled to Mexico City many times over my lifetime and this is probably the best area as a base of operations outside of a private home I have stayed at.

This happened to my 7-year-old daughter, and the toilet room was flooded in no time. The hotel's staff attended our cry for help immediately, and they fixed up the toilet and cleaned the whole mess right away and with good attitude. The price of the room included a wonderful breakfast buffet, with fresh tropical fruit and juices, eggs made per your request, cereals, etc. The restaurant is located on the covered roof of the hotel, so you can enjoy the wonderful views and weather. The hallways are beautifully decorated with Mexican talavera ceramics and historic pictures and artifacts. We never made it to the exercise room. There is no pool. We felt very safe walking late at night in the Zocalo, because there is plenty of activity and policemen continuously patrolling by foot and car.

We arrived at about 10 pm on a Thursday. When the reception clerk couldn't understand us, the English speaking Mr. Carlos Mata was called to help us. We were shown to our room with a double bed and 3 pillows. The bathroom has a good hot and cold shower which was easy to adjust to the right temperature. Bathroom amenities incuded 3 big towels, three hand towels, three small towels with 1 bath robe, plus the usual soap, shampoo and conditioner small bottles. Surprise! there was a small can of shoe polish, interesting, isn't it? The room was equipped with a personally controlled airconditioner (which was a big bonus since we can decide when we want it cold or warm inside the room). Breakfast is more than sufficient with the buffet table laden with fruits, fruit juices, french toast, pancakes, Mexican breakfast staples. There was a corner to order eggs as you like it, sunny side up or scrambled, with a lovely senorita cooking on the spot for you. Endless coffee refills as you wanted. But the best part is the view of the whole Zocalo square ...where the 8:00 ritual of flag raising is done. You have to see it and feel the Mexican spriri of pride as a retinue of soldiers emerge from the National Government building, complete with a brass band, then raise the biggest flag I have seen at the middle of the square. The hotel staff is another wonderful thing. If you're ever booked there, look for Mr. Daniel Aguilar at the Concierge's table. He speaks very good English and is a wealth of information on where to go, what to do, and is a big help on your travel needs. He was a big help to us when we were anxiously waiting for our tour guide, approaching us without our even asking and \"taking charge\" of the situation. Very friendly man, this Daniel. Mr. Carlos Mata was also a big help especially when we found out our reservation for our flight to Vancouver had been cancelled. He called up Mexicana and arranged eveything for us. The best thing though is the price. Our travel agency was able to get us a room for 6 nights, with buffet breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, half-day city tour, tour to the Basilica and the Teotihuacan pyramids and the Xochimilco floating gardens for only US$590 per person.

The national pawn shop is across the side street, and there are venders throughout the area. The maid service was very, very good and the front desk helpful.

There is much history, and this hotel is located right in the middle of the historical area. We did not take cabs, but used the subway all the time. The fare was 20-cents.

They are clean and well maintained. Since the government buildings and the national cathedral are in the zocalo area, there were police and security everywhere. They were helpful and courteous. The pyramids - We took a metro to the north autobus terminal and took a modern air-conditioned bus (for 30 pesos $3.00 ) to the pyramids.... left at 11 a.m. and arrived at the pyramids at noon. If you climb to the top of the pyramid of the sun, be sure to touch the silver spot at the very top that marks the middle of the pyramid. The silver spot is approximately the size of a 50-cent piece. We caught another bus back to our hotel by the pyramid of the moon. The cost was a little cheaper. Chapultepec Park - We went to the park on the weekend when all the venders and the local people gather at the park. The Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe - We took a metro which stops approximately two-three blocks from the basilica. There are venders everywhere except on the church grounds. We visited many more sights and the hotel staff was very helpful in explaining the meaning of customs and traditions.

It is a fantastic location for visiting the Aztec Ruins (Templo Mayor) and the Govenor's Palace (Diego Reviera's murals). There are lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance. The staff of the hotel are very friendly and helpful and our room was very clean and comfortable. The rooftop restaurant offers a fantastic view of the Zocalo and the city. There are a few things that one should consider if choosing this hotel. First, if you get a room close to the Zocalo, the Aztecs will anoy you with their very loud drumming until 10:00 or 11:00 PM. The drum is so loud that you not only hear it, but feel it as well. I took ear plugs and I couldn't shut it out. Second, don't get in a rush at the rooftop restaurant. Service is extraordinarily slow. I'm not talking about normal \"Mexico slow,\" I'm talking slower. Third, we ordered room service each of our seven mornings there. The service was friendly, courteous, and fast. That is, until Lydia came on duty. That day we were treated rudely and we were served day old fruit (we didn't order fruit) and stale toast (we ordered Pan Dulce [Mexican Pastry]). When questioned about the order, Lydia became very argumentative. Language had nothing to do with it since my wife is fluent in Spanish. We complained to the Capitan about the treatment and received an apology and a complementary breakfast our last morning there. Fourth, the hotel will get you a fixed price taxi. The cars are clean and the drivers are courteous. The only problem is that every one of them will work you to take you somewhere else so they can line their pockets. We had one that wanted to take us shopping at a \"special market\" that ended up being just an oversized curio shop (only 100 pesos additional). Another one wanted to stop by a \"special museum\" and another that wanted to come by and take us to the airport for 200 pesos (the standard fare to the airport is 100 pesos). Fifth, leave specific instructions for water, towels, linens, etc. for the maids. A tip of 10 or 20 pesos will work wonders also. Since you can't drink the water in the hotel, you will use bottled water to brush your teeth. Ask for a couple of extra bottles. Sixth, don't bother exchanging dollars for pesos at the hotel. They were giving 10 pesos for 1 dollar and that is the rate vendors use if you pay for goods and services on the street. The exhange rate 12/12/07-12/18/07 was about 1 dollar for 10.65 pesos and about 10.90 pesos for 1 dollar. Seventh, most of us don't travel to watch TV. If you stay here, they have a limited selection of channels. 3 channels offer English programming: HBO Family, CNN International, and AXN (shows American reruns; some from the current season). Bottom line is that when we go to Mexico City again, we will likely stay in Colonia Polanco or Colonia Condessa in a hotel that offers a higher level of amenities and a broader selection of restaurants and lounges. If you want to stay in the Historic Center, try this hotel.

The place has a particular character that makes it memorable, largely (though not entirely) for the right reasons. The location is excellent, within effortless reach of all of the tourist sites in the Centrico Historico. By day, the liveliness of the surrounding streets makes casual meandering an enjoyable experience (and one that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much less in-your-face than might be expected). By night, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say the area is at all threatening, but the crowds of tourists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the even bigger crowds of people trying to sell things to tourists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tend to disappear after about 9pm. The hotel itself has a nice ambience, its communal areas lacking the usual sterility of the big chain hotels. It feels very much a Mexican undertaking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than an American one. The bar is small and pretty lifeless, but a perfectly decent meeting place before heading off to the rather more lively offerings elsewhere. The restaurant is on the top floor, with an outdoor terrace with agreeable views of the city. I only sampled breakfast, but the food on offer was good and the cost, although high by Mexican standards, was low in comparison to North America or Europe. The rooms again are some way off the usual you-could-be-anywhere experience associated with Holiday Inns et al. Their stripped down simplicity was for me a plus point, though some might miss the availability of internet access or zillions of channels of unwatchable US television. The overall feel is not unlike a decent quality Mediterranean hotel. The only real downside is the endless daytime noise from the uniformed hurdy-gurdy player (and his monkey) perched on a daily basis outside the front of the hotel. If you plan to stay in your room for any length of time during the day, the barrel organ and its depressingly repetitive repertoire could well be a major irritant. Proximity to the Zocalo - the epicentre of protest for Mexico - can also create noise at by day or night (though that's offset by the incredible spectacle of watching these serial protesters at work).

We decided to spend the exta money and had a somewhat nice 5th floor suite that was more like a loft with large windows on 2 sides and a great view of the Zocalo. Service and attention were great. Some rooms have windows over a busy street (5 de mayo) and others have windows into a light/ventelation shaft. Overall, a pleasant hotel in a great (although noisy) location.", "Date": "October 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat value - clean, good location, very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "milehighsigh", "ReviewID": "UR4020498", "Content": "Stayed at the Holiday Inn Zocalo for one night at the end of September.

Despite the early afternoon check in time, we were taken to our room immediately after arriving from the airport at 8 in the morning. The rooftop restaurant was spectacular for both views and food, the bar downstairs very convenient. The bar downstairs was nice and the internet at the lobby extremely convenient. Despite there being a half hour free 'trial' of the internet, we used it a great deal more and were never charged for the privelege. Rooms were comfortable, although the beds were a little hard. Certainly nothing worth losing sleep over though.
