I have no idea how the others are recommending this hotel over and over. For the price you can get much better deals in Dubai. We paid around 100 USD per room/night. Here are my honest points: - Rooms: The rooms are ok and within the 4 star standard of Dubai. Good are the washing machine, microwave, cooking plates, fridge etc. - for a family who stays longer here and need to cook etc. This is the first hotel room where the TV can NOT be seen from the bed. The TV is in the living room part of the room. - Internet: You have wireless in the room (the internet is very slow, I made a speedtest and had around 180 kbs for download). This is enough for a very low quality skype connection but not more. Sure not appropriate is the 450 AED they are charging me for one week. If you need a wired connection the cable you have to use will reach maximum the couch - not the bed. - Food: The breakfast is really horrible. Please see the pictures for more reference. So you can see the evidence The selection is very very small. Nearly nothing is there. Only one juice (package), one type of bread, small and try sausages, the scrambled eggs were already gray. So sliced cheese, nothing. I have never seen such a small selection in any hotel - whereever I have stayed in the past. Only plus - if you ask they cook a omlette for you. by the way: If you are muslim take care. There was ham served inside sandwiches without any special sign in front of it. General: The hotel is close to the emirates mall, this is a plus of course. When I arrived the code card was not correct programmed so I could not open the door. When I came back to the reception the worker there offered me to send somebody to show me. She was behaving like I am a complete idiot. I am very dissapointed about the price and what you get for it.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel/Apt in great location\u201d", "Author": "ingrid c", "ReviewID": "UR117469045", "Content": "Stayed here for 10 nights during Ramadan.

They have different style rooms, mine was basic 2 twin beds pushed together to make a bed with a tiny bathroom with shower.

The kitchen was nice granite and appliances but with only 2 plates, couple of pots and several utensils there wasnt much cooking going on. My freezer never worked and since the hotels icemachine was broken, having a cold drink wasnt happening. I did not have a washingmachine as promised but they did very promptly install one. Only used a couple of times, way too noisy and u could only put in a couple pieces of clothing. No laptop either provided in room, didnt really matter, the internet signal was hit or miss. Had to ask daily for washcloths, towels rather hard and scratchy and often ragged. Rooftop pool was very nice, the gym had everything I needed and the attendants were very courteous and always quick with a towel. The breakfast buffet was good, I often asked for fresh eggs or an omelette and these requests were delivered upon quickly by the friendly staff. The hotel was hot in the hallways and also very noisy when familes arrived.

We stayed in a standard studio suite. I have been put off in the past in the U.S. in staying in a bedroom with a kitchen attached. However - and possibly because the hotel is new, it did feel like a studio apartment. The room : Large. Kitchen area, completely tiled. Fridge/freezer, microwave, tea/coffee facilities, espresso maker, toaster ... everything you could need. Breakfast bar with stools. Sitting area : Small couch, flat screen tv with an abundance of channels and a laptop! Sleeping area : Bed not visible upon entry to the room, queen sized bed which was very comofortable. Ample cuboard and wardrobe space. Bathroom : Not huge, but a large walk in shower with fantastic water pressure. Easily accomodate 3 people if you were that way inclined. Location is 5 mins walk from the Mall of the Emirates where there is a large Carrefour supermarket. Not suggesting self catering, unless that is what you're looking for, however, breakfast at the hotel was $18 and for someone like me who is happy with toast and fruit for breakfast, the kitchen facility came in handly as did the supermarket. Directly opposite the hotel is the Novotel Suites and Ibis, around the corner a large Holiday Inn and Kempinski. So in terms of infrastructure, it's an established area. The Mall of the Emirates Metro is just under 1 km walk. Restaurants in the Mall and a few around the hotel. There is free wireless access at the roof top cafe, which also serves as a shisha venue. You can sit there without purchasing anything and avail of the wireless network at any time. There is also wireless access in the coffee shop attached to the hotel, which is open 24 hours. A spa with steam room and gym, which, although I did not use, I believe are free for hotel guests. The only negative thing I could possibly add, although did not affect me too much, the pool on the roof is small as are the number of loungers. It did not affect us because for the best part, we were the only ones using it. Negative in the sense that if you were on a leisure trip, it could affect your enjoyment. But, there are beach clubs you can go to a short taxi ride away and they are very reasonable. All in all, after travelling to Dubai for over 20 years, weighing up the cost of the 5 star hotels and their locations ( Jumeirah ), the use of beach clubs etc I would certainly consider this hotel again. I paid 1/3 of the price I would usually spend on a hotel night and can honestly say, I had more money left in my pocket to spend at some good restaurants with booze. A taxi ride, at night, was approx 60 Dirhams.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel overall\u201d", "Author": "Perth_Four", "ReviewID": "UR84286841", "Content": "The hotel is very close to the Mall of the Emirates and the Dubai Ski Centre.

It is close to the metro and close to the Mall of the Emirates, both easy walking distance. We initially took the metro from the airport to the hotel and this was not difficult. Very cost effective as well. As we arrived later in the evening at the Suites this did not put the staff off. They were helpful and extremely attentive. So much so, the initial room we were given smelt of cigarette smoke despite being a non-smoking hotel, and we asked if it would be possible to have a non-smoking room. This was attended to within minutes with a single telephone call, & followed up by the reception staff with a further call an hour later in the new room, to see if we were comfortable and happy with everything. Breakfast down stairs in the La Mode restaurant was lovely and very enjoyable. So much so we are having breakfast there tomorrow. So to conclude..... if you are looking for somewhere to stay in Dubai do not hesitate to book the Golden Tulip Suites as you will very happy at the cleanliness and furnishing in the rooms. The closeness to popular sites and public transport fantastic. And if you have time book yourself on the \"Tour Dubai Big Bus\", starting at the Mall of the Emirates just a short walk away.

We both had an excellent quiet sleep in a very comfortable bed which was helped by the curtains over lapping each other and blocking out the light of day so that it was dark even when the sun was up. The Tulip is within easy walking distance of the the Emirates Mall and the ski slope. Plus from their if you want you can catch the elevated train line. As we had flight at 2000hrs we asked for a late check out until 1600hrs for this they gave it to us free of charge an excellent gesture.
