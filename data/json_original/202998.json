The rooms are very utiliarian, but ours had a great view of the Duomo, comfortable beds and an immaculate, large bathroom. There is always someone at the desk who speaks good English. The staff is very helpful-- I e-mailed in advance for advice on how to take the city bus to the hotel and they responded quickly and with good info. The breakfast was very good. We got a great deal by booking a full week stay through a travel website. Not many people stay that long, but we still haven't seen everything we would like to see in Florence. Everthing is in walking distance and there is a whole street of reasonably priced restaurants and pizzarias right around the corner. (We liked La Luna.) The hotel is in a residential area of Florence so the nearby businesses cater to locals instead of tourists (this can make a difference of 3 euros in the price of a gelato or a pizza!)", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR843533725", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KathyLondonderry_NH"}, {"Content": "You won't want to be in the room anyway This is a really basic hotel. Nothing is particularily wrong with it other than it is old and tired. It's not perfectly well located, just on the edge of the tourist area for Florence. About 20 minute walk to the central district.The rooms were clean but old, with ugly green carpet. Comfortable beds.The hotel is on a busy busy busy street, so there is lots of noise and no AC. So you have to keep your windows open in the summer and hope you are not a light sleeper.The staff was great, very helpful, as most Italians are. I didn't like that I had to leave my key at the front desk when I left and they didn't even ask for ID or proof of who I was when I asked for the key. It seems you could just look for an available key and ask for it without question.The price was right for us, as we were looking for someplace cheap. It is in a decent location for tourists, so if price is important I'd recommend this. Bear in mind, the price is still expensive compared to Sienna or elsewhere in Tuscany... and outrageous for what you get compared to Canada.Enjoy Florence, don't miss Sienna (it's even more beautiful)", "Date": "Oct 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR599296277", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "zinc8"}, {"Content": "A solid tourist class hotel Date: 25 Oct 06Reviewer: Salado, Texas USAThis is a solid tourist class hotel that caters to individual guests and large tour groups. During our 2-week stay we saw groups from Europe and the Far East as well as individual families from England, France,  Germany. The hotel is situated in a very quiet neighborhood fronting a busy, but not too noisy, thoroughfare. We paid approximately $110.00 per night through an opaque travelsite. This was the non-refundable, advance, internet purchase price. For that price we did not get any of the rooms you see in their brochure or web site. Two double beds shoved together, built-in armoir, small bath with tub  flexible shower, sink, and toilet/bidet. Although the hotel says that rooms were renovated recently, I suspect our floor (#2) is the last to be completed. The room was clean and towels were changed daily. For those whose room price includes the breakfast, it was a treat. What one sees in the breakfast room pictures on the hotel's web site is accurate. Very tasty and filling. A great way to begin the day exploring Florence.We found the hotel staff to be extremely courteous, cheereful, fluent in english, and always had an answer for all questions. They recommended the right buses and stops to maximize getting to distant places in the city, and certain sights to see and tours for distant locations.There is a supermarket withing walking distance of the hotel (Co-Op). Just like the US, but with wonderful fresh breads, meats, and cheeses.The city center is a leisurly 30-40 minute walk from the hotel. Local bus stops are just 2-4 blocks away, depending on where in the city you are going. The front desk sells bus tickets.The hotel recommends a local Trattoria-Pizzeria for evening meals. Do not pass on this place. A Trattoria is one step down from a Ristorante, but don't let that fool you. We ate there almost every evening. The atmosphere and food were great and prices were very reasonable. It is a true neighborhood establishment where the locals go.If you are looking for a place to sleep in reasonable comfort after a full day exploring the city and surrounding environs, this is a good choice for a reasonable price. We enjoyed our stay and do recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Oct 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR266272112", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Robert30"}, {"Content": "Very nice Stayed two nights.

Staff spoke English very well even though we were in an area that was much less touristy. Staff was also very helpful and courteous. We had no difficulties at all in this hotel. Breakfast was very good, with lots of choices and the breakfast room was large also. I have to say we then were disappointed with our next hotel in Rome, after staying here! I would like to echo the other reviewer that the hotel is in a location where you mingle with real Italians and the 2 places we went to for lunch, we needed to use our basic Italian language skills. It is also away from the tourist crowds so one did need to walk a bit more, but we ended up walking everywhere and did not take any buses. So for some this would be a negative.
