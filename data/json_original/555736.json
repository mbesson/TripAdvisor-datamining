The rooms were nice, not out of this world, but not bad either. The bathroom was functional (although there was not enough water pressure in the shower). The daily treats were nice.

It's overtly modern with a museum like lobby area made completely of polished granite and open to the ceiling, yet the staff was unfamiliar with the most basic elements of table service in their quite expensive restaurant. Even though we were the only diners, our glasses were always empty unless we called the waiter over to ask for another drink - including water! Also, the prices in the restaurant (such as the equivalent of $150 a bottle for Robert Mondavi Woodbridge Cabernet) were outrageous. After the first night in the hotel, one realizes why other hotels don't go with the \"museum marble/ open foyer\" look in their lobby. It was incredibly loud. Apparently, some of the staff had children present (?), but my friend and I were joking that it sounded like a daycare center because of the echoes of what were probably only 2 or 3 kids. Finally, the website pictures make it seem like its in a quiet green area. It's actually on a fairly busy street in a small local village that is not tourist friendly.

We knew from a friend's experience that the hotel was quite a trek from the sights in Istanbul, but were looking forward to spending time on the Asian side of the city away from the hustle and bustle of tourist hot spots. While getting to and from Old Town and the New District did take time, it was worth being able to experience another part of the city and get a bit of local flavor. Contrary to wait previous reviewers wrote, there are some small towns within walking distance of the hotel that offer great eats and a chance to see what normal Istanbul life is like. (You must try the yogurt in Kanlica!) As part of the package we booked, we had a waterfront room overlooking the Bosphorous. The room was very spacious with an especially comfortable bed, a fantastic bathroom (huge bathtub and waterfall shower), and a balcony perfect for reading or just watch the boats float by. The hotel accommodations are definitely top notch, but you don't necessarily feel like a special guest. The hotel staff is not very responsive to emails (we sent two that went unanswered) and only helpful to a point. I imagine the hotel staff can offer excellent recommendations to guests who can spend a lot of money and who aren't interested in getting a real deal Istanbul experience. For example, instead of telling us about local shops to visit in city's young artsy neighborhoods the hotel suggested we go to the high end shopping mall around the corner. Coming from Paris and the US, the last thing we wanted to do was go shopping in a mall and be bombarded with brand names. We just felt a bit out of touch with their typical clientele and were disappointed that they couldn't switch gears to offer us solid suggestions for a young couple out to explore the city. Overall we enjoyed the hotel for what it was, but wouldn't necessarily make a point of going back. + super comfortable beds with scented sheets + comfy bathrobes and slippers + giant bathroom and great bath products + magnificent views of Istanbul - far from tourist attractions - semi helpful staff", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBeware the location if it's your first visit to Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "luxury-lizard", "ReviewID": "UR118317677", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed here based on the web site and the hotel's reviews on this forum. In spite of many comments in the reviews about the location we did not pay sufficient heed to these. From the hotel it's a one-hour trip by taxi and public ferry then a 20 minute walk to the major attractions of the Old Town. The cost of this is about $13 (USD) so the cost is not really the issue - it's the time and inconvenience. You can take a taxi all the way - but would be much more expensive and take longer due to the traffic. Once back at the hotel after a day of site-seeing you are sort of stranded - there is nothing within walking distance that we could find. Being a small boutique hotel, it has nothing to offer in the way of facilities; e.g. pool, spa, bar, etc. The restaurant is closed most evenings (so it seems) for private functions (it was closed 2 of the 3 nights we were there, Monday-Thursday) - so you need to take a taxi to a restaurant. You can eat in your room or on a small side terrace right beside the hotel entrance but this is literally only a few steps from the road and as such is very noisy. After checking out the 2 restaurants the hotel recommended on TA we elected not to go to either. So on evening we ate on the terrace and the other we took the hotel speed boat to the European side then walked to Bebek, a trendy waterfront suburb some 50 minutes walk away - this was OK but far from ideal. Overall, the hotel is fine - we were not quite as impressed as some of the other reviewers - the decor seemed a bit tired. For a hotel to be rated 5*, IMO, it should have soft pillows and high quality linen - it did not quite meet this particular standard.

We had a fantastic time, so much so that we have now booked our wedding here for next year, however there were a few minor issues... Firstly we had asked for a taxi/boat transfer from the airport, however we never got to go on the boat as our taxi driver drove all the way to the hotel, this may have been due to a delayed flight (by 1 hour) however this was not adequately conveyed to us. The minibus was lovely with free maps and water for the journey and we got to experience the notorious Istanbul traffic at rush hour!!! We had been promised a welcome cocktail, again something which never materialised, but to be honest we never actually asked about this and it was only when I returned home did I remember! The final issue was that on our first night there was an event on which meant that both the inside and outside restaurants were closed, so we had the choice to either eat in our room or at the side of the hotel facing the entrance. I was not impressed by this at all, as we had specifically wanted to experience the hotels waterside dining. However I must say that the silver service received in the room was lovely and the staff went to a great effort... Now onto the pros - The bedrooms were fantastic - we stayed in the deluxe mezzanine suite and it was superb. Free fruit, water and lovely beds and the view was fantastic!! Every day the room was refreshed with different fruit, a weather forecast (nice touch) and your personalised business card to give to taxis with your address which was fab as most taxis didn;t know what we were saying!!! The food was fantastic and excellently displayed and the wine was lovely, when we eventually got to dine in the restaurant the next day it was magical, with low lighting and the most fantastic mushroom risotto & souffle! Special thanks go to Mete who showed us some of the other rooms available - all were fabulous and to the events manager Firez who was lovely and very helpful. I would recommend paying extra to get one of the top floor suites with a balcony. Be aware that it is a 20/30min drive to get to the heart of town and it does feel quite isolated which only adds to the romantic atnosphere. Do check though whether an event is on as you may be slightly dissapointed if so....

The bed itself is the most comfortable we'd slept in, so good we asked the manager for details so we can order our own. 10/10. We only spent the one night at A'jia but lunch was a perfectly pink salmon, cooked to perfection and then dinner was a spectacular Turkish buffet, a fantastic menu and every dish full of flavour. We had the perfect night and the staff couldn't have been more attentive. Exceptional. I highly recommend A'jia for a romantic getaway. There is no swimming pool, gym etc.. for that, go to the Four Seasons or Conrad. This is a one-off romantic getaway so surprise your better half and enjoy every second. A'jia gets an A in my book.

The hotel itself is exactly as pictured on the website - beautiful, modern decor, a Tempur-Pedic bed, huge bathroom with separate tub (big enough for 2) and shower. Our room was waterfront on the first floor and it was lovely to wake each morning with the sun shining on the water. Guests do need to realize this hotel is very far from the main sites. We were dismayed to see how often the taxi drivers attempted to swindle us with extra charges and inflated fares (over the meter reading). The average fare was approx 25 Euros each way with no traffic. Ataturk airport is approximately 30-40 Euros with no traffic. The boat shuttle to the European side is a quick fun trip in itself and will save you about 5 Euros on the taxi into the sites. There were a couple of small things each day that diminished our enjoyment with the stay. An event was booked at the hotel for one night of our stay so guests were only allowed to dine in the restaurant or the lobby - this is not something we were notified of in advance. When you pay to be able to have a romantic stay on the water, it was disappointing to be barred from the loveliest area of the hotel. Lounge chairs as pictured on the website were not available when we first arrived; my husband inquired with two staff about them and not given a clear answer (this may have been lost in translation), but they were out the following day. The hotel was very noisy in the morning - (beginning around 7); my husband did complain about this on the second morning and was given the explanation that a staff meeting was going on. Lastly, the service and food at the restaurant did not match the accommodations of the hotel. Again, small details, but fine hotels thrive on attending to such matters - for example, empty plates left for 15 minutes without being cleared, water glasses not being refilled (with the sparkling water placed in a chiller away just out of reach from the table), dessert or coffee not being offered at the end of a meal or even a waiter asking if you would like anything else after the entree was served. My husband had to send his steak back the first day, and then only ate half of the second steak; this was noted and removed from our bill appropriately. There are reportedly several good restaurants in the area, so one suggestion might be to eat at one of those and return for drinks on the terrace.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cSuperb place\u201d", "Author": "Blackpearl99", "ReviewID": "UR116440372", "Content": "The hotel is located at the Bosphorus, dinner is served at the water, best: during the sunset (the sun goes down on the other side of the Bosphorus, the light is reflected in the water).

The room we stayed in on the third floor, in celebration of our wedding anniversary, was enormous; polished wood floors, window wall looking out on a spacious balcony that in turn, had a commanding and magical view across the Bosphorus to the European side of Istanbul. The furnishings were sleekly contemporary and everything functioned as it should. The bathroom was enormous too, and very well equipped with large separate bath and shower. There is a large terrace cafe/restaurant over the water, as well as an indoor restaurant. We had lunch at the hotel restaurant; an excellently prepared and served Italian meal. The next morning we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. It was a multi-dish 'tasting breakfast' of traditional Turkish breakfast dishes, both sweet and savory; presented on a large wooden tray. It was outstanding. The hotel offers a free shuttle service by the hotel's launch to the European side, that runs regularly from morning to night.

To make up for the snafu they gave us lunch and dinner for the days we did not have two rooms. Since we had just arrived, we weren't sure whether this was really bad or just a minor inconvenience. We got there early, before check in time, so our rooms were not ready. They offered us breakfast, which was a nice way to spend some time. This was our first time in the restaurant and it made a really good impression. The restaurant is on the Bospherus side you have have nice view while enjoying your meal. We had the \"American Breakfast\" and it was very generous portions. They also serve great bread with all the meals. Even though the staff speaks english, we sometimes had communication difficulties. With the exception of one waiter, the staff would always let us know if they did not understand and we always managed to communicate what we wanted, though getting an egg white only took a couple of tries. With that one waiter we always knew there would be a problem. But in the end they always fixed every thing to our satisfaction. The food was always fresh and excellent. Food presentation was always impressive. You should keep in mind that if you are buying meals they do charge a separate cover charge of 4 TL per person, including children. The rooms are all spacious, we had three different rooms. We had a mezzanine room, a suite room and a regular room. The mezzanine rooms sounds good at first, but you have to go up and down steps. The tub in this room is also on the mezzanine level, not in the bathroom. This room faced north with some windows on the water side and some on the road side. At night traffic on the road was pretty loud in the room, so I would try to avoid the rooms that have any windows on the road side. The flat suite was very spacious with a nice sitting area and large windows that faced the water. The last room we had was one of their regular rooms on the water side. This was smaller, but not small by any means. The water views were great. They have a turn down service that includes a plate of fresh fruit or chocolates every day. This was a nice and much appreciated. One thing to keep in mind if you decide to stay here is that it is relatively far from most of the historic sites of Istanbul. It's about a 20 minute cab ride, 25TL, to the Uskudar ferry. The ferry ride, 1.75 TL, is then another 15 minutes to Eminou. There is a public bus that goes right by the hotel and stops at the ferry, but my guess is that it would take at least an hour since it makes many stops. Another nice thing the hotel has it the private boat that takes you across the Bosphorus as well as a tour of the Bosphorus. The tour goes down the east side to just north of the south bridge and then loops back. It is a nice ride with lots of things to see from the water side that you would not see from the land side. The Ajia is on the Asia side and their speed boat will take you to the European side and drop you off. They also offer pick up service. The catch is that you have to call the hotel to have them send the boat over. We didn't have a cell phone so one day we asked to be taken over and then asked that they pick us up at a specific time. They nodded and we thought they understood, but when the time came we were at the dock waiting and waiting, and not boat showed up. At that point we tried to make a call from a public phone using a credit card. Unfortunately the phone was only labeled in Turkish and we could not make any calls. We were saved by a friendly policeman who made a call for us to the hotel. A short while later the boat stopped by to pick us up. Another thing is that since this is a bit farther away from the tourist area very few folks speak english. This may or may not be an issue for you. All the people we encountered were very firendly and willing to help, if they understood you. :) Overall we were happy with our stay at the Ajia. If you go keep in mind you will need to spend some time and money getting to the historic sites.

We had spotted the property on luxury.link and in fact booked through that site for a package which included breakfast and a hotel credit. The hotel upgraded our reservation to a two level room overlooking the Bosphorus with 3 large windows. The views in this spacious airy room were outstanding and the mezzanine level with the bed very romantic. The decor was sparse, focussing on the materials and making the most of the space, views and location - it is a well executed contemporary design. Unfortunately the AC did not operate properly which made sleeping uncomfortable that first night. We reported it the next morning and were then out for the day. They attempted to fix it during our absence but it still didn't work. We were leaving the next day so didn't bother to ask them to fix it again. Also, our room did not have a separate shower but incorporated a handheld nozzle into a free standing tub. The restaurant overlooking the water is outstanding for the view and the service. The food just about keeps up with these other elements. It is worth the experience and is highly recommended. Breakfast is a gem. Be aware the hotel is on the Asia side and most sights are on the European side. The hotel's water taxi is very prompt and will ferry you in just a few minutes. It does add a bit of an adventure to any outing. The reception staff and concierge worked very hard to answer all questions although english skills are uneven. They were tremendously hospitable and helpful both before and during the stay. In summary, you'll find the hotel gracious, airy and gentile. The staff are helpful, courteous and pleasant. If you have some tolerance for a few hiccups and prefer a quiet out of the way location in noisy Istanbul, this may be just the place for you. Advice: take the car service offered by the hotel to bring you from the airport - you'll get someone with an air-conditioned vehicle who knows where the hotel is located. The fee is a bit steep at 100 euros, but we ended up paying that much in a cab which got lost and suffered from the dust coming in from the open windows!", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWarm Welcome & Gay Friendly.....\u201d", "Author": "jetsetter_boys", "ReviewID": "UR63248275", "Content": "I stayed at Ajia for five nights in a Bosphorus Terrace Room.Upon arrival the Manager greeted me and my partner.This was our second trip to Istanbul.We stayed at the Ciragan Kempinski two years ago.We choosed the hotel through Tripadvisor.The room was excellent,clean and clean.The Turkish breakfast is one the best breakfast I have tested.What makes this hotel different is the excellent service provided by all the staff.

The included Turkish breakfast was a revelation with lots of pots of goodies (five different cheeses, olives, honey comb, dried apricots, cherries, clotted cream, borek etc) served on a tray - very generous portions. This hotel is quite far out of town on the Asian side near the second Bosphorous bridge, which I knew as I'd lived in the city in the past. However, the journey from Ataturk airport only took about 50 minutes, even in rush hour and despite floods in the previous couple of days, because of the new motorway which bypasses the city centre. It shouldn't be too difficult to get back from town by taxi either though we didn't end up doing this. The hotel offers a boat across the Bosphorous if you want to go to the European side of the Bosphorous which was great, but most days we just took the dolmus to Uskudar for about 2.5 YTL and then got the public ferry to Eminonu for Sultan Ahmet or to Karakoy for Taksim. The area of Kanlica has a few restaurants, cafes serving yoghurt (Kanlica is famous for it's yoghurt) with honey, jam or icing sugar, and a small supermarket. The reception staff were helpful and recommended a good, upmarket fish restaurant nearby. We also went to Hidiv Kasri, an old house which serves food and drink, which was about a 15 minute walk up a very steep hill from the hotel.
