There are many places to see in downtown LA. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you would like a quiet place to stay.

We could see Union Station (a must-visit in itself) from our room and walking in this area felt safe and like we were in a 'real' community (unusual in LA). The next day I went to Hollywood and returned to Little Tokyo thinking this is a place of the future: yes, once it was an area that needed regeneration; now, it is an area with the Japenese American Museum and MOCA at the Geffen Contemporary.

I was a little bit concerned about the area, which in turn made me apprehensive about the hotel. I was very pleasantly surprised to find my concerns about the area and the hotel completely unwarranted. Let's start with the hotel: Very nicely appointed rooms, very comfortable beds, and very clean. It almost seemed like it was newly remodeled. Bathrooms include heated bidets with very complicated instructions - I didn't even try - but they looked cool. The high school kids were a little confused until I told them they were butt-washers, and then they just nodded and changed the subject. I had street-side windows, and any noise that got through was reasonable for downtown LA in the early evening. Then it got really quiet. In fact the only time noise bothered me at all was when it got so quiet (middle of the night) was a garbage truck beeping - for-ev-ver. (But that's not the hotels fault.) Room (7th floor) had a nice view of the San Bernadino mountains. The rest of the hotel facilities appear minimal - no gym, pool or anything like that. Big plus for free wifi and only $1 for the bottled water. It was refreshing to stay somewhere where I didn't feel like they were trying to turn the last screw. I found wonderfully tawdry bar on the second floor with a karaoke thing going on -obviously full of locals who take Karaoke -very- seriously! They have some sort of spa, but it's not a general use thing. No pool as far as I could tell. Down one star because of the absurdly over-priced breakfast buffet (albeit with some sort of asian flair). It was the only dining choice, and I wasn't quite ready to venture out. I could have used a simple breakfast. Didn't have that choice. The hotel staff was friendly and efficient, however the bar staff could have been a little more attentive. I had a friend meet me for a few drinks, and we had a lot of difficulty getting a second drink even though we were actually sitting AT the bar. The rest of the staff, including the front desk, valet, and concierge, heck even the housekeeper, were very helpful and friendly. (The housekeeper gets an extra ++ for checking with me about the rooms after realizing I was chaperoning kids). OK - the area: Downtown LA, a few blocks from City Hall. Metro station is just a short walk away and it only took 20 minutes or so to ride over to Hollywood to do the tourist thing. The Disney concert hall is within walking distance.There are starbucks coffee bars in every direction, but I'd head south one block and then go west. Seems to be a revitalized area with restaurants, shopping and bars in one of those hip condo live-walk-work communities.

Check in is supposed to be 3pm and as we did not want to be wandering around LA with our luggage and passports we had arranged (via email) to drop these off at the hotel for safe keeping around 10am. However, when we arrived just after 10am they had a room ready for us and allowed us to check in early at no extra cost. Our room safe would not work when we tried it but this was fixed within 5 minutes, it just needed a new battery. We did have a bit of bother finding the hotel though, mostly down to the fact that I forgot to take the map with me. Also, even although the address is East First street, the street signs just say First street which is confusing as even the locals didn't know where East first Street was.

My hotel needed to be in LA proper/central: my choice was Miyako or a hotel near the LA Live area (very touristy). Miyako may be in need of a renovation, but it's clean and reasonably priced, and most importantly, but it's in an up-and-coming, revitalized, and hipsterized Little Tokyo area. This is vital b/c there are times when you don't want to drive and just need a quick break or bite in the local surroundings. When i grew up, LT was dilapidated, almost ghetto-like. now it's teeming with cool boutiques, bars, delicious food, and is just a vibrant, cool place to hang out, everything within walking distance, and should eventually turn into more of a walking/strolling area without being a spectacle like Citywalk, etc. besides Japanese food, there is a german currywurst bierhaus, senor fish tacos, falafel, yogurt shops, etc.. everything within a block or two of Miyako. If you're new to LA, you may not appreciate this hotel's location. But if you are a frequent visitor looking for something more charming, cool, under-the-radar yet still in-the-know, this hotel offers you a clean room, good service, and awesome location.

The Miyako is one of the most centrally located hotels in the city, in the middle of Little Tokyo on First Street. From here you have easy access to the 101 and 5 freeways, downtown Los Angeles directly west, the arts district to the east, and the bars, restaurants and shops of J-Town all around you. The Metro Gold Line is literally 1 block away and connects to Union Station minutes away for access to all Metro services. It's one of the only hotels in the city that you can reach directly from LAX, Bob Hope or Ontario airports without even looking at a car. The hotel itself wasn't that great considering the price. I suspect if you pay for something more than the standard room I got, it might be nicer, but for the money I frankly expected a little higher quality.The second day of my stay there were maintenance guys working on the room across from mine, so I suspect it's clear to the owners the hotel is overdue for improvements. The hotel has the look and feel of a western-style hotel in Japan, with Japanese touches from the outside architecture to the room accents. My room on the 9th floor faced the Little Tokyo mall, and had the rare and welcome feature of an openable window. You can let in a breeze flavored with mingled scents of charbroiled teriyaki and the wild anise that grows downtown, which I totally enjoyed. The first thing I noticed about my room was that the door stuck. I went in and out often and each time it took three tries to force open the door. I had to master a technique and really put my shoulder into it. The room was pretty small, but managed to feature a really comfortable California king bed, a serious desk with drawers for storing your stuff and a comfy, stylish office chair. The lamp on the desk is not glaringly bright, provides a nice glow and yet is useful for reading and paperwork. Both sides of the bed feature generous night stands topped with Japanese-styled lamps. There is a long hanging Japanese paper lamp by the window that works on a reostat, making the room very atmospheric. The curtains over the window are bordered by wooden Japanese lattices that evoke a little Japanese ryokan feel. The closet is in the foyer behind a mirrored sliding door and is spacious. There is also a coffee service in a small recess adjacent to the closet. It sits on top of a heavy wood cabinet that houses the mini-fridge. There is no wireless access in the hotel except on the 2nd, 3rd and 11th floors and in the spa. I try to be objective in my reviews, but it's 2011 and they need to change that. Nobody carries a DSL cable around with them for their laptop. The bathroom is in need of remodeling, but is clean and functional. The door jam and walls are rife with nics and pitting around the corners from years of use. the toilet is awesome and like those in Japanese hotels features a bidet and heated seat. The shower has good pressure and a hand-held shower head to accommodate all heights. I paid one visit to the spa for a shiatsu massage and to check out the facilities. The bath and shower area are in need of maintenacne but again, are well-maintained. It kind of feels like an old familiar YMCA. Paint chips off the walls and old stubborn grime surrounds the doorway of the wet sauna. I was a little timid about taking off my spa sandals except for in the shower. The shiatsu massage was great and a good deal. Guests get a $10 off coupon so my 45-minute massage was $65 including the tip. A massage includes use of the entire facility which is a $20 value. The gym is small but really who cares about a gym in a hotel? There are lounges set up in the waiting room outside the massage room as well as outdoors on a small patio shaded by a wooden lattice and decorated with flowers and plants: a really nice feature. The massage room is totally relaxing, cool and comfortable and smells great. I wanted to visit the restaurant but didn't make it. The Tamon restaurant is run by the same company that owns Daikokuya and Ebisu here in J-Town and elsewhere, so I suspect it's delicious. The lounge features a full bar and karaoke, which I will experience if I stay here again. The little cafe in the lobby, Take 5, is a great place to chill. I'm sitting at a table outside it on the street as I write this. The coffee's good and the espresso drinks are okay. They have sandwiches and snacks, and a continental breakfast deal that's worth the money. There's comfortable seating inside and out and you can sit there and read or just hang out as long as you want. The staff with whom I interacted - mainly the front desk people and the spa attendant - were polite. I cannot go so far as to say friendly, but hey, polite works for me too. I did, however, feel more \"accommodated\" than welcome. If it weren't for my attempts to sort of cajole them, it would be hard for them to crack a smile. This isn't necessarily a criticism. It might just be the style of service the Miyako offers. Being sort of \"left alone\" is kind of nice. You can come and go as you please just like it's you're own apartment. However, compared to my experiences in Japan in general, I'm used to not only very friendly service but very friendly people in general. The Miyako is worth the stay for the location alone. I'm willing to overlook its faults in return for having downtown Los Angeles at my feet.

Now, its rated 3 stars here and I believe 2 or 2 1/2 on Priceline (the site used to procure the room), but I think that is a bit overrated for this hotel. To me it felt more like a better situated 2 star value chain hotel. First off, you have options for parking (valet or self). We chose self which is located in a parking structure attached to a mall and is a short hop from the hotel ourselves. This structure ended up being the view from our hotel room. To park in this structure you need to bring in your ticked and they'll stamp it and charge you $17 for overnight (it would've been $20 had I just used the parking rates for the structure). Check in was quick and easy. The room was average to below for a 3 star facility. Internet was included and they did have LCD televisions, but the room itself looked like it belonged more in a Clarion or Days Inn instead of this place. Again, I emphasize that it suited the purpose of our stay and did not take away from it in any manner. What sold me on this place was location. It is right in the heart of Little Tokyo and a short walk, public transport, or drive to many spots you'd want to see or visit. For us, it was half a mile from the venue our show was at. The truly exceptional aspect of its location is food choices. The best of Little Tokyo is literally outside your room. Daikokuya, a top notch ramen joint, is right across the street and during the 3 to 4pm hour, not much of a wait.

The window was able to be opened. The bed was a little soft for our taste (our only complaint). Parking next door in the Little Tokyo garage was very inexpensive on weekends, and at one exit time it was even free - no attendant was there when we left Sunday morning. The restaurants of the adjacent Little Tokyo shopping center were delicious, and wonderful for a mid-day snack or a full meal. We were in town for a show at the Ahmanson at Music Center, whjch was a short walk away - so no need for parking hassles at the theatre!

Excellent value for location: obvious choice if doing business in Little Tokyo / Arts District, but also close to City Hall and the rest of downtown, Union Station, fashion district, etc. Served by the gold line light rail, Little Tokyo / Arts District stop. A couple of random notes: the hotel is kind of wedged in and hard to notice from the street; it has a nice lobby, but from the sidewalk, there isn't a huge entry. Also, a note about breakfasts: if your room rate includes breakfast, pay attention to whether it is the buffet in the restaurant or the continental breakfast. The continental breakfast is basically croissants and coffee in the lobby snack stand. The buffet in the restaurant is a utilitarian mix of American (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc) and Asian (rice, congee, natto, etc). Not at all fancy, but fine.

Room service brought up nicely-presented, well-prepared Japanese food. The shiatsu massage and little spa was fabulous,very reasonably priced, and open late in the evening. The surrounding area was safe to walk in and very interesting--don't' miss the Japanese American National Museum. I'd be wary,though,of the nearby Kyoto Grand hotel, where we got kicked out of the garden by a bouncer, after the front desk receptionist invited us to see it--Poor management, perhaps? We also found a little gem of a restaurant/bar called Wurstkuche, very walkable at 800 E. 3rd Ave--try the vegetarian, chicken-ginger-apricot, hot Italian sausages,or a variety of others, all house-made, with many beers on tap. The only negatives were a noisy elevator shaft or something(we thought maybe it was the wind sock on the roof), and the construction going on at the police headquarters down the block from the front of the building--so get rooms in the back if the beeping of tractors bothers you.

Lobby area was nice, staff was very helpful and front desk always answered all the questions. They have maps of surrounding area which includes restaurants etc. Overall, the location is great - you can easily walk to Chinatown and all over downtown. And the area is safe. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: Metro (Union station) is only a 10 min walk from the hotel. You can take it to the Hollywood area directly, only 1.25 each way or 5 for all-day pass which includes buses. Buses go all over the city but usually take a while to get from one area to another due to the number of stops and big crowds. Ask the front desk for directions / locations of the bus stops. Bus drivers are also very friendly and will direct you to transfers and where to get off. AIRPORT TRANSPORTATION: No shuttle to the hotel. Be aware that if you take a cab from airport, there is an additional fee. We ended up paying about $60 with tip. Depending on how many people you have, you could opt out for the airport shuttle which is $16 per person. Taxi back to the airport is at flat rate of $46.50 RENTAL CAR: We wanted to get a rental at the hotel but drop it off at the airport - apparently there is a $100 fee, which we decided to avoid. Went through Enterprise. It was $60 per day for the least expensive car and we ended up paying another $19 for valet parking to drop the car off because Enterprise was closed on our drop-off day. INTERNET: Even though they have free wi-fi the connection was so slow, at times it was completely unusable - most sites timed out or took 10 min+ to load. Best speed was in the morning. BAR: Bar was super small with karaoke - there were about 2 more customers besides ourselves. The music wasn't great since no one sang and there was only the soundtrack going. Drinks were very expensive, and after 8pm you have to pay $6 cover plus 2 drinks min per person... not sure why. We went to the bar at Kyoto Grand on 2nd Street - much better and still close to the hotel. FOOD: If you like Japanese / Asian food there are so many choices. Most definitely try the noodle place across the street - there are always lines but it's worth it. Inexpensive, for a lot of good authentic tasty food (we tried noodles and sushimi - both very generous portions). Oomasa around the corner in the Japanese Village Plaza was also very good. Starbucks is around the corner - ask front desk for the local map. PARKING: As others have mentioned, don't use the valet parking at the hotel, it's $19 vs. $10 maximum at the mall garage next door. Parking lot adjacent to the hotel is $8 during the day or $13 overnight. SPA: Would very highly recommend the shiatsu massage - it was amazing and not expensive, about $50 for 45 min.

The bathrooms are nicely done with the \"high tech\" toilets and I love the oversized shower head. The carpeting in the rooms is typical hotel carpeting but honestly I don\u2019t care about that. The view is great of down town LA, and the wireless internet access was surprisingly fast, im talking T-1 fast. As I said before if you go with the business class room the beds are extremely comfortable and the linins are very soft and comfortable, the comforter is just so nice and soft. There is a safe, larger sized mini fridge, iron and ironing board, desk with plenty of outlets, phone, very stylish lamps, a couch with foot rest or a long couch, and a nice large flat screen TV.

I blame the staff who cared little for the comfort of guests, and acted as if having to interact with patrons was a big interruption to their casual conversations. My room had no heat, and I tried to switch rooms a few times, to no avail. They insisted on fixing the furnace, which was fine when the heat first stopped working, but was nonsensical by the third time! The staff even sent the bellman one morning when I woke up freezing -- and he tried to make up an excuse by saying that I didn't know how to use a thermostat, which was absolutely wrong and insulting. I gave up asking for a new room, and sat in coffee shops for warmth. LA had unusually cold temps, but that's still no excuse for not having a functional heater. To make matters worse, my room smelled like mildew and old trash. I should have switched rooms just for that (they ignored that request too), but I discovered by wandering around that the ENTIRE hotel had an old, unclean smell to it, like trash, cigarettes, and mildew. Housekeeping comes by early, and if you are not ready for them by 10:30am, they stick a nasty-gram under your door. Of course, I wasn't planning to be in my room that much, considering the cold and the smell, but on the two occasions I decided to return after breakfast to make a phone call and pick up some items, they let me know that I was not welcome to linger. Also, there were only two pillows on the bed, no extra blanket, and I could not get more when I asked the housekeeping staff. Parking is not easy, but be careful! The front desk will tell you it's cheaper to park with them, but if you park in the Little Toyko Mall parking garage, which is the SAME BUILDING, they will charge you less than half of what the Miyako charges. It cost me $62 for 8 days of parking; the Miyako was going to charge me $136 ($17/day for self park, $24/day for valet). What makes me frustrated most about the stay is not the poor service at the front desk, but the lost opportunity. The hotel could have had so much to offer. The shiatsu massage was one of the best I've ever had, though the spa was dirty and the reception was not very helpful and seemed stressed. The cafe in the lobby was convenient and offered good food and service. Even the gift shop clerk was friendly and nice. Best of all was the location -- in the heart of Little Toyko, it's close to public transportation, downtown activities, a huge selection of restaurants, and has a wonderful view of city hall. I enjoy the Japanese culture and was looking forward to this visit. It's a shame that the Miyako Hotel had such poor execution. I am a quiet, respectful guest who never complains and I travel frequently on business. This is the first time I felt motivated to write a review and warn others. My recommendation: Stay here for the location, the local restaurants, and the shiatsu massage. Have a high tolerance for the cold and damp, and be able to ignore bad smells and awful service. The rates aren't low enough to account for the poor treatment of guests.

When I checked in, as dripping as I was, no one offered me any towels, nor any way to dry my clothes (they have washers & dryers, but no one made mention of this to me).

I am not a big fan of the neighborhood around the LA convention center because there's really a lack of a neighborhood feel around it. Also, there is a lack of reasonable food options around the convention center. Instead of staying too far from the convention center, we decided to stay in Little Tokyo, which is relatively close to the convention center. Being a big fan of Japanese food and culture, it was a perfect solution to our problem. The hotel itself, however, was not as nice as I hoped. Basically, we got what we paid for. Our room was clean and relatively functional, but was very small. No special amenities. The doornob, I think, was in need of repair. However, free internet access was great. We had a great government rate deal (I workk for a public benefit corporation for the state of New York) which included a room, free internet, free \"continental\" breakfast, and a visit to their spa. However, by no means we felt \"unsafe.\" In terms of safety, I would feel much less safe around the convention center. If this hotel was located in a boring neighborhood, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. However, for those who will be going to LA for a convention, I highly recommend staying at Miyako instead of any of the typical \"convention hotels.\" The hotel is centrally located in Little Tokyo, more centrally so than other hotels. We found too many wonderful places to shop and eat around the hotel than any other hotel we have ever stayed in our travels. We had breakfast mainly in their \"Take 5\" lobby cafe, but we tried the Japanese style buffet breakfast in their 2nd floor \"Tamon\" restaurant twice. The breakfast was pretty good, since it was either part of the package at \"Take 5\" or discounted at \"Tamon.\" However, I think it is sort of silly to stay in the hotel for your food, since there are a lot of options just outside the hotel. Also, the hotel is very close to a couple of museums (Japanese American National Museum and MOCA Geffen), both of them are worth visiting. The spa area on the third floor is clean and nice, probably not the nicest spa I have been to. I may not recommend it unless it is \"free.\" There is a coin operated laundry area, also on the third floor. In summary, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who needs to stay in downtown LA, especially for conventions.

I've stayed there before and like the hotel and location. When I compared prices about a month before the trip the Travelodge was $99 and Miyako was $109 plus approx $20 for parking. Then about two weeks before the trip I checked again and the prices were switcehd; Miyako at $99 (via their website) and Travelodge at $109. Hence we stayed at the Miyako....and it was a very pleasant experience. Finding the hotel was easy as was valet parking. Desk clerks were fine and yes they speak English. I have no idea what other reviewers were talking about. The clerk also upgraded us to a business room that was fnatastic and very nice. He even went out ofhis way to tell us about the immigrant march planned for the next day and gave us a map with the route and any parking resirctions. He even gave some guidance on driving away from the march area. He was very helpful. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants. There's a Starbuck's-style coffeee place off the lobby but instead I walked to a real Starbuck's two blocks away (west?, left out the door) at the Otani.

The hotel lobby was a little scary to me at first and I was really worried that I had made reservations to stay there. Our room was ok, nothing special. I really did enjoy the linens on the beds though. They also had down comforters, something you don't find in a lot of hotels these days. They do charge for phone calls, even when you have a calling card. I had to get the front desk to allow my call by giving my credit card number to them once again. Most Hotels where I have stayed do not charge for calling card calls. It wasn't a big deal just somewhat of an inconvenience. The following morning I made a trip to the lobby and was surprised by the difference from the night before. They have a gift shop and a small cafe that was opened and it really helped brighten up the look of the lobby.
