We were not happy at all with our service from the guys at this hotel. In fact this was our worst trip. We arrived on the saturday morning and were able to check in early which we thought was great. As we weren't supposed to check in until 2pm it was an added bonus for us so we could drop our luggage off. When we checked in we were in a room that was still not cleaned from the night before. The beds weren't made and it was obvious someone had been smoking in the room, so we left our bags there and assumed this would be cleaned. We went about our day into amsterdam. As we returned at around 4pm, our room was still in the same condition and we were disgusted that this had happened. We reported this to the receptionist who apologised and promised to get it sorted and told us to come back in two hours. we went away and returned within an hour as we had no where else to go where we were staying. We were tired and weary from the travelling and it been a long day. We were left to wait in the reception and was ignored by the reception staff. After an hour and a half i thought id go and check the room. It turns out it had been cleaned but no one had bothered to tell us At this point i was angry with the receptionist who said she would alert us as to then the room was ready. The receptionist then started to argue back with me which i was appalled at. It got to the point where i had to tell the receptionist we would be making a complaint. After asking for details on how to do this, she replied 'the details are on your keycard' which to me made it clear she couldn't be bothered to help us in anyway whatsoever. It was the worst start to our holiday and the fact the receptionist argued back with me just topped it off. I couldn't believe we were treated like this. Bearing in mind how much money we had spent on the hotel i was appalled by the overall experience we received in this hotel which is shame because the facilities were nice and the breakfast buffet was also great. Dont try and check in early and be prepared to walk into town.

Make sure you get off at Bos en Lommerplein and not Bos en Lommerweg which is 2 stops beforehand. The hotel itself is purpose built and not a converted town house with the usual steep stairs. Here you get elevators and en suite bathrooms. Room had the basics. Hairdryer, tea facilties, free tv and extra pay tv. No fridge though.

It was advertised as being close to Central Station. It is nowhere near the centrum. After realizing that we were hoodwinked, we reluctantly checked in and the hotel staff ignored us for the first 10 minutes. We informed them about our displeasure about being misled about the location and they were disinterested in hearing what we had to say. After prepaying for two nights (a common practice in Europe) we went to our room where it was dusty, the phone continually fell off of the wall when one walked by,and the bathroom was tiny with the toilet tightly situated between tub and the wall. After discussing our options we decided to leave and find another hotel. The manager tried to get us to stay at another Best Western for more money, but we were uninterested. We asked the manager to refund our credit card and the manager refused. He gave us excuse after excuse as to why he could not do that and eventually he told us he was only concerned about getting his commission. He was perfectly content to allow his customers to be extremely unhappy rather than assist in any way. At one point all three of us were arguing with him to just credit our credit card and he continually refused. He actually looked at me and said \"I learned a long time ago not to trust anyone with pretty blue eyes.\" We eventually cancelled our reservation through Easy Booking and left with the understanding that he would refund us our 300 euros. The money was not refunded until we arrived back in the U.S. and they only refunded us half of the money owed. I have traveled all over the world and understand that customer service is defined differently wherever one travels, but this was truly the worst service I have ever received and actually felt this hotel was holding our money hostage.

There were 2 supermarkets to choose from situated beside the hotel underground car park.(this was very handy) we suggest you try to have at least one dinner at the hotel as we were both very satisfied with decor, setting, service and of course the food. The sea bass is a must. The chef even added a personal touch by cutting a piece of chicken we ordered into a heat shape, this was a nice touch as he thought the chicken was for my lady, but I had ordered it and I didn't appreciate his individuality as much as a female would've but it was a nice touch! All in all our stay was both enjoyable and comfortable, one piece of advice, the Dutch are very laid back and so much so, that we became very laid back and missed our ferry back by 2 hours due to a mixture of lasting coffee shop effects and really just taking it easy as they seem to do.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBargain of the year!\u201d", "Author": "gladysScotland", "ReviewID": "UR116635814", "Content": "Booked this short break for my husband's birthday.

Thanks to Trip Advisor reviewers, we found it no problem, Had been a bit concerned re some of the reviews talking about it being a dodgy area. Yes, it's a residential area but gave us no concern whatsoever. Think some folk live a sheltered life!! Reception very helpful and efficient. Room was on the 10th floor. Room was huge. Lovely bath and toiletries for soak after walking all day! Beds were really comfy. Aircondiitoning very good.Travelled in and out to Centraal and Dam Square no problem on tram and bus using 72 hour public transport pass purchased at Info centre when we got off train from airport - again all info gleaned from TA subscribers. Breakfast plentiful although husband not impressed with scrambled egg. Staff in restaurant a bit brusque but efficient. Was struggling to get wifi access on my notebook through no fault of the hotel system but then I realised there were two PCs in the reception area which were free to use. Sorted!! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a cheap but quality break within easy reach of all the many attractions of Amsterdam. Also bought a 24 hour pass on the Cnal bus which was great value too. Was surprised that we ended up eating in Greek restaurants twice - they tended to be best value although the steak on offer at one of the various Argentinian steak houses was delicious. Last point nothing to do with hotel - I was SO impressed with the Schipol Airport! Took almost as many photos there as I did of Amsterdam! of the various exhibits like the china elephants, mini Riksmuseum and Delft teapot playhouse.

The hotel is modern and in a fairly residential area with a main road running past. It was very quiet though and felt safe. Our 10th floor room was perfectly fine, comfortable, king bed, clean, air con, safe, tea/coffee, toiletries etc. However, we found the sheets stained with some blood after our 1st night. We complained at reception and the staff could not have been more attentive and helpful - they immediately and without question upgraded up to an executive room for free. They came with a manager to check the sheets and it was all done with great efficiency. We had only expected them to change the linen, and so we were very satisfied with the outcome situation. I believe it was a one-off incident and so I would still thoroughly recommend this hotel. Our new room was excellent, just as comfortable but larger. No complaints about the rooms at all. Breakfast was fine - streaky bacon, scrambled eggs, grilled tomatos, cold meats, cheese, rolls, croissants, fruit etc, The usual. It was self service and did the job of keeping us going through the day. Reception staff were very helpful, not only with our linen complaint but with helping us find our way around and providing information on restaurants, where to go / not go. This hotel is not in central Amsterdam - its a 10 minute tram ride. (hence why its a lot cheaper than city centre hotels). The tram is the easiest way to get around, and it stops close to hotel and is very convenient for reaching all central parts. Would recommend an Iamsterdam card (iamsterdam.com) for FREE tram / bus travel, a canal tour (excellent), free entry to museums, money off Heinken Musuem (excellent) and money off restaurants etc. Had we not had the card, we wouldnt have done as much and it worked out fanatastic value for us.

As most hotels were quite we decide to upgrade to a 4 star hotel as a treat. We arrived at Central Station and caught the no.21 BUS (across the bridge from the station and opposite the Victoria Hotel). The hotel is indeed about 15/20 mins out of town not a problem with the superb transport we found it quicker by tram no.14 than bus, but busses easier to find. The hotel stop is called Bos en Lommerplein. Upon arrival (after walking across the shopping plaza) we are greeted to a lavish Reception 4 star if ever I saw one. However once we reached the room we discovered that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the stars end! A twin room was given to us (even though a double was booked, happens a lot apparently). No mini bar standard in most 3 stars. Room covered in little (sweet wrappers, empty drink cans under bed) The cherry on the cake though, was opening the bathroom and finding the sink waste pipe on the floor and foul smelling water spewed all over the marble floor. We reported this and went out to lunch on arrival back nothing had changed so decided to fix the pipe and clean up myself. (should I send them an invoice for my plumbing??) Also to note, the hotel seems to be a favourite stay for European school/college trips. Breakfast if you can called it that!! We ate at different times of the morning and still hardly anything was available including basics like bread, juice, milk and fruit. Save yourself time and effort and eat out once you have got to town or grab some breakfast thing at the 2 supermarkets near bus stops. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure not everyone will have these experiences but if you are thinking you are getting a four star hotel for your money you are NOT.

People who find fault with this hotel really should do there research before booking. Although im sure these are the kind of people that like to find fault. Anyway enough of my ranting! As the hotel is not in the centre of Amsterdam it does require the use of public transport to get to the main tourist hotspots. (taxis to these places or the airport is really not worth the money) As Amsterdam has one of the best networks in the world this is not a problem. Tram/bus stop is literally 60 seconds up the road. You can get the number 14 or number 21. 14 takes you to Dam square, 21 to Central station. Buses and trams come literally every 5 minutes and we were never left waiting long. Dam square and Central station are only 5 min walk from each other though. A bus from the hotel to Central station takes 10-15mins. If you are going to use public transport for more than 24hours then it pays to get a bus/tram pass which can be bought in 24hour blocks. We got 72hours for about 14euro. These are bought from tourist information centre opposite Central station. To save a lot of money travelling too and from the airport go by bus and train. Get the train from Schnipol airport to Sloterdiik train station then get the number 18 bus to Bos en Lommerplein. This is where your hotel is. Its so simple, cost a quarter of the taxi fare and only took 30mins. Do the reverse to get back to the airport obviously! Only other thing to mention is the area the hotel is in. In some peoples eyes it may appear a 'rough' area but trust me its not. Its completely safe and i can only gather the negative comments are because the area is very multi-cultural. So if you have left your country mansion in the last 25 years you won't batter an eye lid!

We always stay a little away from the centre in order to get a nicer hotel for our money but we were really disappointed with the area of this hotel. The tram stop is a 1 min walk from the hotel, trams are frequent & it takes about 20mins to get to Dam Square. The hotel is randomly placed in the middle of an Asian area & surrounded by what look like lots of blocks of council flats. It is not a tourist area & there is NOTHING here for tourists except for KFC & a supermarket. This isn't ideal as it means you always have to travel in into the city for food, drinks etc which ends up in the hotel being a pain to get to and from. The hotel itself is really nice & modern & spotlessly clean, couldn't really fault the interior at all. The reception staff are very helpful if you ask them things but they don't go out of their way to be friendly, they don't seem to smile much. Breakfast wasn't geared up to the English at all, the choice was 3 cereals, a fruit bowl, various bread rolls, cheese, ham, salami, salad, scrambled egg & bacon, no pastries or bakery goods etc. They serve until 10.30am but when asking for some bacon at 9am we were told to come earlier! The staff at breakfast were rude & tables weren't being cleared. For a 4* hotel I was extremely disappointed with breakfast! We were upgraded to a large Executive room which was really nice & could not be faulted. The bed was a kingsize & super comfortable & there was lots of drawer and cupboard space. It was a little strange there being no minibar & our TV (which we didn't have to pay for) only had about 2 English channels which was a bit disappointing. If this hotel was in an area with stuff going on I would certainly stay again as I liked the hotel but in reality it's just a hotel in the middle of an Asian community council housing estate so I probably wont return and would in opt to stay in Diemen again at the NH Tropen as this is similar distance from the city but Diemen has loads going on from pubs to restaurants to shops so you don't always have to rely on being in the city.

Unfortunately, its halo seems to be slipping. I do not like hotels which insist on advance payment for extended stays \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in this case 6 nights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without offering a substantial discount. I asked for an extra pillow on my way out and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when it had not arrived \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on my way back on my second day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it did not come. After a third \u00e2\u20ac\u201c written \u00e2\u20ac\u201c request I finally got it the next day. The floor was not vacuumed for at least three days in a row and we were left with a toilet roll with only a few sheets and no spare. Increases in public transport fares mean that, certainly if you are a couple, you can easily afford to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 a night more for a central location and still show a profit. This is what I will do next time. It is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.60 for a single ticket on the tram or bus for one hour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though only \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7 all day which is quite good value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although on two out of five occasions the tram conductors did not have the tickets. As this was only 10am it smacks of poor planning on the part of the individual conductor or the company. It also gives you a chance to see multi-cultural Amsterdam as you travel on the buses and trams or, looked at another way, travel with dangerous looking youths and kids who run riot and scream for the whole journey. The hotel is certainly situated in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multi-cultural\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area. This does mean plenty of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ethnic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd food in the restaurants and shops. There are two good supermarkets immediately behind the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c under the market square \u00e2\u20ac\u201c plus a KFC, banks, etc. Room Apart from a large pillar in the middle of the room it was of reasonable size with a decent size bathroom and shower. If you shut the bathroom door it required a lot of force to open it once more. There was a large, comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if anything too soft \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bed with slightly small sheets. The (central) air conditioning coped with the July temperatures. The room has a kettle, safe, flat screen TV (with BBC 1 and 2) but no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfridge which, given the heat and the fact the hotel says it is 4*, would have been nice. There was free wireless internet but not of very high speed. The view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of a block of council flats at close range - was uninspiring! I had requested a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room but was put on the 4th floor out of 10! - another example of the hotel not paying attention to detail. Noise If anyone slammed a door anywhere on the floor my door and lampshade rattled loudly. Unlike some other hotels, there is only one door to the corridor and not an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153air-lock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd formed by a second inner door to deaden the noise. If you are prone to singing in your shower be warned that, thanks to the ventilation system, your \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concert\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be broadcast around the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as will your neighbours for you to hear. Food As breakfast was not included in the rate we used the excellent supermarket next door for pastries etc. Breakfast was available at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 if ordered the night before or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14.50 if you just turn up. From the noise emanating from the breakfast room when the lift stopped there on the way out in the morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something like school dinners at a primary school with a poor disciplinary record \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I am glad we opted for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option! The hotel does have a restaurant and there are others nearby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of which does a full English breakfast. Amsterdam Amsterdam should be a delightful place to stroll along the canals and stop in a shady bar for a beer or jonge jenever. However, of course the actuality is somewhat different as you try to avoid being mown down by kamikaze cyclists and motor cyclists who obey no rules of the road and who park their machines all over what little pavement there is by the canals. However, with a little effort it is possible to enjoy walking by the more distant canals. The Hortus (botanical gardens) is well worth a visit for somewhere peaceful for a change. If you are not too prudish and like a good laugh then the Sex Museum is for you. The main museums are overcrowded and overpriced but there are plenty of smaller ones - like the purse and bag museum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to enjoy.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "AliG317", "ReviewID": "UR71514615", "Content": "Went to this hotel on a quick 2 night stay with friends to Amsterdam.

First of all, eventhough it is cold for this time of the year, the two windows only open longitudinaly for a bit and it is impossible to open entire window so it was relatively hot in the room while air-con wasn't working even after few complains. Looking at extremely ugly Muslims in neighbourhood isn't the problem, someone said people who don't like this are islamophobs which isn't true for me or other people who hate this place, I'm sure, cause problem is hotel itself. Next, there was a strange quite knocking from inside the walls, I believe it is something about instalation and it iritates.

The price of the hotel was within my budget and I thought it was very close to the amsterdam city centre so I booked it for three nights. The services provided within the hotel were fantastic in terms of room service, amenities etc. Even the size of the room was larger than I expected making you feel quite relaxed and not crammed up in a tiny place. However, the only disappointing thing was that it was in the outskirts of the amsterdam city centre and it took me 30 mins everyday to go to the city which was kind of a problem if you wanted to go back to the hotel and relax frequently. If you are looking at affordable accommodation and dont mind travelling 20-30 mins to city centre then this hotel is something i would recommend to you. The taxi fares from hotel to the city were around 10 europs whereas a tram ride was no more than 2-3 euros which was worth it considering the fact that room prices for other hotels in the city centre were around 30-40% more.

The hotel website has great instructions on which tram and bus to catch to and from Amsterdam City Centre. The location of the hotel is good, the locals were friendly and going about their daily lives. In the day its buzzing with workers and local shoppers and on certain days there was a market square with lots of bargains. There is also restaurants take- aways, KFC (although UK one is the best :D) and supermarkets. The room we booked was just a double room nice furniture, flat screen telly, nice tiled clean bathroom, it was a funny shape room but it was nice and cosy. The breakfast room was amazing lovely range of teas, juices, fruit, only downside was they didn;t have any sausages, but lots of nice bacon and boiled and scrambled egg. Nice decor to enjoy your brekkie in, amazing artwork on walls and lovely views and stylish furniture. Back to our room there was some cobwebs on the ceiling, I did ask nice lady at reception if it could be cleaned she said it should be sorted by the time we came back from our day out. When we came back It wasn't cleaned I just assumed they never got round it to it.....when we went to reception to upgrade our telly service, the nice lady at reception asked if our cobweb problem was sorted, I said no it was still on the ceiling...she offered us a free complimentary drink in the bar which I thought was nice, her manager then whispered something in her ear and the reception asked us if we would like a free room upgrade instead, we were like yes please.!.... The room upgrade was well worth it, it was in the top floor with beautiful view of the city streets nice spacious room, only downside no mini bar to keep our drinks cool :), the bathroom was amazing while on loo or in shower there were beautiful views of the city streets very nice room.....I would recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cToo bad about the surroundings\u201d", "Author": "Billunga", "ReviewID": "UR66262814", "Content": "Online reviews were very accurate so we were quite prepared for what we got in terms of amenities, location and transport.

We we're told we couldn't check-in until 14.00 on the first day, but a couple of hours after that we we're told we couldn't, as they had overbooked! We were moved to their sister hotel - the Blue Square, about 1-2 miles down the road. The rooms were very similar, but what annoyed me more than most is that both hotels had stupid rivalries and brinkmanship between the two, saying \"ours is best\" all the time. The second day we we're told we could we could move back which we did. The room wasn't perfect by any means. There were black marks on the curtains and rings on the windowsill which I assume had beer cans on. However, both the bathroom and the beds themselves were clean which is the main thing. We didn't spend much time in the hotel room, so it was good for what we needed. There was a decent view of West Amsterdam from our 8th floor room. Eventhough there was a motorway very close, sleeping was fine and the hotel was quiet. Prices in the city for food and drink especially is extortionate to say the least. I once paid 6.50 one night just for a Coke and one of the shops just outside the hotel we're selling oranges for 2Euro... per orange! We didn't eat in the hotel having found out that a buffet breakfast cost 14.50 a time. We managed to work out in the end the confusing public transport system. It works well if you know what you're doing! I advise getting a 3 day chipcard for 15Euro a piece, but you can get different durations for your needs. You can have unlimited access to trams, buses and metro trains. Well worth it and better than spending 2.60 for a single ticket!

We stay here as we have family nearby, not for the Amsterdam attractions (the centre is 15 minutes by tram). On arrival we were allocated a room on the first floor. This floor is shabby. It's right by the restaurant and the rooms appear to be for staff. The hallway is shabby and rooms have numbers printed on paper and stuck to the doors. We had a strange shaped room, long corridor, small bathroom with only a shower and a double bed crammed into a corner room with windows on two sides. The windows looked out on the flat roof at the front and side of the hotel were there were broken chairs and rubbish. The room was cold despite upping the temperature. There was a persistent sound of running water so after one night we asked to move. Reception staff did find us another room but I was disappointed that our complaint did not seem to come as a surprise. There was not apology either. So room number two on the 8th floor was fine. Although in neither room did we have a tea bags or milk for a drink and neither was particularly clean. However, it was quiet and we did sleep well. Unlike our companions who had a 9th floor room on the A10 ring road side and really suffered with the traffic noise. So, on to the reasons why this hotel has gone down in my estimations\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 1. The situation with the lifts. There are three but you have to wait forever for one to arrive. It is ridiculous for a hotel with 10 floors. The stairs are not obvious although we did find them. The cleaners use the stairwell to smoke and they are smelly and dirty. I was really concerned to find that on the ground floor the stairwell, which is an emergency exit was blocked! 2. The staff are not rude but there is no real customer service. No one really cares. I suppose this is the reality in a big hotel but it could be improved, drastically. 3. Breakfast. 14.50 Euros for not a lot. Really expensive, I would recommend getting something from the supermarket or bakery across the street. 4. Cleanliness of both public areas and rooms could be better. Generally dusty and dirty. Good things to note - the adjacent car park is cheap if you decide to take your car. 6 Euros a day but you must get a tram ticket there and speak to the attendant.

Behind me dragged my luggage, my boyfriend and numerous plastic bags filled with accumulated treasures from our previous stop in Rotterdam. The only thing that had got any lighter that day was my purse. We had parked in the underground car park next to the hotel. It has a direct entrance into the hotel reception, however the parking isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t free for hotel guests. The entrance area is certainly no big talking point, clean but rather unwelcomingly lit and furnished. It was cold and gave the impression of an office block reception rather than a hotel. A small and unfrequented bar sits to the right. After having completed the usual check-in formalities, we headed up to our room on the 7th floor. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to say that the lifts in that hotel are the slowest in the world, but that would be unfair, I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tried them all. My boyfriend and I stayed in room 710 and despite having booked a double room, were disappointed upon entrance to see two twin beds pushed together, yet made up individually. It made no sense. Surely even if one person had booked the double room, it would be sensible to assume that the reason they had done so was that they wanted a double bed. My mistake perhaps. Despite this, the room was of acceptable size with a large window that overlooked the city. It was nicely furnished, if not a little dated, with mahogany wardrobes, cabinets and two chairs by the window. It had the usual amenities: tea-making facilities, TV, air-con/heating, safe and hair dryer but no mini bar. An added bonus was the free Wi-Fi Internet access in the room, which nowadays is essential, particularly for customers who are traveling for business. The telephone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, although, from overhearing another customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaint at reception, it would seem that this was the case throughout the building.\u00c2\u00a0 The bathroom was clean and stocked up with the basics. It had a bath and integrated shower that worked perfectly and was very much appreciated throughout our stay. After an ok night's sleep, the following morning I decided to visit Amsterdam city centre. One of the staff at reception called me a taxi and I waited in the lobby for my allocated 10 minutes for it to arrive. The cab was to cost 15 euros, fixed rate, to the square. Reasonable. As I mused over this thought, aggressive shouts echoed through the room, bringing me back to reality like a slap round the ears. One of the staff members was arguing fiercely over the phone. She was sat behind an opaque glass screen acting as a small office next to the reception. I wondered whether she thought it was soundproof as she yelled expletives at a certain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chris\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\u00c2\u00a0 I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe what I was hearing and was amazed at the level of unprofessionalism that I was witnessing. Already, up until that point, I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t found the staff to be particularly friendly but this was just unacceptable, not to mention uncomfortable. The taxi arriving was a relief to say the least. We stayed for two nights and on the second decided to sample the food at the hotel restaurant on the 1st floor. This in itself was a task as it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear where it was and in the end we had to ask at reception. The restaurant is new and only opened in July this year. Compared to the rest of the hotel, it is rather luxurious. It has the appearance of a fancy gastro pub, dimly lit and furnished in a modern \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leather chairs and wooden tables\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd kind of way. Our time there however, was very short lived. After sitting down and browsing over the menu, it quickly became clear that the price-list was way out of our league with a main dish averaging at 20 euros and a bottle of still water at 6. It seemed so strange that a pretty averagely priced hotel would have such an expensive restaurant, particularly as this is the only one in the place. We left in the hope of finding somewhere a little more down to earth in the city. The Blue Tower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is too far from the centre to walk and there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything of any interest close by. Which, in itself is pretty inconvenient when there is only one over-priced restaurant in the hotel and nothing to do in terms of evening entertainment. \u00c2\u00a0Overall, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it to anybody wanting to visit Amsterdam and would think twice before staying there again myself.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, UK", "Title": "\u201cAgreed with previous reviewers\u201d", "Author": "SuppersReady", "ReviewID": "UR49506575", "Content": "It's diffcult to disagree with much that has already been written about the Blue Tower. It's a very nice hotel and good value because of it's out of centre location. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade and our room was lovely with a very large bathroom. The breakfast didn't provide too many choices but all was very good quality. The reception staff were all very friendly and happy to answer our many questions. The hotel is located behind the shopping precinct at Bos en Lommerplein. The area has many shops and several supermarkets and felt perfectly safe to walk around. To get to the hotel from Centraal station take either the 18 or 21 bus to Bos en Lommerplein (the next stop is displayed on all buses and trams so don't worry that you won't know where to get off). You can also take the 14 tram to Dam Square, the Anne Frank museum and Rembrantsplein and the 7 tram to Leidseplein. All journeys take 15 to 20 minutes which isn't too bad but did get a bit tiresome after a couple of days. It's worth buying the public transport day passes from the information office outside Centraal (they are sold for durations of 1 to 4 days) as this will probably save you money if you make a couple of trips into town a day. A couple of general observations. For restaurants, it's worth going to Leidseplein in the evening as the competition means that there is better value to be had than in other areas in the centre - several Italian restaurants are offering decent quality pizza and pasta menus for 5 euros. Due to the low Sterling rate we found much in Amsterdam quite expensive so such cheap meals in reasonable restaurants was a good find. I'd also recommend the \"La Place\" food hall in the V&D department store on Damrak for very good value food. One thing that caught us out was the ticket machines in Centraal and Schiphol.

Overall, I would say that it's a very nice hotel, new, nice facilities, clean rooms, etc. We were looking for a hotel that is not in the center, but is in a more quiet neighborhood, since we were travelling with our 6 year old daughter. We did have to book a triple room since European hotels often have just twin size beds, and we had 3 people. The hotel is located in the Bos en Lommerweg neighborhood, and the tram stop is right next to the hotel, so it's an easy 15 minute ride to the center, which we didn't mind at all. I did not like the breakfast at the hotel that much, but we usually didn't take advantage of it as we woke up too late. A \"Bagels and Beans\" cafe right across the street on Bos en Lommer will cost you about the same or less, and the food's better. Now, for the annoying parts: the free Wi-Fi, which was one of the important features of this hotel for us, didn't work for 6 out of the 8 days that we stayed there. I honestly don't know what takes so long to fix it. That was a major inconvinience, as we were planning to rely on finding out various details of our trip on the internet, and were not able to do so (that same Bagels and Beans cafe does have a free Wi-Fi that works). Also, my pajamas disappeared one of the days after they cleaned the room. I doubt anyone took it on purpose, probably the cleaning people grabbed it by mistake, but they never did find it, which was also a bit annoying. Other than that, I thought it was a nice place to stay in Amsterdam. If you have a car, there is a garage right next to the hotel where you can park your car, which is not cheap (14 euroes a day), but it is open only until 10 p.m. If you come after 10 p.m., you can leave your car on the street, but you will need to either move it to the garage or pay for parking starting at 9 a.m. the next morning.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel, poor service and facilities\u201d", "Author": "BiggerBlings", "ReviewID": "UR39601757", "Content": "Booked online, had never been to this hotel and certainly wouldn't go again.

I would not recommend this hotel to any body who is just going to Dam to get so wrecked out their face they need to crawl home. but if youur willing to do a little (and it really is a little) travelling into dam (in fact i stayed at ehe eden hotel last time and from Dam square its a good 20-25 min walk) then you will be fine. just take in the scenery as you drive past and you will be ther in no time.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiltshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cCan't be faulted.\u201d", "Author": "seanppk", "ReviewID": "UR37931937", "Content": "Try as I might I can't find fault with this hotel.

They even sell tickets at the reception (eg \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7 for a 24 hour citypass in 2008). 2.Accommodation prices are cheap for a 4* rated hotel close to the centre. 3.Rooms are spacious and well equipped. 4.WLAN is free 5.Public parking garage adjoins the hotel, and, if you leave before the attendant starts work, it is free, otherwise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6 per day. 6.Some wonderful eateries and cafes are nearby. 7.Very handy for access to airport, without traffic jams. Now the negatives: 1.Sound-proofing is poor between rooms. Although not kept awake by \"audible friendliness\" of adjacent rooms, the keys turning in the doors certainly echoed when opened or closed. 2.Local residents are victims of night time car racing.It was possibly a one-off, but the pre-dawn (3am) chorus of tyre screeches was a form of Amsterdam nightlife I could have done without (although once awakened, the visual spectacle of waiting to see a crash was entertaining if not ultimately disappointing) 3.Night/early morning receptionist wasn't the brightest spark. When checking out at 7am to catch a flight, although polite, he was easily distracted, starting tasks for anyone who shouted, before completing service for current queuing customers. In his defence he complained that he had not slept all night!! (Certainly in my days of working night-shifts, that was always the point) In summary, if you will be awake all night anyway (or drunk), and not in a hurry to check-out, then location price and quality of facilities are top notch.

She found rooms for us at the Bilderberg Hotel, which was only 10 dollars more and 100 times nicer. When the taxi driver picked us up from the Blue Tower, he told us the owner of that hotel only ran \"budget\" hotels and didn't spend money on them.

During the day there is a large flea market in the square, but at night there is little activity. There are a few small grocery stores and restaurants a couple of blocks away if you want to grab food at night, and I felt 100% safe in the neighborhood. It isn't downtown, but the buses and trams can be picked up on the opposite side of the square and it's about a 10 to 20 minute ride to the Centrum depending on where you want to go. The hotel itself is very nice. By Amsterdam standards, it was reasonably priced and the rooms and bathrooms were immaculate. The bed was comfortable and the furniture was in great condition. The only knock I really had against the place was that the window in my room closed completely, but did not latch, and so on one very windy evening the wind was quite loud. The breakfast buffet is good but very expensive. Breakfast in Amsterdam isn't cheap no matter where you go, so I couldn't hold that against the hotel. I read some other reviews that stated the hotel staff were rude, but they were actually exceptionally nice. I've traveled quite a bit, and I've only been to one hotel in my life where the staff was more pleasant and helpful than here.
