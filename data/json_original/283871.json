Furniture was random and the kind of stuff you'd walk past at a car boot fair.

The reception of the Repubblica was a disgrace and very untidy and unclean. The lift which you'd never know takes you to the other floors is like stepping in a swinging double wardrobe.

Upon actually arriving, I couldn't believe how wrong I was! I have stayed in quite a few hotels around Italy and this was one of my favourites - I shared my room with three fellow students and it was very clean and neat, large, and perfectly sufficient for a city stay! It even had a working television - not that anyone had any time to watch it! I went with a group of over twenty students sharing in rooms of four and we were all impressed - it was much, much better than any hostel! I dreaded the thought of having a broken and dirty shower and packed with the expectation of having to 'rough' it, but the bathroom was lovely! The shower worked well, with hot and cold water, and it was all very hygienic. There was a good cleaning service too, which I didn't expect! The view from my window was wonderful (I stayed in the room with the American flag outside the window - I can't remember the room number!) and the beds were clean and comfortable, in fact, I slept better than I do here in England! I have no idea why other reviews complain of a horrible smell, none of us noticed anything unusual. Although the hotel is on a busy street and I could hear the sounds of the city all night, it did not disturb my sleep (and I'm a light sleeper) at all; when you've spent 8 hours a day footing it around Rome, sleep really isn't difficult! For the money, breakfast service is absolutely fine also. I'd also like to say that security is perfectly fine - no students had any incidents of theft, although we didn't take anything of particular value other than cameras. I dread what people had said about the 'dodgy 1950s lift', but actually it looked quite nice in my opinion and worked fine! If you're looking for a luxury, glisteningly modern hotel, intend to spend most of the day within it, and dread ripped wall paper or damaged wall paintings, then this isn't the place for you. However, if you've come to Rome to see the amazing sights of the eternal city and need a hotel to shower and sleep comfortably in, then Repubblica hotel is ideal! As a student, it's fantastic - 24/7 reception, plenty of places to eat and drink around, brilliant location. I think I was lucky enough to get the best room in the hotel when comparing it to other students' rooms who were in my group, but the worst to fear is a bit of shabbiness and that's all!

The receptionist was the rudest, most unfriendly, sour woman I have had the pleasure of meeting. Getting information from her was like getting blood from a stone, she would ignore you if you spoke directly to her and she blatantly lied to my face on the first night, informing me that the hotel was totally booked out so that I couldn't swap from my revolting room. The manager refuted this the next morning. Never were any of my complaints dealt with. She virtually ignored me for 4 days. My room was on the third floor at the end of a corridor. (Meanwhile - the numbers on you hotel key are written in biro and stuck on with sticky tape!!) I was in a single room. It was small, smelly and furnished with numerous items which appeared to have been bought in flea markets. I had a lopsided bed, and a fridge that looked to be atleast 40 years old with no shelves left in it and mould growing inside. There was no chair and the sheets were not changed for the 4 days that we were there. The bathroom was the worst. Mouldy shower with water that alternated between cold and scolding, a tap that wouldn't stop leaking, a toilet paper dispenser that was the same as those used in school bathrooms, and walls that had never been cleaned. There was a drain in the middle of the room full of other people's hair and numerous fittings were falling of the walls. I felt like vomitting any time I had to enter the room... and showering - all I can say is - glad I had thongs. The breakfast was cheap and nasty. The room was filthy - and the asian girls handling our food looked as though they had just jumped out of bed. Tracksuit pants, underwear showing, hair falling in their face. The table cloths were just wiped down with ONE diry rag day after day. I cannot believe health inspectors would pass this!!! On the third day the first floor was in disarray and there was drilling all day. There were three blackouts - no explanation and the TV and airconditioning never worked again for the next 2 days.. our complaints were not answered, explained or dealt with!!! In summation - this hotel was a filthy, rotten, revolting excuse for accommodation... and in no way whatsoever, feigned or official was it three star quality. I was staying essentially in hostel quality accommodation and paying unacceptably high three-star rates. I have researched the rating system in Italy and found that there is very little, if no regulation which does not suprise me.

And our bathroom window didn't stay shut, it opened on its own. - In my room, a friend of mine went to put her things in the fridge, it was wet so she pulled her things out, and she said it smelled weird. Then she realized her jeans had white spots on them from what was in the fridge..figured it must be bleach and after smelling it, it was. So she complained to them and they claimed it must have been the people before! Ya right, the people before us decided to rub bleach in the fridge. Two words - B S - The breakfast was as horrible as the service and hotel rooms which comes as no surprise really. - My advice, don't risk it.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halton", "Title": "\u201cTake one look, then run for the exits!\u201d", "Author": "P_Dawg_8", "ReviewID": "UR14540758", "Content": "I also was part of the group who had possessions stolen from their room during their stay at this hotel.

A few days before we left for Italy in November I started reading horrific reviews for this hotel. I was nervous and expected the worse. Honestly, its really not that bad. Our package was VERY affordable. The hotel is VERY run-down (wallpaper peeling, pictures from the 30's, etc), but our room was clean. I am a neat-freak, I even brought my own sheets because of the reviews, but I did not need them. It's a European Hotel at a budget price, what were you expecting? We were traveling to Europe to see the sites, not to hang out in the hotel all day. The breakfast is not great (rolls, warm yougart, croissant) but in Italy they do not eat like we do here in America (you will not find pancakes, sausage, home fries). Really, if you already booked this hotel... do not worry, I am very picky and had no problems. We went to visit a friend that was studying abroad and she shared thousands of stories about terrible European hotels..but she said they all eventually feel like home. On day 1 I didnt believe her, but by the middle of the week- I had agreed. The only station we got in English was MTV, but the t.v worked fine. The maids came every day and cleaned everything (I saw it). The shower water was either scorching hot or freezing, but I had that problem previously in a variety of hotels (just make it a quick one). If you are looking for luxury, you have to pay a higher price. We wanted affordable, and we got it. Also, its in a good location..steps from 2different metro stops (Repubblica and Termini) and very close to the Trevi Fountain (my favorite site in Rome).

We were supposed to catch a train the following morning for Venice, but our luggage didn't make it. Arriving at 12:30 AM, there was an Asian man behind the desk who did have our reservation for a standard double room. We were given the key and he pointed to the elevator which had me saying prayers for the first time in a long time. It was about as big as an airplane lavatory and looked ancient. We entered our double room to find four cots that had pillows the thickness of a padded envelope, bottom and top sheets with thin bedspreads. The wall paper was torn from the walls. The minibar was appearently being used to grow some sort of fungus. The shower had hot and cold water, you just never knew when or how much you'd get of either. I returned to the desk at 9:30 and explained to the Asian girl now manning the desk that our luggage would be delivered sometime early that afternoon. I told her I understood check out was at 10:30 and asked if we could arrange for a half day rate while we waited for our luggage. \"Sure,\" she said, \"half the rate\". OK, there's another 65 Euro. Went upstairs to give my husband the \"good news\" and then we ventured out around 11 to find something to eat and look around. We returned to the hotel around 2:30 in the afternoon and was told our luggage did not arrive. I got out the lost luggage form and called British Airways who told me they tried to deliver our luggage but were told that we checked out! After pleading with BA to please bring the bags back they said they would see what they could arrange and call me back. Great. So now I ask Asian man #2 if he can put the call thru to our room, \"No problem\", he tells me. Up to the room. Phone doesn't work. No dial tone. Yes it's plugged in. Back down to the office. I'm told there's no technician to fix the phone. Fine. Call BA back, yes, they'll bring the bags back and will be there in about 30 minutes. Back upstairs to relay the plan to husband. I decided to lay down for a little nap and my husband, not too trusting of the front desks' capabilities of receiving two pieces of luggage from a driver, goes down to wait. Sure enough, they've told the driver he can't park in front of the hotel (for 7 minutes to drop off bags) so my husband has to meet the driver about a block and a half to retrieve the bags.

The location is very good as the hotel lies in walking distance to nearly every Rome's key sights. The personnel was polite, but the service was nothing special.
