It was a last-minute trip, as we had just visited Gettysburg and saw that Baltimore was just an hour away, so we decided to go to the Inner Harbor and the Aquarium since we were so close! Hotels very close to the Harbor are VERY expensive. This hotel was .38 miles (or something like that) from the harbor and aquarium at less than half of the price other hotels a little closer go for. Location: 6 blocks down and 2 blocks over and you are at the Harbor. The hotel has no parking but is adjacent to a parking deck. We paid $26 to park over night. The area is not the best, but there were a lot of public safety officers on every block. Still, I don't think I would be too comfortable walking in the dark. Unfortunately, like many urban areas, there are a lot of homeless folks in the area. Our room was VERY tiny. I think the bathroom was, possibly, the smallest bathroom I have ever seen! You had to be in the bathroom. negotiate yourself kind of next to/behind the door to close it! The sink was located outside of the bathroom. The room had 2 full size beds (or double, but not queen). Bedding was okay except they use those tiny pillows that are not comfortable. But, full sized pillows for 2 people would not fit on the bed. The room was very small and I would not have wanted to spend more than one night here with the 3 of us in one room. Breakfast was typical for a \"free\" breakfast...egg and sausage, make your own waffles, bread and muffins, cereal/oatmeal packets, coffee, tea, juice. It was as expected.

The only drawback we had was the actual layout of the room was kind of small and cramped, especially for 4 women traveling for the weekend! What made this Quality Inn stand out from the others we have stayed at was the staff, in particular, Raymond. Raymond greeted us warmly from the moment we arrived and was eager to assist us with places to go. Being that we were celebrating a birthday, we wanted to hit some hot spots and he gave us some great suggestions that were all within walking distance of the hotel. He gave us directions on how to walk to the Inner Harbor and even pointed us in the direction of the hot spots there, too! His recommendation of Mo's Seafood & Pasta in Little Italy for excellent dining was spot-on and the best part..they provided a shuttle to and from the restaurant!

I waited in line for about 15 minutes before he realized that I was getting impatient and wanted to check in. His attitude suggested that I disturbed him. So when he finally started to check me in, I explained to him that this was very last minute stay and I forgot my wallet at my office in DC ( I work at the State Department). I had my government ID and I explained to him that I was going to pay for the room in full with cash. I've stayed at other hotels and I know about credit card holds, so I asked him would he require a hold on my credit card when he asked (this is an old card that I barely use). He said no so I gave it to him and the cash for the room. He checks me in but before giving me my keys, he explains to me that my credit card was declined and that he either needed additional cash or another card. I told him that I asked him before making the authorization did he need a hold and I reminded him of how he said no. We went back in forth for another 15 mins and I asked him how much additional for incidentals ( most limited service hotels only require about $50 so I was prepared to do that) and he said a whopping $100! So you want me to give you $200 for a flea bag hotel and there is no way to incur incidentals anyway??? ---hotel has no minibars, you don't have the option of putting parking on your room, can't order movies, and there is no room service. I ended up walking right out and checking in at the Hampton Inn on Redwood. Not only was the manager on duty empathic to my situation, but he was very accomdating and within minutes I had my key and was ready to go and for that I have officially become a Hampton Inn fan. There were no homeless people walking around outside of the hotel. The staff was very attentive, available, and provided great service. Overall, I'm so mad I wasted my time and energy trying to stay at this FLEA BAG HOTEL. I will make it a point to let everyone that I know about this and hopefully they won't waste their hard earned money on such poor service.

I felt sorry for the foreigners who were using the hotel as their base to explore Baltimore, because I overheard snippets of their unhappiness with the breakfast in general. There is also a club on the first floor, which is something to consider-if you want to go out all night and party, great, but if you want to sleep, stay away from the floors immediately above it!

The hotel has been renovated is very modern inside. Our room was very small, but we only had a king, so for two people, there was plenty of room. The hotel is short on \"fancier\" amenities that you would find at other, more expensive, downtown hotels (ex: no room service, though there is FREE wi-fi), but is clean, comfortable, nicely decorated and in a terrific location. It's about a ten minute walk down St. Paul/Light St to the inner harbor, and maybe 15 minutes to Oriole Park. Since we only stayed one night, we didn't experience any housekeeping, but check in and out was smooth and the front desk was able to give directions and recommendations for restaurants. Another review commented about loiterers asking for money out front--nobody asked me for money, but, um, it's the city and it's downtown, what do you expect? Overall, we would (and probably will) definitely stay here again. It's a great place to crash after an O's game, or as a home base for a weekend at the Inner Harbor. Two major downsides: there is no free parking (the garage a block away was $15 for a 24-hour period); and there is no place to park temporarily in front of the hotel for check in. In front of the hotel, there is a \"no stopping zone\" until after 7pm. We solved this by leaving my husband pulled over on Lexington while I checked in and got directions to the closest garage. Not a big deal, but something to consider. Another tip: our \"view\" was a roof and the three outside walls of the hotel.

However, there is a side road to park for loading and off loading your luggage and a local car park is available for use. The receptionist was helpful in responding to any questions but did not volunteer any information and nobody there to assist with luggage. The first room we were given stank of stale cigarette smoke and as soon as we phoned reception she apologized and put us into another room, 608, which was fine, but with a little bit more thought at the planning stage and the bed moved towards the doorway another foot, the space around it and the desk area would have been easier to use. The room itself had everything in it including free high speed wi-fi, it was just that it was all crammed in. The use of side lights everywhere makes the opposite side of the room quite dark and the bathroom looked something out of Homes and Gardens, very neat, very stylish but we really wouldn\u2019t like to be the housekeeper cleaning the place. One downside though, was the lack of a loo brush. We don\u2019t understand the modern idea of hoteliers not putting one in the bathroom. Do they really think it's unhygenic or that people will steal them? The coffee in both our room and the breakfast area was appalling. Even though it was \"freshly percolated\" in our room - it was the cheapest! Talking about the courtesy breakfast, once again sadly it was barely adequate, totally self service with a few rounds of bread for toast, a couple of bagels and muffins and a selection of jams etc. and not eco friendly at all with everything in plastic or polystyrene. On arrival back in our room, we were horrified to discover a man there speaking no English, dressed in jeans, a jacket and woolly hat. We asked him what he was doing there and he just took out of his pocket a pass card and proceeded to pick up towels off the floor and said \u201ccleaning\u201d. This obviously wasn\u2019t adequate explanation for us as somebody had entered our room where all our personal effects were on show waiting to be packed, so we phoned to reception and asked for security immediately. They phoned back some three minutes later to say the General Manager was on his way up. He listened to our grievance and explained that the man was indeed an employee of the hotel, was being trained, and whoever was training him hadn\u2019t given him proper instruction on when to enter a room, dress code and he \u2013 the Duty Manager \u2013 would deal with the situation personally.

We did not want to spend a lot of money so this place was the best place for us. We are very simple people who were looking for a bargain. Take that as the mindset when reading my review: First, location, not in the best part of Baltimore, but certainly not the worst. I actually think I drove through the worst part of Baltimore when trying to find this place. St. Paul St turns into Light Street by Inner Harbor, so it's just a simple 10 minute walk to everything by the Harbor. We walked during the day from the hotel to the harbor with no problems. There are a lot of office building lining this block, so I felt pretty safe. However, we walked back at night and of course all of the building were closed so there wasn't as much pedestrian traffic. I didn't feel totally safe, but safe enough to walk back to the hotel. We saw several homeless people, but that's about it. Check-in: No problem here, but of course this is on a case to case basis. We arrived on a Wednesday but we arrived at noon and they had a room for us (2pm checkin time) Parking: There is none, and you have to pay. Good thing is that the parking garage next door is relatively safe. No problems parking my car here overnight. Also, there is no dedicated drop-off/loading area. You need to double park or park in the garage and then go check in. Room: Like I stated earlier, we were looking to save money. We had the smallest room, but it was enough. Any longer than a couple of nights might have been too much. But, we literally only slept and showered there as we spent all of our time outside of our room. Some minor points, they did have a safe, but it was locked. The sink was outside of the bathroom. And the towel rack was broken off. Oh well, we saved money here to spend it someplace else. This place wasn't bad to save money, but doesn't offer some niceties. If you're looking for a full-service hotel, go someplace else. If you want to save money and stay at a safe decent hotel, then stay here. Oh as for cleanliness, it was okay. My wife and I are very clean people and noted that this place wasn't the cleanest, but it was just ok.

So we checked in and allowed the other couple to hang out with us til their room was ready. About 20 min. later they called up to let us know the other room was ready, at which time I requested to be moved to another room since the security lock on the door had been busted off, and I did not feel safe enough in that area, having been asked on the way in by a homeless person for money. They said they would not to keep us side by side, I explained that was fine with us, safety was more important to us. They moved us from room 204 to room 404 which that room did not have a security lock either. They said they would need some time, so we left our numbers for them to call us at since we had already spent over an hour trying to get rooms straight, and we had other things to do than to wait longer. They called around 4pm and said they had 2 rooms side by side ready and they have upgraded us to King rooms. We were very appeciative, and returned to get the rooms and put our things away before going to the baseball game, to arrive to once again only one room being ready. Son once again we placed everyones stuff into one room, checked the room that was not ready since the cleaner was in there cleaning to make sure locks were on the doors, and they were, so rooms looked great, after another 45 min. wait we left once again with both room keys in hand.

The notice was so they could inform us that they had once again switched our rooms, because someone was already occupying room 412, (keep in mind we had already inspected the room earlier and there were no ones belongings in the room) so once again we had to move all of our belongings at 12:30 in the morning to another room. So in less than 24 hours in their hotel I had 4 different rooms. Not to mention that the staff was extremely rude, after requesting to be moved so I could sleep feeling safe, and I was asked only asked a total of 4 times in less than 24 hours for money by people loitering in front of the hotel. This was the worst experience I have ever had in my many years of traveling. Oh I forgot to mention that there was also no hotel manager available for us to speak to the entire time we were there. I must sum up my rating: the rooms even though extremely small (my sons room over a one car garage is bigger than the king size room bathroom included) were very clean once they were finally ready, the service sucked, the location is bad unless you don't mind people begging for money, value was ok for when we stayed, would not think of paying a penny more for the size of the room and service received, rooms once again extremely small.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cStaff goes the extra mile!\u201d", "Author": "bjkkl", "ReviewID": "UR39281309", "Content": "We just returned from a weekend in Baltimore and stayed at the Quality Inn downtown.
