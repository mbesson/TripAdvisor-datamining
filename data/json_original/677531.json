To my great good fortune, there really wasn't any place else to stay...which is to say that the average nightly rate wasn't cheap. But it was worth it. The Loden is, for me anyway, perfectly located: You can easily walk just about anywhere you want to be in Vancouver. BC Place, Gastown, all the downtown restaurants. And it's quiet. My room was on the 10th floor and was utterly silent. The rooms are elegant and modern, the staff is warm but not cloying.

Rooms are excellent (if not that large even though we took the larger rooms) and the staff knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and an asset to any stay. We stayed for one night and then returned for two more after spending some days in Whistler and received a warm welcome back with some thoughtful touches in the room to acknowledge we had returned. All such things lead toward this being one of the best city hotels anywhere however the overall impression of quality and style is a little let down by the breakfast experience which is inconsistent with the rest of the hotel. Our room booking entitled us to a continental breakfast which was a small bar top buffet in the restaurant annexed which was a little meagre even after making allowance for the fact that this is a smaller hotel so the type of offering seen in large hotels cannot be expected. There is a breakfast menu that can be taken but that was not in fact mentioned to us and upon looking at it it did not really inspire in any event. It rather felt as though the restaurant was not really there to provide breakfast and the whole thing was a bit of an afterthought while the staff got the place ready for the real business of the day to come; small things irritated such as coffee other than the low quality type provided in a plunger flask on the bar top was an extra and one glass of juice only was provided etc which is just that bit too mean to leave the impression the rest of the hotel is clearing seeking to achieve and is inconsistent with that being provided by other hotels so they really should pay attention to this (I see that others have taken a similar impression). Another, albeit smaller, issue is that charging for internet access in the room is just not the market standard anymore (I travel a lot on business) and any hotel, like the Loden, that does charge an hourly or daily rate in the room for such access is out of step especially if it markets itself as a business friendly place. So, yes, we will go back to the Loden because it is very good but wish it would take the time to bring its food offering up to the standard of the rest of the hotel.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHome Away From Home!\u201d", "Author": "Marissa B", "ReviewID": "UR128044669", "Content": "I stayed at the Loden for the first time, booked by my Company, and was extremely impressed!

Yes, it was a bit more pricey than some of the options, but there was value in it. The location was ideal: easy walk to the sea wall, Stanley Park and great restaurants. The service was fantastic, with personalized touches like a welcome note and our names on the TV menu screen that made the difference. It felt safe, secure, clean and welcoming. We were upgraded to a King room with floor to ceiling windows on two sides, and enjoyed looking out the window from bed, and enjoying the sunshine. Great bathrooms with big tubs perfect for soaking your tired legs after a day of walking. The only challenges that you should be aware of is the limited breakfast menu and the price of that breakfast menu. It averaged $20 per person for breakfast, so I do recommend you purchase a package that includes breakfast vouchers (we did). My fiance managed with the continental breakfast, but he definitely would have enjoyed more selection of meat products. I overheard a few other men comment on it being a scant breakfast. Selection was fantastic for a Continental breakfast, but not for it being the only option available. Oh, and if you order toast for room service, know that the staff make it from the Continental buffet and just bring it up to your room with an added charge. Otherwise, over all a great stay with lots of benefits.

Cheers to mgmt and team at The Loden ! The other reason I love this hotel - if you like to walk - this hotel is a great location.

The shampoo/conditioner and lotion goodies are heavenly - Molton Brown. Simply the best.

The room was lovely, with two queen beds. Unfortunately, this didn't leave room for a reading lamp on my side of the bed. The absence of an in-room coffee maker was also an inconvenience, although coffee is served in the hotel lobby. The front desk staff were very friendly and the ambiance is lovely. The restaurant/bar is bright and modern, and the breakfast buffet is good, if somewhat limited in hot food choices. Valet parking was very expensive at $47.00 a day after taxes were added on.

It's very distinctive, and you get more looks than the Aston Martins as they drive you to your destination. Only one downside to this hotel, and that's the bathroom. It looks fantastic with it's brown marble flooring and white fixtures. However, it's almost impossible to run water in the sink without having it splash on you, and the shower leaks like crazy - I notice that they had installed a new piece of trim on the edge of the shower door, but it doesn't seem to work.

We had requested a higher floor, which was granted upon our arrival. The lobby was very stylish and modern. Arriving in our room, it was very clean and bright. The bed was very big and comfortable and there was a big flat screen that was suspended from the ceiling. It was a very nice touch that we turned in on, the home screen had a greeting and displayed our names. There was also a big desk in the room if you had to write or work. The bathroom was very large with a deep soaker tub, standing shower, and a separate little room inside it for the toilet. The tub was big enough for two to sit and relax comfortably with a glass of wine. We brought our own wine (from the BC liquor store up the street) and called about where the ice machine was and they sent someone upstairs with a bag of ice for us and they arrived very quickly. We came and went from the hotel several times and the staff were always pleasant and greeted us. The only thing this hotel was lacking was a view. It is shorter than the other buildings around it so all there was to really see was the street below and into the living rooms of the neighbors. There were little peeks of the harbour between a few buildings though but paying for the higher floor upgrade, I didn't feel was worth it.

For the average traveller, I would say this hotel is excellent! I preface my review this way because I noticed many of the guests at the Loden were dressed to the nines and of better means, clearly here for business and luxury. If one is used to the glitz and pampering of a fancier hotel, I can understand a lower rating given the price of this hotel. However for me, this hotel is a 5 star. ROOMS: I stayed in a signature room (the most basic) and I was extremely happy. Right off the bat, you see a contemporary style room - the way I'd imagine a home to look after a trendy designer has been through with it. (Of note, I am not partial to the ornate guilded styles of more traditional hotels.) The rooms have earthy neutral tones, tall ceilings, sliding walls between the bathroom and bedroom, and all the trendiest fixtures (beautiful sinks, geometric taps and knobs, flat screen TV). There was both a soaking tub and a standup shower with hot water and great pressure. We had no problems jumping into bed and resting comfortably after a full busy day. SERVICE: My husband and I were meeting up at the hotel after travelling separately. I paced anxiously for over an hour by the front door. In that time, I watched the doorman warmly greet guests and help them out of taxi, and helpfully answering questions. Likewise were the reception and restaurant staff. Internet was $10-12/day, so we only paid for a day to get all our travel arrangements in order. I was surprised because rarely do hotels not provide internet! LOCATION: Fabulous location, right near the waterfront and 4 blocks north of Robson street (5 min walk, not even). Finding food, shopping and spa treatments was EASY! Note: We are walkers - but we walked to Granville, out to Yaletown and Stanley park with no problem (okay fine, we were a little tired). The Burrard Skytrain station was closeby (5 minutes east), so that is convenient as well. Getting to the airport was also easy. We could have taken Burrard to Granville and switch trains, but we walked directly to the Vancouver City Centre station to get on the Canada Line with our luggage - it took about 15 minutes.

It's a little further away than some hotels but only a short (5-10min) walk to the main shopping areas and taxis are readily available and inexpensive. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the quality of the breakfast, which we thought was poor for a hotel of this standard. Choice was very limited and quality mediocre at best. It was included in our deal which is just as well, as I would have been very disappointed if I'd had to pay the $18 or so for it. There are other eateries nearby (Urban Fare on Bute St is very good) that offer much more variety and better quality for less. We didn't eat any other meals at the hotel so can't comment on the quality of the restaurant. Finally, the only other disappointment was the lack of availability of the complimentary car service. I tried twice to book it, with a couple of hours notice, but was told that they didn't had a driver available. Seems a shame to be offered such a perk only to be denied it.

While I have no major complaints about the Loden-- front desk staff were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, the rooms are small, but nice, bathrooms are spacious and very clean-- I didn't find that they tried to go above and beyond my expectations the way Fairmont always does. For example, I felt it was tacky to charge $15 per 24 hrs of wireless internet...PER DEVICE. We had 2 laptops and an iphone and had to get multiple user codes. To their credit, the Loden staff comped us our second code, because we didn't realize the policy when we bought our first. The room was very dry and went from being too stuffy with the window closed to too cold with the window open. I also wasn't able to sleep thanks to a strange loud clicking noise coming from the wall the entire time we were there. The breakfast was lack-luster but adequate, our dinner was ok, and the wait staff were friendly but somewhat inexperienced, and I didn't appreciate their policy of sitting guests VERY close together, even when the place was empty. Gym was nice, again nothing wow. Next time I think we'll give the Shangri-La a whirl and if that's not up to snuff I'm going back to Fairmont.

I found the lobby welcoming and opulent with stylish couches; beautifully decorated, and a pleasure to be in. I found the staff professional, inviting and very warm. I received a complimentary upgrade to a corner suite (they have a philosophy that their nicest rooms should be filled by guests if they are available - very smart, as it made us feel both special, and spoiled all at once and gave us a view into what they have to offer for a slight upgrade in price!) Our room keys were magnetic - no mysterious \"did it work\" moment after sliding it into the lock on the door - it simply worked by waving it in front of the elevator and room. Our room was a positive interior decorating DELIGHT. They nailed a feeling of sophistication, hipness, coziness and opulence in one fell swoop. Features like floor to ceiling cabinetry for stowing away luggage, and the in room fridge and safe created a clean sweep of style and what was even better? A little sitting couch nestled inbetween two banks of cabinets for sitting on to put your shoes on/placing your suitcase on to unpack. Because this cabinetry was tucked away in the entranceway, it left more space to play with in the bedroom. Our corner suite was banked by floor to ceiling windows with an incredible view of the city. I was greeted by name by the television, and we put on all four of their cool little 30 minute ambient videos while we settled in with some snacks and scotch that we had brought along. Realizing we had forgotten our ipod, and that we needed ice, we called down to front desk. I swear they had a teleporter; our items arrived so swiftly that it was almost a little eerie, considering they had to go to our car to get our ipod! Our evening unfolded beautifully. To make use of our room package credit for their restaurant (Tableau) we had made reservations for 7pm. Despite the fact that their restaurant was packed, they had taken note of my special request for a \"booth in a quiet corner\" and placed us in the nicest seat in the main dining room! We settled in, and proceeded to have a savoury, delicious and wonderful dining experience. Our waiter was a little scattered, but his obvious ineptitude for serving was balanced out by the simple, beautifully prepared and plated food, nice cocktails and overall ambiance. Nice little touches like gourmet olives were certainly appreciated. Heading back up to our room, we decided to stay in; the bathtub in the bathroom was insane - so deep and beautifully lit. The floor to ceiling translucent glass doors that separated the toilet and shower rooms from the main bathroom created the coolest ambiance, and they thoughtfully had patched in music (with volume control on the wall) from our media server in the livingroom (it runs through the television). Dimmer switches on the (very cool) bathroom light fixtures added to the mood, and we settled in for a long soak. The bed? The bed was fantastic! Comfortable, great curtains, wonderful sleep quality and a pot of coffee arrived in the morning as per our request - hot, delicious and lovely. The only negative of this hotel? Checking out. We were totally impressed by every aspect of their service and styling. I would highly recommend this hotel; not just to visitors, but to residents of Vancouver and the outlying areas as well! Treat yourself to a night in the city, have a mini-holiday and support the BC Economy instead of taking your tourism dollars away!

The room did not have an ironing board, so I struggled to steam my work clothes with the mini steamer that was provided. The breakfast room service menu was disappointing. You cannot order a simple order of eggs, bacon and toast. The only egg option is hard boiled. The only meat option is in a breakfast sandwich. I asked if I could get scrambled eggs and bacon and they said no. I don't understand why they don't offer this as the food comes from the Hotel restaurant downstairs,Tableu. Your choices consist of oatmeal, granola with yogurt and other healthy items. I called ahead and asked for my 'healthy' breakfast to arrive at a certain time. It arrived 30 mins early. The cream had chunks of ice, the butter was so hard I couldn't butter my toast and the salt/pepper holder only contained pepper. I stayed in a room close to the elevator, and I could not sleep the first night. It sounded like a subway rumbling all night. It was extremely frustrating.

The hotel is in a fantastic location - a few blocks from Robson street and walking distance to the harbour, Stanley Park and the central shopping areas. The staff at the hotel was also very friendly and we were made to feel quite welcome during our stay. Although I think we were either mistakenly given someone else's room or else they had mistakenly put the wrong name on our welcome card (and perhaps we weren't the intended recipients of the free jelly beans and water!). Overall the room was nice, although for such a new hotel I didn't expect the fittings and fixtures to be so worn - the handles on the glass doors the bathroom were broken, the toilet roll holder was dislodged etc. These are minor observations though and overall didn't affect the quality of the stay. One final note though - the Loden charges a daily wifi fee of $14.95 per room which we found to be quite expensive.

The hotel also offers a free car service that will drive you anywhere in the downtown area - just book it in advance at the front desk, and give the driver a tip (ok, it's not quite free). The rooms are well designed, with floor to ceiling windows that include a window that opens to let in fresh air. Bathrooms are large, with a separate bathtub and shower, and nice toiletries. Only two complaints. The shower doors often leak, so it's not unusual to step out of the shower into a puddle of water. And the sinks are not well designed - they look great, but the water splashes out when you run water into them, and the spout sticks up too high so you have to be careful not to bump your head if you try to wash your face.

The first time we stayed at the Loden was for only one night. We were greeted warmly and checked in promptly and efficiently into a two queen bed superior room, as booked. The decor is modern and comfortable, and the beds and linens were wonderful. Upon our second stay (which was for 4 nights), we checked in expecting a two queen bed room but were given a two double bed room instead. I assume they had overbooked the two queen rooms, but I don't really know for sure. However, a quick call down to the front desk remedied this situation right away, and we were given a one bedroom suite instead. It was a big room, and it came with a DVD player, and a Wii with Rockband 2, which was awesome for killing time during our breaks from exploring Vancouver. There was even a Nespresso machine inside the suite.. So convenient! During our second stay, we also took advantage of the free drop-off car service, as well as the bike loans which we used to cycle around Stanley Park. (You can borrow bikes for up to 3 hours. More than enough time to ride around Stanley Park!) We really appreciated the attention to detail and friendliness of the front desk staff - Once, when it was raining, the front desk offered to drop us off at the aquarium, and the very next day when we called the front desk to ask about bike loans, they asked us how we liked our trip to the aquarium! The location of the hotel is pretty decent, a good place to start from when walking around Vancouver. Some other perks: Free Nespresso machine in the lobby in the mornings, iced tea in the afternoons. Really nicely appointed bathrooms with more masculine smelling shampoo/conditioner/soap - no floral stuff here! Cool buttons in the room that allow you to tell staff whether not to disturb or to make up the room, without needing to use one of those door signs. Lindt chocolates and water next to your bed at turndown time. Comfortable slippers and robes, and umbrellas in every room! Daily Globe & Mail newspaper hung in a green bag on your door every morning.

This time it was for a last-minute 24 hour getaway with two friends. We got the B&B package, which includes valet (otherwise expensive to park overnight). The decor is modern yet comfortable, the rooms are a decent size, and as a total \"germaphobe\" I appreciate that everything is clean clean clean. The location is centrally located downtown with easy access to shopping and restaurants in Yaletown, Gastown, West End, etc. It's also a couple blocks to the water, Coal Harbor and its paths connecting to spectacular Stanley Park, a walkers/runners/family outing paradise. There is a Starbucks on the corner, and a gourmet grocery store and deli nearby. Many of the rooms do not have a view, which is typical for downtown Vancouver with all its skyscrapers, but ours had a peek-a-boo view of the water and mountains. It also looked right across at a condo building, which might bother some people. I've stayed in a couple different room types -- a standard king, a park vista corner room, and this time a room with two queen beds. We were able to fit a rollaway into the room, but it was cramped so I'm glad it wasn't set up until we were ready for bed. This room was not as beautiful as the others I've stayed in, even though we were on a high floor. There was no gorgeously tiled tub, and no sliding wall between the bath and sleeping area, so the bathroom was dark and a bit uninspired. I assume there are room space issues with having two beds, because there was also no reading chair or chaise, which previous rooms I'd stayed in had. Beds are soooo comfy with nice linens, and rooms are quiet if windows are closed, though I always travel with earplugs. My favorite rooms are the high floor corner or park vista rooms, with their two walls of floor to ceiling windows - makes you feel like you're floating. Service is consistently outstanding throughout the hotel, and is one of the main draws for me. The reservation staff, valets, concierges and housekeepers are courteous and professional and appear to enjoy their jobs. The restaurant has been remodeled into a warmer and more casual bistro style than when the hotel first opened.

A very common reply for just about anything and everything on our visit to your beautiful city. We had a 7 day vacation that had to be used before 9/1. We were looking for an escape from the oppressive FL heat and humidity and decided Vancouver would be the perfect ticket. It had been over 10 years since we last visited and each time in the past had been in the winter months. This would be our first summer jaunt. We exited the airport to find we had arrived on the warmest day of the year, a balmy 79 but guess what? It felt like 79 whereas our weather we just left was 90 but felt like 105 (sorry that I\u2019m stuck on Fahrenheit). After researching TA and scouring hotel reviews, The Loden seemed to offer all of the amenities and location that would fit our needs. Bingo! The Loden not only delivered they exceeded expectations with exemplary service and a few surprises. Our package was the bed and breakfast with the deluxe corner with two window walls offering spectacular views of the city, Coal Harbor and surrounding mountains. Cool features were a doorbell for our room, touch button do-not-disturb and service- notifications. No ice machines. Wait a minute, no ice is a feature? It is when you simply pick up the phone and tell the front desk you need ice. The bellmen are so fast that your doorbell will be ringing within seconds of hanging up- consistently- and we needed ice every day for our in room happy hour! Toss in provided bicycles with helmet, lock and H20 and a fabulous onsite restaurant with tremendous service and our table was set for a great week. Breakfast was a nice buffet of breads, waffles, bagels, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt and hot egg wraps. Servers quickly offered coffee and fresh squeezed juices. Many newspapers are available, all included. It was a great way to jumpstart each day of our metropolitan adventures. The proximity to Coal Harbor and Stanley Park is very, very convenient. We would spend the mornings bike riding the Stanley Park bike trails, which in itself has to rank as one of the world\u2019s most scenic as you always have a water view on one side and either mountainous walls or breathtaking gardens and forest on the other side. We also played the pitch and putt golf course, checked out the ginormous pool, walked the rose and rhododendron gardens, admired huge totems, lunched in the Fish House and.winked face to face with Beluga whales in the Aquarium. Afternoons we would stroll 3 blocks down to the Coal Harbor park area. A massive soft green lawn on the waterfront that served the sun worshipers or just those seeking some laid back book chillaxing like us. Very colorful crowd that included dogs of all shapes and sizes, some even wearing shoes. You will hear the word, \"perfect\" alot while at the Loden. And justifyably so.

The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. They had complimentary bikes that we could borrow for a few hours. We rode around the seawall at Stanley Park. I would recommend reserving the bikes as soon as you get to the hotel since the bikes were already taken by someone else on the day we checked in. The valet was extremely convenient. When I needed to get something from the car, a staff member went to my car for me to get it. Even after we checked out, the staff allowed us to keep our car at the hotel with no additional charge. When the car was brought out to us, the staff member helped store our luggage in the trunk, and closed the door for me as I sat into the driver's seat. They had even left two chilled water bottles in the car for us to drink since it was such a hot day. I cannot stress how great the service was. The room was a great size and was very modern. I loved the set up! There are beautiful floor to ceiling windows. There are even a lot of connections to the television to plug in many different devices. The television is directly across from the bed which is nice. I have been to some hotels where the television is in an awkward position. I would warn you that the bathroom is a somewhat open space to the bedroom. The bathroom door can be closed, however, there is a gab near the sink. The person in the bedroom is able to look into that area. However,the toilet and shower area have some privacy: the toilet has a separate door, and there is another door for the shower. The bathtub is a great size, however we did not get a chance to enjoy it. There is lots of light in the bathroom, tons of light switches. I overcame a switch which even turned on speakers from the television in the bathroom. Overall, the bathroom was beautiful! Be careful about splashes from the modern style sink; a way to avoid that is to not turn the nob too much. That works out perfectly. The continental breakfast was alright, I don't think I would have paid extra just for that breakfast. By the time we got there, most of the food was gone. However, since we had valet included in our package, it all worked out. I really wish the hotel had a swimming pool or hot tub, that would have been perfect! I highly recommend this hotel!

The staff were all so welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. It was the last game of the Stanley Cup playoffs and the staff in the restaurant attached did all they could to get us a place to sit to watch the game. Our room was so comfortable, fabulous bathroom, good lighting, lots of room in the room itself. Comfortable beds, good, quiet air conditioning as well as a window that opened. Anything we needed was brought up right away to the room, no waiting around. The staff tried to do their best to accomodate transportation to and from the theatre for us, we were given good information and acted upon it. Unfortunately the Vancouver riots happened and we had to walk back to the hotel as there were no cabs . Upon arrival back the front desk staff was very concerned and happy that that we had made it back safely. We could not hear any of the riot noise at all once back in the hotel and we felt very safe. It is a very quiet neighborhood.

Case in point: When we first arrived hungry and tired, and asked for child-approperate setting, we got sent to a bar full of cheering raucous patrons watching the Stanley Cup finals. Definitely not an appropriate place for hungry and tired kids. Even though we were the only people in the lobby, the entire checking in experience seemed a bit stand-offish. The wireless Internet would not connect with my AirPort but would with my iPhone and iPad, which was a bit weird. Overall the rooms are nicely appointed, with sort of a chic slightly retro feel (mostly due to the dark wood paneling that reminds me of some basements). Bathrooms are large.

Floor to ceiling windows on two sides made the room bright and airy. The lovely ladies at the front desk were extremely polite, friendly, helpful and very professional. Being our first trip to Vancouver in decades, we were very appreciative of all the information they gave us - suggestions on where to eat and things to see and do during our stay. The treatment we received was very personalized, we were greeted each time we came and went, with the staff remembering our names and the fact that we were in Vancouver to see the Kid Rock concert! It was also convenient to use the complimentary Loden car service to get to the concert, saving us the hassle and expense of a cab ride. We were very pleased with our room, it felt spacious and modern, but very comfortable. The bed and linens were luxurious and the room was so quiet, it felt as if we were the only guests at the hotel! The bathroom was sparkling clean and reminicent of a high end spa, with the marble floor, square vessel sink and contemporary fixtures. We ate lunch one day at Tableau and even though we hadn't made reservation, and they were very busy with the corporate lunch crowd, they found us a table and seated us right away.

From the moment we arrived we knew we had chosen someplace special. Our numerous bags were aboard the luggage trolley and inside the hotel before we had paid for the cab. The bellman provided better service and more information than one gets from some 5 star lodge concierges. Our bags were thoughtfully placed out of the way yet accessible as soon as we entered our requested high floor room. The layout was modern, stylish and chic, yet not over the top. The marble bath was superb with a unique configuration which allowed for either privacy or access giving the space an unusual open air feeling not found in most hotel baths. Once slipped on, you surely will not want to remove one of the luxurious robes provided for your stay.

It took too long for orders to come up and whenever I called (3 times) they would actually put me on hold to \"check and see if we can do it\". What? They made me feel like the weirdo for asking for a service they supposedly offered. And I would always be transferred no matter which button I pressed on the phone (room service, restaurant, front desk). And the pizza, take it off the menu...just horrible. 2. When delivering a wake up call, don't just say \"hello\". Something like \"Good morning, this is your wake up call, have a nice day\" would work a little better. 3. The bed was a little lumpy to me and the curtains didn't block the outside light at the top, which again is a personal peeve of mine. 4. The bartender was just off. Just kind of introverted and strange. I don't need you to talk my ear off, but at least act like you have the slightest interest in making sure I feel welcome. 4. HDTV with no HD channels. 5.

We totally enjoyed the whole experience, and will return again this year. Stanley Park and Coal Harbour are blocks away, and the location is on a quiet street with litte traffic.

The room was one of the nicest I've ever stayed in. I think it's a genius idea to make the rooftop level rooms into special garden rooms. The front desk girl was incredible, she recommended several wonderful places to go and made all of the reservations for us. A few minor downsides: The \"spa\" was just a spare room in the fitness center. It's not particularly relaxing to wait in the hallway to the fitness center before a massage. Additionally, the massage people clearly didn't know the policy/packages of the hotel. We had a sauna session included in our stay, and they told us that to use it was going to cost extra, so we skipped it. Later the front desk called us to apologize and tell us it was free and we could use it any time, but we didn't want to go back to the \"spa\" area after our massages so we skipped it. The taxes for the parking and hotel cost were substantial, and not included in the reservation summary. Together, they added at least an additional 20% onto the total cost of the trip, on top of parking. If the hotel has to have those taxes, fine, but it would be nice to know about them upfront, so they don't come as a surprise at the end of a wonderful trip. Finally, the \"temporary dining\" solution in the suite is terrible. I went up and tried to grab some coffee and OJ to take back to the room, and it caused such a complication amongst the staff I just left and went to the Starbucks on the corner.

My bags were stored. About one hour later I received a phone call on my mobile that my room was ready. A cot was also given to me as I told my cousin and his gf they could stay with me after needing a place to stay when his gf's air mexicana flight was cancelled due to bankruptcy. This was at no extra charge. Hotel staff also delivered a connection cord to allow us to watch a movie from my Macbook to the TV. In no time they brought the cord to my room and helped connect the laptop to the TV. When I stayed at the hotel for the first time in March 2010 a fire alarm went off at 230AM in the morning. The next evening I was delighted to find a small sample plate of great tasting desserts waiting in my room along with a letter of apology for the fire alarm. I enjoyed having breakfast at the Voya restaurant, not many people, very quiet. The service was a little slower for not having many people in the restaurant. I am a little disappointed that in room internet is not free however there is a business room where a computer with internet access can be used. The gym looks well equipped with the latest cardio equipment. The location of the hotel is a close walk to Stanley Park and close to the Burrard Skytrain, convenient if you have no car.

I booked directly with the hotel through their website and received a discounted rate for a Signature King room. The staff was very friendly and professional upon check-in and check-out. I was, however, a bit disappointed when first entering the room to see that I had been put in a \"downsized\" room. By this, I mean it did not appear to be as large as the Signature King rooms in the photos on the website and it lacked the seating area with sofa which I had believed was standard for this room type (once again based on the photos from the website). That being said, it was a very minor issue and did not at all stop me from enjoying the comfort of my room. As many people have commented, the interior design, decor, and furnishings are modern yet retro at the same time. My room, including the bathroom/toilet area, was spotlessly clean. On the other hand, I am aftraid that without regular and frequent upkeep and attention to detail the rooms could start to become rather dated and worn. For a new hotel, I noticed that the fabric on the armchair in my room was already starting to wear. In addition, I noticed that the wood panelling was starting to fade in areas and was slightly damaged with scuff marks, nicks, and scratches. Finally, I also remarked that although the bathroom was very clean, the caulking around the bathtub was starting to peel and some of the granite (marble?) used in the bathroom appeared damaged, similar to how water damage on wooden furniture appears. Once again, given that the hotel is only a couple years old, the condition of the room was for the most part above average, but as I wrote above, perhaps a bit more attention to little details like this would help to keep the rooms from looking rundown in the future. To sum up, the staff and the service are excellent and the rooms are very reasonably priced for a hotel of this quality.

I saw a rave review of the hotel in the New York Times, and decided to splurge on the Loden, I was impressed by the reviews on trip advisor and the pictures and the friendliness of the staff before I even got there. The hotel is kind of hard to find if you get off the plane and decide to walk from the skytrain stop, and I would probably avoid this at night, but everyone is nice enough in Canada that you will find it, and if it is during the day, it saves you a bit of money versus the cab. I tried to walk to it from the train stop and got harassed by a homeless 'guide' and couldn't walk away fast enough with my bags... but that's just my experience. Once I actually found the hotel which is super close to the water and the Vancouver Convention Center and Stanley Park (if you're up for a gorgeous jog!), the staff was great and helped me settle in right away. I was literally in shock when I saw my room. Talk about swanky. I didn't even realize until my second day that i could plug in my Ipad into the audio and have my music play in surround sound even in the bathroom, which was a great way to get up in the morning. The bed, ohhhh, that bed, was so very wonderful, I wish I could have taken it home with me. The hotel did everything right, they somehow got to my room while I was out at dinner, did a quick clean up for the second time during the day and would leave a lindt chocolate and water every night. Vancouver was wonderful, and so accessible from the hotel. I started running every evening and was able to get out to the water in a matter of 1-2 minutes. I can't say enough great things about this hotel. I loved the staff, and the GYM! The gym was actually what it looks like in those pictures on the site, it is that great.

I struggled with my cases and managed to get to the front desk where the bellman was chatting with the front desk agent (yes, that's where he was). I felt like I interrupted their fun, their reception was lukewarm. The room decor was nice but safe for this type of hotel, there was a particular scent in the room which did not agree with me. I always wonder why hotels infuse smells in rooms, there are chances people will not like it and this was the case with me. I arrived late so I was going to take a bath in the nice soaker tub and go to bed immediately. The bathroom was beautiful, the big tub was inviting but the bath salts were in a small square vase with no lid. The germaphobe in me scramed \"uhhygenic!\" and made me think other people's bath splashes may have gone inside. So I took a shower instead. The sink is very small and I splashed water all over the counter. I think it doesn't help that the counter is relatively low too. The bathrobe made me wonder if they wash it every day since it looked a little ratty so I did not use it. Heading to bed I thought maybe I should order something through room service but I could not find the menu anywhere, it ends up you have to switch the TV and go to the directory channel. I thought I was tech savvy but apparently not, this made me feel old. The bed was rock hard and I did not feel like I was wrapped in clouds. I was woken up twice with the loud A/C noise, I thought this was a relatively new hotel but it certainly didn't sound like one. Needless to say, I woke up not very well rested.

The hotel is in a fantastic location, has a very clean and nice rooms, and an attentive staff. There are also nice little touches such as ice delivered to your room, free london cab in downtown area, free bicycles rentals, etc... There were a few things that could be better. There were a few hidden-misrepresented prices of certain things. When I made a reservation on the phone one of the gentelman I spoke with highlighted that $15/night parking in downtown was a big benefit of the hotel. I agreed with that, however when arriving at the hotel, I learned parking was $35/night + parking taxes which made it nearly $50/night. A huge difference from what I was told when making the reservation. The second item was the breakfast package. We called down a few times to find out what the package included and never got a straight answer. We specifically asked if we could get the breakfast in the room and what was covered by the package. The answer was anything from the breakfast menu. Well that wasn't quite accurate, only 1 entree + 1 drink was covered. So if you got a side of fruit, or a coffee, those were extra charges. This is very easy to explain, just tell is 1 entree + 1 drink - but somehow the front desk staff wasn't clear on it. It did seem like they were training new front desk staff, so that might be the issue on both these items. The last complaint I have is although the bed is wonderful, and we slept very well, my wife got itchy due to the sheet configuration. There is a fitted sheet with a down comforter directly on it. There is no top sheet between the comforter and the fitted sheet. As a result if you are sensitive to down feathers, it can get itchy. We were there with friends and they said they had the same problem around feeling a bit itchy in bed.

The views of Vancouver and its harbor were spectacular. The bathroom was gorgeous, with a huge soaking tub....actually too deep for me, I felt like I'd really have trouble getting out, so I stuck to the rainforest shower. The concierge recommended an informal seafood place on the nearby inlet where all kinds of yachts were docked.

They did offer coffee pods downstairs in the morning until 10am (although one morning, I overheard someone complaining that they had removed the coffee at 9:30). My issue with the pods is that while they're good, they're slow and I also walked by a line of people waiting for coffee since there's only one machine. And, no free internet. I realize you're less likely to get this amenity at nicer hotels, but seriously, in this day and age, internet should be free. Final complaint, parking with taxes was over $40/night.

The rooms are very comfortable and cozy without succumbing to the starkness of many a modern design these days.

There is a large wood sliding wall that gives you the ability to open up the bathroom to the rest of the hotel room. The sink faces out and there is a floating mirror, which allows you to watch TV while shaving and primping. There is even a speaker in the ceiling of the bathroom that's connected to the TV's audio--a nice touch. Now for a few gripes. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of offering up Ethernet ports, power outlets, and video connectors for the TV right on the back of the desk, but internet access and WiFi should be free in a hotel of this caliber. It's so annoying to have to pay for WiFi every single day when all I might need to do on a particular day is check my email or look up a restaurant. WiFi is more important than an in-room telephone or a TV, yet I have to pay for it? And speaking of TV, why bother to install gorgeous flat screens in every room and then hook up low-def analog cable to them? This is not the first luxury hotel I've seen with this problem, but I expected more from a hotel that had it's building recently completed from the ground up. Any hotel over 3 stars should have digital high definition cable and an onscreen program guide.

Got a great online deal directly thru the hotel for $189/night CAD, which is fantastic given how busy Vancouver is during the Summer. After reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor, I must say my expectations for The Loden were sky high. Having said that, most, but not all, of my expectations were met. I requested an early check-in and while they couldn't accommodate me at the time of my arrival, the room was ready within an hour and our luggage was waiting for us in our room by the time we returned. The Loden King room is beautiful, complete with floor-to-ceiling windows, spacious closets, very functional desk/workspace, and a L-shaped sectional that fit beautifully into the corner of the room. The king bed was super comfortable, complete with 4 king-size pillows that lended itself to 5 nights' great sleep. It really felt like a home away from home, minus a kitchen. The bathroom is gorgeous - sliding door between the bathroom and hallway, and another sliding door that shows or conceals the bathroom from the rest of the room. There is a two-sided mirror that makes it great for 2 people to get ready at the same time w/o getting in each other's way. The bathroom had great counter and storage space, featured a deep, large soaking tub, with frosted glass door leading to the toilet, and another frosted glass door leading to the shower. The service from the staff was great throughout our stay - very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful all the way. We took advantage of the hotel's car service multiple times to get to Yaletown and also had drinks @ Voya, the hotel's restaurant/bar (which is very beautiful). Despite all of the great attributes of the room, there were some flaws that slightly impacted our stay. First, there was a leak in the rain shower head that sprayed water out over the shower door. The shower head didn't seem fully secured and had low water pressure, which I think went hand-in-hand. Second, the battery for the safe in our room malfunctioned twice, so I had to call the front desk for help so our valuables could be secured. Third, as others have mentioned, you must request an iron and ironing board -- kinda unusual for a luxury hotel of its stature. Fourth, any changes we made to the room temperature trigged a small leak in the AC unit in the ceiling right above the room entrance/closets, but we worked around it by keeping the room at the same temperature after day 1.

You have to put on your gown and go downstairs to get a cup of coffee in the morning. No slippers are provided so you might want to take your own. -the business centre is a tiny box, taking one person at a time.

Our budget for lodging was at the \"clean and comfortable but modest\" level, but we decided to splurge a little bit for our last two nights in Vancouver. This is not to say that the Loden was expensive; in fact it is probably cheaper than its peers. From the first moment we walked into the lobby, the Loden is true to the images and styling on its website. It is unique and trendy, with a distinct effort by its designers to make you feel like immersing yourself during your stay there. This styling only increased in our room. The small couch, comfortable bed, and elegant entertainment system invites you to stay. The bathroom is equally elegant, with a sliding wall which provides the opportunity to control the amount of privacy. The large glass-enclosed shower was very nice as well. Our only complaints were the sink's tendency to spray water everywhere when used, and the presence of only a single computer in the business center. On the note of hotel services, it must be mentioned that the fitness center at the Loden was also topknotch. The equipment is all high quality, and the Loden-styling is still very much present. If we weren't already pleased with our stay, the valet that returned our car to us made the feeling stick permanently. He knew that we would be driving down to Seattle that day, and so he took the initiative to place two complimentary bottles of water in our car.

Overall a positive experience but several issues detracted from an otherwise fair value package. An imaginative restaurant affordable menu with top notch friendly service which applied to valet staff, hosekeeping and concierge services, even the front desk. Response time for fixing an annoying TV problem was very fast as well. A few things need sorting however. Here's my gripe list: Leaky shower door allowed water to spread far and wide - dangerous on marble floor. Shower head collides with inward opening door and ends up pointing at the wall instead of you & is unreachable to all except the tallest guest. There are no coffee/tea making facilities in-room but the lobby offers the very highest quality European coffee if you can be bothered to head down there as soon as you're out of bed. The bed frame projected far enough to cause stubbed toes on the metal leg. Ouch! So lot's of poorly thought out teething design issues that didn't spoil our stay. The check-out procedure revealed valet parking charges that topped a whopping $47 a night if you include HST and specific parking related taxes. Guests better check the valet charge before booking. After searching for a fair deal, much of the value offered is lost on valet charges. The hotel should be more up front in revealing this at time of booking. I was partly at fault for not checking. Rooms don't have much of a view unless on the higher floors. On the plus side, it was nice to have only 7 rooms per floor. The hotel is spotlessly clean & sharp and well located. There were several excellent value all day breakfast joints within 100 metres of the lobby, so no need to pay hotel restaurant rates to start your day. Will we return?

I can't say enough about the Loden's professional, friendly, responsive staff - which is why I scored it with 4 stars rather than 3. Their excellence mostly made up for a couple of things we thought were not so excellent about the hotel itself. First, our biggest annoyance was a persistent vibratory noise in our room which seemed to be coming from the elevator bank. We spent our first night in a room on the 8th floor almost directly across from the elevators, and the thrumming/vibration each time an elevator moved was very obvious and quite irritating (even wearing earplugs you could hear/feel it). The next morning I informed the front desk of this, and they very willingly moved us to a room on the 11th floor further down the hall from the elevators. Although being further down the hall seemed to lessen the vibratory noise, we could still hear it. Given that there are only about 10 rooms on each floor of the hotel, and since our room the 2nd night was near the end of the hallway (with the elevators in the middle of the hallway), I would guess that the vibratory noise is present in most if not all rooms of the hotel. I would be curious to know if any other guests have noticed this. The other thing that bothered us (and which can easily be corrected by hotel management) is a wide gap between the glass shower door and the wall which allows water from the shower to easily spray/leak out onto the bathroom floor. So much for a nice, dry shower mat to step out on. Have other guests noticed this? My own glass shower door at home has a clear silicone gasket along the edge of the door to prevent this from happening - why the shower doors in the Loden don't have this same gasket is puzzling. Apart from these two issues, the Loden is a nice hotel with a laid-back vibe that is not trying to be as splashy as a lot of the newer trendy hotels are trying to be. We liked that. With regard to recommending the Loden to a friend, I would make sure they know about the vibration noise in the rooms before they book to make sure this is not going to bother them as it did us.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leamington Spa, UK", "Title": "\u201cIdeal location, helpful staff, lovely room, good value.\u201d", "Author": "DonStanley", "ReviewID": "UR67927532", "Content": "We were very pleased with all aspects of the hotel and thorougly enjoyed our stay.

The front desk associate walked us to the elevator to show us how to wave our card in front of a panel (they don't swipe them in this system). We walked into our corner room (not a suite) which had floor-to-ceiling (extra high ceilings) windows across two walls (including a portion of the window that actually OPENS), and were greeted by soft music already playing on the very nice clock radio. The room is modern, and tastefully decorated in subdued hues with a splash of color here and there. An extra-large flat screen TV hangs from the ceiling, and greets us with our name on it. This leaves extra room on the dresser and desk (good idea, not seen in older hotels). The desk has a dozen different electronic connections right on top of it, so you don't have to hunt for outlets. You can connect anything to this desk. Bed = ultra comfortable. Love seat in room with comfy pillows. Filled water container on night stand accompanied by card with clever quote from Bob Dylan. Umbrella hanging in closet, along with steamer to take the wrinkles out of your clothes. Water and wine glasses on etegere await whatever libations you want from the mini-bar. Bathroom is amazing. Solid marble everywhere. Etched glass door to stand-alone shower with adjustable rainfall showerhead and separate glass door to toilet. Large soaking tub with waterfall fill, along with glass jar filled with bath salts on the marble surround. European-style sink and fixtures. Plenty of room. Dimmers on the halogen light fixtures...separate over tub and sink. TV sound piped-in to ceiling speaker with volume control. Terrycloth robes, of course, and two pairs of terry slippers engraved \"Relax\" and \"Revive\" are a nice personal touch. The restaurant off the lobby matches the hotel's contemporary design and is soothing to look at but pretty loud when full of diners.

Thankfully our room was immediately available as our family was exhausted as we had disembarked from an Alaskan cruise earlier that morning. Our family of four (children ages 15 and 6) stayed in a spacious room (#1205)with two queen beds. The room's design had very clean lines and arguably the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in! Although the bathroom did not have a bath tub, the shower stall was spacious, and my wife enjoyed the heated floor and always appreciates the quality toiletries (Molton Brown). I also appreciated that we had a window that could be opened and the peek-a-book view of Coal Harbor was nice. Can't say enough about the wonderful front desk staff....just warm, friendly and knowledgable. Took care of our special needs (when we informed the front desk that there wasn't a DVD player in our room for our 6-year old son to watch movies, one was installed with an hour) and we were always greeted with a smile as we passed by. The restaurant, Voya is not to be missed.. Restaurants that look cool and hip and catering to a young clientele, usually offer food and service that falls short and in many cases fail miserably. That is not the case with Voya. The cooking is well prepared....not too fussy but creative without being over the top. The kitchen is clearly working with quality ingredients (excellent ceviche, bison, veal cheeks) and the kitchen crew is top notch as the taste is excellent and the presentation definitely adds to the dining experience. The service was not always perfect (e.g. water glasses went unfilled, finished plates lingered a bit too long on the tables) but that said the friendly and GENUINE nature of the wait staff more than made up for any service glitches. We were debating between staying at the Loden and the Shangri-La but decided on the Loden because of our preference to stay at smaller boutique-style properties. I've stayed at many deluxe hotels (e.g. Shangri-La, Four Seasons, SLR) but when you stay at a smaller property that \"gets it\", it's hard to beat.

The rooms are exquisitely appointed and very comfortable. The bathroom was fabulous, especially the large shower. Everything is very modern and high-tech but in a soothing way. Each day we'd return to a spotless room with a special amenity awaiting us like a calming lotion or slippers.

Charlie and Venzenia were helpful getting us dinner reservations, bus tour info and taxi back to the airport. The use of a fully equipped health club right on premises was a real plus! Upon hearing that we had raved about his candies, Mauricio sent more to our room! My favorite was caramel w/ a touch of sea salt encased in a dark chocolate truffle.

As a regular traveller I have stayed in virtually every type of resort around the world. In addition, having worked in the service industry at one time I have an appreciation for the effort behind quality service. I am more grizzly bear than kitten as a client. Finally, I have stayed at every top rated hotel in Vancouver but one. This is the best overall experience and stay - period. My experience at the Loden was truly excellent, and for several reasons. First, I have been in Vancouver three times this year, each time at the Loden, and each time was met with truly outstanding service. This is the most important point in my opinion; professional service with a friendly tone is a difficult balance. The staff was very professional without exception, and I can\u2019t remember the last time I could say that about a hotel or restaurant. To be friendly, in an appropriate manner means reading your client and their current mood. The front desk get special mention, but everyone was very good. Second, the standard rooms are better than most \u2018superior\u2019 or \u2018deluxe\u2019 rooms elsewhere. While not huge in size (it urban Vancouver people), the rooms are spacious, very modern, stylish and very well appointed. Most hotels I have to look at the room key to remember which hotel I\u2019m in they are so monotonous. Not true here. I would be surprised if you did not remember your stay, just based on the room alone. The bed and linen were truly \u2018dreamy\u2019. The soaking tub, large walk-in shower, WC, and bath products are all outstanding. The location is subtle, while not on one of the main drags it is very well positioned between the core business district, Robson Street for shopping and dining, and the waterfront leading to Stanley Park. Finally, on our last visit we decided to risk not to go to CinCin (still a personal favourite) and went to the Voya Restaurant located in the hotel. Well it was amazing. I could easily write another article just on the meal we had, but suffice it to say if you haven\u2019t been, go! The balance of flavours and quality of ingredients for all of the dishes was superb.

The vibe here is luxury and hipness. They get a lot of things right and some things more than right, but their uber-hipness may prove a Pyrrhic victory for them if they don't make some simple changes. First, the good. The staff were without exception friendly and informative--and more importantly, sincere. There was no practiced obsequiousness--simply a muted yet earnest wish to be of help and a local's knowledge of the city. We enjoyed chatting with them. One great service the hotel offers is complimentary use of its London taxi within a few blocks or so of the hotel. (We went as far as Yaletown.) It's customary to tip the driver a few loonies, of course. It was lots of fun and a very charming feature. Be advised that the return trip is not part of the service. (I never asked outright, but they never mentioned it when I asked about regular city taxis' availability for the return trip.) You're expected to give them a little notice, naturally. The modern-yet-subtle rooms were reasonably spacious and quite luxurious, featuring: a marble foyer with a little loveseat nook; a marble bath with separate, glass-enclosed toilet; a desk with all manner of a/v linkages conveniently arrayed in a mini-dashboard on the desk; a large HDTV; two very soft robes; etc. The bed was great. I could not figure out the alarm clock, but it sure looked fancy. There is free wired Internet in the rooms, with the option to purchase high-speed access for $10/day. The free version was actually not that slow. I didn't stream a movie or anything, but it was only marginally slower than our home cable Internet. All in all, sleek, gorgeous, tasteful and luxurious. However... Now for the criticisms: One problem was the a/c. The thermostat was very responsive, yet when the a/c came on or went off, we heard a loud noise in the vent. In addition, the air from this vent was either very warm or very cold, and even the softest fan setting was very powerful. We never could find a setting where it would come on automatically and softly. Since we were there in May, we just turned the thing off and were fine. So that wasn't much of a problem. There was, alas, no coffee maker in the room. I've seen this trend in other boutique hotels, and I must say I don't care for it. There is no luxury in having to get dressed and go downstairs for coffee, nor in having to order room service and spend maybe $10 (?) for something that should be free in a hotel. That said, the free coffee in the lobby was from an espresso machine and quite tasty. I would've liked to have slurped joe while watching the news or checking e-mail, though. There was nothing to do in the lobby but listen to Deep Forest or whatever it was they were piping in. Housekeeping did a great job getting the room spotless, but they didn't leave any extra toilet paper in the bathroom. Probably not their fault; I think this must be in keeping with the hip luxury motif. But I just feel better knowing there's no way I'm going to run out before the next time the maid comes. Management, if you think spare rolls look gauche, then why not put them in a bathroom drawer? But those are quibbles. The only real problem came on our last night there. The restaurant/bar adjoining the lobby, two floors down, was playing loud, Enigma-esque club music very late (the same Eurobeat stuff playing in the lobby at all times). We decided we'd just ignore it and go to sleep. But it was annoying. Even worse, however, was that late that night, guests of said bar were hollering in the street outside the hotel. Of course, the hotel can't control guests' behavior per se--but a sign reminding bar patrons to be considerate of the sleeping hotel guests would be in order. Or perhaps the hotel should consider shutting the bar down at 11 pm--less bar profit, but if this keeps up, the hotel's lodging profit will surely decline. Maybe if the bar played some less-hip music at half the volume, they wouldn't attract 20-somethings looking to get rowdy. It is for this reason alone that I almost gave Loden three stars. Most things about Loden rate five stars--but the ability to sleep through the night uninterrupted has to be there. That night, I felt like Loden cared more about its bargoers than us. Still, Loden is not really average in any way. So I rounded up. A word on parking: Parking in the hotel (valet only) is $32 Canadian and is on a 24-hour basis from the time you dropped it off and includes in/out access. A bit steep. And very few garages in Vancouver do overnight parking; the only one I found charged $25. However, parking meters on Vancouver's streets are free 8:00 p.m-8:00 a.m.., as long as there is no restriction on any of the street signs. (Look carefully!) Our second night there, we parked on nearby Alberini street overnight and were fine there. So if you drive into the city, try to arrive just before 8 p.m. Overall, Loden Vancouver has the potential to be an exceptional hotel. It's more than halfway there. We got a decent deal because it had just opened. I'm sure the rate will rise, but hopefully the problems I mentioned will also be remedied. TIP: It's best to avoid driving into Vancouver if you can--public transit there is ubiquitous and safe--but we found renting a car was the only viable option for us to get there from Seattle. There's a ferry, but the schedule is limited until late in May.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cVancouver's hidden gem\u201d", "Author": "Bazza13", "ReviewID": "UR30262630", "Content": "My wife and I chose the Loden after a bit of trip advisor research for our 25th anniversary get away.

The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, and went out of their way to acknowledge our 25th anniversary. Our room (1105) was spotless and appointed very well in a modern boutique theme. We both loved the d\u00e9cor and the quiet of this hotel. We did not get a chance to take in the restaurant but were able to visit the hotel lounge, and the service was fabulous. The hotel is located in the most beautiful area of one of the worlds most beautiful & clean cities. It is located on a somewhat quiet street within a 2 block walk to Robson Street and the waterfront, where your selection of restaurants and entertainment is almost endless. Vancouver is a very safe & pedestrian friendly city, so this location is ideal for those who like to explore things on foot. You will not require a vehicle to explore Vancouver\u2019s nightlife from the Loden. The only complaint I had with this hotel was the $31.00/night Valet service. There is a parking garage right next door, so I have no one to blame but myself for this rather pricey service. (I was warned).

Check-in is brisk and pleasant and you are asked about your journey in a sincere manner. You are then walked to the elevator and shown how to work the key card security. My room was more than I expected, very stylish, comfortable and luxurious. A open concept room that is really spacious. The bathroom is very spa like with a soaker bath tub taking center, flanked to the left by individually frosted glass enclosed toilet and a large stone shower. To the right is a long granite vanity bar fully stocked with Molton Brown products. I fell in love with Molton Brown during by BA Travels as it was standard issue in the First and Business Class Amenity Kits. All the lights in the bathroom are dimming and the bathtub comes with a large serving of bath salts for those that want to melt away while listening to the in Bathroom Sound System fed by the entertainment center. There is a large HD LCD with tons on easy input hook-up if you wanted to watch your own material from your laptop; otherwise the On Demand Programming offer still in Theater Movies, HD Movies and a ton of free cable channels. The LCD TV is big and you will not be left wanting. The rivals my Duxiana and the linens crisp and ultra comfortable. Any requests from Guest Services are promptly attended to. I asked for a Tooth Brush and Tooth Paste and was surprised when it arrived nicely packaged in a Molton Brown Box. The lobby / lounge is very comfortable, a great place to gather and reminiscent of a W or the Opus Yaletown. The restaurant has great food and really friendly staff who make an effort to engage you; this is especially welcomed when traveling alone on business, as dining alone can get tiring.

It looked great and very modern which is always a plus when your travelling for work. It was odd as two days after I booked the hotel there was a story in the travel section in the ottawa citizen about the hotel. Now on to the actual experience. When I got to the hotel they were very quick with checking me in and took me up to the room to show me all the features. It was great to have someone show you rather then figuring out some of the nice touches of the room on my own. Now onto the room itself The room is very modern looking with a nice big LCD tv and a nice view. The bed was comfy and made me never want to actually get out of it. I liked the slippers they included to walk around in but they kept leaving them on the opposite side from where I slept. By far the nicest part of this room though is the fact that the wall between the washroom and the main room can be moved. You can move it so you get a much more open feel which is something I have never had before in a hotel. They also had a speaker for the tv in the washroom which I have had before but is a nice touch. The shower and the tub were amazing as I have come to expect at these modern hotels. Another nice feature was being able to put the do not disturb notice on with a button rather then a really ugly sign. I always think it looks terrible when you are paying 400 a night for a hotel room and you have to stick a sign on your door know. Well at this hotel they have an electronic version and a door bell on the outside rather then just having to knock. Now about the area this hotel is in. This hotel is about 4 blocks from cole harbour which is beautiful and I spent a lot of free time sitting down there working on my laptop. Also your close enough to be able to walk to robson street and shop but far enough away that it is quiet at night. The only two problems I had were the super long time it took to get my car from the valet parking. I came down and there were no one else in the lobby waiting for their car and even though I had called down to get my car I ended up waiting almost 20 mins for my car which is crazy for a high end hotel but still a minor problem. The only other problem was not being upgraded to a better room even though their policy is if you find a better price then on their website you get that.

It wasn't large, but the finish-out was fantastic --- particularly the bathroom. A sliding wood door opens the bathroom into the bedroom area, but is easily closed off for complete privacy. The shower and water closet are hidden behind frosted, frameless glass doors. A separate deep soaking tub is surrounded by tumbled marble mosaic tile.
