{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice new rooms Having previously been to Florence further off season (Nov or Feb), our usual hotels were way pricier. We hence decided to stay a little further out. When we got there we were taken to the new rooms across the road from the main block. We were really surprised, there were large and modern, with a sofa, contemporary furniture and a large flat screen TV.Staff were friendly (apart from one, who after us making a little effort became extremely friendly as well).It's a little out of town but there were some amazing local restaurants around. To be honest though, we still walked in to town (and back in the end). We're in our early 30's... For the price, I'd really recommend the place.", "Date": "Apr 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR297697144", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "paulwoodh"}, {"Content": "nice but far away from everything We stayed at the Best Western Select in Florence from Sept. 28 thru Oct. 2nd. It was a nice hotel, but you had to take a bus to see any attractions in Florence. The back of the hotel was next to a school so it was very loud in the day, but very quiet at night. The room was clean and the bathroom had lots of room. The lady who ran the breakfast room was a little rude. The front desk all spoke english and was helpful with the bus system. Great hotel if your alright with catching very crowded buses everyday.", "Date": "Oct 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR451212695", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "tahoesun1"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel about 10 minutes from the Airport My family of 4 needed a hotel near the airport but still in Florence, as our flight left 7:15 a.m, but we still wanted to have a great last meal in Italy. The day before, the hotel let us drop off our main luggage and we went to Venice for 24 hours. Upon arriving back in Florence, we walked about 20 minutes from the train station, getting to the Hotel at about 10 p.m. The concierge kindly called and got us a late night reservation at a local and fantastic restaurant a few blocks away. He also arranged for an early (5:45 a.m.) taxi to the airport. The quad room was sort of small, but it was perfect for us our last night. We'd recommend the place for sure. We can't tell you about breakfast because we left too early!

Although the hotel was a little further than we would have liked it to be from the town centre, it turned out not to be as big a deal as we originally thought it would be. A number 22 bus has a stop not far from the hotel and the service is frequent and cost \u9227?1 and tickets are available form the hotel reception. Although the staff didn\u9225\u6a9b go out of their way to make conversation, they were polite and helpful when asked for assistance. As usual you are a little apprehensive when you are about to open the door of the room you will call home for the next number of days and wonder if its up to your expectations, having been caught out before, the concern is always there.The room we stayed in was reasonably decorated and although we couldn\u9225\u6a9b initially put our finger on what we didn\u9225\u6a9b like about the bedroom, I think it was the darker base colour on the walls, dark carpet and the dark furniture to match an old window frame. There is a children\u9225\u6a9a playschool at the rear of the room we were in (118) and although as you would expect they were noisy, it didn\u9225\u6a9b bother us, as we weren\u9225\u6a9b there during the day. The bathroom was well appointed, as was the decor in the parts of the hotel we saw. However, breakfast was poor and basically bread and cheese and ham. My biggest disappointment was the fact that there was no bar that you could sit and unwind in after you had tramped the streets all day long, which was doubly disappointing as I had read a list of facilities prior to booking that said there was a bar. Rooms were cleaned every day and towels changed. The fridge in our room was never working during our stay although reported as such and the extra pillows we asked for never appeared. We would have preferred a hotel closer to the centre and also better appointed and certainly one with a bar where you could sit and relax with that last drink before retiring for the evening. For these reasons, we would not re-book in future.

The rooms were fine but after a heavy rain there was an unbearable musty smell in all the main level rooms. The entire staff, except for Simone were very kind and helpful. Simone seriously needs an attitude adjustment if he is to continue working at the front desk. Florence is a magical city with great sites...stay away from Trattoria del Ponte Vecchio.

My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Select for two nights in July 2005. The hotel was a 20 minute walk from the train station and about 30 minutes walk to the city center. The staff was helpful and professional. Our room (#215) was large and clean and one of the few rooms with a balcony. Because the hotel is further out from the city center, the room and balcony were quiet and it was relaxing. The breakfast is served in a nice room in the basement and includes rolls, cheese, ham, cappuccino and yogurt. There is internet access on one computer in the lobby area for 4 Euro for 30 minutes. The negative to the hotel would be that it is a longer walk to get to the main sights. There are busses running near the hotel, however, we chose to walk while we were in Florence.

To get into the city takes about 15-20 minutes walking, but the train station is only about a 10-15 minute walk (with my large pack on my back). They also have a space for cars, however trying to actually arrive there by car was a bit difficult because of all the one way roads. The rooms were clean and the staff extremely helpful and kind. They have a good map to get you into the city and around, but I would suggest stopping at one of the tourist info desk and picking up the map that includes all the public restrooms (WC). They have a breakfast which was decent but could have included fresh fruit. In addition when they ran out of something for the breakfast (even if there was still an hour to go) they did not replenish it. I thought this was a bit odd given that the same thing was served every morning.

But no restaurants. So dinner is a bus ride to the train station and into town. The shower in my bathroom was huge and I loved the big fluffy towels. The room comfortable and clean.
