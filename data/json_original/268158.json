But, knowing the Marriott name, and SpringHill Suites being one of their brands, I did have some expectations. Marriott did not disappoint. This SpringHill suite is located in the Rancho Bernardo/Poway, a section of San Diego immediately to the north of San Diego's city limits. We arrived at Carlsbad Airport (a less crowded/busy airport just north of the San Diego area...about a 30 minute drive) via LAX. This location is right next to the freeway, the \"I-15\". But, don't let that scare you. Not only was it very convenient to all area points and \"highways\" (as they are known on the east coast, \"freeways\" as they are known on the west coast, and \"motorways\" as they are known in the UK) north, south, east and west in the area, but it was quiet and very well maintained. In fact, the uppermost floor was being renovated at the time of our stay and we hardly ever heard any noise except for one day, but not until it was mid-day. This location has a very friendly staff at the front desk, and a spectacular breakfast room right off the lobby. Complimentary coffee, tea and hot chocolate is available in the lobby 24 hours a day, along with a variety of fresh local fruits like oranges. Anyone who knows me when I travel knows that I prefer to stay at a place with complimentary breakfast. This place had some of the best variety of breakfast buffets to choose from and it rotated daily so you'd never have a repeat of the prior day's breakfast. They had cereals, buns, pastries, bagels, sausages/bangers, make-your-own waffles, milk, juices, eggs, yogurt...and the list goes on. You'd be hard-pressed not to find something you'd eat for breakfast to start your day right. The location had a small, very modest fitness room, and likewise a very small outdoor pool area. Maid service is daily, but one day someone did \"screw-up\" and failed to clean our room. A call to the front desk resulted in a very humble apology and a query of there was anything that may be needed as a result, like clean linens and the like. Linens were quickly and cheerfully delivered to the room by a maintenance/night housekeeping person who likewise apologized for the inconvenience. The room itself was similar to a large hotel room, but had a king bed, sleeper sofa, desk, refrigerator, microwave oven, sink and bath. One thing I did not like was that the king bed was very close proximity to the exterior window and its air conditioning/heating system. When the AC blew, you could really feel it if you were on the bed. A plexiglass deflector shield to blow the airflow upwards would have been good. Restaurants like Chili's, another Marriott branded hotel, a restaurant and a gas station are all interconnected with the property's parking lot. However, other restaurants, churches (St. Gregory the Great Catholic Church is just a few minutes drive east of the hotel and is a beautiful, modern and unique church building to visit!), grocery stores, malls and the like are all within a very short drive...usually less than 5 minutes. All major attractions, like the San Diego Zoo's Safari Park (Escondido just a short drive to the north), Old Town (a State Historic Park a short drive south), beaches (like Torrey Pines State Park/Beach in the LaJolla section of San Diego...a short drive west) are all within a 20 to 30 minute drive. I would highly recommend this location to anyone visiting the San Diego area due to its high quality, value, convenient location and amenities.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGood breakfast, nice service\u201d", "Author": "florenciamartinezs", "ReviewID": "UR120306212", "Content": "Nice hotel, small rooms although they are suites.

I picked this location sight unseen because it was in-between my two destinations and I trust the Marriott/Springhill brand. I was not disappointed. I understand that they're doing some upgrades, and one of the two main elevators was decked out in big cloth drapery to protect the walls. Our second floor room was not yet upgraded, but no big deal. The King-sized bed was comfortable and the furnishings perfectly adequate. Shower pressure was fine, although there's only a single curtain (not double-curtain, no biggie but a style choice). At least the shower rod is curved to provide more room. Toilet and shower are in their own little room apart from the sink, which is good. Didn't use the internet, even though it was free. The mini-fridge kept our drinks cold. And conveniently there's a second little sink in the \"kitchenette\" area. The LG LCD TV worked fine, although I noticed that there's no menu for on-demand programming. No big deal since I was watching the US Open on CBS anyway. The location is what it is. It was convenient for us, but downtown SD is realistically 20-30 minutes away if that's where you're going. There's not much immediately around the hotel except for a Chili's and a Wendy's. Mira Mesa with a big theater, two different supermarkets, and lots of restaurants is exactly one exit south, so that was convenient. Breakfast was typical, although I miss the Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches. I still made my own breakfast sandwich out of a bagel, the provided scrambled eggs, sausage, and hash browns. Yummy. Plenty of cereal, juice, and yogurt (both Yoplait and Activia). I also ate like 3 hard-boiled eggs.

I think Arlington, Texas. In both locations, I had the exact same room layout. In fact, I wake up in the morning shaking, praying to jeeebus that I'm not back in Arlington. The Springhill around the corner from my company's corporate office is the practical and preferred choice for all business travel into San Diego. Thankfully the hotel staff take pride in what they're doing. The desk staff is very friendly, super helpful... even if you've misplaced your room key... three times... during... four days.. Breakfast is served every morning for a few hours starting at 6:30am. It's hotel breakfast, but it's free and gets you going. The housekeeping staff is on point. My room is sparkling every time I come back. The beds are surprisingly comfortable but the sheets aren't enough for me. This is one of those hotels where no comforter is used (and probably for good reason - I read somewhere that hotels only wash those every few months anyway). It just gets cold in here, or really hot... the wall AC/heating unit is a bit testy... you never know what you're going to get come morning. What feels good at midnight may feel like a total 180 when you wake up. On the plus side, even the cheap rooms have a microwave, mini-fridge and kitchen sink meaning this wouldn't be too bad of a spot for an extended stay. As for businesses immediately around the hotel you've got your typical on-the-road-business fare. A Chili's, Wendy's, USA Gasoline and a slightly over priced seafood restaurant called \"The Firegrill\" occupy the same lot. Do yourself a favor and hop in that rental car and just get out of Poway completely. San Diego is a nice town, the last thing you need to do is work all day then hole up right next to I-15 all pissed off about eating a Chili's night after night. The hotel is legit and I guess the moral of the story is that if you're stuck in Poway for work for a week or longer, this is probably your best bet if your company can't score the corporate rate for the Double Tree Golf up the road a bit. Ours did, but two days after I booked my reservation here. Whatever.

The rooms were spacious enough, clean, and loved the two TV's. Since we were traveling with family the kids could watch one and the adults the other by the couch. The desk area was great for the laptop! The breakfast was also wonderful! There were eggs and bacon/sausage each day of our stay as well as many other varieties of breakfast food. There were many choices for a family of four and all were happy! We also enjoyed the fruit baskets in the lobby all day. The pool area was nice but the pool water was cold so the adults stayed in the hottub.

After too many disappointments on previous vacations, we decided to try Springhill Suites, part of the well-respected Marriott family of hotels, and we couldn't have been happier. THe hotel was modern, clean, and the expanded suite-stule rooms are a huge plus when travelling with children, as we visited San Diego with our 3-year old son. The hotel's location is in a good location, right off I-15 in between the San Diego Zoo, The Wild Animal Park, and Legoland. The breakfast buffet is great, offering a great variety of breakfast foods and the hotel even offers baskets of fresh fruit in the lobby, which is a nice touch when coming back from a long day. Springhill Suites was a top-rated suite-hotel in Consumer Reports, and this hotel definitely proves why.

The only thing I was impressed with was the selection for breakfast, especially the fresh waffle. The dining area has a fireplace & TV, which was a nice touch. Lobby area has hot cocoa & cookies throughout the day, which was also great. The room was a bit smaller than I expect for a \"suite\". There's a walk-in closet, which I could do w/o in exchange for more \"suite\" space. The two TVs in fact block the walk ways. The bathroom toiletries were lacking (there were only shampoo & soap - no lotion or kleenex). The kitchenette has a microwave, sink, coffee maker & mini fridge - no utensils. The desk area has free high-speed Internet, but no computer. I was surprised that the front desk did not have a street map of the area.

We spent a night in the SpringHill Suites (Rancho Bernardo/Scripps Poway Parkway) by Marriott. Based upon the price of other hotels in the San Diego area, this hotel was a good value for a large family with children. I've stayed in other locations for this hotel brand before, and was somewhat disappointed this time around. The suites are nice and clean, the beds are good, and the staff is cordial and helpful, but I was disappointed with the amenities. The very tiny pool (smaller than most single-family pools in Houston) was located behind the hotel next to a major freeway (very loud). The pool was not heated, and with the cool San Diego breeze it was quite nippy. Many SpringHill Suites have their pools inside (even in the deep South USA). The room was somewhat smaller than your typical Embassy Suites 2-double-bed configuration. The continental breakfast at this location was quite understocked compared to other locations for this brand.
