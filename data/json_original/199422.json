I'm sure it was lovely and made a nice walk, but -2C is too cold for enjoying a riverwalk. I would have preferred to have stayed near the TV tower as it seemed much more convenient (restaurants & shops as well as sights, transportation, and tours). There was 1 restaurant in the strip with the hotel, and it was quite good. Our room was the 2-story one pictured online with the spiral staircase going up to a living area with hidden bed and seating area. Since we weren't traveling with our child, it was kind of spooky having another floor open to your room, and especially the extra large windows you had to drop 3 curtains over to block out the street lights. If you don't need the extra space, just get a regular room as these were in a wing away from the reception area. The bath was modern and nice, but the shower curtain was a pain as it kept blowing onto your legs, which it quite a gross feeling. There was no way to attach the shower curtain to the wall, and opening or closing the bath door did not help. The towel warmer was a nice touch, though, and the water pressure was good. We made the mistake of asking a dry cleaners near by to launder our clothes for 4 EUR per 1kg. We basically got back wet, unclean clothes for over 40EUR! The hotel was gracious enough to take all our wet clothes and put them in their dryer for us (no fee!), which was VERY nice!! To use an iron was quite odd as they had me go to reception, pick up an iron, then go to another floor to a small closet where an ironing board was located (something about a fire code, but it seemed inconvenient for a business traveler not wanting to pay 5EUR and wait 24 hours to have a shirt pressed). Also rather inconvenient was the fact that you had to go to reception and get a key in order to use the spa area. We didn't bother. So, if it is warm weather when you go, by all means stay here and enjoy the riverwalk. If not, stay near the TV tower where all the \"action\" is.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austria", "Title": "\u201cgreat river view, surrealistic location\u201d", "Author": "anna_austrian", "ReviewID": "UR85255706", "Content": "Overall the hotel is very nice, and not a standard typical hotel.

Consequently we didn't get out as much as we had planned. We went to the opera and the Berlin Phil, which we had booked in advenace, but other than that, we were restricted to short trips out. The hotel was therefore a large part of our break. Fortunately, it was excellent.Our room was spacious on the eighth floor with great views over the river Spree, which was frozen solid except when the ice breaker sailed through each day opening some clear water for the poor flying swans to settle on briefly. We had comfortable armchairs by the window. The food was excellent too. Breakfast had a good selection and twice we ate in Lannigan's bar, the hotel Restaurant, with good service and lovely food, though the portions were rather large.

The 'Lanninger' bar looks out onto the Spree and some lovely buildings opposite, with seating on the riverbank for warm evenings. The hotel does cycle hire, which I'd recommend; Berlin is as flat as a pancake and with the cycle paths you can't go wrong. Riding around the Tiergarten on a sunny day was just great. The hotel is also handy for bus and U-bahn stops. The room was clean, modern and spacious, and had air conditioning. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for hanging clothes.

Check-in was fast and friendly, the hotelstaff (reception, restaurant, housekeeping) was overall very helpful and friendly! My room #619 was ok, good size, many storage spaces, mini-bar, air-conditioning, tv. The bed had 2 seperate matrasses, like other reviewers before posted it's still a bouncy bed! The view from my room was on the roofs of the buildings besides the hotel, the better rooms have a view on the Spree river. The room was on the end of the hallway so it was mostly quiet during my stay, also no street noise here! The bathroom/wc was very clean with a standard decoration and the usual bathroom amenities. The breakfastbuffet was good, large selection of cold and hot items but no cook to order! Items where fresh and frequently added, good selection of breads! Didn't have to wait for a table on the days of my stay, staff was very fast with cleaning tables and serving! Hadn't got the time to use the fitness/sauna facilities!

Very bouncy so if it's two of you on double/king bed every time one person moves the other one does as well... If you travel to Berlin via car, the hotel is quite close to the Main train station and it's well hidden on the Alt Moabit Street. It's by a river, but in a courtyard!! So we drove past couple of times before we found it. The hotel doesn't have own parking lot, so you have to use a public parking (which is underneath the hotel) and will cost you 1.20EUR per hour or 17.50 EUR per 24 hours. This hotel is about 25 minutes walk from the Brandenburg gate; about 40 minutes walk from the Check point Charlie so I recommend you use the public transport.

It's all new construction next to a warehouse district that has been refurbished into chic bars, restaurants and office buildings for the Interior Ministry. Although not in a real touristy area, it's location only added to the appeal in my opinion. Because it was out of the way, prices in the restaurants, shops and bars were much more reasonable. The Hotel is well maintained and the room was standard size for Europe. All the amenities (wet bar, shower, TV, etc..). Breakfast buffet in the morning was excellent with omlettes made to order and the full range of other items (fruits, breads, cereals, daishes, etc...). Hotel staff was friendly, curteous and multi-lingual.
