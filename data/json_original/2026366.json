We booked it because it was a little outside of Rome and we were on our honeymoon so we wanted some quiet time as well as the sights of Rome. This hotel was more than we thought from the pictures. If you are looking for the nightlife of Rome, this is not the hotel for you. The hotel is about 30 minutes to an hour outside of it by bus and train. The hotel offers shuttle service to and from the Vatican each day dropping you off at 9:30am and picking you up at 7:30pm. The hotel itself was beautiful and we wished we had had our wedding there! Rooms were clean. Staff was great. Marco in the restaurant was great, and the food was the best we had in Italy. Recommended to in-laws to go stay the next time they are in Italy. Only stayed two days, but it was great and can't wait to head back. Thanks for making our honeymoon wonderful.

This is a beautiful hotel with a very friendly ambience. However, it is not for anyone looking to go partying in Rome. It was two buses and then the metro into Rome, approximately an hour journey, which we actually got used to fairly quickly. Alternatively, you could pay for the shuttle to take you into the city, if you booked it the night before. The staff were always keen to help and accommodate. We had an issue with our room whilst we were there but this was addressed fairly quickly, we were offered another room at no further cost. There is a restaurant next to the hotel but we ate there once only. I believe the hotel will have a swimming pool this year, which will be a bonus. All the members of staff were happy to help and guide on places to go and how to get there as well as making sure that our stay was very enjoyable! We cannot fault the service here at all, it was excellent! I have no complaints about it all! Hotel would be ideal for couples!!", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA Little Piece of Italian Heaven\u201d", "Author": "LynnMcGregor", "ReviewID": "UR120110111", "Content": "I cannot say enough about this fabulous tranquil little piece of Italian heaven set in wonderful countryside. Myself and my partner David stayed here from Friday 28 - Monday 31 October. The staff make you feel so welcome and nothing is too much trouble for them. On arrival myself and my partner David Findlay were greeted by a lovely woman whose name i unfortunately didnt get - she had the biggest smile and made us feel so welcome and took us to our room which was rustic, cosy and clean with a little terrace with table and chairs and a gorgeous wooden double seat with ivy wrapped round the top, then Maria who also worked in reception organised the shuttle and taxis for us and talked us through where to go in Rome - she always had time to talk and tell us all about the hotel and offer help and advice. I could have talked to her for hours - such a lovely person and her English is fabulous. The two men who worked in the restaurant were also very helpful and courteous and the food was second to none! Even on the days we ate in centre of Rome we always returned to the bar for drinks and had lunch and dinner on the Friday and Monday of our stay as the prices were on par with the restaurants in Rome so i dont understand some of the reviews saying it is overpriced? We plan to return next year and spend more time at the hotel rather than touring round Rome for a more peaceful, romantic break. We didnt want to leave. It is out of the way and not close to anything but the shuttle is 5 Euros so you cannot complain - the only thing i would suggest is possibly a little shop selling basics and possibly instead of the shuttle picking you up at 7pm from Rome that you had the option of a bit later pick up e.g. 9pm but these are minor points that would not and shoud not stop anyone from staying here rather than a city centre hotel. You have the grounds to wander round, sit on the swing chair higher up on the grounds next to the gorgeous gazibos, fountain and water wheel taking in the gorgeous Italian scenery. We have both fallen in love with this serene Italian haven.Thank you to all the staff esp Maria xx", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in beautiful grounds ...

So far so good. Maybe a bit over-styled here or there, esp. the overdone attire of the staff, but overall a good ambience. Now for the problems, which are mostly details, but they add up ... Firstly a lack of attention to detail. No clothes hooks in the bathroom: makes it inconvenient. The showerhead kept slipping down, although it was a very nice shower: annoying. There was a plate with crumbs sitting on a table in the corridor during the entire stay: not making a good impression. The air-con box although brand-new ridiculously noisy, like a tractor or so. Thankfully the windows in my room were double glazed. Kept the noise of the Saturday night party out relatively well, although sensitive people may not get a good nights sleep while the disco is going. The breakfast was soso. Again nice ambience, no doubt, but stale bread, a lukewarm cappucino (although asked the waiter to give a hot one: version 2 was also lukewarm), cheese and ham that looked like they came from the supermarket, and so tasted the juices. An ok breakfast, but no reason for joy. At the checkout they charged for wifi, even though wifi did not work and I told the reception guy so. The \"Rome city tax\" was also a surprise. Although not substantial, you never like it when there are items on your bill that you did not expect. Overall the place has potential, but kind of lost the plot a little. Actually, it reminded me a bit of an Indian operation / business model, with the very dressed up staff, 2 restaurants and stuff so that in principle you can just hang around the hotel, get pampered and not go out - at a price. Talking of price, I got a good rate, and so I do not complain about the deficiencies. This might be quite different if I had paid the full fare. And last but not least: do not expect any sweet Mediterranean setting in terms of the surrounding landscape. There really is not much of a view to talk about. Unkept scrubs, bushes, trees, the sides of the road going there very littered.

It was a little difficult to find and had our taxi driver somewhat frustrated, but it was worth the wait.

We were impressed with the cleanliness and size of the rooms. The place is very new and modern. As we ate our lunch we observed an event going on with great delectable dishes of food being carried up the hill to a party. It looked like a wonderful place to have a wedding.
