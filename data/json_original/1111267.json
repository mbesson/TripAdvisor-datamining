Wow! could not believe this, my friend gave me this look and said we cant put up with this already, so I ventured down to his office and asked for another room since this one was directly above his office. He proceded to tell me that there were no other rooms available, and that we shouldn't be doing alot of walking around the room anyway since it was so small, and that he likes renting it out to elderly people because they don't move around as much.He went on a rant for awhile saying that he works more than 16 hrs a day and that he will not put up with alot of noise. I told him that I read some reviews about him on trip advisor but rented anyway with an open mind, but I can now see the reviews by other people were spot on, this guy is on a power trip. When I told him that, he responded by saying him and the owner of the tides motel do not care about those reviews because they do not mean anything anyway! So since I got there late I just figured I would ride the storm out and check out as early as possible. I felt like a little kid in the room tip toeing around the room trying not to upset big daddy Lavon. It was the worst stay i've ever had anywhere in ocean city, and I have been going every year since i was 10, so 30 yrs!

We never saw a vacuum cleaner or any signs of one in our room. Outside was well kept amd clean. One night I called the desk for towels and was asked if I left my maid tag hang on the door, I told him it was hanging there since 11:30 AM and it was 6:00 PM. Why do I have to ask for maid service.... The staff was very friendly but I think they could do a lot more when it comes to the rooms.. The pool is small but adequate for the motel.. Its always clean and lots of chairs.. The noise, now thats a whole other problem.. the second night someone was beating on the door next to us and cursing . The next two nights the other neighbors thought that they could fight curse and swear untill 4:30 AM out on the balcony.. Not a very restful place. The annex building was the same as above as we had relatives in that building..The beach was only a 2 minute walk at most not bad..", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Tides Motel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d1111267-Reviews-Tides_Motel-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7100 Coastal Hwy</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1111267", "ImgURL": ""}}
