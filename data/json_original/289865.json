The Hotel is situated North of the centre of Rome in a nice area - plenty of restaurants and bars though not any that one would seriously recommend. A cab into the centre costs around 10 -12 euros or there are buses and trams.

The company that I work for has a good deal with the River Chateau and because my wife was flying over I decided to stay for 3 extra days (and nights) after 2 days of meetings at our office in Rome. For me it was my first stay in Rome and the River Chateau and it was great! In my opinion the River Chateau is a hotel that makes you feel welcome from the moment you set foot into the lobby. Sure, it is not directly in the center of Rome but still is located in a nice neighbour where the locals also go. Check-in was easy and I was located to room 314. The room was quite small but equipped with all necessary amenities. After a night sleep it turned out that my neighbour was quite loud and that the noise he made was reinforced by the door between his and my room. I requested a different room without a door connecting to the adjacent room and it was all taken care off without any problem. All my clothes, suitcase and items where moved by the hotel staff to room 308. It turned out that the rooms on the backside of the hotel have a balcony. Which is nice when the weather is good because in the afternoon there is still sun on the balcony. The breakfast and dinner at the hotel is also very good. The breakfast offers you enough choice to enjoy a decent breakfast and the cappucino is really worthwile. Having dinner at the hotel restaurant is also not a punishment. I have enjoyed dinner at the hotel restaurant on one evening with my colleagues. Everybody received their main course at the same time and the food itself and atmosphere was good. The only remark to this restaurant from my side would be; \"why pictures of a New York skyline in your restaurant when you are located in a beautiful city as Rome?\" If you want to have dinner elsewhere you can just walk down the street and choose one of the restaurants located there. I had dinner at restaurant \"Voy\" with my wife and enjoyed this restaurant as well. The River Chateau is located in the Northern part of Rome near the Olympic Stadium and on the otherside of the river which crosses through Rome. Getting to the center is relatively easy if you don't mind using public transport. We just walked down the street and across Ponte Milvio (don't forget to buy and hang a lock on the bridge). Once you are on the other side of the bridge cross the street and head for Piazza Mancini. There you take the tram to Piazza Del Popolo, tickets cost 1 euro for 75 minutes on the tram or bus and can be used for one metro trip. Once you reach Piazza del Popolo (12-15 minute ride) you can either take the metro on line B from station Flaminio (which is located on Piazza del Popolo) or go by foot because from the Piazza del Popolo you are within walking distance of the Spanish stairs, Via del Corse and Villa Borghese.

The local area is also great; taxi driver told us the gelateria and cake shop down the road is famous throughout Rome - it was FABULOUS and there is also a small market for fresh fruit and veg and a bread shop/pizzzeria within a 5 minute walk. The Ponte Milvio bridge is just over the road from the market. Yes it's a way into town but I am so glad we didn't stay in town. Here it's quiet and pretty - well worth the 35 minutes on one bus and an MRT into town, or just the bus goes straight to the Vatican area.

There are many fine restaurants in the area, all at reasonable prices for Italy/Europe. Suggest \"Cafe Cassa Mortaro\" reservations highly suggested, \"Palotta\" and the restaurant across from the hotel to the left.

The hotel was fabulous, we stayed in the double room for for 3 nights at 125 euros per night. Bargain. Everywhere was marble. The breakfast had a good choice available and included in the price. The staff were very friendly, showed us how to get around. You can travel in Rome for 75 minutes for 1 euro! The hotel booked a car to collect us from the airport and to take us back again for 110 euros. Brilliant. The only downsize was that it is out of the city centre, but it was in a lovely area and very quiet - no sleep was lost! At the bottom of the road there are a few restaurants and this is where the Italians eat - always a good recommendation! We found a briliant and very cheap restaurant (can't remember it's name!) It was very busy, but they always found us a table. They could barely speak English, but we got by. 20 euros for a 2 course meal, cappachinos and a litre of wine for 2 people! We will definteley be going back to the hotel and the restaurant - can't wait.", "Date": "May 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3329756", "Content": "The River Chateau Hotel was a wonderful place to stay in Rome. We stayed in a room for 98 Euro a night. The room itself was beautiful. We had a computer/television as well. Even the bathroom was beautiful, with a mosaic above the bathtub. Everything was spotless. The people working at the desk were always helpful and accomodating. The breakfast was the best we had in any of our hotels, with a large variety of foods. The only concern we had with the hotel was the location. The hotel is located in a nice area of Rome. However, it is a bit of a distance from the main sights of Rome. There is a bus which is about a block away from the hotel which takes you into the heart of Rome. However, you will need to take a Taxi or bus back to the hotel, it is not someplace you can walk to from the main sights (Vatican city, Spanish Steps, Colleseum, etc). I would also recommend printing a map of where the hotel is and bring the phone number when you first arrive in Rome. The hotel is off many of the Rome maps we had. We took taxies two times to the hotel, and neither taxi driver knew where it was. One called the hotel on his cell phone, the other driver used the map I had printed off the internet from the hotel website. We would recommend it, just know that it is not in the heart of the sites. However, for the price we paid and the service we got, we felt it was worth it.", "Date": "April 4, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "River Chateau Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d289865-Reviews-River_Chateau_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$99 - $431*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Flaminia 520</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00191</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "289865", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/42/49/4249656bdd4dcbf460ec06cc7b0ee2725large.jpg"}}
