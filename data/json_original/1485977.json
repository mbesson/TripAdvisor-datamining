We had a beautiful corner room (#2010) on the Gold floor. Similar to the Ritz Club Floor, the Gold Floor offers a lounge with breakfast, coffee, honor bar, etc. Both our room and the lounge overlooked the water with beautiful views of the mountains and the bay. Each morning, I planted my self on one of the very comfy sofas with one of their fuzzy throws and \"worked\" while watching the float planes take off and land from the bay. Being from Phoenix, I never got tired of watching these planes. Of course, not all work and no play. The spa was wonderful and I had one of my best massages with Melissa. The hotel is also within walking distance of Stanley Park with has a great trail along the seawall which became my exercise routine. Even though it was typical winter weather(rainy and overcast), Vancouver is beautiful and the rain didn't really hamper being outside. The location of the hotel is perfect for walking, and the hotel also offers rides (in the hotel BMWs) to downtown locations. The only downside is that the food is good but not great.

THis weekend I decided to try out her sister hotel, the Fairmont Pacific Rim. It most certainly did not disappoint. Check-in: Our taxi pulled up to the property and we were helped out by a very nice bellman. He proceeded to check our name and since we had pre-registered online, he gave us our keys and registration and escortedus past a very sleek lobby and bar to the elevators, where he let us know where the gold floor was and how to use our key to assist in the elevator. We arrived to our room (for a much appreciated) early check in on the gold floor. Room: Beautiful walnut faced door and entry lead us into a very sleek automated room. Divine italian linens, on a king bed, 2 uber comfy chairs and a work desk made for a very luxurious room. Marble adorned most of the bathroom with a separate tub and shower. My only criticism is that this space could have used a second sink and instead of a frosted glass door, perhaps a solid walnut one so that lights at night would not disturb the other person in the room. Service: Gold floor service was outstanding. Friendly staff amongst a beautiful view facing the harbour truly make this a winner. Evening noshes and breakfast offerings were nicely presented and yummo. Restaurant: THeir main asian fusion restaurant was elegant and sleek, again with wonderful staff preparing and serving wonderful food. Lobby bar was a happening place on Friday night where we enjoyed a glass of wine and some nibblies. Checkout: Bill was correct. Easy! Conclusion: Absolutely would stay here again! IT was nice to be amongst the Fairmont hospitality once again. Check on Fairmont's website for deals that they may be running. We found a 20% off slae on room, food and beverage. It worked out great, as we were also able to use the discount at Heron's at the Fairmont Waterfront.

It was very easy to jump on the Sea to Sky highway to Whistler from here also (approximately two hour drive through some of the most beautiful country I have ever seen).

The rooms are amazing. The hotel restaurant (Oru) is top notch. The pool is located outside on the roof, but is heated such that it was comfortable even in outside temps of 40 degrees (F).

However, this hotel is not somewhere you want to bring your 2.5 year old child for many reasons 1. It has a few in-house dining options but today ORU was shut for a private function and so was the Cafe leaving only the lounge which doesn't exactly have many child-related eating choices! Having just arrived in the city an hour back on a rainy day, we really feel very stuck and helpless as to how to feed our little boy! -- I am not sure how management could allow limiting eating options so significantly for in-house guests. 2. There are no things/activities to do with kids at all within the hotel 3. The outdoor heated pool is great but on a cold wet day, while the adults will enjoy themselves, lack of any patio heating means that it is impossible to really take young kids outdoors dressed only in swimming trunks. Oh, by the way, they have a children's in-room dining menu- perhaps so that kids can stay locked indoors and not be seen disrupting their very pristine surroundings.

Upon checking into the Fairmont Pacific Rim, I discovered that my laptop had been stolen out of my rental car sometime earlier that day. The theft had nothing at all to do with the hotel however they simply decided that they should to their best to try to brighten my day. I was paying for a basic Fairmont room but using a room update coupon that I had as a president's club perk. The kind young man at the front desk decided that he would give me room two upgrades up from the one I should have received and we ended up on the 18th floor with a spectacular harbour view. Now I will say that if you like the character and charm of the old Fairmont hotels, this is a departure from that style. This hotel is modern and sleek. At the push of button, you can open and close your drapes, change the lighting from \"welcome\" to \"relax\" mode and let housekeeping know that you want privacy in the morning. The bathroom has a dreamy soaker tub that you can relax in while watching the TV built into the mirror. The room also had a kit full of connectors which would allow you connect your electronic devises to the large HD television - this was very handy as my cell phone charger had been on my laptop bag. Despite the great surrounding, my luck hadn't completely changed. While unpacking, I discovered that I had left a jacket behind at the Fairmont Whistler where I stayed the night before. I went down to the front desk and was helped by a different staff member. I told her about my jacket and asked if the hotel might be able to get it to Vancouver for me. This young lady told me that she was headed up to Whistler on a personal trip the next day and that she would be happy to pick it up and bring to Vancouver for me. At this point we decided to take advantage of the \"Dine Vancouver\" $28 three-course menu at the restaurant. Once seated our friendly waitress, took our orders. When the two glasses of wine we had ordered arrived, she told us that she had heard about the laptop theft and the two glasses of wine were on the house. The meal was terrific, especially the short ribs. The wine list was extensive and included many wines by the glass including some reasonably priced wines at around $12 glass. Now given this stellar service, you may think that perhaps, we are big spenders who frequent the Fairmont regularly but in fact we only stay about 8 nights per year but we do make a point of trying to spend a few nights in a Fairmont when we are in city that has one. We have had the occasionally less than satisfactory situation but typically all you have to do is let a staff member know that you are unhappy and the problem will be solved. So clearly, I give this hotel top marks for customer service. I can also say that the hotel public areas are remarkably beautiful with a very modern clean look. This can however make the lobby a bit noisy when the lounge is full however I felt this gave the place a high energy feel that was very \u201cbig city\u201d.

There is a comprehensive connection center to enable use of the TV with your laptop or portable media player. The in-room music system is very good. Each room has a Nespresso espresso machine, which makes me feel at home! The only quibble I have with room design is that the lighting panels are not backlit at night, so it is difficult to select the desired lighting scene. Service was generally excellent. The only time I had trouble was when I had forgotten my running shorts at home and I ordered a loaner pair through \"Fairmont Fit\" room service. I only had an hour to work out, and the shorts took too long to arrive so I couldn't work out that day. The Milanese bakery on the main floor becomes a very nice wine bar at night.

The sommellier brought the items to my table and gave me a full explanation, including a description of the regions of Italy they hailed from. A memorable experience!

You have to realize that there are two Fairmont's in Vancouver. This one, by far, is the choice to make! We joined the President's Club which is the Fairmont chains rewards program and it was well worth the time it took to simply fill out the information card. They upgraded us to a magnificent room upon on our return after the cruise simply from joining prior to leaving on the cruise. Can't beat that! The corner rooms on the water side are stunning. The seaplanes take off right below you and if you never left your room, you'd still have a fabulous trip just looking at the breathtaking views of the mountains, the parks, the seaplanes and the ships. I had never been to Vancouver and was not particularly excited about going. To me, it was just an overnight before the cruise. Now......I can't wait to return!! The people in Vancouver were charming and friendly, the restaurants, both at the hotel and in the surrounding area were an adventure every night, the shopping was top notch and the parks provided endless ways to exercise outside (and that beats the gym any day of the week)! We received endless suggestions and help from the lovely Concierge staff and upon taking their direction to drive to Whistler, we found ourselves oohing and ahhing at every turn. That was yet another day in the Vancouver area that was unforgettable. If you decide to do that day trip (which I suggest you turn into a two day overnight), make sure to stop at the waterfalls on the way up. And DO NOT go without a camera. There is literally a photo opportunity at every turn of the drive. My suggestion is to drive to Whistler early in the morning, check to see if they are having one of their fabulous outdoor festivals (we lucked upon one), have lunch at the Fairmont in Whistler, take a rafting trip (they're fast and don't require an entire day to do) and then time your drive back to put you at Stanley Park (a not to miss destination) in Vancouver in time for an early dinner and sunset at The Tea Room (which is not a Tea Room but a lovely lovely and charming restaurant on the point at Stanley Park). That was our schedule for the day and I can honestly say it was a day I will always remember. The sunset at The Tea Room was unparalleled in my opinion. The Tea Room gets very crowded and they do take reservations so if you intend to do this, plan ahead. All in all the Fairmont, and Vancouver are something I recommend highly. And if you are so inclined, stay on the Club floor and request a corner room. Yes, there are upcharges, but if you join the President's Club it will help offset that a bit and you will not regret it. The food presentations are lovely, the Concierge staff at the Club are so attentive and helpful, and the corner room is huge with amazing views. The windows literally wrap the very large living room with pull out sofa and the bedroom and two baths are almost spa like.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cUltra modern chic hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Erikjonahluke", "ReviewID": "UR122870018", "Content": "Our family stayed at the Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel August 2011.

I stayed here for 3 nights in early November - not the best time to visit Vancouver as it's the rainy season, but this Fairmont certainly allowed me to make the best of it. I'll start with the meeting space, as this was the main reason for my visit. We held a one-day meeting in the Garnet Room including catering for a continental breakfast and some wireless internet connectivity. Ok, so I don't have much to say about this, as there was nothing to complain about. The meeting was for 5 people, the food was decent, and all staff were attentive - exactly how you want an important business meeting to go. Now, on to the hotel itself and the overnight accommodations. This is a newer property for Fairmont (there are THREE in downtown Vancouver), apparently built for the olympics. It screams luxury. I had a standard king room overlooking the pool area. Spacious floor plan - especially the bathroom with huge, glass-walled, walk-in shower. All very modern and very tech-savvy - plug-in your iPod to your alarm clock to play or wake to your own music, in-mirror TV display/tuner, touch-pads for shades/lights. All very nice. Now, to be honest, this is the one grip I had - the touch pads for lights (on entry, near desk, near bed, in bathroom) were very cool, but not really practical. Settings were unclear (ok, \"day\" and \"night\" modes are obvious, but other options weren't) and when the lights were off, one could not tell which touch button to push to turn the lights on or open the shades or whatever - so I just ended up slapping my fingers anywhere on the touch pad so that *some* light would turn on. Oh well. With respect to the hotel itself. Beautiful. Great service. The Buffet breakfast at Oru was excellent. Doorman would greet me with a water bottle each day I came in from my morning run. Used complim car service (a BMW X5) to get dropped off twice at destinations downtown. All around a great stay.

Room sizes (not counting the suites obviously) are pretty much the same, what sets them apart is the view you desire. There are city views (still very nice generous sized rooms, decorated exactly the same and views over downtown Vancouver) or harbour views, mountain views, pool views with patios and fireplaces, some rooms have balcony's, etc etc...so the choice is really up to you about how much you want to pay for what view. This Fairmont is also not like other Fairmont's at all - it was newly built for the Vancouver Winter Olympics and is all modern furnishings, large sleek spaces, trendy design - the book in the room talking about the design of the property is an interesting read to see how it all evolved. I arrived very early in the morning and was treated with exceptional customer service from the moment I arrived, by everyone I encountered. My room wasn't ready yet, but after only about an hour relaxing in the trendy lounge, they had it ready for me. Even the woman who delivered my bags to the room was genuinely kind, friendly and seemed to be happy in her work - happy staff make SUCH a difference in the customer service industry and this really came across during my whole stay.

Free wifi throughout the room worked perfectly the entire stay - this is included if you are a President's Club member and why wouldn't you be, as it is free to join online. I didn't require anyone to show me how the high tech room controls worked and didn't find them difficult to figure out at all, although I could understand how some who may not be used to such things might find them a little confusing, however they are simple touch pads to control all lighting and curtains in the room. I experienced no problems at all as some have reviewed about random lights turning on during the night and I also figured out the trick as some have mentioned the 'night' light under cabinet lighting in the bathroom stays on all night - simply hit the 'night' button on the touch pad twice or until it goes off - this will turn it off completely. I did find with all the glowing up touch pads through out the room, there was a lot of light when sleeping - I like a pitch black room, however with a little thought this can easily be overcome - just covered each touch pad with a book, etc - even the one half way up the wall can be covered up by propping a pillow up against it - so don't be worried by that if you too like a dark room! The room style - large and spacious, great entry way with large wall mirror and wardrobe with safe, ironing board and iron. Lovely walnut paneling and furniture - good desk for working at, large very comfortable king size bed (though I do wish hotel's would do away with the over the top stuffed feather pillows or at least give you a choice as I always find these rather uncomfortable). Arm chair and foot stool, plus nicely designed art/light installation above bed, however the lightbox above the bed with what looks like local forest picture, was popping out of it's frame so I could see right up into the light and the staples that were hanging from the wood frame, so that didn't look so great. This and the dust around the ornamental vase were the only two negatives I could pick about the property though - so that's saying something! My room had a balcony (no furniture on it though, which was a bit strange so could only stand out there) but it was great to be able to open the sliding doors and look out over the harbour, watch the sea planes land, look right down onto Canada Pl and the Olympic torch, just a magical view and so relaxing. I could occasionally hear the sea planes outside and only ever heard a door shut every now and then in the hallway, otherwise I would have thought I didn't have any neighbors at all - very very quiet. The bathroom....ahhhh, on another level. Grey marble throughout - huge tub, including free bath salts. Rain shower head, plus another normal one meant for a great, great shower experience. TV in the bathroom mirror, makeup mirror with light, plenty of towels, robes, anything you could need provided, toilet in separate frosted glass area at back of the bathroom. I ordered room service twice - both times it arrived quickly and hot. Delivered again by smiley, happy hotel staff who seemed to just genuinely enjoy what they do. Food tasted great also. Cafe attached to hotel has all sorts of coffee, teas, hot chocolate, etc along with breakfast pastries, muffins, and more substantial lunch items. It turns into a wine bar at night. Every day it was buzzing with locals stopping in to enjoy their coffee. The gelato place on the corner of the hotel, also very good. The location of the hotel is decent. Easy to get around - right on Canada Pl, so perfect for walking around the waterfront, looking at the Olympic stuff, right next to the exhibition centre and literally one block from the Waterfront centre - which had a Tim Horton's, Subway, McDonalds, Starbucks, etc in it, plus links you to the SkyTrain station to get around town, or just walk a few blocks and you're in the heart of the shopping district. From start to end, my stay was perfectly easy and relaxing, whilst making me feel special and luxurious. This hotel creates the hard to come by balance of modern, clean lines, simplicity, whilst still feeling cozy, comfortable and warm. I definitely did NOT want to leave and would stay here again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFeel like a princess :) I like this feeling\u201d", "Author": "Ladypelt", "ReviewID": "UR120998232", "Content": "Stayed here with 13 others on our way to whistler for a wedding and ski holiday!

I have zero complaints and tons of compliments for the staff and their service from check in to check out. This is truly an amazing hotel. Here's a short list of why it deserves a 5 star rating: - Excellent service - we arrived late, room was already checked in, my keys were out front and handed to me when I got off the taxi, and someone escorted us upstairs and explained all the little details about the room (definitely very helpful if you are not used to all the electronics). The concierge was extremely helpful as to point out walking directions, best scenic routes, different transportation options, etc. - Cleanliness - from the floors to the bathroom to the public areas, this hotel is squeaky clean! The hotel is very modern (which might be very different from other Fairmonts), and the decor and design is very sleek but welcoming. Housekeeping does an amazing job (twice a day) at getting your room ready for the daytime and the evening. Simply amazing - Lobby bar - fun place to hang out. They've got a good selection of drinks at a very reasonable price. Live music is pretty much played all throughout the afternoon and until closing at 1 am. This place gets pretty packed so secure your spot early when everyone's out at dinner. - Location - it's definitely the best place to stay at if you're in Vancouver for tourism or even for business. We did not rent a car and walked everywhere. Buses and the subway are very convenient and within walking distance. There are also lots of great restaurants nearby (Japanese, seafood, snacks, etc.). The one thing that was probably missing was a supermarket, but there are several drug stores that open late nearby. Oh, and a gelato place downstairs that opens from 8 am to late in the evening (11 pm?) - Food - We only had the chance to go to Giovanne (not Oru) for breakfast. They have a fabulous selection of breakfast items. The breakfast sandwich was amazing. I was not a big fan of their coffee and think that they can improve on this, but other than that, I was a happy man by starting my morning off there. I have to try their main restaurant the next time I'm in town. - Price - I almost forgot... Yes, I paid 240 CAD / night. It comes with a 25% off breakfast buffet coupon which we didn't use, and internet was included. I'd say this is an amazing rate for what you get, don't you? Complaints? Well...none really.

From the moment we arrived, the staff were remarkable. They were very efficient, friendly and helpful. Even thought we arrived early (12pm), they were able to get a room for us right away. The hotel lobby is stunning and has a modern, Scandinavian vibe to it. There is a lobby lounge with a spacious seating area and it had a great, live band each evening. The room was gorgeous! It had plenty of dark, wooden accents and a modern feel. Everything was automated: the blinds, the lighting etc. You could set the lighting to a few different settings to create various moods in the room. The bed was very comfortable and had nice white linens. There was a little table and two chairs by the window. The window was basically floor-to-ceiling and allowed an amazing view of Vancouver. We had a nice view of the harbour where the cruise ships dock. The bathroom was great! A huge, deep bathtub surrounded by marble. There was a separate shower with a rain-fall style shower head plus an additional handheld shower head. The toilet was in a separate room with a sliding door. Again the lighting in the bathroom was automated so it could be set on groom (brightest), spa (dimmer) and night (very faint) or turned off completely, of course. I loved that there was a TV inside the bathroom mirror! I liked watching some TV while in the bathtub or getting ready in the morning. The room had other nice touches; pod-style coffee maker, nice flat-screen tv, safe, plush robes, turn-down service, Globe and Mail on your door in the morning, and nice toiletries. What else do I love besides the beautiful room? The breakfast buffet was really nice. It is $30/person and that seemed liked a great value for excellent food. Our friends went to the Pan Pacific for brunch and it was $50/person! In my opinion the ambiance at the Pacific Rim is much better, the staff far friendlier, and the setting less dated. We ate lunch at Giovanni's. It is a great cafe to pick up paninis, soup, salad, pastries, coffee and an extensive Italian wine selection. Everything is made in-house, from scratch. There is also Bella Gelateria that offers a great selection of home-made gelato with some unique flavours: Earl Grey, salted caramel, lavendar, chocolate and sea salt, along with many of the usual flavors. I have to admit, the chocolate/bacon gelato seemed like a crazy combination. It is perhaps a bit pricier than a typical gelato place but it is made in-house each day and you can look in to see where it is all made.

Our room was on the 19th floor which when we entered our room, we were gobsmacked, it was huge, furnished really well with push button electrics for lights, curtains, nets etc. Everything ultra modern, LCD TV & coffee maker. Bathroom was huge as well with blinds over the full height windows, enormously deep jacuzzi bath, shower etc. even a TV with remote in the bathroom. Push button electrics for lighting and the blinds which provided superb views 'to die for' over the harbour and the mountains beyond. Drinks in bar very expensive, min of $18 for a glass of wine. We went to a nearby reataurant for dinner and a cafe for breakfast, so cannot comment on food. Staff were excellant.....just could find nothing to be unhappy about, an absolutely lovely place.

I am a Fairmont Presidents Club member and have used the Fairmont Gold level service in Kona, Hawaii a few years ago. The service and amenities were so incredible, I'll hit a Fairmont whenever I can and get a Gold Class room if one is avail. After looking at the 3 Vancouver Fairmonts and despite the $600+ price tag per night, I decided to try the Pacific Rim. It was 5 star, looked magnificent and had a Club room avail. We got in about 7:30pm just as the evening drink/snacks were just winding down and we missed any opportunity to take advantage (bummer). To our dismay, our room was right next to the concierge/club room. Since I didn't receive any special discount, was traveling for leisure (unlike alot of the business folk I ran into) and am a Fairmont President's club member, I thought for sure they would have given us a better room. The view was all city - but not an attractive city view (directly facing some office building). We were exhausted so went to bed early despite all the chit-chatting going on outside our room at the concierge desk (well beyond 10pm). The noise did keep my husband from sleeping. In the morning, the coffee machine was on the fritz. We called to see if we were using it wrong and the concierge said she'd have some coffee delivered. 20 mins later we just dressed and went to the Club lounge and told the concierge to not bother sending the coffee. The poor overworked girl in the Club lounge apologized profusely, while the 2 concierge girls giggled at the desk. The morning breakfast on the Club floor was decent, but not the same level of service as Hawaii. In Hawaii eggs were made to order and the warm food selections were more abundant. Surprisingly, there was not a Wall Street journal available in the lounge either. Proximity to the water and Stanely Park was the only saving grace of this stay. We explored the city and were offered a late check out that we very much appreciated. The late check out was really the only benefit we received for our $600+ night. When asked if the BMW car service available for Gold rooms could take us to the train statione, we were told it was 'just outside their boundary' but 'a taxi will surely take you straight away'. I was flabbergasted! I'm quite certain the Fairmont Orchid folks would have stretched their limit for us. As I jumped in my taxi, I looked over at the Gold floor BMW sitting unused in the parking lot. I don't think it had moved all day. I smiled to myself ironically. I wouldn't be coming back here. On the flip side, the room was pretty well appointed, with electronic controls for everything and the in mirror TV in the bathroom was a hit:). Additionally, I could see a fabulous looking lap pool and the gym looked promising. I will never return to this Fairmont and probably none in the Vancouver metro. I will certainly never recommend it to anyone. My expectations for Fairmont hotels have been reset and I will not automatically gravitate to them when making hotel plans. I am so disappointed. The Cascadia was 1/3 the cost and I would recommend that (as well as the free breakfast buffet) over this Fairmont.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valsolda, Italy", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "kenmaestro", "ReviewID": "UR118246456", "Content": "I am a fairly regular visitor to Vancouver and this trip was in town for just one night so decided to give the Pacific Rim a go.

It was our first time in Vancouver and the staff and amenities at the hotel was a large part of our enjoyment. Here's some of the highlights and a couple recommendations. Pool: The pool is heated to a very pleasant temperature. Our two daughters really love playing in pools but usually get cold fairly quick. The pool at the Pacific Rim is the perfect temperature for them to enjoy it and the surroundings are very pleasant for us to relax as well. Service was excellent and the decor and chairs very comfortable. Spa: My wife had a manicure and I went for a massage. Both were excellent and the lounge area that overlooks the harbor makes for a very romantic setting. There are chairs the shape of an egg (funny sounding huh...) resting at a slight angle and open on the front. Two people can comfortably sit inside with with a high amount of privacy like you are in your own little oasis. I recommend spending the money to use the spa or just get a massage and its free. It was a very relaxing get away in the middle of our trip. Its a nice place to get away from the pool areas if you want hot tubs that are more private and less people. Biking: The concierge was exceptionally friendly and helpful. They even have bicycles you can use so the 4 of use took a 2 hour ride around the park. The one aspect I would recommend is reserving them as soon as you arrive. That way you are sure you can have them at the time you are interested in. They recommended a drive up to Whistler and it was spectacular. Many short hikes and waterfalls along the way and in the summer there are numerous activities for the kids to enjoy in the ski area (rock climbing, etc). The rooms are well appointed, clean, and in very good condition. The hotel has some rooms with unique shapes so if you booked a suite you may want to call ahead. Some of them have the sofa in the same room as the bed and if you have kids that can be inconvenient. When I raised this to the hotel they were very helpful in offering to change rooms and really pleasant. The breakfast was excellent. More than I usually like to spend but it was well worth it to us. The staff was amazing too. Stopped by just the right amount of times, made hot chocolate for our girls and its the first place in a long time my wife enjoyed Eggs Benedict - they were very well made and fresh.

As a female solo traveler, I look for location, security and good concierge services and, of course, a clean and attractive room. This hotel met all my requirements +. Firstly, the room was gorgeous. I want to live in the bathroom! The hotel is perfectly located, a few blocks from the Sky Train, right next door to the Vancouver Tourism office (which was great), across the street from the Seaplane Terminal and Canada Place (where all the tour and local buses pickup) and across from the beginning of the bike path to the Stanley Park seawall. An added convenience was the food court/mini mall next door, for quick coffee at Tim Horton's, some sushi or a taco, if I didn't feel like going for an upscale meal. If you are a member of the Fairmont President's Club (free), you can reserve the BMW bicycles for three hour rides, which I gladly did (the ride around Stanley Park is a must). The hotel valets also have BMW SUV's, which if available, can drop you off to your destination in town (which was great!) The concierge staff was terrific. Ivonne and the tall blonde fellow during the day (forgive me for forgetting his name) were wonderful. The front desk staff was great, too, running over to help you if the concierge desk was busy.

The first time was in July last year during the Vancouver Jazz Festival. This time we missed the Jazz Festival, but there's always something going on in Vancouver during the Summer months. First of all, the view from our room on the 19th floor was outstanding. We had a panoramic view of Coal Harbour, overlooking Stanley Park and North Vancouver. The early morning sun shining on the water and the glow of the late afternoon sun, was just mesmerizing. Our room was top notch. As has been posted, there is a modern aesthetic which we really liked. All the light switches and draperies were controlled electronically. The bathroom has a big mirror with a tv in it. When you switch off the lights, a very low level nightlight glows under the counter as an aid in case you need to get up in the middle of the night. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens were good quality. All the finishes were just top notch. This is how a luxury class hotel should look. The service was also top notch. From the valets to the front desk to the household staff, everyone performed their tasks pleasantly, efficiently, and with a smile. I was almost embarrassed to show up in my el cheapo rental car, set among a sea of Bentleys, Ferraris, and Porsches parked out front. The valet staff was great. As long as we called down first, they had the car waiting for us by the time we came downstairs. Despite the fact that we missed the Jazz Festival, there is still nightly live music at the lobby bar entertainment area. The space has a natural resonance that is ideally suited for jazzy type music. Our only disappointments were that the coffee and desert were very mediocre. As for the location, it can't be beat. You are right in the heart of everything. The waterfront is right there. Canada Place is right there. Stanley Park is a short distance. Robson Street is a few blocks away. Or you can zoom across the Burrard Street bridge to the Kitsilano neighborhood (great walking street for shopping) or Granville Island. I give this place 5 stars.

The rooms are spacious and the room we stayed in had a lovely view of the harbor...well it was a partial view because we were on the 7th floor which looked out onto the roof of the convention center, which has a lot of wild grass growing on top. But the water was visible if you looked to the right and the mountains in the distance, and we were fine with that. The bed is super comfortable, but it is a very technologically advanced room.

The concierge was really helpful in making last minute lunch reservations for us at Cardero's the first day. The lobby gets pretty crowded at night, a lot of people come there for drinks and events (there were a couple weddings) and there is a gelateria that is attached to the lobby. So, if the staff does not recognize you as a guest and you are coming in at night, they won't be as nice...until you say you are staying there and then the service turns on high.

The room overlooked the water to the east , and had comfortable chairs for reading and admiring the view. The bed was soft, and what you should expect from a hotel of this level. I loved the fact that the outdoor pool was open in December and it made for a delightful afternoon to look out to the snowy North Shore mountains and have relaxing soak in the hot tub after a swim. They have an excellent complementary car service within the downtown core that we utilized, it is first come-first served and subject to a car being there. The only hiccup was one morning, when I and my wife were enjoying some time with out the kids, the Housekeeping staff let themselves in at 8 am without knocking and our \"do not disturb\" was on. After we called the front desk to let them know what happened, the Assistant Manager was excellent and truly apologetic. she did her best to make sure that we were well taken care of, for the remaining duration of our stay.

They made sure we had bottled water and juice boxes, and that our children had fish food to feed the goldfish out front. We spent 6 nights here, the first three in a Fairmont room and the last three in a Signature suite. The basic rooms are modern, with a beautiful bathroom and separate shower. Our kids loved the TV in the bathroom mirror. Beds and pillows are very comfortable. To avoid obstructed views make sure you are on a higher floor. The pool area can be noisy since it doesn't close until 10 p.m. so if you are travelling with younger children the sound can be an issue on the lower floors overlooking the pool. One night there was still music playing and people noisily swimming after 11 p.m. I would have been content to stay in our 2 queen harbour/mountain view room, but we had to upgrade to the suite since the hotel was sold out for all other room categories for the last three nights of our stay. The suite was a bit over the top for us, huge, 1200 sqare feet, with a separate bedroom, two bathrooms and a living and dining area. It had a balcony with a table and chairs, and an incredible view. I found it a bit strange that a room that size would have a microwave but not a fridge other than the small bar fridge, but they were happy to provide one for us. We did have one issue with our duvet not being clean but the problem was quickly corrected. The pool area is outdoors but chairs were always at a premium in the afternoon....could be nicer if they added more loungers. Never saw anyone using the private cabanas. The lobby had live entertainment each evening but drinks in the bar are very expensive. We loved the coffee and thin crust pizza at Giovanes.

The room was very comfortable in size and amenities. The big thing you need to know is exactly where your room faces. We paid for an upgraded room and we had a completely obstructed view of the water and mountains, however, the reservationist told us we had a grat room. Fairmont does offer nice complemtary bikes and it is located right on the waterfront with walking and biking roads right outside the hotel. You are also in walking distance to the water taxi and train station. Overall, we thought the hotel was nice, but $500/night for an upgraded room (not suite) was a bit pricey for what we received. If you are able to find a deal for your stay, I would try it out. Lastly, there are several different areas within walking distance which we walked and rode through just about all of them. Gas town is one of them and they often recommend you check out.

Each time I come here my heart explodes with pleasure. I have visited many times but was waiting until I had completed the most recent booking, as it was a two-night stay that included a trip to the in-house Willow Stream Spa. When you arrive at the hotel check that you are in the right one, as the Pacific Rim can easily be confused for the other Fairmont hotel next door. The Pacific Rim entrance is distinguished, among other things, by its fabulous Lobby Bar, which consistently plays excellent live music nightly. During our last visit the bar served as a venue for the Jazz Festival, so we paid a particularly long visit one Friday night there. There is a menu of \u201cold-fashioned\u201d (and I\u2019m talking the olden-olden days) drinks which are very expensive and strange tasting. I tried one (bitter flower cough syrup, anyone?) but ordered a brown sugar mojito for the second round (f-ing BEAUTIFUL and PERFECT) and was blown away. On the Lobby level there is a flower shop (for your suite parties!), a bakery/lunch place, and a coffee bar. All are wonderful. One morning I went down for lattes and bought two giant cream puffs that were so indulgent the server actually tried to talk me out of them. Luckily I ignored him. Imagine a large, sugared donut shell ten times better than any Tim\u2019s, and then fill it with like two cups of heavy sweetened whipped cream. Yeah, do that. Dude. OMG. Feeling guilty about that but also not (this is the Pacific Rim, pimpin\u2019 ain\u2019t easy) I decided to take a dip in the pool. Beautiful but not overbearing, the pool area is lined with the standard loungers as well as a small bar. Beyond the pool loungers, the area is rimmed with some Las Vegas style cabanas, complete with TV\u2019s and bar service. They have to be booked and paid for separately, but none were used the day I went. The Willow Stream spa is a fully-equipped bliss centre. After being greeted at reception, you are led into gender-specific dressing rooms, which are lined with digital lockers. You are given a plush robe, a bottle of water, waterproof slippers, and usually a product sample of some sort. If you arrive a couple of hours early for your treatment (which I HIGHLY recommend), you\u2019ll have time to try the giant eucalyptus steam room, the \u201cexperience shower\u201d (only on the women\u2019s side!), the indoor and outdoor lounges, and the co-ed hot tubs outside. They serve light snacks and beautiful teas, and citrus infused cold water. You can also stay and relax after your treatment. It\u2019s totally amazing, absolutely the best spa I have ever been to. I had a Stress Relief massage, which was outstanding, but during another visit my husband and I had a couples treatment which included a mud wrap and a soak in a Japanese tub and that was really outstanding too. Treatments are really excellent value when you take into account how many amenities are available to you both before and after your appointment. During our last stay we had booked a spa package, and during our two night stay we were allowed unlimited access to the hydrotherapy and lounge spaces in the spa. It was so great to be able to begin and end each day with a steam, shower and hot tub at Willow Stream. There is a semi-private hot tub on the deck, just behind a rock wall, perfect for a romantic couples\u2019 soak or a BFF bonding session. I have stayed in many different rooms at this hotel, including a couple of suites, and all are really gorgeous and modern. Everything feels new and clean, which is more than one can say for many hotels in the city. Beds are wonderful and comfortable, and some suites include a bubble-jet tub. Pool-view suites have TV\u2019s in the bathroom mirrors! The stunning decks have wall mounted gas fireplaces, perfect for relaxing at night. Amenities and toiletries are high-end \u2013 don\u2019t forget to use the provided bath crystals to soak in your bathtub! ORU Restaurant serves modern Asian food \u2013 you really must visit. It\u2019s a bit expensive but worth the money. They also serve a fabulous breakfast buffet in the mornings (book the bed and breakfast package, it\u2019s the best deal) complete with a cook-to-order omelette station, gorgeous pastries, and table coffee and drink service. Tips for the servers at breakfast are included in the breakfast rate, and they will graciously remind you of this when it\u2019s time to sign the check. I absolutely adore this hotel. We are planning a visit in another couple of weeks and as many times as I have stayed here I know it will be special.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOne more night please!!!\u201d", "Author": "Katzy61", "ReviewID": "UR115671685", "Content": "This exquisite hotel is the best I have ever stayed in.

It is conveniently located downtown, just off Coal Harbor and other attractions like Canada Place \u2013 housing the Convention Center, the Olympic Cauldron, Vancouver\u2019s seawall stretch and not to be missed Stanley Park. One thing you immediately notice upon arrival is the warm welcome by the bellhop receivers at the front entrance--smartly dressed in all black attire complete with fedoras and a welcoming smile\u2014asking to help with luggage while directing you to the front desk attendants. Off to your right is as you enter is a lobby lounge and bar towards the back and, to your right sits the reception area and Concierge. On this particular stay check-in was pretty quick and efficient and we were able to get up to our rooms in no time. The hotel design aesthetic is the brainchild of Hong Kong born Canadian, James K.M Cheng (also responsible for the Shangri-La Vancouver and Tonronto) and is decidedly ultra-modern but functionally so. Rooms are well appointed and very spacious with either city or bay views and come equipped with all the standards, plus plush bedding, do-it-yourself coffee service by way of pretty smart looking Nespresso makers, expansive bathrooms with rain showers, TV in mirror, and luxurious bath products by Miller Harris. Oru, the onsite restaurant is a Pan-Asian bistro helmed by Executive chef David Wong who cleverly incorporates east and west flavors in his specialties. I\u2019m a sucker for a nice breakfast spread and Oru\u2019s is pretty much as good as they come. You have the choice to order a la carte or experience the buffet (which includes most things on the menu anyway). My recommendation: go for the buffet. It runs \u2018roughly\u2019 about the same amount, ~30 CAD (not terribly inexpensive, admittedly), as ordering a la carte, but with a better value in my opinion. For a grab-and-go option or a more casual alternative, check out bustling daytime caf\u00e9 and nighttime wine bar, Giovane caf\u00e9 which is also onsite. For a little R&R, the Fairmont Pacific Rim features a roof deck cabana lounge with a heated pool where you can take a plunge and order drinks pool-side till after dark, or for a more serene relaxing experience, try one of the services at Willow Stream spa.

We are locals and have stayed at the Pacific Rim twice in the last year. The first time was to celebrate my sister's 25th wedding anniversary - we treated her and her hubby to dinner at Oru and a room so they wouldn't have to drive after dinner. We got a pretty good rate and booked a room for ourselves too. From check-in to check-out the experience was great - the staff are polished and professional without being snooty and were quick to respond to any request. The rooms are the very best of any I have stayed in...and I have stayed in many a high end hotel. Crisp, clean design, fantastic lighting and absolutely fabulous bathrooms. We had a room facing the harbour with floor to ceiling glass in the bathroom...in which we enjoyed the huge two person soaker tubs facing the mountains. I admit to arriving at the hotel stressed and harried from a horrible day at work, but a pre-dinner soak with a glass of wine and some chocolates had me melty and in the best of moods by the time we sat down at Oru.

Northwest does get you a beautiful view of Stanley Park though. Kudos to the interior design team - this hotel is a visual delight without being fussy or overstated. The lobby and piano bar have the grand elegance a hotel of this stature should. Blackout blinds and mood lighting via switch controls in the rooms are a a nice touch. Not cheap, but if you are looking to spoil yourself, this is the place. Ask for a higher floor if traffic noise is a concern for you - also the views are much better. On our second stay we had a slightly different room with a less spectacular bathroom (but ultra-deluxe non-the-less), the tradeoff is that we got a walk-out balcony from which we could sip a glass and watch the sea planes take off and gaze at Stanley Park. Both were enjoyable - but in different ways. If I had to stretch to find a negative it would be that the Coal Harbour location doesn't have the density of cool shops and restaurants that a location like Yaletown provides within easy walking distance. It does get you the Stanley Park Seawall though - so it just depends on what experience you are looking for.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place.

Being such simple people this was a WOW factor in our books. While none of us travel that often we were very impressed with this hotel from the first time we got out of our shuttle to the time we left we were treated with the utmost kindness, and being from the Aloha State this plays a big part. What did we like, well it goes something like this: 1. Bellhops were right on top of everything the moment we got out of our shuttle. 2. Lobby - OMG when we stepped inside the place was so immaculate. Our eyes were in amazement of the beauty and details. Marble throughout the area 3. Check in - thinking that our arrival was at 9:00am we didn't expect our room to be ready and hotel would hold our bags so that we could walk around the area. Much to our surprise our room was ready and we had the opportunity to freshen up after and early morning arrival. 4. Bell Woman (not man) - took our suitcases to our room and then proceeded to tell us everything about the room and how to work everything. Considering that the place is high tech, good thing she took the time to introduce us to all of the gadgets in the room. 5. Information - both in the room and at the front desk was great. Even told us where there was some good cheap eats in the area. 6. Bathroom - space, space and more space! Soaker tub, separate shower, amenities fit for a queen or king 7. Pool area - what a nice place to just sit and relax. Hot tub - great. 8 Security - best I have ever seen. You'll need a key card to activate the elevator when getting to your room or any other floor. Smart move! 9. Location - near Canada Place for cruise goers. Olympic Flame across the street. Convention Center across the street and a two minute walk to the other Convention Center located in the Pan Pacific Hotel. 10. Piano in lobby - take a good look, it's one of a kind Fazioli made in Italy at a whopping $225K. The sound it great if you're into listening to music while you drink. Now what didn't we like: 1. Internet service is not free! Come on guys! 2. We had to leave From the moment we entered this hotel to the time we left, every worker we encountered was incredible. Helpfulness every step of the way. No doubt that this is in fact a 5* hotel. If we ever have a chance to return to Vancouver the Fairmont Pacific Rim is where we will be staying.

We arrived by towncar from the airport and were assisted by the doormen in collecting our luggage from the car, and then directed to the check-in desk. Our room was ready at 1 p.m. and after being checked in, the guest services lady showed us to the elevator and how you need to put your card over the sensor to have access to the guest room floors. Our room faced Cordova Street. We were on the 9th floor. We liked that there was a small window that would open to let some fresh air in, especially having been on airplanes for much of the day. One thing about the area of Vancouver we stayed in - the air felt fresh and not city-ish. Our room had two queen beds that were absolutely comfortable. There were two side chairs plus the desk chair for adequate seating (the window ledge was also a good spot). There could've been more drawer space as one drawer was taken up with the \"mini-bar\" snacks, ice bucket, etc. This hotel has a lot of modern features, including push-button drapes and lights which took a little bit to figure out how to not turn off all the lights at once, but it was also nice to have the light control panels located in several places throughout the room so no one had to get up to turn off the lights at night :) The bathroom was spacious and we liked having the toilet in a separate area which made sharing the bathroom easier. The shower was good, but as someone else mentioned, it would be nice to have an extra place to hang a used towel. We had read about the bathrooms having tv's but didn't notice it was actually in the mirror until we wondered what the remote control was doing in the bathroom. The door has a doorbell and a light system so that you can mark it for privacy or for cleaning / service. They have nightly turn down service and bring bottles of water (but not plastic water bottles - these are reusable bottles that they fill and bring each night). The pool area is nice and quiet with plenty of sunbeds and cabanas which also had tv's. There's also a hot tub. The fitness room was available 24-hours and had plenty of equipment and also headsets to borrow. The lobby is big but very loud - louder than I expected - and that was my only disappointment - the lobby bar is very open and the music and conversations echo throughout the lobby area. After a busy day of sightseeing, there's nothing relaxing about being hit with so much noise in one space. Concierge was helpful in giving directions and information for various places we wanted to go including a grocery store and how to get to the Seabus terminal. It would be nice if the hotel offered free internet access, but as it turned out, Giovane, the cafe in the lobby, offers free wifi access to customers. I had a delicious hot chocolate one afternoon so I could use the internet. As it turned out, I didn't lose the signal or connection when I went to my room on the 9th floor. Just saying. The location of the hotel is very good for access to touristy things to do and the port for cruising. We walked several blocks up Thurlow to find restaurants and shops along the way. We enjoyed strolling along the promenade area by the convention center and Canada Place. We walked to GasTown in less than 10 minutes.

It was my first visit to Vancouver, and I wanted to end my experience on a positive note. This hotel is one of the best I've ever stayed at, and I'm a fairly well-traveled person. The staff was so welcoming and professional throughout the entire stay. The doorman came to the front desk with my husband and me, even though we didn't need help with our bags. He had politely caught our names and introduced us to the clerk, who couldn't have been sweeter. Every interaction with the front desk was pleasant, whether calling down from the room, getting directions to the pool and restaurant or requesting a key when I'd popped in quick for lunch and didn't have mine on me. The concierge asked how we'd enjoyed our stay when we checked out and warmly wished us safe travels. The location is perfect. You're a block from the Sky Train and the waterfront. There are a ton of good restaurants close by, but the hotel's own is more than adequate. The gelato stand is popular from what I gathered, and the cafe was decent. We loved the look of the lobby and bar. The hotel is so well-designed! Our room was enormous with a European style bathroom, spa style shower and soaking tub. There was even a television in the bathroom mirror, not to mention a large LCD flat screen in the room. If you were going to have a party, there was a long parsons table in the entrance that seemed made to double as a bar. There were tons of details in the room from a suit rack with cufflink holder to a gourmet espresso machine to a suitcase stand. The pool was nice if a bit on the small side. (The hot tub was almost as big.) It's too bad you can't see the amazing view from it. If it were on a higher floor maybe, but they built some pavilion for the Olympics from the looks of it. There is a bar which wasn't open when we were there. But there is no better place to stay in Vancouver. I feel like I ran the full gamut, going from heaven to hell while I was there.

Our arrival was marred by the odd circumstance that Fairmont has two properties with similar names located only a block apart. We accidentally pulled in to the \"other\" Fairmont's parking garage, paid, and wheeled our luggage into reception, where we were informed that we were in the wrong hotel. Coincidentally another couple was checking in after having inadvertently gone to the Pacific Rim. The clerk noted that \"this happens all the time\" and pointed us to the correct destination. Annoyingly, we had to pay for our parking mistake. Finally parked in the Pacific Rim's garage we wheeled into their lobby, where we were ignored by the doormen who seemed focused on more glamorous-looking guests. We never once got a glance from them during our stay, which is hardly significant but a little odd for a property this expensive. Arrival was the only flaw, however. Check-in went smoothly and we zipped up to our room. Although it was the least-expensive in the hotel it was spacious and had fine views over the city. Traditionalists and chintz afficionados should beware: The decor is ultra sleek and of-the-moment. Being dedicated modernists, though, my husband and I found the room a paradise of pushbuttons. We could have spent the entire weekend doodling with the motorized drapes and lighting settings. The bathroom is a palace of granite, glass and mood lighting. The flatscreen television embedded in the mirror is sort of a gimmick, but a worthy one that I enjoyed. The scale was a nice touch but one I used less as the weekend and the meals progressed. We ate breakfast in the ORU restaurant. It was delicious and the service was attentive. Again, expensive but we thought the high quality of the food was worth it. We also had drinks one evening in the lobby. It was pleasant to sit next to the high style fireplace and again service was good. One of the nicesest surprises was Giovane, the espresso bar near the hotel entrance. WIth a beautiful modern decor and ecellent coffee and pastries it was a good breakfast alternative to the more pricey ORU. One of the hotel's best features is its location on Vancouver's waterfront. We were lucky enough to be there during a spell of good weather during an otherwise gloomy Northwest spring. We took full advantage of the opportunity to step outside for long walks along the promenade, watching the seaplanes come and go past the sheer green skyline of the Coast Range. For those who enjoy walking its also an easy trek up to Robson Street and the rest of downtown Vancouver. The hotel is also quite close to the cruise ship terminal.

We had a Deluxe Harbor View room and as a previous reviewer has stated, it is partially obstructed by a building but the view is still lovely, overlooking the pool area and also the harbour. There really isn't much to complain about for this hotel, the only thing that I would say is that there was only one towel rail which was also the handle to the shower (no huge deal anyway) and the lights are all clipsal electronic lighting and the master button is on the same panel as the other ones so in the middle of the night you can potentially turn on all of the lights when you only want the bedside table! Again, no huge thing, but I just thought I'd point it out. They don't have free wi-fi though, which is one thing that I think a high class hotel should offer. You are able to purchase it of course, but at the usual rediculously high hotel rates. We were very impressed with the service. I'm not sure if it is common occurance or if it was because we had emailed the hotel before hand in regards to our stay (and our friends who we also booked for are part of their executive club), but we had chocolate truffles delivered in the afternoon and they also dropped us down to Stanley Park in one of their vehicles.

The clock-radio on the nightstand has iPhone attachment, but even better it has a \"nature sounds\" mode which gives you sleepy music. This place is plush. The spa is top-notch.

An amusing aspect of the bathroom was the built-in TV in the mirror. The main room had a large flat-screen TV. An odd part about the room was the lighting design and curtains. Everything is electronic/automated. There are no switches. Instead of switches, there are small buttons with which to change the mood lighting in the room and to open/close the curtains. I would have been happier with standard light switches and manually controlled window curtains. The hotel is located next to the Convention Center (with underground connecting walkway) and within 2 minutes of beautiful views over the water. From the hotel, I walked to many places in Vancouver including Gastown, Chinatown, and Yaletown. By the way, if you like ice cream/gelato, you need to try Bella Gelateria, located on the same block as the hotel.

I must say that stay in this property was a very pleasant surprise. I loved everything about it. We walked into a lobby on Saturday night, after 7 hours of traveling and found it bustling with a wedding party. Despite all that, we never felt out of place, the check in was brief and courteous and we were shown to our room within few minutes after arrival. Our room was facing an office building next door, but it did not deter me, in the city, it is rare to have a truly exceptional view, and I was not planning to spend lots of time in the room anyway. The beds were one of the best hotel beds I have slept on. I loved the level of firmness, the sheets and the cleanliness. The lights / curtain controls were interesting and I did not find them hard to operate. As many reviewers mentioned before me, there was TV in the mirror, and we all loved it since it was one of those things that you rarely see in hotels! Concierge service was exceptional. I have talked to 3 of them over the course of stay, and all three were very pleasant, and provided valuable recommendations. Location was very close to waterfront, Stanley Park and to Skytrain and Tram. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet at the hotel's restaurant. It had a nice variety and not crowded. I especially enjoyed my green tea that was served in the cast-iron tea kettle with the warmer! All of the staff that we encountered was very pleasant and helpful. Checkout was quick and we were on our way to explore the city. When I come back to Vancouver, I would certainly not hesitate to book this lovely hotel.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, Maryland, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great city!!\u201d", "Author": "texan4eva", "ReviewID": "UR84827255", "Content": "Arriving at the hotel: I just get off the skytrain which is a *tough* 3.5 blocks away (and I say tough because it's a series of uphills and downhills on what seemed like cobblestone sidewalks in downtown), I'm rolling a heavy suitcase with a laptop case piled on top and a heavy purse...needless to say, I'm huffing and puffing. And it's 60 degrees out. I finally reach my hotel and before I could even reach the front door, a doorman comes up to me and asks for my name. I reluctantly tell him and upon briefly checking his list, he informs me that I am checked in and he already has my key. You don't know how relieved I was to realize I didn't have to stand in any kind of line or even talk to a receptionist. All I had to do was walk to the elevators and go to my room. It was like spotting an oasis of water in a desert. In fact, there were two complimentary bottles of water (and chocolates) waiting for me in the room! The room: I booked a harbor-facing, king bed room on the 10th floor. Well, it's not the largest room I've ever stayed in, but they spared no expense when it came to the little extras and made it feel like I was VIP. The lights are ultra-high tech. All controlled by a touch switchpad. One by the door, the desk, and at bedside. Very convenient. It made going around a hotel room turning off lamps with a turn of a black knob seem so ancient and barbaric. I LOVED the tv behind the mirror. I loved the deep soaking tub even more. Especially because it was spotless. For once, I actually felt comfortable taking a bath in a hotel bathroom. With my clothes off. The plush, white robes were a nice touch too. Made me feel like a filthy rich millionaire. The bed was super-comfy. I actually want to purchase the sheets and comforter for my own house!! The view from my balcony was nice, but from the 10th floor, the view of the harbor was partially blocked by the convention center. Not horrible, but not great either. One word of caution: do NOT under any circumstances make a long-distance phone call. It costs $6.75 for the first minute and $2.50 for each additional minute. I found out the hard way. For a 9-minute phone call back home in the states, I had to promise my first born child. However if you sign up with the Fairmont's President's Club ahead of time, you get free internet access in your room everyday. That was a plus. The service: VERY friendly staff here. Every time I called the front desk, I would get a personal greeting and never waited more than 30 secs to get a real person on the phone. The housekeeping staff is also ultra-nice and meticulous. The bartending staff in the lobby was excellent. They are really friendly (in a real *friend* kind of way, not a fakey hotel-service kind of way). I enjoyed the drinks and food I had there. Although it was pricey, it was worth it for the people-watching and convenience. I never actually made it to the spa, but when I called there, the receptionist was very friendly and informative. They were even willing to extend their Mon-Thurs. special to me on a Friday. Usually day spas are not very flexible with their specials. Checking out: So, this is one place where the hotel could improve. Since I asked that my bill be broken down in a different way, it took upwards of 10 minutes. The couple next to me also ran into a snag and were there for longer than they wanted. It seems that during a time when every guest is presumably trying to catch a flight, they should have more knowledgeable and quicker staff at the checking out process. All in all, this is a very classy, modern boutique hotel that is in a very good location in downtown Vancouver. I would venture to say that all the action in Vancouver happens within 5 miles (or less) of this hotel. Robson street is within walking distance and Yaletown is 2 stops away on the skytrain.

There was no booze and no entertaining. I only had one spa treatment. I had a city view room (lower priced than harbor view) on the gold concierge level. I was with a large conference and would have checked out the same day I arrived but for the fact that the hotels in the vicinity of the conference were completely booked. At the Airport: The hotel booked transportation from the airport to the hotel. Their contract limo service could not find the hotel. After the second pass where I kept seeing the sign and telling the driver he had driven past it, he finally got me there. Then he did not how to get the doors unlocked and took about six tries as the hotel doorman is desperately trying to get me out. I could not get the door handle to release. That\u2019s for starters. Recommendation for airport transfer to hotel: Make your own reservation for a sedan service. The taxis, unfortunately, are very hit or miss as to their competence. Check into a bus or sky train transfer. Check-in and Lobby Atmosphere: When you walk in the hotel in the late afternoon you are greeted by a loud wall of sound from an off-key singer in the lobby. It is so loud that one can hardly hear what reception is saying. I had to ask reception to repeat several times. It was so loud it hurt my ears. This seems to be the way the hotel runs its PA system. If you book a regular room, you get to go to the reception at the front lobby. If you book a Fairmont Gold room, you get to stand in line at reception at the front lobby and then stand in line for a second time at the Fairmont Gold check-in on the 20th floor. Odd isn\u2019t it? Well, it gets more odd. Recommendation for Check-in: There is nothing you can do to avoid their check-in problems. The cost: When I checked in, the hotel had switched my reservation without my consent to a more expensive room charge. I caught it and my room was changed immediately. The Room: Lights: A computer that fails regularly and has to be re-set even twice a day, controls every light in the room. I was standing in the bathroom one evening and every light in the entire room went out leaving me in pitch darkness. I could not get the lights in the bathroom to completely turn off. The significance of it is that the door to the bathroom is glass. So, the light from the bathroom kept the beds lit up all night. The engineer for the hotel told me that he and his wife were required to stay in the hotel when it first opened. Same thing happened to him. It took him three months to get an answer from the manufacturer of the light system. And that answer doesn\u2019t always work. You have to know the combination of LED\u2019s to hit just right or it won\u2019t go out. The light by the bed: When you want to turn on all the lights in the room-it just won\u2019t work. If you try to turn on the light by itself, the light will turn on and then just turn off by itself!!! Try again! And when a light is off, you cannot see the writing on the led switch plate to determine which of the myriad of buttons will turn on the light. I put a book in front of the LED lights to get the room darker at night and had some ultra-bright LED\u2019s taped over by the engineer. The window does open. But the gasket around the window keeps fresh air from entering the room The slightest sound in the hall could be heard in my room. I could have used more drawer space. The showerhead in the shower keeps sliding out of your hands and is just plain difficult. More noise: Seaplane traffic and the room: This hotel\u2019s premium rooms face the harbor and are only a couple of hundred feet from the water\u2019s edge. Directly across from the rooms is the take-off and landing zone for Canada\u2019s busiest float plane airport and one of the busiest in the world. People commute to their jobs via floatplane. With poorly soundproofed windows and flights taking off from DAWN and landing through dusk, this is not a relaxing place to be let alone get a decent night\u2019s sleep when you have early meetings or want to sleep in on the weekend. Requests for meals: I made requests for meals and found it very difficult to get the hotel to comply. The hotel\u2019s description of their menu items is not complete and were an unhappy surprise to me time after time. For example, the hotel lists on its menu that it has steel cut oatmeal that has brown sugar and raisins on the side. What it does not tell you is that the oatmeal is pre-sweetened and pre-flavored. And even when I requested that the oatmeal be plain, it prepared it with the pre-sweetener and pre-flavoring. I finally had to tell them no pre-sweetener, no pre-flavoring, no milk and prepared with just plain hot water to get \u201cplain oatmeal.\u201d It took several days to work this out with the kitchen. This did not make for happy breakfasts during the first part of my stay. Another example is where the kitchen had written instructions from the chef to not include cheese in any of my orders. The kitchen ignored the chef\u2019s written instructions. When the kitchen will not follow their executive chef\u2019s written instructions, I felt quite helpless in dealing with them myself. I would also like to note that because the hotel made me make all my requests through room service, I had to pay a room service charge plus gratuity for every meal no matter where in the hotel I ate the meal. Transportation: I asked the Gold concierge to not to book me with the same limo service that brought me from the airport. When I needed another sedan and driver, they booked me with the same limo service. The driver was late and could not find the restaurant. When I used the complimentary hotel car service, it was late. Laundry: Don\u2019t believe what is written on the laundry list that your laundry will be back BY 6:00 p.m. mine wasn\u2019t back until 9:00 PM. The laundry department has contracted with an outside service that was NEVER returning laundry BY 6:00 PM unless you paid 50% more for express service. In addition, things that should have been pressed were not pressed. Gold Concierge Service: I was told, with a sneer, by one of the Gold concierges that the reason that the hotel was not operating very well was that the hotel was full of people from my profession. I believe the Gold concierges are inexperienced. ATM Machine: The hotel\u2019s ATM machine accepts very few foreign cards. The one good department in the hotel is the housekeeping that cleans the rooms. The rooms were clean and the staff cleaning the rooms was good. Swimming pool is on the 6th floor and outdoors. It was quite chilly to get out of the heated pool and be in the wind. The pool could be 1-2 degrees warmer. I did not use the hot tub. It was adequate for laps. The other people using the pool were courteous.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cStaying in Vancouver?

(See my posts on two other stops this trip: Blackrock in Ucluelet and Wickanninish in Tofino). Fairmont itself is a terrific property, spanking new as it opened last year for the Olypmpics, with zero apparent wrinkles. The hotel is completely modern yet with classic sensibility so as not to alienate the Four Seasons type. Conciege, front desk and bell staff all great. Special call out to Matthew (of the Concierge team) who I spoke with many times during my \"research:\" he was very helpful, and gave me honest and focused opinions regarding my 3 day jaunt to Vancouver Island. We checked in at 2:30 am (scheduled flight from JFK lands at 1:30 am): front desk and bellman were as alert as mid-day and the surprise platter of fruit and cheese was very welcoming and perfectly fresh. I have stayed at many top hotels and enjoyed many suites: this is among the best. Bathroom has 3 lighting categories: night, spa and groom---none of this leaving a wasteful light on all night in the bathroom, none of this squinting as you apply makeup. E-drapes are brilliant. Furnishings and artwork fit into BC landscape, but are comfy and beautiful. Morning coffee room service (I need my delivery before I can even contemplate my day) was reasonably priced (am used to being robbed at most places, often $20 for one person, here it was about $12 for two) and they threw in delectable pastries. Lobby food very good, tho somehow they cook the salmon in their sushi! Oru is delicious, and Emily (sommelier turned server) is delightful, pleasant and makes the evening feel like you are a friend's home. And when I spent the day walking the town, the hotel sent their driver to pick up my packages from my lunch stop. The IBA (international lawyers) was in town, so hotel was packed to capacity, yet we never felt unattended to or rushed. There were no crowds --just a great vibe in the lobby as the guests toted briefbags and shopping bags and greeted and exchanged cards and smiles. Wonderful environment. We had suite in new west wing --overlooking pool and convention center yet with larger views too, even from 7th floor. Join the the Presidents Club: costs nothing, gets you automatic free Wi Fi and access to upgrades etc. Their properties in Seattle and other locations are wonderful as well. I am a huge fan of this \"chain\" . In a word, this hotel is very user friendly: great location, every amenity and service you want or need, ideal location.

A large patio overlooking the bay and mountains as well as the pool. A pull out sofa in the main living area a king in the bedroom and 2 amazing bathrooms. Perfect classy modern decor.

We stayed in several high end hotels (among them the Opus hotel & Shangri La hotel) and I can guarantee you that the Pacific Rim Fairmont beats them all. Like some of you, I like it to plan my travels in depth, and as such, I always consult websites like Tripadvisor & Kiwicollection, as well as magazines like Conde Nast. To give you an idea, we have stayed in many high end resorts all over the world before, so we are used to luxurious holidays. For all those luxury minded travellers like me, I can reassure you that you cannot go wrong with the Fairmont Pacific Rim, which has opened a couple of months ago. This is what I liked about the hotel : - location : it is next to Canada Place and in walking distance to everything (including the Canada Rail). Vancouver is surprisingly small and you can explore everything on feet. Having said that, the Opus hotel is definatly in a better spot for those looking to stay in a trendy neighboorhood, and the Shangri La hotel is a bit more centrally located. - service : top notch ; the personel is amongst the friendliest I ever encountered in a luxury hotel (but this may be a Vancouver thing as everybody in the city was so kind) - rooms : this was the most splendid room of a city hotel I have ever staid in. It felt like being home away from home. The rooms are oversized, very nicely decorated and lightened. The beds were heavenly. I can recommend everybody to stay in a poolside room : these rooms come with a private, covered balcony that has an openfire as well as table with chairs (to dine outside if you want to). It was so nice to relax there (no matter what weather) before going to sleep. I did visit some other rooms that come with quite a spectaular view, but personally, I prefered the poolside room with balcony and openfire (as the same view that some other rooms have can also be enjoyed from the waterfront). - Pool and hottube : this was genuinly the largest pool we encountered in Vancouver. Hottube was very nice as well. The whole pool area was very nicely done (with cabanas and palm trees). I can also recommend everybody to become a member of the Fairmont Club before arriving in the hotel, because this will give you access to complimentary wireless internet access (which will save you 20 CAN $ a day). Book the rooms in advance or look for specials on the Fairmont website, as there are some very good deals out there. The only thing that I did not like that much was the main lobby. Although luxurious, it felt not very intimate and has the ambiance of a shopping mall or small airport (very loud and crowded).", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holmfirth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUltra modern hotel but a little lacking in warmth.\u201d", "Author": "helen_sheard", "ReviewID": "UR79416080", "Content": "This hotel is state of the art and ultra modern but certainly lacked warmth in our opinion.

She was on the phone for 5 minutes at least without even acknowledging. OK, she probably was helping other customers on the phone, but it was more like a business call. Waited, and waited, and she finally finished and asked me as if I was bothering her busy schedule if I have a question. And her answers were made up with one or two words. I wanted to know if I needed to take a taxi to Aquarium. She said yes. Can I work. Yes. Is it far? Yes. How far? About 40 minutes. Is there a bus? No. It is amazing that the hotel like this can afford to keep her as a staff to inteface the guests, Economy must be good in Vancouver enough to keep the bad staff. With one of the 2 rooms not being ready after the check-in time and this, I complained to the front staff. She was very quickly found another room for us, and the complaint was communicated to the manager. I know the manager tried to contact me but it was my faults not to get back to the manager. The rooms were very nice, quiet, and the TV in the bathroom was the best thing for my son. There were a couple of things that needed to be attended, and they were handled quickly and professionally.

Many of my colleagues are now converts, as well. Great location, down by Coal Harbour, and if you face the harbour, you can get a nice view. My most recent stay, I was on the other side, facing the street, so no view, but I had a nicer room. The electronic lighting system is both good and bad. It's a neat system, when it works... Both rooms I've had in my stays had quirks. Both times, one bedside lamp would flash on and off for 5-10 minutes at a time. This last visit, I had turned all the lights out to sleep, and about 10 minutes into it, one of the bedside lamps started to flash on and off. Just a tad annoying. As well, the vanity lamps in the bathroom mirror were not working, and the Privacy lamp was stuck on, the first morning, but I reported both issues to the front desk and they were repaired before I returned in the evening. The room I had this past stay was quite nice, although lacking a view. It had a walk-in closet, and a massive size bathroom. There was a computer controlled pedestal tub, and two walls were floor to ceiling windows in the bathroom (I never lifted the shades, however, as the windows are not covered with a reflective finish, like you would expect). There was a walk-in shower, and a large vanity. The only thing surprising was that the toilet was positioned at the end of the vanity. Some couples might not appreciate this. My previous stay, although the bathroom was smaller and less elegantly appointed, the toilet was in a separate stall. They have panel of connectors, at the end of the desk, that will allow you to connect anything to the entertainment system. Every type of connector known to exist, is on that panel, including VGA, HDMI, 3.5mm audio, composite, etc. Coupled with the 40\" LCD TV and the surround sound speaker, it's great. Great lobby bar. Always musicians playing. Very cosmo vibe to the whole lobby and reception area. Fairmont's usually use BMW vehicles for hotel shuttles, but one of the BMWs at the Pacific Rim is actually a 750Li. Very nice car to get driven around in (~$120,000). They'll drop you anywhere within the downtown core. As nice as this car is, though, it won't be the most expensive one you see parked out front.

We were so impressed with dinner that we returned the next morning for their buffet style breakfast, so much choice and everything was so fresh and tasty!

I booked a Fairmont property becuase i have stayed at three other Fairmont hotels and loved all of them and I wanted to try this newest one. It turned out to be the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The hotel itself was beautiful. My room was wonderful - super cpmfortable bed, big tv, marble bathroom, huge soaker tub, electronic bathroom mirror with embedded tv screen. I had good food at the lobby loung on two occasions and good drinks. But the best part of the hotel was the service. Right from check-in, which I was early because of a spa appointment, was no problem for them. The desk clerk gave me a short tour of the lobby of the hotel and walked me to the elevator, made sure I knew where everythign was, which I didn't even ask for but made it feel very personalized. Every staff member I passed for the whole two and a half days smiled, greeted me and made me feel like they were there to help. There was poolside bar and food service on the pool deck. And the nightly turndown service was fantastic. There was no detail overlooked. Lights set, soft music turned on, a second tidying of the room, a card with the next day's weather forecast, even a fresh bucket of ice left in the evening without even requesting it, but just in case. It was the best service I have ever experienced and what put it on the top of my list as best place I have ever stayed. I would love to go back again because it was total luxury. There was only one minor issue, and that was with the spa, so not specifically the hotel. I did chose this Fairmont over the other two Fairmont's in downtown Vancouver becuase of the spa. I have been to the spa in the Fairmont Banff springs and its was the best spa i had been too (pure heaven) so I was expecting the same quality here, especially since the hotel itself was even better than banff. I came early hoping to enjoy some of the spa before my treatments as in Banff there are soaking pools, etc. lots to do before and after treament. But there wasn't much. It lacked a spa jacuzzi or hot tub. Instead i went up to the public pool deck. it did have a steam room. There was also construction going on outside the lounge on what i assume will be a spa pool/hot tub, so perhaps when that is done the spa will have more amenities. But i was a little disappointed. Best hotel did not equal best spa. Also, when I booked my appointemnt, one of the services i booked was a facial peel. When i got in the treatment room, the attendant said i coldnt have the peel as my skin had a bit too much sun for a peel. I had been out kayaking for two days prior and the reason for the spa day was relaxing after this physical activity. if they had asked at the time of booking what the purpose of my visit was, I would have told them and they would have been able to tell me that my skin would not be able to have a peel after two days of kakying in the sun. I could have chosen a different more appropriate service. This was just a minor setback, the attendant did a good job of picking something else out at the time and I was still satisfied with the service. But, it could have been avoided with asking what the purpose of the visit was at the booking time, since my sun exposure was planned, and not unexpected. So just two minor disappointments that really only styood out because everything else was so fantastic. I'm sure when the construction is done the spa will be up to the quality of the hotel, and now i know to ask the question myself about a peel. I still hada very relaxing day. My second treament was fabulous, and I would definetly come back again for another experience.

Spa and Gym - This hotel got probably the best spa ever, back in Mar of 2010, the spa is not yet finish, but is usable, it will be very nice once they complete Hotel lobby- at night time, they're a small band playing different type of music, depending on the night of the week, everyone really enjoying them self, and if you're traveling alone or with someone but your company went to bed early, you can always go down to the lobby and enjoy the music, everyone is very friendly. If you visiting Vancouver and want to get the best out of it, this is the hotel for you If you visiting Vancouver and just want to sleep and shower in the hotel, this is not for you, because I promise you, if you stay at this hotel one night, you will not want to leave", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dixon, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPoor security/personel.\u201d", "Author": "RussJohnson", "ReviewID": "UR61982802", "Content": "Our GPS was stolen out of our car while in the hotel valet care.

We were celebrating a recent achievement in her studies and had let the hotel know in advance. We had a wonderful stay from the moment we checked-in to the when we left Vancouver. The service was personal \u2013 staff did many little things to acknowledge our travel preferences \u2013 and rooms were extremely comfortable. This will become the only hotel I stay at in Vancouver when I visit as I believe they have something special going here. Service (5/5): *Our room wasn\u2019t ready when we arrived at 8am but the staff gladly stored our bags and the agent who checked us in said she\u2019d call me when the room was ready (which she did a few hours later). I ran into the same agent the following afternoon and she asked me how my stay was going and referred to me by my name. A small touch but made me feel like a personal guest at the hotel. *Concierge at the hotel was EXCEPTIONAL. I worked with one person in particular before the trip, who asked great questions and followed-up on a timely basis and exceeded our expectations on every level. This concierge added various personal touches throughout our stay. For his service alone, I would rate VPR as 5/5. *The availability of the courtesy vehicles was inconsistent. Of the 4 times I requested the vehicle, I was able to secure a ride 2 times. I\u2019m not sure if they only have 1 car or if there is a shortage of drivers. Rooms (5/5): *We stayed in one of the \u2018signature suites\u2019 which was extremely comfortable and spacious. Room was warm which was great considering we had two blustery days while in Vancouver. As noted above, my wife has allergies to certain scents and cleaners so the staff prepared the room accordingly. Staff cleaned room on both days and also turned down the room in the evening. Overall very clean and well-maintained throughout our stay. *The common area was huge, and included both a sitting area with large flat screen TV, a dining area and two large closets. The balcony had great view of the harbour, Convention Centre, Olympic Cauldron, and the eastern side of Stanley Park. Also very interesting is the Chairman\u2019s Suite which is still being built. It has two levels of floor-to-ceiling windows and I was told the roof of the suite would become an entertaining area for the suite. *The main bathroom had a TV in the mirror which was a great feature that you could use while in the shower or in the tub. Shower had one of those rainfall showerheads which I love. Second bathroom was very large and also had a shower. *Bedroom had a view of the habour and Stanley Park and was very comfortable. Room also has a large flat screen TV, a \u2018Nespresso\u2019 machine that makes decent espresso. *All of the lights were activated by touch pad and had preprogrammed themes although I\u2019m not sure if they were functioning appropriately as the \u2018relax\u2019 and \u2018entertain\u2019 theme seemed to either dim the lights so low you couldn\u2019t see anything or made the room really bright. Restaurants (4/5): *Giovane (Caf\u00e9) \u2013 Enjoyed their fresh pastries, savory scones and well-made coffees. Really nice area to sit in with lots of windows. A bit pricier than local cafes which is typical for hotel cafes. *Oru (Pan-Asian) \u2013 Overall thought it was an authentic Asian restaurant with excellent service. They had a tasting menu with various land animals but they were able to accommodate all of our dietary restrictions. Our favorite dish was the Sake Kasu Sablefish (perfectly cooked) which had a miso glaze (not salty and comforting). Their homemade tofu with mushroom truffle sauce was earthy and light although a bit difficult to eat with a plate and chopsticks \u2013 I\u2019d recommend they serve it with a serving spoon and small bowls so you can \u2018shovel\u2019 the tofu out with your chopsticks. The steamed rainbow trout with ginger/scallions tasted great and was a very generous portion that could easily have fed 4-5 adults. My wife particularly liked the \u2018tanryoku\u2019 cocktail with chili infused vodka, sak\u00e9, giffard ginger, lime, fresh cilantro. *Lobby area \u2013 Did not have drinks or food here although I\u2019d point out the Fazioli piano that played in the evenings \u2013 what a beautiful looking and sounding piano! Location (5/5): *Ideal location downtown and just a few blocks from the Canada Line and Skytrain stations *Across the street from Canada Place and the Convention Centre (where the Olympic Cauldron stood and where you can see the Olympic rings that turned gold when Canada won a gold medal during the Olympics) *Short walk to water and a few minutes by bike to Stanley Park", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cQuite simply, the best hotel I've stayed at in North America...\u201d", "Author": "Gung_ho_in_TO", "ReviewID": "UR60911096", "Content": "The Fairmont Pacific Rim is the best hotel I've had the pleasure of staying at in North America, especially for the value. When I travel it's mostly for business and I usually try to keep the hotel rates reasonable (i.e. <$200/night). I managed to get a grand opening special rate and stayed for 4 nights during the tail end of the para-Olympics. The hotel is new (opened during the Olympics) - the cabbie I had had not heard of the hotel (there's 2 other Fairmonts nearby) so be ready to have the address handy as a precaution. It's downtown on the waterfront - good location. Also, the entrance is off to the side a bit. I travel to China quite a bit and this hotel reminds me a lot of the hotels in China - at a reasonable price. They definitely transferred that model to this hotel. The lobby is very impressive. Very grand, chic and modern. Great fireplace and sleek design. Very nice staff. The room is very spacious. Big flat screen tv. Complimentary internet, water and shoe shine service. Very cool/funky bathroom - separate room for the toilet. Separate shower and tub AND a tv built into the mirror but stands as part of the mirror when it's not on. The decor is modern and very nice. Sliding barn doors were a nice touch too I thought. Safety deposit box in the room but it didn't seem to work (not a deal breaker). Room service is good but they do automatically add a gratuity but that makes it easier, in my opinion. Other amenities: Gym is nice - lots of modern cardio equipment. Ok free weights and machinery. Free bottles of water, free fruit and muffins - again, stuff you'd only see in China it seems. There's a nice bakery/brunch place in the hotel and the main restaurant is supposed to be really good but I didn't have the pleasure of trying it (other than room service). Too often I'm resigned to the fact that I'm spoiled in China and slumming it in N.A. but alas, I finally found a hotel here that offers a true hotel experience.

He handed us off to another gentleman who took us to our room and showed us how everything worked and where the buttons were (remote lights, curtains, coffee maker, TV in the mirror......) The location of the hotel is great. The 2010 Olympic Caldron as directly across the street to the left and Canada Place was directly across the street to the right. The elevators are the fastest that we have ever had in a hotel. The longest we had to wait was approximately 2 seconds, they seemed to anticipate us needing to use them. The rooms are large and comfortable. The hotel just opened in January 2010, so the pool area is not finished yet (it's due to open in June 2010). You may want to ask for a room on the other side of the hotel until the pool is finished, as the workers seemed to start working outside between 7:00 and 7:30 am. I went to the spa and it was great. I decided at the last minute to get a massage, that was around 4:00 pm. I called down and they said that they were all booked up, I said that was fine. About 10 minutes later I received a call from the spa saying that a masseuse said that she would stay to give me my massage. I went directly down and had an awesome 60 minutes massage.

When we requested another room, we had to wait a very long time, and were shown a room in front of an ice machine and close to the elevator, even although we have a preference stated for a quiet room away from elevators and ice machines (both in our President's Club profile and on our reservation). In such circumstances, good hotels normally offer one or two upgrades at little or no charge, just to compensate the guest for the inconvenience. This hotel did offer a minor upgrade, but to another totally unsuitable room. When we asked for a higher upgrade, for which we were willing to partially pay for, we were asked for the full amount of the upgrade. Ultimately, we had to cancel our reservation and move to another hotel. However, it was not until we informed this hotel of our decision that the Assistant Reception Manager came to speak to us, even although he was close by during the previous discussion. Also, we highly recommend that anyone looking for an enjoyable and relaxing stay in a 4 star hotel atmosphere should avoid this hotel, because it certainly does not have a 4 star hotel atmosphere, but rather appears, sounds and feels like a typical business hotel full of convention delegates, with the associated high level of noise and constant bustle and delays in service. Due to this hotel\u2019s extreme proximity the convention centre, the choice of rooms is very limited for individual travellers, due to the common block-booking for conventions.

This past weekend, my hunch was confirmed. It is indeed a hotel for the discerning traveller displaying the utmost taste in design, staff, fare and facilities. Lobby The modern, yet welcoming marble-clad lobby is bright and full of life. Although the design is clean-lined and simple, the lobby is nothing but with its dramatic set of wooden chandeliers, oversized fireplace and custom-made $225,000 Italian piano. There's even a flower shop. Restaurants All the food options you'd need are viewable from the lobby. Oru, the hotel's signature pan-asian restaurant towers above the lobby. Oru's (meaning: to fold) bar provides an excellent perch for drinking, chatting and people watching. The food is excellent, the service personable, yet professional and the environment spacious and airy. The Lobby Bar serves drinks, high tea, appies and fresh seafood. Each drink comes with a trio of olives and nuts. Giovane is an Italian-inspired breakfast, lunch and snack bar. Eat-in or take out. Love the food, love the decor, love the convenience. Staff In addition to its services and offerings, the Fairmont Pacific Rim is attempting to set themselves apart in their high level of service, and it shows. The did all the right things --when things went well and when things were bumpy. For example, the moment we walked in the doors, the doorman asked us if we were checking in, found our name on his daily list and then escorted and introduced us to the front desk agent. Our room was not ready when we checked-in and because it was after the regular check-in time, the front desk agent kindly offered us a drink in the lobby bar while we waited. After 25 mins, our room still wasn't ready she offered us another drink and some food. This was the right, classy thing to do. Because they handled things well, it didn't bother us that our room was a little tardy... Rooms The rooms are contemporary and high-tech. All the bathrooms have TVs embedded into the mirrors, the mattresses are made by Sterns and Foster (same company who supplies the White House) and there is a nespresso pod-like coffee maker. All lighting, electronics and curtains are controlled by electronic panels throughout the room. Tips - The Fairmont Pacific Rim is one of 4 Fairmont properties in the greater vancouver area - There is a high-end grocery store (urban fare) 3 blocks from the hotel - It is across the street from Vancouver's award-winning convention centre - It is across the street from Tourism Vancouver, making it easy to pop-in and ask for directions, recommendations or help - It is a 5-min walk from Vancouver's shopping district (robson street)", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular view, outstanding service, gorgeous property\u201d", "Author": "ASASG_7", "ReviewID": "UR58041171", "Content": "Weekend getaway (Fri - Sun) at the Pacific Rim exceeded expectations.
