The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such. This is a W Hotel wanna-be for the over 40 set. The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities. Designer soap in the bathroom does not a luxury hotel make. This hotel has a very cramped feel. Be warned, the building next door is under construction (which I am sure is temporary). It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment. It really ruined the experience for me. The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable\u201d", "Author": "lcb47", "ReviewID": "UR128138264", "Content": "A friend and I (females in our early 20's) stayed at the Joule on the night of the 7th April. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. Check in: staff were friendly and efficient and very happy to provide recommendations for activites/meals in the local area. Room: we stayed in a Deluxe room with two double beds. The room was immaculately clean, modern and very spacious. The view left somewhat to be desired but we weren't there to look out the window. There was a very large shower but no bath. A point to note: there was no door separating the bathroom from the bedroom, instead there was a large pull-across curtain which acted almost as a room divider. There was a separate cubicle with door for the toilet. This didn't bother us too much but it was a bit of a strange arrangement, particular when the room isn't set up for couples. The beds were large and very comfortable. Pool: The pool was wonderful. There were plenty of towels and comfortable seating available and the staff couldn't do enough to help. The service was great and drinks not eye-wateringly priced. Transport: The hotel provided a courtesy car which was available to take us for dinner. The restaurant that was recommended to us for dinner was excellent but very pricey (make sure to check before accepting that this is what you're looking for). The hotel also arranged a car to take us to the airport early in the morning, which charged the same as the cabs' flat rate from the airport to downtown.

Every hotel should be so fortunate to have a go-to -man as personable and professional as Myron. He set the tone and the bar for the rest of the staff and they, too, exceeded my expectations. The room was on the 7th floor and I was quite pleased. I was not disturbed at all by any noise from the construction project. The bedroom could be closed off from the sitting area which included a sofa, bar area and flat screen T.V. The furnishings were upscale and comfortable.

It seemed gimmicky rather than classy. I usually stay in the SMU area, but this time my business was in downtown Dallas, so I chose between the Joule and the nearby Adolphus. Some reviews said the rooms at the Adolphus need renovation, so I chose the Joule. Unfortunately, the Joule seems to be one of those hotels that strive to be trendy rather than aiming for something more important. Very low light in the elevators, whose walls are decorated with jazzed-up prints of what at first glance appear to be photographs of bats or extraterrestrials but upon closer examination turn out to be deer. There is not much light in the guest rooms either; even after I had figured out the modernistic multi-setting light buttons I couldn't get them bright enough to see very well. I'm pretty sure this is intentional. And one of the signs leading to the pool says \"Poule\". As in many hotels that are funky and proud of it, there was not enough attention to the fundamentals of customer care. I had asked for a quiet room on a high floor, and although I did get a high floor my room was directly across from the elevator and my window overlooked the construction site where the hotel is apparently building a new wing. Construction starts at 7 a.m. This wasn't a problem for me because I had early meetings both days, but most luxury hotels would hold off until a bit later in the morning. And my wake-up call the first morning came 30 minutes late. (When I asked what had happened, the young lady apologized.) There's an exercise room with good equipment but not enough of it. At 5 p.m. there were a couple of guests waiting for others to finish on the three treadmills. And there is a partial set of Nautilus-style weight machines, somewhat fewer than in most high-end hotels and omitting several basic exercises. It wasn't all bad. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and most of the staff -- particularly the housekeeping staff -- were courteous and efficient. I liked the Bulgari shampoo and the chocolates on my pillow. So if self-consciously high-tech hotels are your style, you'll probably like the Joule.

Was quikcly escorted with my bag to the front desk where they already had my reservation information pulled up and had started my check in. Had booked a Deluxe room and was automatically upraded to a Grand Deluxe at check in (hotel was not too busy it seemed on this particular wekened). After finishing check in, bellman already had my lugagge ready to go and an elevator waiting. ROOM Room was very spacious and well laid out. I liked how the working area was seperate from the bedroom so i didnt have to stare at all my work materials, etc while relaxing/watching tv etc. Amenities in teh room were very modern, multiple light dimmers, BOSE ipod player with remote, digital thermostat (2) and great new flat screen TV. Washroom area was well designed and spacious with seperate toilet area which is always nice. Shower was wonderful with 2 options, rain and wand. Decor was very modern and reminded me of an upscale W hotel but with a more refined and muted color palette. Bulgari amenities were a plus and always plenty of soft fluffy towels which is always nice! SERVICE Staff really made this hotel stand out that extra bit. They greated our group each morning and remembered all of our names, even with 9 of us! Used their in house car service (escalade) to go for a quick 5 minute errand. Driver was quite an interesting character and made the ride enjoyable. Escalade was new and in top shape. F&B At both at the Charlie Palmer restaurant and room service. Room service was quick and food was quite good. On par with other 4-5* hotels I have stayed out. The Charlie Palmer restaurant is what really stood out. I ate alone the first night as my colleagues arrived the next day. I called the concierge to ask for a reservation and they took care of it quickly. When I arrived they were ready with a nice table for me and greeted me by name. Restaurant was above attentive and i could tell were trying to keep me company by chatting/etc. Food was above fantastic (although you will pay).

Our first room was called a Demi Joule, what a mistake. We are Starwood members so I asked for an upgrade which normally I do not have to ask, but they said they were fully booked and that's the room I booked so that's what you get, but said they would upgrade us the next day. Now I knew it was 212 sq ft but I did not know that half of the square feet was bathroom. It has a round bed, my husband is over six feet tall so has to sleep in the middle of the bed or his feet hang over the edge, He has a seven hour meeting scheduled the next morning so needs his sleep. I am sleeping to his right with my feet hanging over the end of the bed and cannot get out because there are drawers in the way so to get out I have crawl over the end of the bed. We go to sleep, at six in the morning construction starts below our room, with sewer gases, yelling construction workers and beeping trucks. There is nothing on their website informing you that there is construction going on at this hotel and nothing is mentioned when we checked in and the windows do not fit correctly and are impossible to close all the way. Our room is right over the construction site, I booked this room over a month ago and I thought being a starwood member meant something, I find a small note on the desk in the morning saying that construction starts at seven. My husband decides to iron his shirt before his meeting, once the ironing board is up I cannot get to the bathroom. And this is a $300 room. The room is tacky all it needs is a pole for pole dancing. My husband goes off to his meeting with lack of sleep. They move us around noon. Nicer room the size of a normal hotel room. The windows in this room do not close correctly either, but we are not over the construction site, so cannot wait for a good night sleep. WRONG! We are awaken by motorcycle races at one in the morning. I call down to the front desk and ask \"Don't you have police in this State?\" I am informed it is not against the law to have motorcycle races at this time of the morning. My husband has another long day of meetings with no sleep. When he gets back we both work on the windows and finally after he stands on the ledge of the window and puts all his weight on windows gets them to close all the way, I wonder how they expect a woman to do this. The bathrooms, who ever designed them should be shot, I know the dim light looks cool, but it would be nice to be able to shave or put makeup on in the morning. The mirror is on one side and the sink on the other side of the counter, so if you are a man trying to shave you have to keep walking from mirror to sink. I believe charging $15-$20 for a glass of wine that has been opened for over 24 hours (not gassed) and not offering to open you a new bottle is a rip off. This is a Charlie Palmer restaurant and he should know better.

They finally corrected that charge, but now 2 days later they have charged a separate additional charge of $121! So I called AGAIN to ask why, they said it was for mini bar. We went out for dinner and then straight to sleep, then left early in morning bc construction noise woke us up, so we didn't have time to eat anything from mini bar.

I have not experienced that before, he was very patient, kind and accomodating. He also went on an errand for me as I was running out of time to get ready for a wedding. Bryson also has great customer service and I enjoyed visiting with Bryson on the front sidewalk several times. Nikki went out of her way to accomadate getting us some food Unfortunately she did not have enough pull to get what we needed. I suggest you take a look at the managment position as the pool ran out of Chardoney on Saturday night before 10pm and no one offered to go get us some more. I find that very unproffessional as a manager not to be stocked or offer to go get what the customer is requesting. Bryce, Bryson and Nikki were willing to do whatever it took to take care of us, they just had their hands tied and could only do so much. I think the Joule has a ways to go when it comes to the managers making the decisions. I do think it is a lovely hotel but I would like to mention the lighting in the rooms was terrible.

He and I made the most of it and enjoyed our time together but for the price and all the hype, we left really wanting more. The Joule came up short on just about everything. We had multiple issues and many of the issues were further compounded by more issues. None of them in and of themselves were worthy of writing a bad review but when you add them all together, it's pretty tragic. ISSUE #1A - My husband had arranged for our favorite brand of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room the second night, which was our anniversary. It was supposed to be a surprise...and it showed up the first night. We didn't drink it, they admitted it was their mistake. $165 surprise ruined. ISSUE #1B - They sent the bottle of champagne the second night but it showed up TWICE on our bill. Got them to take it off the bill at check out time... but really? ISSUE #2 - The concierge who my husband contacted weeks in advance of our stay made a reservation for us at the in-house restaurant, Charlie Palmer's, for our first night. My husband explained that it was a special weekend, we had friends meeting us, and we really wanted a booth. We were one of the only people in the restaurant and they seated us at THE worst table in the entire place. We asked to be moved to a corner booth - and it was perfect. The whole time my poor husband was apologizing. I guess this isn't necessarily the hotel's fault but since we had the concierge make the reservation at the hotel restaurant and there were specific requests, someone should be responsible. Not sure who they were holding the table for. Nobody sat down after us. Dinner was good but it was awfully quiet in there. ISSUE #2B - Same concierge made reservations for us at Abacus for Saturday night. Again, the restaurant tried to give us a crappy table despite husband's specific instructions to concierge that we wanted a booth in the main dining room. We waited for an hour for a good table even though we had a limo waiting on the clock. Again, not sure whose fault this is but with this being the second restaurant that said concierge was supposed to request a booth, and both times they tried to seat us at a bad table, this problem has one thing in common, the concierge. Dinner was fabulous and our waiter more than made up for the miscommunication. ISSUE #3 - We were told we needed to reserve bottle service at the PM Night Club on Thursday night if we thought we might ever want to sit down in the club. Shame on us for letting them talk us into $350 bottle service. The place was dead! We showed up at 10:30 and they sent us to a different club down the street and told us to come back after midnight if we wanted there to be more people. We did and it was still dead despite a birthday party for a 21 year old kid from SMU who had rented the Penthouse. Nice enough kid. We should have passed on the bottle service but we were told that it would pick up. Plus, we had friends with us and didn't want to make a big deal about it. The Penthouse is gorgeous. ISSUE #3B - When the bill at PM Lounge showed up it was $550 which was $200 more than we were told. Also, they didn't have Grey Goose vodka which is what we had pre-ordered. Not a big deal but when you spend that kind of money, you'd like to think things like a very standard bottle of alcohol wouldn't be an issue. Again, we had friends with us and didn't want to make a scene. Thought we could work it out in the morning. When we went to pay for the $550 tab, we asked them to put it on our hotel bill but they couldn't because that function was not working. No biggee. We paid with a credit card. Again, didn't want to make a scene and honestly just wanted to get to bed. ISSUE #3C - In the morning, my husband spoke to our concierge, told him that we were not happy for being talked into bottle service but even worse, that we were over charged. He said he would look into it and 48 hours later still did not have an answer. It took my husband bringing it to the attention of the Front Office Manager on Sunday at check out to have it addressed. We were told it would be corrected. We received a $100 for our trouble which was nice...but really? ISSUE #4 - We utilized the in-house car two times. We had a car parked in valet ($30/night) but thought the in-house car would be more convenient. We were told to call 10 minutes out which we did. Both Friday night at dinner and Saturday at lunch we waited over 30 minutes for the car to pick us up after we called. ISSUE #5 - The lighting in the room, mainly the bathroom and dressing area, is unacceptable. We had read other Trip Advisor members complain about this and we both thought they were being overly critical. How bad can lighting be in hotel of this caliber? The only light that was good for anything was in the closet so I had to get dressed and do my makeup in the closet! One other thing on the room...we had room 813 which every employee in the hotel went out of their way to tell us was really special because it had a balcony. Well, this balcony was covered with bird [--] that looked like it had been there since prohibition. So much for a nice breakfast on the terrace. There's more but honestly this is depressing me knowing how much we paid to the hotel ($3,000) and how excited we were about this trip. The one shining light at the whole place was Todd at the Poule bar. He was fabulous and absolutely perfect at his job! I would hire him in a second.

Even with it being first come, first serve, the service only had about a 10 minute wait on a Saturday night. The room details were well thought out. Although the room we were in was a bit small, they had really nice decor and details that you would not see a Marriott or a Hilton, IMHO. The photos were interesting, the bathrooms unique, and the bed was really comfortable. It was essentially a \"funky\" modern look that suited us great. The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!). Valet was pricey, but much preferred over worrying about my car in one of the nearby parking lots overnight.

She was amazing, she ensured that we were at ease with the accommodations...she even sent up complimentary milk and cookies for our four year old daughter. Later in the evening we went up to the Penthouse for the birthday party and were greeted by Virginia with the head of security, I could have talked to her all night! She was so friendly and attentive! When we checked out the next day, she even came out with us as we waited and we talked some more! Back to the Penthouse...what a view of Dallas, both at night with all the lights and then again in the morning when we met for breakfast. Two balconies offer two views.

The hotel is contemporary yet luxurious and comfortable, it is hip but it doesn't feel like a nightclub with beds (like the W's tend to). All the staff members were very warm, friendly and helpful from the front desk to the phone operators, pool staff, etc. I stayed in a Grand Deluxe room (upgraded for SPG Gold which was very nice). This room has a great layout, a separate desk area in the hallway, a separate water closer, walk in shower with rain showerhead and a second adjustable showerhead, big sink area and a window. The bedroom, which is separated by a curtain has a big king size bed, 2 nightstands, a bench at the end of the bed, chair with ottoman, and large built-in furniture unit with drawers, the LCD TV and minibar. The room decor was contemporary but comfortable, the room was quiet and was bright and airy with the curtains open and dark with closed. The lights have a low, medium and high setting and can be controlled individually or with a master switch by the bed and entry. There are also several lamps and built in reading lights over the bed, all nice touches. There is a Bose wave radio with iPod dock. There is twice daily housekeeping which is another really nice touch. Plenty of towels in the room, etc. Room service breakfast has a limited menu but the food items are high quality. The coffee comes with a whole pot which is nice and the OJ is fresh. My only room service complaint is the ambiguous 19% \"service charge\", is this gratuity that goes to the waiter, does it go to the hotel? If you're going to auto-grat the bill should either be totaled and you just sign it or the bottom should should sub-total, grat, additional grat (that you can fill in or not) and total. I don't like feeling like I'm being tricked into double-tipping or being stingy, this should be fixed. The pool is a great amenity, it was great to hang out there Saturday afternoon, get a break from the concrete jungle. They were playing good music and had the misters going. There are several high quality Frontgate pool floats and the pool hanging over the edge of the hotel is pretty crazy. The pool service was great, the pool food menu is really good. My only gripe about the pool they have reconfigured it since the photos, there are now dining tables between the bar and the pool, promoting food service, and less lounge chairs for guests. They also reserve all or most of the good chairs for high-tab guests. They do let you use them before the reservation holders arrive so it isn't terrible, I'd like to see more first come first service chairs though, the pool is an amenity for the hotel guests. The hotel did reverse the old policy of allowing non-guests to pay to use the pool which helps a lot. The Charlie Palmer restaurant downstairs is one of the best in Dallas, it's well worth it! Parking is very expensive at $27 a day, the meters are enforced 7AM-6PM every day at $1.50 an hour (quarters only, come on Dallas this isn't 1995 get card meters) but there are lots of private lots that are no more than $5 a day and there are two city lots which is $2 a day on the weekend. It's up to you if you want the convenience of valet, or if you want to save $20 a day. I think the Joule is one of the best hotels in Dallas, especially for the price. I will be staying here again and I highly recommend it.

The front desk service was excellent, I'm an SPG gold member and was upgraded from a demi joule room to a deluxe. A deluxe is pretty much the standard room at this hotel, nothing special in regards to size, but bigger than the demi. The dual head shower is great, but not tub like the joule suites. I went down to the front desk later asking if a suite was available for me to pay to upgrade to, but they were all taken. The front desk manager was sorry about this and we later found a handwritten note from her with a voucher for in room breakfast for my wife and I, a very nice plus for us because we were staying there for valentines day. The concierge was also able to get us dinner reservations at a very small but very popular sushi restaurant in the area, this was a big plus because I knew this restaurant wouldn't take reservations from me when I called them directly (parties of 6 or more only) and there was already a long wait when we arrived. Now the bad; This hotel is located downtown, so unless you want to park on the street overnight and wake up at 7am to feed quarters into the meters (tickets are given 7 days a week) you have to find a self pay/self park lot nearby or valet with the hotel. There weren't many parking lots I could see within reasonable walking distance, so I chose to valet with the hotel. BIG MISTAKE. The next morning when the valet pulled up our car I noteced he had rolled down the drivers side window all the way, which was strange because it was kind of chilly. When I got into my car I realized why, whoever parked the car for us the night before, sat in our car and smoked a cigarette, didn't even try to hide it as he just left the butt in the ashtray and ashes on the console. This is NOT cool, first of all we don't smoke so this was very obvious and second my wife has asthma and my 2 year old rides in my car all the time. AND to top it off, the guy also rifled through my glovebox, found a half box of chocolates from a movie dat we had the other night, ate them and then left the empty box on the floor. WTF? The chocolates were just regular old chocolates, but the fact that he went through our stuff, utterly and completely unprofessional. Needless to say I immediately went back in and let the front desk know what happened and so far everything looks like it's going to be taken care of by the hotel and the valet company. He comped us for the parking and put me in touch with the valet manager (evidently this hotel outsurces to an independent valet company). I've coordinated with the valet manager and my dealership to get the car in for a full detail and odor removal process, the valet company will be paying for all of it. I haven't gotten the car cleaned yet, but hopefully they hold up their end and actually pay for it. So while the hotel is great, I really would advise against valeting with them, which makes staying at this hotel pretty difficult since there's no nearby parking lots. And to top it all off, I checked my credit card statement today and found that they charged me for some minibar items that we supposedly took. This is complete c*&p because we declined a minibar key when we checked into the hotel and we definitely didn't take anything from it. I've called them and they're going to refund the charges, but it's supposed to take 7-10 business days. All in all, the hotel is great, the service we received directly from the hotel was definitely great, but the lack of trustworthy parking in the area and all the dramal with the valet and my bill really killed the experience. I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you're not going to have a car and you watch your credit card statements closely.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cthe experience of a life time !\u201d", "Author": "nmart455", "ReviewID": "UR96756732", "Content": "The Staff Was amazing and a special staff member name shrecka clark was so helpfull they made or stay super special, an i thought it was just us but as i was walking out an saw people checking in the hotel everyone was welcome the same way, as royalty ! an all the staff welcome you an said hello , an how are you doing , wow ! great Experience!", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cwell taken care of\u201d", "Author": "jefcars", "ReviewID": "UR96673235", "Content": "The staff here is great.

I am a Hyatt Diamond but only a SPG Gold member. I knew I wasn't going to get the same benefits at this hotel as the benefits I get when visiting Hyatt, but I was still a little disappointed with this hotel. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. Check-in was fine. I was told I was \"upgraded\" to a Deluxe King room. I'm not sure how this was an upgrade since the only category of room lower is the Demi-Joule room, and I also originally booked a Deluxe King, but I didn't press it. I found the room to have a nice design, although having the desk in an alcove instead of in the same room as the TV was not ideal. Also, I am not a fan of pillow top mattresses. I find them too soft and that was the case here. But that's not a criticism of this hotel, since I find that at many hotels. I did like the iPod docking station and I liked the Remede toiletries. The shower was nice too. And while the sink looked nice, it is entirely impractical since the bowl shape of it made water splash all over the counter and your clothes if you weren't careful about turning on the water not too high. I like hotels with shuttle services around town and the shuttle service here is in an Escalade. However, I found that the front desk had a severe inability to give an accurate timeline as to when it was available. This culminated in me waiting 40 min for the shuttle to come pick me up when I was told 10-15 min. I could have taken a cab, but I was in an area where I would have had to call for one, and I thought that would take too long. In retrospect, maybe that's what I should have done. I also found the service to be a little amateurish. I know they were a little short-staffed due to the holiday, but the hotel was also less than 50% full (from what I was told.) The shuttle service was my biggest issue. But I also frequently had to call services multiple times because no one picked up the phone the first time. The restaurant also closed 1/2 an hour early one night, which made me upset (probably because it was the same night I had to wait 40 min for the house car to pick me up.) I voiced my complaints and was given free breakfast, which was nice. At any rate, I probably won't be back here. Service issues aside, I didn't like the rooms, because I found them a bit cramped. I come to Dallas often for work, and will pick somewhere else next time.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Breckenridge, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding service and clever thinking!\u201d", "Author": "dsogrady", "ReviewID": "UR88034931", "Content": "Modern and comfortable guestrooms.

It's a beautiful property that is very poorly managed, and the staff seems unable (and unwilling) to handle the hotel when it is crowded. The last time we stayed our room was never cleaned. We complained twice, and even left the room so housekeeping could come in and they still never came.

Yesterday we tried to check in at 4:30 in the afternoon (check in is at 3:00) and were told that our room wasn't ready and had to wait an hour to get into our room, which forced us to cancel our dinner reservations. Once there, we found an ironing board, but no iron and when we asked to have one delivered we were told that they weren't sure when they would be able to locate one. The staff is indifferent at best, and they don't even pretend to try to solve your problem. Additionally, they have made their pool a \"scene\" for twenty-somethings who are not guests of the hotel, which means that guests get to ride in the elevator with drunk kids wearing nothing but wet swim suits, and there is never room for guests to enjoy the pool.

It was almost as if the hotel lobby and elevators were wearing cologne and it was a good scent but I am a little sensitive to scents so it was a little strong for me but was nice when walking in from the street. 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small. Didn't really bother us because it was laid out well but if we had been there a number of days and spent them in the room, it would have gotten cramped. Back to the good things. The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W. The pool at the Joule is amazing and is actually where they film the outdoor bar scenes for ABC's The Deep End which is the show is set in LA but is actually filmed in Dallas. Charlie Palmer (the Joule's in house restaurant) is whole other raving review waiting to happen. The food was amazing! Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.

Along with four other friends, I planned a getaway for a friend who has breast cancer and has recently gone through a particularly grueling surgery. I contacted the hotel just one day prior to her arrival to ask if there was something they could do to make her stay more special. Arliscia Harris contacted me immediately (within 15 minutes) and took this on as her personal project. She told me that she would do everything she could to make my friend's stay extraordinary and had already taken the liberty of upgrading her to their deluxe two story loft suite. Arliscia was in frequent contact with me over the next 24 hours, and about an hour before my friend Michelle checked in on Friday, she called me to tell me everything they had planned for her at the Joule. When she checked in, the staff greeted her by name, and everyone was wearing pink ribbon pins to celebrate her fight against breast cancer. She was in complete shock and almost started to cry immediately when they told her they were doing it just for her. When she arrived in her room, there was a beautiful bouquet of pink tulips in a gorgeous vase waiting for her (that she could take home and continue to enjoy). Arliscia and the rest of the staff had also arranged for Michelle and a friend to eat dinner in the fabulous Charlie Palmer's restaurant, where the staff was also wearing pink ribbon pins just for her. When I spoke with Michelle this morning she commented over and over how amazing the staff was at the Joule. She said that she never needed a single thing, and that everytime she would look up someone was already there to take care of her. As I am writing this, I have a combination of tears in my eyes and chills up my spine thinking of how the staff at the Joule reached out to a stranger and treated her like a queen. Amazing.

This hotel really reminded me of a W Hotel. I have stayed in some of the Starwood luxury collection hotels (e.g. St. Regis) and this does NOT compare to that in any way. If you like traditional luxury, this is not the hotel for you. Try one of the Rosewood hotels in town instead. The Joule was very trendy and scene-y. We went out to the pool and found no place to sit in the sun, so we ended up sitting at the bar. The place was packed with the young tatooed and siliconed variety (it felt like Vegas). We noticed that the bartenders friends were hanging out - clearly not guests at the hotel - which was slightly irritating, but would have been more so if I had payed to stay here. It isn't right when guests cant get a seat by the pool because local friends have filled the place up. If you do go up to the pool, skip the mojitos. They were awful. More like sprite and rum. The valet service was lackluster. They were slow and it is just a bad set up because there really isn't a pull through, you just pull over on the side of the street. In the valets defense, there was a large party innundating them all at once, so this could have contributed to the below average service. But at $27/day, you'd think they'd be able to hire additional staff. If you like a trendy scene, like to do the club thing, then this place might be for you.

I went there for lunch to enjoy their advertised 'lobster corndogs'. I asked the maitre'd if it could be served at the pool and they said 'yes', but it would have to be ordered from the pool. My friend and I went to the 10th floor pool deck and ordered the corndogs along with 2 expensive drinks. After 30 minutes, we ordered 2 more expensive drinks. Finally, after 1 hr of waiting, we cancelled the order for the 'lobster corndogs' and left. We were told some lame excuse that they didn't know what was going on - 'normally they are so quick about delivering the food'. For a 4-star hotel, it has 1-star service.

Then I went up to bar to close tab again just standing there it took ten mins, then the manager of the pool and club pm was there and was very friendly offered us free drinks and help but I rejected I no longer wanted to be around that. This hotel does not have ice machines you have to call for ice well we called so we could have our own drink in room well lets say it NEVER CAME!!!! That evening we went down to the club PM which is in hotel very unfriendly and it took us for ever to get in and if your staying at hotel it is suppose to not be a problem to get in YEAH RIGHT!!!! ok Saturday we ate at Charlie Palmers resturant in hotel food was good but service was so bad I could get better service at MC Donalds than this supper bad.

There is not a club lounge as there is at some Lux Collection properties. The rooms are well appointed as would be expected at a hotel that wants to charge $250/night. We had a package that included a bottle of champagne (Charlie Palmer sparkling) and also included breakfast for two with complimentary parking. There is a very nice work out room on the 9th floor, and pool on the 10th floor. The pool area is quite small and has a hopping bar. Minors are prohibited from the pool area after 6 pm because it's a scene, especially on the weekends. If you are into clubbing, this is a good place to have a drink. They also have a night club downstairs called PM that is also very popular. The elevators are not locked off or monitored in the evenings, so anyone can jump on and ride up to a floor of their choosing whether they are staying in the property or not. The rooms on the 10th floor can be inconvenienced by the noise of people in the hallways going to the pool bar on 10. I would not recommend anyone stay on this floor. The lobby is very nice and we had a couple glasses of wine while getting hit on by two older women who had flown in from Anchorage to attend an Eric Clapton concert. Not exactly what you would normally find in the lobby of a Luxury Collection hotel, but kind of fun none the less. The hotel restaurant is Charlie Palmer and while we didn't care to eat a steak, it has received excellent reviews in the Dallas press and I'm sure is top notch. We thought the staffing was a little untrained. They tried hard, but it's definitely not a 5 star experience. I had a problem at the desk when reviewing my bill and while the gal helping me got everything taken care of, some buttinskee from the restaurant was interjecting his comments about why I had a tax and gratuity added to my bill for a \"complimentary\" breakfast. He was a little over the top, but I'm sure he'll not be there long with his demeanor. Furthermore, the room service breakfast was not acceptable we didn't say anything but it really wasn't that good. So so at best. Had we paid for it and it wasn't included in the inflated package price we paid, I would have quickly called and asked that the food be re-cooked and brought up. The presentation was plain, very plain and it took way to long to set it up once they got it to the room. All in all, it's a modern trendy boutique hotel, well appointed as you would expect at a Luxury Collection property, but it is definitely geared to a younger party crowd that would enjoy the hip modern vibe of the rooms and wouldn't care about so-so service, especially when they are getting loaded at the poolside bar. We normally stay at another property in downtown Dallas with impeccable service and always on the Gold floor where there are complimentary food presentations throughout the day, private check-in and an honor bar. We pay $139 at that hotel which is far less than the Joule and with incredible rooms that were just redone last year even though it's of a more traditional design, so we won't stay again at the Joule, but it was an interesting experience and our only real observation was the service level and quality just wasn't quite up to snuff with the staff. If you get an absolutely ROCK bottom price for the Joule it might be worth a stay, but otherwise there are other alternatives close by with impeccable standards and service. I'm a Platinum SPG member so I'm in and out of a lot of Starwood Properties and while this was entertaining for a night, I would not have wanted to stay here longer than I did.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cOff Key\u201d", "Author": "Travelgirl8008", "ReviewID": "UR32526602", "Content": "Cons: Service is terrible!! Maybe I just had a bad experience but I was throughly disappointed in this hotel. It seemed as if they had the \"summer staff\" on duty. The valet just stood right next to me while I struggled with my luggage. He did not offer to help in any way. Once I was at the desk, I still was not offered any help with getting all my luggage to my room. That evening, I placed my room service order on my door well before the requested time of midnight. I only ordered a pot of coffee for 7am. After waiting 45 minutes, I finally opened my door and realized they didn't even pick up the card. It was still hanging on the door handle. After calling down to the desk, they did not even give a simple apology. Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an \"upscale\" hotel.

The hotel was wonderful but more than the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the service was impeccable. I first found the Joule online and wanted to stay there just from the photos on the main Web site page. It just looked amazing. I called to make a reservation and was helped by one of the kindest men ever. He took down all my information and even made sure we had a great room with a view. He completely made me feel at ease and even went to the extent of trying to get our dinner reservations out of the way so we would not have to worry about it when we got to Dallas. I cannot remember his name \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but he was fantastic. My boyfriend called up earlier on in the week and told Katie, a concierge, it was our anniversary. We wanted to go to the Byron Nelson golf tournament and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really want to drive. She mentioned she might have a contact who could take us to the golf event. She lined up the driver and it was perfect. The driver was also one of the nicest men ever \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was lovely. For my anniversary gift, Katie set up for us to have a massage even though you guys do not actually have a spa area. She told us just to be ready in our robes and someone would come to get us in our room. The masseuses were running late \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it did not matter. The robes at the Joule are to die for. I was already relaxed and we were in no rush. However, the heads up was given to us by a very nice woman on the phone and she also asked if we needed anything else. It was quiet when we walked into the makeshift \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and smelled wonderfully and I literally had one of the best massages I have ever had. It was so relaxing. I was in heaven. What a wonderful anniversary gift! The man who consistently brought our room service was hilarious. He was funny and helpful and even ensured I had all the items I had ordered before he left. The coffee was wonderful, but more so, we thought the burger we got from room service and the Caesar salad was better than a restaurant served items. It was just great. The shower was refreshing and the hair dryer was the best I have ever used. I can assure you the next time we come to Dallas, you will be our home away from home. Please find out who helped me make my reservation and thank them. Tell Katie she truly made my anniversary weekend a dream come true. Tell our room service man he was great and very gracious to bring us everything we needed and have Katie pass along our thanks to the driver from Friday. Thank you again for having us at the Joule. You have a wonderful hotel and it is gorgeous from the inside out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but what will truly bring guests back is your service and attitude towards the customer. I felt as if I was right at home and smiles were abundant. Three things out of the ordinary that we did not like was the area where you check in. We were a bit confused when walking in but found our way back to the back. A sign or someone walking you to the desk might be nice. The second was there were no hooks to hang our towels. I am all about saving the Earth and preventing the staff from washing my towels each time they clean our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there was no place for me to hang my towel. Thirdly, I would love for one hotel to step up and offer free Internet in the rooms. We are at a time where I do not think staying in an upper class hotel such as the Joule should also require me to pay $15-$25 to use the Internet for 24 hours in my room. Either include this within the rate for the room or go above and beyond and offer it for free. You could steal a ton of business from not only hotels such as Doubletree, the W and Westin hotels but all other upscale hotels. Each of my friends and I are waiting for one hotel to offer this amenity and then we will be exclusive to them for our stays. Yet, no one has stepped up to the plate to do so. I ask the Joule start the free Internet craze and increase your room occupancy tenfold.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama City Beach", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel In Dallas!\u201d", "Author": "baypoint1", "ReviewID": "UR31677459", "Content": "I was born and raised in Dallas and this hotel is the new Mansion on Turtle Creek.

Check in staff was extremely courteous and actually escorted me to the elevators (instead of saying \"turn left, then right...\" as the front deks often does). The front deks area is not huge, but has a farily open seating and meeting place. The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42\" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room. The bed was very comfy. Everything was clean and well maintained. The bath and toilet were divided into two separate rooms, and the sink area was separate. This can be useful for couples staying in the room. There was a complimentary bottle of water, and toiletries were top notch. There was a nice collection of magazines in a rack next to the toilet bowl! Internet cost the usual $12 to $14 a day. Just one downside. The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.

I've stayed there twice now - once in November, once in December. Both experiences have been among my top experiences at any hotel. The first time I was in an upgraded room, and the second time I stayed in a room that was more of a suite, with a sitting area and jacuzzi tub. Both rooms were a joy to stay in -- immaculate decor, extensive light dimmers throughout, $200+ professional hair dryers (the nicest I've ever used in a hotel), complimentary water bottles in the room, rain shower heads, unique coffee table-type books to read in each room and in the lobby, an umbrella for guests to use in each room, etc. It was too cold to swim in the pool or drink at the bar at the pool, but this area looks like it would be a major draw in the warm months. The gym was by far the cleanest, biggest, and most well equipped hotel gym I've ever visited (minus the spa gyms in Vegas hotels -- not really comparable). Charlie Palmer is a home run restaurant, with a hopping bar scene on weekends, fabulous dining fare, and an exceptional breakfast menu. With only minor exceptions, the service was top-notch and went beyond our expectations. Once we had to wait longer than acceptable (30 minutes) on a car to come out of valet parking (other guests who called for their cars later than we did got their cars before us). On the positive side, though, we were greeted by name throughout our stay, assisted with dining reservations, and treated exceptionally well in all other interactions. Hotel staff dress well in pin-striped suits and other dressy professional wear and seem to take pride in their jobs. The downtown part of Dallas where the hotel is located is enjoying a bit of a renaissance, it appears, with more businesses opening but still some empty storefronts. Neiman Marcus is less than a block from the hotel, and several restaurants are in that same block. The Sunday brunch at Iron Cactus was better than expected (and a great deal at around $14 a person, I think it was), and we ate a pricey but excellent foodie lunch at the Dallas Fish Market (less than a block from the hotel) and LOVED it.

Also there is 2 PCs for internet usage, should you want. The very friendly receptionist was welcoming, greeted us and took us up to our room. She showed us around our room, we had been upgraded.
