{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The dirtyest hotel I ever seen!!!! Me and my fend were in this hotel only one night on the end of March 2008, but it made on us bad mood for many days. I have never been disappointed of any hotel before, as of Anna hotel! The last renovation was, probably 100 or even 1000 years ago, furniture is old and dirty, behind the bed - dirtyness. Bed linen, bathroom was full of hairs, room was smelling very bad, bathroom was very hard smelling of clorine, but it didn't helps - we were choosed not to use shower, because it was very very dirty! The fridge in the room could even become Oscar prize for the dirtyness! We paid for breakfast, but after being in such circumstances we were afraid to eat anything in this dirtyness!Personal is lazy, but friendly...Please chose this hotel only if you your life is very boring and you need to get a hard shock!", "Date": "Mar 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR367354744", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "kanaliha"}, {"Content": "Not a good hotel for tourists I picked this hotel based on price and location. The price was great! (40 euros/night for two people) The location was not what I thought it was. Having not researched the location very well, I thought the hotel was onthe way from downtown Frankfurt to the airport--its not. Its in a suburb of the city near the Messe (unless you have a reason to go to the Messe, this isn't really helpful). Its also not really near train station or a bus stop on a convient line--we hauled our luggage at least a mile from the S-Bahn station  were hot  sweaty by the time we got there.Location aside, its a nice hotel, and more than worth the price. We had a comfortable and clean room on the first floor, with a private bath. Breakfast was included, the usual German breakfast buffet, with cold cuts of meat, cold cereal, breads, toast, coffee, tea, juice, etc. The shower left a lot to be desired in terms of water pressure, but the bathroom was bigger than most other European bathrooms for this price range. The furnishings were a little worn but all in all, it was not bad for the price. We did get two single beds though, which is odd for a couple traveling together, but no big deal.Just not a good location for someone who wants to see the center of the city and needs to be near the airport.", "Date": "Jul 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR764140560", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "phoxy03"}, {"Content": "Machen Sie einen gro\u813den Bogen um das Anna-Hotel!!!!!   showReview(21730344, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR569693029", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "pimpipimpi"}, {"Content": "Preiswert , aber dreckig!!!   showReview(20692381, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR527299055", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "sabbeltussi"}, {"Content": "Dreckig, Personal unfreundlich, Handwerkerpension, nicht f\u7709r Gesch\u76f2ftsleute zu e   showReview(11235806, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR599676129", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Jens_T"}, {"Content": "Das Hotel lag nicht so zentral...   showReview(13397820, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 13, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR850450937", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d231133-r14569744-Anna_Hotel-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "231133", "Price": "$77"}}
