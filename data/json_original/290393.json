{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Quite a find. As I was visiting my god daughter who is a student in Berlin I required bed and breakfast only preferably near to her own apartment which was in Charlottenburg. I did have the advantage of her knowledge of the area and she was able to visit in person before booking on my behalf. hotel is placed very well as metro goes direct to city centre and one can therefore access all the city very quickly. This means you get to stay in a less noisy and expensive area but can be amongst the city life in five minutes. Having said that, the hotel is on a very busy main road but the room I had was on the front and double glazed. OK for me this time as the weather was foul but usually I prefer to have a window open and not too sure how this would affect a light sleeper!! There are a number of rooms to the back of the building and some at the upper level on the side. There is a lift.Breakfast was excellent. The usual continental, choice of all teas, coffee, fruit juicesall the cooked meats, cheeses fruit, yoghurt, smoked salmon, sausages, boiled eggsetc. etc. served from 7 till ll am which I thought was very generous of them.No bar, no restaurant no fridge in room but that didnt bother me at all. pleased with room which had obviously been recently re decorated bathroom was super clean (shower only no bath- I prefer) hair dryer plenty of shelf space and crisp white towels electric point and mirror a bonus for the hair equipment and make up!!! Good value for money, thoroughly recommend it, would stay again.", "Date": "May 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR531282142", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Time Travellers' Wife"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d290393-r5226968-Hotel_Aster-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "290393", "Price": "$120"}}
