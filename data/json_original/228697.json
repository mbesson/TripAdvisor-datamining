Overall I enjoyed my stay here and any complaints I have are typical for Paris/French customer service. First, location wise, this hotel is great at least for me and where my meetings were. Like any place in Paris, it's near several Metro stops and you can get around fairly easily via Metro which is very easy to navigate. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. I arrived late in the morning fresh off a red-eye and was able to check in early, which I was thankful for. My room was on the 4th floor facing the street which had nice views and it wasn't too loud to sleep, although I am a heavy sleeper (and was overall exhausted from the time change and working round the clock). The room was typical of Parisian hotels - small but relative to some other Paris hotels I've stayed in, it was laid out well and didn't feel cramped. As a solo traveler, it was comfortable and enough room. If I were traveling with another person, I can see how it can easily feel cramped, especially in terms of the bathroom. It's small and it's proximity to the bedroom means no privacy for the person in the bathroom if the other person is in the room. There was a desk where I could easily work although it would have been nice if it were a bit larger to accommodate my laptop and files, etc. The bathroom was typically small but at least it was modern and updated. The shower was also typical - you run the shower and the water spills onto the floor. I have seen this style shower in every Paris hotel I've been in and have resigned myself to the fact that either as an American I am doing something wrong or it's normal for the water to splash onto the floor. The bed was comfortable although the detergent they used for the sheets had a weird smell but it was not overwhelming or unbearable. I paid for the expedited/business wi-fi which was expensive but necessary to do my work. I ordered the late night room service one night which was a nightmare. It was supposed to arrive within 20 minutes but didn't come for an hour. The selection was already limited and then when I called several items were unavailable. When my food arrived, it wasn't even what I ordered but by that time I was so hungry I just took it. I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and overall it was comfortable and convenient for my needs.

The hotel has quite an ultra modern reception area, with internet access that's housed in what looked like a pod from Space Odyssey! The staff were just so friendly, and thankfully their English was a lot better than my French! Our room had a balcony overlooking Rue Lafayette which was just brilliant - I could stand out there watching the world go by. The rooms aren't the biggest, but they have everything you need, and if you want tea or coffee, a complimentary tray was available simply by calling reception. Television, good sized wardrobe and storage space, tastefully designed (including a set of the trademark Hotel Jules lips attached to the wall - a souvenir set can be purchased at reception). Bathroom was a good size, with a brilliant shower, great for waking up in the morning, after an evening drinking too much French wine! I have to admit that we never had breakfast at the hotel (it was included but we were never hungry first thing, and preferred to head out and do some sigh-seeing, and grab something when we did start feeling hungry), so I can't comment on the breakfast or dining room facilities. There was a funky little bar just off the reception area - monochrome colours with cool armchairs to relax in. There were also some tables and chairs set outside the bar, ideal for having a drink and watching the world go by. There's a metro stop about 50yards from the hotel door, which was ideal as well. The hotel offers a booking service for some of the tourist attractions, and they have a good knowledge for recommending where to go for a nice meal. They stored out luggage for the whole day when we checked out, which allowed us to have a last wander around the City of Lights.

The hotel had a nice stylish interior - seeing the bar first, before the reception, isn't a bad thing either. The staff were reasonably friendly and very efficient. The tiny lift (3 or 4 with luggage max) seemed old and I did think would be overwhelmed, but I never had to wait long for it. My room (516) seems only a year or so old. The room is comfortable enough for the rate in central Paris: the bed was large and very, very comfortable, with crisp sheets and firm mattress. The bathroom was also very new, shiny, with very good quality toiletries - things like the shower cubicle not leaking at all, and having plentiful, instant hot water, were welcome details that you would expect but don't always find in some hotels. Another hitn of the boutique nature of the hotel comes in the form of ceiling-mounted projector light whose sole purpose is to illuminate a 'lips' statue on the wall. As for food - you wouldn't expect to eat in in a boutique hotel, but I was late back one night and tried the room service, ordering Chicken Teriyaki with Rice, and Fruit Salad. Since they have no restaurant, I didn't expect much - perhaps that they would use an order-out service, and I'd get a moped-delivered plastic container, as I have elsewhere. Au contraire... 25 minutes later, I had a full tray with stylish crockery delivered by a hotel staff member. The portions were small - as I've come to expect from France - but very, very good quality, which I would be happy to receive in a good restaurant, and filling enough. Hoping for a bread roll on the side, I received a full bread basket and butter. Probably the best room service i\"ve had in a non-5* hotel, and it wasn't hideously expensive either (Eu24 including a coke). It's not an achingly stylish or absolutely luxurious boutique hotel - the desk is just barely large enough for my laptop if I move the TV, the decor is a little understated - but any cut corners are only cut very very slightly, and all the important things (clean, very good bed, very good shower) are there. I can also confirm as other reviews, that the rooms are slient - walls must be thick, and despite the main road outside, closing the balcony doors completely silences the traffic noise. One strongly negative comment is the 'gym'. I thought this was a little much to hope for in a central Paris boutique hotel, but held out hope.. which was then crushed. The 'fitness centre' is actually their smallest hotel room (it even has a number - 109) - with the single bed removed, and a second-hand Lifefitness treadmill and cycle in its place. And that's it. No weights, mat - or even space for them. Being a hotel room, it does have a bathroom and TV - and the WiFi/mobile phone signals reach there, if you want to use your PDA while you exercise. However... to be fair, the machines do also work perfectly, which is a lot more than can be said for some similar hotels that claim to have a gym, and then turn out to have a few '70s relics verging on the dangeous. If they could have the room opposite as a weights room, with a couple of decent machines and some dumbells, that would help a lot. They should also post the gym photos on their website so that travellers at least don't book on what is otherwise a false promise. The 'free internet' is not the same kind as, say, Radisson Free internet. What you get is a 24-hour login on their Swisscom hotspot, which is limited to 128kbps/200MB total use. It's fine for email/web browsing, but painful for YouTube/Video, or downloads. For that, you have to pay Swisscom directly - Eu22 for 24 hours!! That gets you a steady 1Mbps connection for the period. Swisscom are the most expensive out there, but again, I would have to admit it's an intelligent choice by Hotel Jules: you're not really going to hit the max daily limit (not at those speeds!), and it'll do for email/Facebook and your iphone. If you really need high speeds then you have to pay extra - which is fair enough, at least it's an option. Overall - I would recommend the Jules. It's not hugely outstanding, but it is a quite stylish hotel that, while it doesn't have any specific outstanding points or advantages, has been intelligently put together, and gets all the important points right.", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "bsbruce", "Title": "\u201cI had to cancel - had a Paris pass delivered to the hotel - and it has disappeared\u201d", "Author": "bsbruce", "ReviewID": "UR85891928", "Content": "I had to cancel my reservation a few days prior to my scheduled arrival due to a family emergency.

We choose Hotel Jules because of good reviews on Tripadvisor. We landed on CDG airport and took the RER in to the city center (as I always do) before changing to the metro. We used Le Peletrier metro station and it was very close to the hotel - great! However, the metro line for this station has \"Chatelet/Les Halles\" as a junction, and it is (in my opinion) the worst junction in Paris. It`s huge, and this means you have to go up and down stairs and through endless corridors before you reach the plattform you want. We were sweating when we arrived at the hotel. The hotel has late check-in (3 pm) and there was no chance of getting our room early, but I knew this beforehand. We used the bathroom belonging to the hotel restaurant to get cleaned up and it worked out OK. The woman at the desk was very friendly (wish I had caught her name so I could have given her extra credit here) and took care of our luggage in a locked room while we were out. The room itself was quite small, but I`ve stayed in smaller rooms in Paris. No problem. Good, clean bathroom with a good shower (but no tub). The toileteries were not very good, but we had brought our own, so no big deal. Very good beds! Good breakfast buffet, BUT not worth the cost. We got the definate impression from one of the reseptionists that it was included in our rate, and so we ate breakfast at the hotel. Had I known how expensive it was, I would just have chosen one of the many great caf\u00e9s in the area. My key card stopped working, and the reception was not the most efficient. It delayed us for 30 minutes the morning we were leaving. All in all: The hotel is very good, clean. I`d say it it a very safe choice. The location isn`t perfect if you like to wander the streets in more central parts of the city. It`s quite good if you like the shopping malls, though. Galerie Lafayette is near by. Tip: Get off the RER from the airport at Gare du Nord and just take a taxi to the hotel. Not to expensive and much easier than the junction downtown. Allow some extra time at check-out in case there is a line at the front desk. Eat your breakfast somewhere else. Got a pretty good deal at Expedia.

The fact that the hotel website has great photos and looks quite quirky was a bonus with a twelve year old daughter who's keen on design. The reviews on Tripadvisor also helped - as did a special internet 3-night deal direct with the hotel. We went straight from the Eurostar to the hotel to drop off our luggage (check in is at 3pm) and then had time to find our bearings. Remember to buy a Carnet of 10 bus / Metro tickets in the newspaper kiosk at the station when you arrive (avoiding the huge queues downstairs at the Metro machines / counters) - by the way, the buses are brilliant and the drivers really helpful - an unexpected bonus when you're not sure what number to catch! Our room (300) was a 2 room suite - the sofa bed was made up ready for our daughter, who was really pleased to have her own plasma TV, and the clever travel trunk which contained the mini fridge and coffee making machine. The bedroom had a proper king sized bed and great pillows (no need to ask for more to stack 3 together then!) and the bathroom was a treat: his and hers sinks, deep bath with hand held shower, and shower cubicle with large rainshower fixed head & hand held fitting (+ bathrobes and slippers). I could go on and on... the windows actually open, the air con worked really well, thick curtains to block out the light. If you are looking for any negatives - no view (apart from another quirky idea - one wall of the interior courtyard was tiled with a 'vine design' to add a bit of greenery!), teeny-weeny lift (but then again it only services the few rooms situated in this odd triangular section of the building). Top this all off with Benjamin the barman (who showed us to our room, brought our cases up, opened the front door to guests, mixes a mean cocktail etc!) and David on reception who was so friendly you felt perfectly able to ask any questions (not from the school of snobbish, standoffish desk staff at all).

The hotel staff called the shop and asked them to stay open for a few minutes so I could get some flowers for my girlfriend. Check in is at 3 and there's no early check in. The staff was very helpful and safeguarded our luggage as we had lunch at one of the nearby restaurants. Ask to have a room on the 5th floor as you will have a balcony. You will be on the street side, and the street noise is not bad at night. Hotel security is good. At night, you must use your key card to get into the hotel and you always have to use the key card for the elevator, also there's a safe in the room which is a plus. The room was very clean but everything about this hotel is small, but large enough for two people having a romantic trip. I recommend this place for a couple looking for a relatively cheap romantic long weekend and I'll definitely stay here again. I used TripAdvisor to pick this hotel. I used bookings.com to book this room. For additional information, I\u2019d recommend getting a Frommer\u2019s Travel Guide and a laminated City Center Street Map of Paris, both purchased off of Amazon.com for about $25.

We got a deal for a half price standard room (normally 320 Euros; we paid 150) as we booked quite far in advance. On first impression we were really happy - the front desk staff were really helpful, we were able to check in early, and the lobby / cocktail bar as you walk in are great. However, our room was TINY! Even at the discounted rate we felt it was really overpriced, and the standard of decor was quite poor given the cost. I would have been really annoyed and definitely complained had we paid any more (to be honest we were a little tempted to complain anyway). Having said that, the location is really good - 10 minute walk to the big department stores (Galleries Lafayette, Printemps etc), and some good restaurants / bars in the area. Also close to Gare Du Nord (20 minute walk if you can cope with it with cases), and 5 minutes to the Metro station. The hotel provide you with a little guide to the area which has suggestions for food / shopping / drinks, some of which we tried & we were happy we did! After long days on our feet, we did sleep well in the room - good air con (we needed it, it was really hot!) and the bed was comfortable, if a little small - we were told it was a queen, but it was a double (which would be fine if you are used to it, but we weren't!). We did try breakfast at the hotel on our first morning, but didn't again. Hours are good (6.30am - 10.30am every day), but it was a pretty poor selection for a 4 star hotel - tinned fruits, yoghurt, breads, and a very small selection of hot stuff. Better to go to a local cafe! Overall, we would recommend Hotel Jules, if only for the location.

We arrived at Gard du Nord on Eurostar from London and the hotel was close to the station. We tried walking there but I suggest that you take a short bus ride to the Hotel, along Rue La Fayette. As we enter the lobby, I was delighted at the small but lovely decor at the lobby area (very retro). The service staff were very helpful, spoke good english and checking-in was a breeze. We found out that there was a metro station and a 24-hr MacDonald's nearby, so it was great for a quick night supper if you're hungry. The lift was slow and small but since it is a small hotel, we usually get the lift all to ourselves. We were given a corner room at the top level and it was very lovely, clean with very modern decor. If you're looking for a nice, cozy and clean room, this is definitely the place. The hotel doesn't have much facilities like swimming pool, gym or spa. It has a nice little lounge area at the lobby and breakfast is served in a room at the basement. There's also an internet station but they charge quite a lot for the usage. Breakfast was great, they serve American breakfast (sausages, ham, eggs) with warm croissant and choice of Hot Chocolate, Cappucino or Tea.

In my room, the lip artwork on the wall and a leather mirror in the bathroom gives you a feeling of this quirky design which I absolutely loved. There are restaurants right across the street and directly around the corner from the hotel is Ed, a small grocery store where you can stock up on snacks and inexpensive but wonderful French wine.

The buffet was always stocked well and the food always fresh. It was a great way to start each day! There is a small and welcoming bar right in the lobby of the hotel that I did not get any drinks at, however, the bartender was friendly and gladly opened my bottles of wine that I purchased around the corner at Ed.

Plus points include having a great location, in between montmartre and the louvre. Other than lift noise the room (409) was quiet. The deco is young, modern and fun and the rooms were spotless every day. Breakfast was tasty but frustrating. Our first experience on Sunday morning was chaotic. All free tables had piles of leftover breakfast that we ended up clearing one ourselves.

I've been to Paris 11 or 12 times and if you want to stay in a central area at a reasonable cost Hotel Jules is a good candidate. Its not cheap at all, but if you search for Paris you'll find that its not out of line with other hotels of its class. Most hotel rooms in central Paris are small and Jules is no exception. The room on this visit was smaller than the first but was still fine. It does get tight with two people and three weeks worth of luggage, but thats the way it is and you need to prepare yourself for that or stay are a more grand hotel (for more money of course). The rooms are extremely clean and the bathroom was spotless. Plenty of thick, clean towels are provided and changed daily. The room we stayed in had only a shower but many rooms also have a bathtub. The picture that I've included of the bathroom was taken from the balcony. Yes, the bathroom has a balcony although I'm not sure anyone would actually use it. The room is well appointed with a small refigerator/mini-bar that had enough free room to put your own drinks in. The room had a large closet with plenty of storage as well as a safe. A small flat screen TV had a couple of English channels (CNN and Eurosport I think). The rooms are modern but are showing a sight bit of wear. There are scuff marks here and there as well as small wallpaper rips. Nothing horrible or unexpected. The beds are great. Two single beds beside each other which works for couples or singles. Rooms either face the street or a courtyard. On both occasions I've chosen a street view and wasn't disappointed. I've read reviews of people complaining about noise and I would have to disagree. If the windows are closed it is very acceptable. Its not silent, but then again you are in a major city. Unlike my last vist, breakfast was included in the room rate. This is my only real disapointment with the hotel. The breakfast room is small and VERY busy (its in the basement). The food is just fine (bread, eggs, fruit etc) but its such a crowded space it was difficult to get anything. We went down earlier the second day but it was just as crowded so we left. Another HUGE warning that was my own fault is the telephone. I had to call my partner from the room one day and used the automated credit card option on the phone. I followed the instructions but nothing was mention about charges or rates. A 45 second call to a North American cell phone was charged to my AMEX - $48. I called the phone company when I got my bill and they said there was a 5 minute minimum, overseas charge, etc. They did credit me $17, but still a very expensive lesson. Another annoyance that you will find in most French hotels - Internet usage. You'll see signs that say \"Free WiFi\". Most people will assume that means free Internet. Nope. It means you can connect to the hotels WiFi service for free and then pay for Internet usage. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Everyone that I encountered spoke perfect English. The area is great if you are driving or walking. The hotel does not have parking but there are places to park within a few minutes walk (very expensive) and you are right between two Metro stations. Just north of the hotel is a great shopping area where you can find all sorts of food shops and restaurants. You are also a ten minute walk from the Opera and the major department stores. As long as their rates stay reasonable, Hotel Jules will get my business.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "SethC", "ReviewID": "UR33785108", "Content": "Stayed here for one night on a quick trip to Paris.

We searched for hotels on tripadvisor and felt like the vast majority of the places we read about had extremely negative reviews (room is tiny, dirty, staff rude, won't provide towels, etc), so we were a bit anxious about booking a place. We found hotel jules and the reviews seemed fairly favorable, and the price was right ( ~165 a night). We definitely made the right decision. The hotel is very modern, clean and tourist friendly. The staff went out of their way to help us, even though we barely speak any french ( we did make an effort though). The room was small by american standards, but it provided all that we needed. Any it truly was smoke free. The bathroom was modern and clean and we had a nice view out the front of the building towards the city. They have a computer available for internet access, which we found very helpful as we were traveling with out cell phones. They also have a small room with a treadmill and exercise bike. I wouldn't call it a gym, but it was nice to be able to do something aerobic for a few minutes each day. The computer/internet did charge by the minute (a fair price) and the gym was free. The hotel also served a free breakfast each day. I'm not sure if it was free for everyone or just part of the deal we signed up for when we booked. The breakfast was more than adequate. Plenty of choices, hot and cold. We're not extremely picky when it comes to free food. I figured if we didn't like it, we'd just go somwhere else. The location is great too. We walked almost everywhere once we figured out there were a few different routes we could take. The louvre was about a 15-20 minute walk. The opera area was about a 10 minute walk. I think we even walked to notre dame, although that was a bit further. There are plenty of bars and restaurants in the area, so there was always something to do, and it felt very safe. So, all in all, I would definitely stay here again if we were heading back to paris, especially knowing there are a lot of places which may not live up to expectations. One other tip, non-hotel related. While the metro/subway is a very good way to get around, we had some problems with it. First, the machine for purchasing tickets does not take paper cash, only the euro coins. Which, when we exchanged money or went to the ATM, we basically only received cash. So, you'll have to ask for the coins specifically. Also, while the ticket machine did take credit card, it only works with the cards that have a chip built into it. I think its a new european standard that hasn't quite caught on in the states yet. None of my cards, nor my fiance's have a chip in them, thus they didn't work. It was extremely frustrating for a while trying to figure out why our cards wouldn't work at the metro stations. At first we just thought it was a bad machine, but after it kept happening everywhere, we knew it was us. Luckily a very helpful passer-by stopped to ask if we needed help and filled us in on the whole chip thing.

This was our first trip to Europe and to Paris, and neither of us spoke fluent French. I booked the hotel through Travelocity in a hotel+flight package. For a 3-star hotel, this place gave us everything we needed. Our room was a simple twin contemporary (non-smoking) on the 5th floor with a balcony, facing Rue Lafayette. This afforded us a great view of the top of the Eiffel Tower from a distance, especially when the tower was lit up at night. Anyways, below is a list (positives and negatives) about this hotel. I'll begin with the negatives because it's shorter. \"Minor\" Negatives: - Small room and small bathroom = The room is a standard European size, so it is smaller than an American hotel room. Fortunately for us, we were already prepared for the small size, so it wasn't a shocker. - Heater making noise = The heater in our room was loud; it sounded like a shower was turned on next door. After the first few nights, we stopped using it because the room remained warm as long as the balcony doors were shut. - Reception/lobby area undergoing renovations = Work occurred during the day, but we were rarely around to see it; by the time we got back from our Paris explorations, it would be night time. - Small elevator = Compared to an American-sized elevator, Hotel Jules' single elevator was small. However, it did have enough room to comfortably fit 4 people, or 2 people with luggage. Positives: - Location = The hotel is in a nicer area of Rue Lafayette. The street is not overly crowded/congested, and neither is it a truly quiet area. There is a small restaurant across the hotel with a green canopy (unfortunately we did not have a chance to eat there). There is also a small grocery store at the first left intersection from the hotel. Best of all, the hotel is located between 2 metro stops, Le Peletier and Cadet, both about a 1 minute walk away. Also the 2 big department stores, Galeries Lafayette and Au Printemps, are close by (just 5-10 minutes walk away). - \"New\" look = The hotel seems to be undergoing the last phases of its renovations to give it a more modern/contemporary look. - Very friendly and helpful staff = The front desk employees were very friendly throughout our stay. They wore business professional attire, spoke English, and were available 24 hours. They also accomodated our needs: a) David checked us in promptly when we arrived, and also helped us in translating some French phrases. b) One time we called down for some soap, and they delivered it to our room shortly after. c) When we needed a taxi to pick us up at the hotel and take us to the airport early the next morning, a front desk employee offered to call the taxi and make arrangements for us. Next day, check-out was a quick process, and the taxi showed up on time (6:00 in the early morning). - Guest room was always clean. The housekeeper came everyday. - The beds were simply AMAZING! = The sheets were so comfortable and soft we wanted to take them home with us. The beds were totally at fault for our lateness in getting up every morning. - Room amenities = There is an in-room safe, and a tea/coffee tray. The bathroom also had a strong hairdryer, which I desperately needed. The TV mostly had French channels, but there were also 2 English channels (CNN and BBC) and a channel for Spanish, German and Italian. - Balcony doors = These doors acted as a noise buffer to the street noise below us. Also, when shut, they kept the room warm. - Efficient check-out = Took less than 5 minutes. Since we didn't incur any extra charges during our stay, all I had to pay at check-out was the city tax (1 Euro per person per night). Overall, our stay at Hotel Jules was wonderful.

It's closest metro station will get you to the Louvre/Palais Royal within 5 minutes also. The hotel itself has been completely refurbished and is very tastefully decorated in a contemporary style throughout. Works are still going on in the reception area and there was a faint odour of fresh paint everywhere. As we visited the hotel with a view to organising a function in Paris we were able to inspect a standard room, a superior room, a deluxe room and a suite. The suite and the deluxe room were significantly larger than the other rooms and nicely finished - smart, spotless and stylish. The standard and superior rooms are similarly decorated but very small - no more than 4-5 paces square. Just enough room for a double bed and a dressing table. The bathrooms are brand new but also small. I would recommend insisting on a room overlooking the Rue Lafayette (the front of the hotel) and the internal view from the corridors is horrible. The only real problems with the hotel are easily solved by the management and astonishing that they still exist. They are that the shower room we occupied in our superior room was devoid of a working extractor fan and so fogged up instantly. The newly fitted shower enclosure was fine but there was no internal shelf upon which to place soap/shampoo etc. which meant having to repeatedly exit the enclosure to retrieve the essentials. The shower itself was unable to dispense more than a drizzle and the temperature of the water was totally uncontrollable, instantly changing from arctic to nuclear without warning. My wife's main gripe, however, was that the room's designer had completely neglected to install a mirror of any shape or size leaving her desperate and needing even longer to beautify herself. All in all this is a good choice of hotel for a flying visit to Paris and it's good value - we paid just over \u00a3100 per night. The best aspect is the fact that is is new and shiny as opposed to many other Parisien budget hotels. The undoubted style and design however is offset by the room size and absence of some basic facilities. Hopefully the hotel management will read this and attend to the niggles. If they do then this hotel would be very high on my list of places to stay in Paris.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "demondmoy", "Title": "\u201cCharming yet small hotel\u201d", "Author": "demondmoy", "ReviewID": "UR20357295", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Jules for only two days. I extended my trip for two extra days beyond my other hotel booking (Marriot rive gauche hotel). The Jules is very charming and has the whole \"modern/minimalist decor thing\" going. Its in a very nice yet touristy area. The rates are reasonable and the staff is accommodating. The staff changed my room and even combined my 2 twin beds into a large king bed. The hotel has a nice view as the windows open up entirely and some rooms have a walk out balcony. there are many cafes and pharmacies within 2 block walking distance.
