San diego trolley station is just 5 min walk away. The hotel lobby is good and the front desk staff is very polite with big smiles on their faces. We requested a fridge and a microwave and they were provided. The rooms were very clean and modern. The bath room was fully updated with granite counter.They have a roof top patio that provides very good views of down town, marina and petco park. The historical buildings on 5th street are good to see. Cons Check in 15 min late. The room was not ready, Service in the restaurant slow for breakfast. There were only two servers for a lots of people. Continental breakfast buffet in the restaurant was way better then the breakfast in the concierge lounge. I do not know why. Concierge lounge had limited choices and no omellete or pan cake option. For me this was difficult to understand.

I'm sorry to say even with the do not disturb sign out most properties still knock to ask if I want service. I'm happy to say San Diego Marriott Gaslamp Quarter did not.

Again, I have to compare this to other stays - I normally have to set the A/C way down to keep the room cool but this location the A/C worked great!! The curtains would close completely and totally blacked out the room. The room was well appointed with a large comfortable bed, chair & ottoman plus a desk that is actually set up for work.

We had a very hard time finding a desirable hotel that would allow us to book only one night (a Saturday). Most other hotels that we tried insisted on a 2 or 3 night minimum (on a weekend). So we ended up at the Marriott Gaslamp Quarter. A nice hotel, right next to Petco Park. We were assigned to a high floor and the view was decent, facing east. The room itself was nothing fantastic, but suitable for our last night in San Diego. The location gave us an opportunity to check out the Gaslamp Quarter and the waterfront between the convention center and the USS Midway museum. So as far as location is concerned, not bad at all. We arranged a breakfast special which included a buffet breakfast as part of the room charge, which was perfect for us. The hotel has a well known roof-top outdoor bar, but we didn't have time to check it out. The business center was available for airline web check-in, so we were able to book our seats and print our boarding passes. Wireless internet was not included in the room price, which for me is a huge disappointment. You'll know from any other of my hotel reviews that as far as I'm concerned, with hotel prices being what they are, I don't see why they can't just include Wi-Fi for free. The beds were comfortable. I noticed that because of the location, it is possible you will hear the sounds of druken revellers in the streets below in the wee hours of the morning. But although I did hear some commotion (we opened our window), it wasn't so bad that we were unable to sleep. Your mileage may vary. Overall, not a bad hotel, in a great location.

I am so happy they choose this hotel because it offered some great ammenities during our time in San Diego. First of all, the hotel was very nice to my friend, the Bride, and was always asking her if there was anything she needed, etc. They were also nice enough to offer my Husband and I early check -in as I needed to be there early one day for wedding festivities. Our room was very nice and had a great view of the water and petco park. The location of the hotel is nice and within walking distance of lots of places downtown. The only two downsides were that there was no pool or spa, and from our room we could hear the nighclub on the roof. If I was here for a random weekend, that noise would most certainly bother me, so if you don't like pounding music till after 2am, you might want to ask for a room far away from the nightclub. The hotel was the place for the rehearsal dinner, which I thought was good. The appetizers were tasty and the service was great. All in all, I would go back to this hotel for sure.

It clearly is a bait and switch where you are charged a lower amount for the room so people book a stay at the hotel and then the hotel gets the money back by charging an outrageous parking fee. I guess you could charge $20 a night to stay at the hotel but charge you $100 a night to park. I am not going to walk to San Diego, so I have to have a car.

We loved the location, but there are several reasons we'll stay elsewhere next time. First the good: * Location - Only 1 block From the southern end of the 5th street Gaslamp district. Loads of restaurants & bars nearby and within walking distance of Balboa park (a bit of a walk, so likely not good for small children or older folk). * Cleanliness - Very clean & reliable maid svc. * Toffee - Big ol' bowl at reception that my gf couldn't get enough of. * French Toast - Mighty tasty French toast that comes w/ an otherwise average bfast buffet. However, skip the buffet unless it is included w/ your room rate. You can find much better for the $18 they otherwise charge. * View - We had a 17th floor room that had a decent view of the water and the unexpected fireworks on Fri, Sat & Sun nights. However, if on a lower floor, your view is likely to be of the neighboring building's windows (i.e. keep your drapes closed). Now for the bad: * Mattress - It was one of the oldest, most uncomfortable ones I've slept on. The mattress & springs were ancient & they simply tried to improve it w/ a 1\" think mattress pad. Needless to say, it didn't work & made the bed not only too soft, but also lumpy. * Toilet - Mot only was the bathroom quite small, but the toilet flush was extrely loud - both from within the room and from neighboring rooms (both on the same floor & above). Both my gf & I were awoken several times by it. There is absolutely no way to sleep through it, especially if your partner needs to use it in the middle of the night. * Age - While marriott does a good job of keeping it updated, it is getting older. From the tiny bathrooms to the thin walls, the infrastructure can't be changed. * Valet - Luckily parking was included, otherwise it would've been something like $34/night. Plus, they left my car door ajar for 2+ nights such that my battery was completely dead, required a jump to leave (which took 45+ minutes), and had to be replaced when I returned to LA. Not reasonable for a battery/car that is less than 2.5 yes old. * Management - My gf and I were a little bored & wanted to leave a day early to spend a night in Temecula. I'm a Mariott Elite who spends 30-40 nights a year in Mariott hotels. When I asked if it would be a problem tocheck out a night early, the day manager went into contract mode and stated the hotel's non-negotiable $150 early departure fee. When I simply asked if there was any way this could be waived for a good customer, she pulled out my signature on the reservation form, pointed to the fine print and said \"see you signed in agreement of this fee when you checked in\". I was taken aback as I was not being the least bit argumentative and ws simply asking if there was leeway. She couldn't care less and was quite rude. Amyway, the hotel is decent, but there are MANY, MANY, MANY (did I say many?) more options in the area. I'll most definitely try another (non-Mariott property) next time.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kamloops, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMarriott Gaslamp...great location, lots of walking!\u201d", "Author": "JForster154932", "ReviewID": "UR114945895", "Content": "the Marriott is nice and rooms are large, ask for ocean and \"Petco\" view, on the even side.

There was only one other party seated at the same time. The Gaslamp is one of San Diego's hip areas but it is not for everyone. Plenty of restaurants and bars, which is both a plus and a minus. There are tons of options but there were a lot of drunk people as well as pretty aggressive homeless people around.

It's one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at recently. I was very impressed with the room. Everything seemed just a touch above the usual quality you'd expect at this price level. We were on the 16th floor in a room very close to the elevators but didn't notice any noise. The bathroom was beautifully designed. They really made perfect use of a rather small area, with lovely tile walls and floor, and the bathroom amenities included fluffy sponges and bath gel in addition to the usual shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap set. Very impressive. We didn't eat at the hotel (except for snagging Tootsie Rolls and taffy from the big bowls at the reception desk every time we went in or out) but had a big room service breakfast which was well worth the $18 each that it cost. Again, very impressive, and a good value considering this was not at all something that just got scraped out of a can or a cereal box. I like their late checkout time (noon) and we were also impressed that when we checked out, our car was already waiting for us at the valet stand without having to ask for it. The location is excellent, right in the Gaslamp Quarter so there are about a hundred restaurants of every imaginable type within a few minutes' walk.

When I couldn't find the TV remote, they brought up another remote within 15 minutes. When a waiter delivered a room service dinner one evening, we got into an interesting conversation about how one of the chefs on the TV show \"Hell's Kitchen\" used to work at the Marriott. Since I was travelling alone and missing home, it meant a lot that this very busy employee took a couple of minutes out of his day to make me feel welcome, and I made sure to eat in the restaurant after our conversation. The room was always clean, and on a night I worked very late, I returned to find my covers turned down and cookies left by the bed. It was a small touch. but meant a lot after a 17 hour work day. Some drawbacks - as mentioned in other reviews - there is no pool. Walls are paper thin. I could hear people talking at normal volume in the hall as if they were sitting in my room, which made it difficult to sleep with people passing up and down the hall. The sound of the elevator bells could be heard clearly in my room, and I was a few doors away from the elevators.

The food was good at the restaurant, but there was not much of a selection. The hotel would be great for short visits, especially for those attending conventions or going to baseball games.

The Altitude Lounge is not open until 5pm Monday -Friday but is a great place to sit on a warm chair on a sunny day and enjoy the view. The rooms have updated furniture, Nice bathrooms (a little small) and great bath products! Hotel Staff is nice and eager to please. Elevators are lightning fast.

We were on the 19th floor. We were simply wowed by the stylish decor and amenities. A nice mix of elegance and modern furnishings in the room. The living room window looked out over San Diego - looking to the left was Petco Park, and to the right you could see the ocean. The duvets and linens were very soft and the bed comfortable. I loved the bathroom. The Gilchrist and Soames bath amenities were really wonderful. The location is right in the Gaslamp Quarter and in easy walking distance to the shops and night life. There is no pool here, so I wouldn't recommend it for families looking for a lot of recreation for the kids, but for those who love night life, or business travelers, or first time visiters to San Diego, this is a great place to say.

There is a clearly marked rectangular sign post with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MTS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd written on it. There is a schedule on the pole and information regarding the bus fare. The fare is $2.25 exact change (bills or coins). The bus took approximately 8 minutes to get to downtown. Get off the bus at the stop located at 4th and Broadway. (It is the LAST stop on the route and thus not hard to locate, it is located beside Horton Plaza). Walk down 4th street for approximately 10 minutes to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153K street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Turn left. The hotel is on the left side at number 660. Check-in was quick, less than 5 minutes. The room key is required to access the elevators. No more than a 15-30 second wait for the elevators both in the evening and the following morning. My room, 1726, was located at the far end of the hallway. The room was attractive, comfortable and impressive. The bathroom had a sliding, wood door that does not lock. Standard bath tub and shower with lots of water pressure. The bath products were quite nice and well supplied with a few extras. There is a coffee maker with stainless steel pot and Starbucks coffee products. The unit made a nice, hot, cup of coffee in the morning. Both paper cups and black, ceramic mugs were provided. No issues with cleanliness. The room had one king bed, a wardrobe that contained drawers and the T.V., a cupboard, wing chair, and large corner unit work desk with rolling chair. The windows both opened onto the street, that was relatively quiet. The view was of downtown, the convention center and the ocean in the far distance. The 17th floor allowed views over most of the surrounding buildings so that quite a grand vista was afforded. The bed was comfortable with several types of pillows and a duvet that was very warm without being too hot. The alarm clock was a bit difficult to figure out, but there are helpful instructions on a sticker on the front of the clock. The button on the telephone that was supposed to connect to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wake up calls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actually always connected to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging service and needs to be reprogrammed. The carpet was clean, the furnishing in excellent condition and the room very well maintained. Any staff I had contact with were friendly and helpful. The common areas of the hotel were modern and attractive. Bowls of salt water taffy were placed on the front desk for guests to help themselves to. The hotel is directly beside Petco Park, and across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel. The hotel is located in the Gas Lamp Historic Quarter, but more to the edges.

Obviously, the location cannot be beat. It's adjacent to the Gaslamp District and Petco Park (home of the San Diego Padres), putting you in the center of downtown San Diego's attractions. There is no need to have a car as downtown attractions are all within in walking distance and many others are a short ride on the San Diego Trolley. I was staying in town for a wedding and photographs were at 2pm, the hotel without hesitation granted me an 11am check-in so I'd have time to shower and change after the drive from Los Angeles. My Marriott elite status was recognized at check-in and I was given a room on the 20th floor and access to the Concierge lounge without having to ask. My room directly overlooked the entire playing field at Petco. The room as good-sized for a downtown hotel and furnished with a nice modern flair. Now what really set this property apart were the small touches. For some these things may not matter, but for someone who travels as often as I do, they are invaluable. Mouthwash was provided in the bathroom along with a sealed loofa for use in the shower with liquid shower gel (I am not a fan of soap bars). There were also two complimentary bottles of water sitting next to the ice bucket for me. Each staff member I encuontered was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working at this Marriott. As an added bonus, one of the hottest bars in San Diego, Altitude, is located rooftop on the 22rd floor. Lines to gain access extended throughout the entire lobby nightly, but as a guest, you bybass the line and can go straight up to the rooftop.

Easy to walk around and find almost everything! The only thing was when we came back to our hotel, the Padres were playing and heavy traffic was everywhere. We were in no hurry that time, so we didn't mind it at all. They have an awesome lounge area on the rooftop called Latitude. It was nice that we stayed there for we didn't have to wait in a line that wrapped around the corner. The lounge uon the rooftop isn't your typical club as it is more loungey and tasteful.

They would just ask, \"What floor?\" and punch our number in without us having to use our room keys. So much for security. On our second night in San Diego, we got back to the hotel at 10:15. I wanted to order room service, but the menu said dinner ended at 10:00 pm. I thought that was a little early, but I guess it saved me from gorging right before going to bed. Overall, we didn't spend much time in the room, but it was a nice hotel. I thought about coming back with my husband and kids, but they don't have a pool so I don't know if I will come back.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wyoming", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, weekend was noisy\u201d", "Author": "jbmWyoming", "ReviewID": "UR23536933", "Content": "I stayed at Marriott Gaslamp for two nights at the end of a trip to San Diego visiting friends.

I was supposed to get up early for a flight, but the noise made sleeping impossible and I decided at 3am to call the airline and change my flight home and stop stressing about the sleep. Gave me an extra day in San Diego. The location as others have said is great. Would be perfect for baseball. The front staff I delt with were just ok (always seemed to have their own conversations going on while they were helping me, which isn't great service), couldn't get a bellhop to help with my luggage (again talking to other workers), but the bartenders in the streetside bar were very nice and made great drinks. Rooms very comfortable; linens, mattress, etc. Nice bathroom. Good Sunday brunch. I have stayed at nicer hotels in downtown San Diego, but weekend web rate was a decent one, and I was glad I didn't pay more with the bad first night!

If you're here for a convention at the convention center, it's a short and pleasant walk. Beyond that, the hotel has its good and bad points. First, the good points: this hotel is at the edge of the Gaslamp district. There are endless restaurants, bars, shopping, or whatever touristy diversion you could want. Second, there's Colleen (hope I remember that right) at the front desk. If you have a problem, she'll fix it. It's also a very quiet hotel unless you have noisy neighbors like I did on 1 of 3 nights. Unlike the Hyatt, you'll never hear the trolley because it doesn't run next to the hotel and that's a good thing unless you plan on using it. There's a coffee maker, a hair dryer, and all of the usual toiletries. Hot water came up pretty fast except on the day when I got up at 4AM to catch an early flight. Then it took a few minutes for the shower to get up to temperature. Not everything was perfect and I found more problems than I would have expected in a hotel that's so highly rated here. First, realize that all of the hotel's rooms were not created equal. The first room they gave me was on the 9th floor. It looked like a basement apartment because the windows started halfway up the wall, and the glass was frosted so you couldn't see out of the room. Fortunately the windows opened far enough for me to see what they were hiding and it was a roof with some kind of equipment on it. Maybe they weren't noisy air conditioning compressors that I saw, but I didn't want to find out. I went back to the lobby and got switched to room 1701 with a view of Petco park that was just like the ones in the traveler photos here. Another problem is that you can't get to your room without using your key card in the elevator to allow access to the guest floors. It's a nice security feature but when you get into the elevator with both hands full of luggage, it's a bit silly. There's a bar on the roof that's open to the public and at night they block off one of the four elevators for roof access only. There's always a crowd in the way, the three other elevators become busier and slower than ever, etc. And this is when it's not baseball season. The roof bar looks down on the stadium so during a game this elevator situation can't be fun for guests in the lobby. I think the roof bar is probably a good reason to avoid staying on the top floor, but that's just a guess. Finally there's the high speed internet access. First you have to call downstairs. Then you have to tell them if you want wireless or an ethernet connection. After you say \"Wireless\", they tell you that you'll need to give your credit card number to some company that you've never heard of. And if you want to use a cable to connect, the charge can go on your bill. Once you try to use it, you go through a screen that basically says \"Your only choice is 24 hours of broadband. What would you like to choose?\" You have to do this every 24 hours or you can skip a day if you'd like. Upon checkout you'll discover that after you pick the 24 hour \"option\", you get billed for this automatically every day until you check out. One good thing is that along with the internet, you also get free domestic calls, local or long distance. I'm not sure how much people actually use the phone in their room for long distance calls, but it seems like a reasonable way to call home once you realize it's free. The system doesn't seem to be well thought out. I think they'd make more money if the rooms were $3/night more and there was free wifi, but I'm not in the hotel business. I just stay in hotels. Overall, I had a good time at the Marriott. It wasn't as nice of a hotel at the Hyatt and there were ar too many small problems, but this would be my number one pick if I was in town to see the Padres.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "utah", "Title": "\u201cGreat!\u201d", "Author": "earing", "ReviewID": "UR21858326", "Content": "We just got back from a conference in San Diego, and had a wonderful time at the Marriott.

The rooftop bar offers a pretty good view of the outfield. My room was very nice and easily surpassed my expectations. On my first morning, I ate at the Soleli@K restaurant.

Now, I'm sure it was put on the window to conceal the terrible view if a rooftop and building. But I could not see outside at all - not even to see what the weather was. I would have preferred the bad view. Secondly, and more important to me, is that they do not put clean glasses and cups in the rooms. After seeing a news story that some hotels do not put clean glasses and cups in the rooms to replace the dirty, used ones - and being a little grossed out by this- I marked the bottom of my cup and glass to see if they would be replaced. Much to my dismay, when I returned to the room after housekeeping had cleaned it, the same cup and glass, with the marks still on the bottom, were there - rinsed but not replaced. I went to the next room where housekeeping was cleaning the room, to ask if I could get clean ones, and I saw on the housekeeping cart that there were NO clean cups or glasses!! And I could see the housekeeper in that bathroom, rinsing the glasses out and drying them with the bathroom towel, and putting them right back on the counter! Bad enough when a cup that I used is not washed properly and replaced, but being there were no clean ones on the cart, I can only assume that they are not replaced even when the room changes guests!

About a mile in to the town is also a large shopping mall. The only downfall of the hotel is its restaurant and bars. The bars are overpriced, even for such an area ($7 for a beer) and I couldn't get a decent vodka martini at either one. There are two; one at the lobby level and one on the roof. The one on the roof has a great view, especially at dusk and allows smoking, but still, couldn't get a good drink. The restaurant is also dud. It claims to be serving some sort of authentic Californian cuisine. No offense to California, but if that's authentic California cuisne, I don't want any. It's almost entirely vegetarian, which is fine, but it's all very odd concoctions, none of which really seem to work (I tried several during my stay, trying to be open minded and such) and they put a lot of emphasis on the display \"food as art\" kind of presentation. Aside from those two faults, the Marriott Gaslamp Quarter is a very good hotel. There is another Marriott about three blocks from it, the one with the convention center on the water.

Also great Thai food at Rama which is only a couple of blocks away. You really don't need a car if you plan to stay in the downtown area as most everything you'll need is an easy walk from the hotel.

I guess we were in a premium room that was somewhat larger and most updated to ones on lower levels. We were on the 17 floor (1716) and anything higher than that requires the key for the elevator. The room was bigger than a lower floor we had before and the decor looked to be fairly new . Everything in modern city style the bathroom doors I noticed were pocket doors which helps with not taking up walking space in the entry. I forgot how small the double beds are here, they were comfortable but small. One thing that I had never heard ( I guess because we were on a lower floor last) of was when I called to get a roll- away for my child they said they could not give us one as we are above the 15 floor and roll-aways aren't allowed because of fire codes.

They have jars of Tootsie rolls and bubble gum and other sweets at the front desk, which is a nice touch.

The only issue was that the walls were not as thick as I would have liked and I could hear my next door neighbors partying until late in the night.

I'm in San Diego on Business and this hotel was on the list of preferred hotels. Last summer I had wanted to come down on a weekend getaway and originally researched this hotel but passed on the opportunity. What a mistake. I've stayed at some pretty nice hotels but this is the best. It's bed was better than the Ritz Carlton and the Westin Heavenly bed. The sheets were silky smooth. Westin has pretty rough sheets but comfy beds, ritz has similar sheets but the beds are way too soft. The bed was like the heavenly bed but with the butter soft linens and fluffy down comforter like the Ritz. My room, 1704 overlooked Coronado Island and the ballpark; I could litterally see homeplate from my window. You can't walk out on a balcony. But the view was still great. The room was about the size of a NY hotel room. But well appointed. Granet countertops, mosaic tiles, wingback chair with an ottoman. The area around is awesome. Clean, tons of restaurants...enjoyed Trophies upcale bar food, and Freds Mexican food. I'm sure it gets pretty crazy when the Padres are in town. I was in town when they were on the road. 2 Thumbs up. I'd come back just for a good nights rest. :-) WONDERFUL!!! My only criticism is the Valet. They are really slow. Day 1 took 15 mintues to call my car up. So Day 2 I called 30 minutes ahead for it to be ready. But when I arrived, 3 valets were standing there and my car was no where to be found.

I ordered breakfast and a late dinner (room service) and they were both bad. There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel that serve great food and I recommend that you take a quick walk.

Check-in was quick and efficient and the front desk associate skipped the \"hotel talk-through tour\" as I had already explained the wreck situation and it was quite obvious that I was just ready to go to my room. So for that I give kudos to this hotel, however, having worked in the hotel industry before, for a situation as serious as a totalled car, I half expected a complimentary amenity or upgrade, neither of which was offered (can't really fault the hotel for this, however, many other hotels would have offered one or the other). Room was a large corner room, however was a handicap accessible room (no mention of this at check-in) and did not have a tub, but instead had a roll in shower. Had I been notified of this at check-in (it is standard procedure to notify a guest if they are being placed in a handicap accessible room and have not requested such) I would have been asked to be moved to another room. Had requested extra towels, a microwave, and a refrigerator prior in my reservation. Was told at check-in these items were already placed in the room. They were not there when I arrived so had to call back down (after being told that they WERE there) to have them delivered. Hotel loses points for this. Overall my two night stay was good however, on the first night (the night of my accident) a group of drunk women exited the elevator on my floor and proceeded to converse quite loudly in hallway at 2:30 in the morning. I called down and requested that Loss Prevention (Security) be sent up to take care of the noise. Not quite sure if anyone was sent, but my assumption is no as the conversations continued until around 4:00 AM. Housekeeping began their rounds around 7 AM, once again awakening me due to the rather large gap between the bottom of the door and the floor. Second night went uneventful. At this point, my opinion of the hotel was still rather high, with a few key points that needed to be worked on. However, check-out was a disaster. I asked to speak with a manager regarding my inconveniences and the manager which responded just kind of looked at me with the attitude of why was I even bringing this to her attention (no writing down the problems [Marriott encourages a log of all guest complaints] and a general sense of apathy). I was then told that since I was staying on a discounted corporate rate, that my complaints don't really matter and that I would just have to deal with it. I was also told that had I called back with the noise complaint, I could have been moved to another room (moving at 4AM, when I'm sore and can barely move anyways due to whiplash among other accident related pains, which would include moving of the refrigerator, microwave, and other towels). Unsatisfied with the response received from the manager, I proceeded to call the president of Marriott Intl (I am acquainted with him as he is a graduate of my university) and left him a voicemail stating my concern. At this point, the manager's attitude still remained one of apathy and arrogance, as if noone above her (not even the president of the company) can overrule her decisions. I must say, I am quite dissatisfied and this is the worst service I have ever received from ANY level of hotel, select, limited, or full service. I will not be returning except maybe as a full paying customer solely so that I can receive a guest satisfaction survey and let the company know just how poorly managed this property is.", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location...walking distance to everything downtown\u201d", "Author": "puppylov", "ReviewID": "UR7271644", "Content": "We stayed here last weekend for my birthday and had a wonderful time.

I have read negative reviews about the front desk and they probably got fired or something, becuase the lady at the front was great, had a smile the whole time, and told us about the sky bar (which we already knew about). I had NO problem checking in, i reserved this place ONLINE the night before. (yea last minute) The online menu said there were NO king size beds, so i called in after i reserved online, the man who picked up the phone said at first that its all dependent on how many requests are made the day of. The guy was very kind and promised I would get one and I did. The room is very luxurious. They had quality bed sheets and furniture. The bathroom is awesome, I like how the bathroom door is a large sliding door. They provide the amnenities that you would expect for what you paid for the room. The view is great, you can see over Coronado ( the small island next to the gaslamp) Unfortunatley the OMNI hotel was slightly blocking the direct water. I can definitely understand why people would be upset because there is ALOT of construction being done around the area and it would be in direct view of their room if it faced south. But COME ON, its not like the marriott has ANY control over that. It's like telling your neighbor to never remodel their house. The sky bar (Altitude) is beautiful. It is SMALL compared to the Standard in Downtown LA (for those of you who have gone there.) It looked like it fit a little more than 100 people or so and the servers are extremely great at getting you drinks too. They asked us several times if we wanted drinks even though there were many other people around. Thats great service. There is also a great view of Petco Park. All in all, I thought it was worth the price to stay at this location and will definitely recommend it. We didn't party in the gaslamp area because we stayed at the skybar. Oh yea, if your older and don't like the night life scene, don't stay above teh 18th floor. I stayed on the 19th floor and you could still somewhat hear the bass from the sky bar.

We liked the location and the fact that it was a relatively new hotel. The rooms were pretty clean, and we were given one with a great view of Petco Park and the bay. The only thing that was suboptimal was the service. For such a pricey and \"hip\" hotel, the attitude was a little much. For example, on saturday nights a line forms around the lobby of people who want to get upstairs to the rooftop bar. There are several staff in dark suits and ear phones who man the elevators like secret servicemen with overinflated egos. They actually made guests wait while they held the elevator for bar goers, and we had to show our room key to get anywhere near it after getting blockaded by the staff. The restaurant was overpriced ($12 martinis), and the food was so so. I had a waitress argue with me about what I ordered when the wrong thing came out, instead of just apologizing and replacing the meal. The final issue was getting a cab in the morning. A late night staff told us to call the front desk 10-15 minutes ahead of time, and it would be no problem. When we called, we got forwarded to several other lines then got a voice mail box.

In addition, you're just steps away from the action in the Gaslamp District, but yet far enough that it's a little more quiet. One caveat: If you're not a baseball fan or a fan of the commotion that goes along with the game, steer clear of this hotel during any home Padres games; it's Ground Zero for a lot of the pre and post-game hype, and the bar fills up with folks who have already consumed their fair share of adult beverages.

The lobby is beautifully decorated, clean and contemporary with art from local artists all around. The rooms are beautiful -- not your usual polyester bedspread...this hotel features Marriott's new bedding (ala the Heavenly Bed at Westin), a beautiful marble walled bathroom and nice view of the bay and Petco Park. The rooftop bar (Skybar) is very popular on the weekends, with a line for non-guests stretching through the lobby to get upstairs. Hotel guests go right up. Especially attractive for the 20 and 30 somethings. Services were all around better than normal -- front desk and restaurant staff were very cheerful and helpful. The only spot on that record was that we'd called for fresh towels Sunday morning and they hadn't arrived 45 minutes later. We finally picked up old ones and used those and called to tell them not to bother. Seemed to be a fluke, however, as the next morning we called and got new towels in less than 5 minutes. The breakfast buffet was your standard fare for a hotel of this caliber...but it was $18 too. Unfortunately, the gaslamp is more geared to dinner and drinking than breakfast...so your breakfast options are limited. There is, however, a nice breakfast spot down K street about 3 or 4 blocks west. As another reviewer noted, there is no pool...kinda strange...but you do have reciprocol privileges at the Marriott at the Convention Center -- friends in our group went there and said it was crowded and not pleasant. I've also stayed there...and had the same feeling about the rooms. The other Marriott is about 5 or 6 blocks? away...but there is no shuttle, so if you want to swim, you have to walk or drive. I agree with the other reviews on the parking situation -- we didn't have a car, but folks in our group did. If there isn't a game at the stadium, parking should be ample in the garage right across the street (contrary to another reviewer, I know that there is parking in the hotel itself -- but I suppose they do use the garage across the street for overflow). Park it yourself across the street and you should save plenty off of the $24 tab. Sounds pricey, but things aren't free in DT San Diego. Workout facilities were also pretty decent. I wasn't especially looking for a pool, and I didn't rent a car, so those issues weren't a big deal to me. Like I said, an all around very good hotel. Of our group of about 15 people, nobody had a bad thing to say -- and we were wondering how much better the Omni can be, just a block away, for twice the price?
