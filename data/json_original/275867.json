We were so happy to hear that the alamo was giving rooms away for 85 dollars. This was the only exciting thing upon renting a room here. As soon as we walked in, it smelled of a mixture between moldy cheese and dead bodies. Laughing, we looked up to notice just a light bulb hanging from the ceiling. We entered the bathroom, the shower was small with just a pipe hanging from the wall. This all was but humorous until we noticed the massive amounts of black mold all over the sink and around the entire bathroom. Also, long black hairs were at the bottom of the shower and where u put the soap was crud and a razor blade that had probably been there for 3 years. This bathroom had never been cleaned. Ever. It was also easy to tell this since there was poop smeared all over the wall next to the toilet and on the wall next to the bed. The towels were blatantly dirty and merely refolded. I then heard this place is known for prostitution. I'm surprised we didn't end up with bed bugs or something because the blankets on top of the beds had burn holes and stains (which looked like blood).

I have not seen any prostitution or rude employees. Yes, the bathroom was tiny and old but it worked. We where there for the beach not the damn hotel! We had 7 people and only paid $95 a night which allowed our family (we have small children) the ability to do more fun things while on vacation. The bed was hard but you can't expect 5 star pillow top beds at a tiny motel just trying to get by. Also, someone had reviewed this place that stayed in 1985.....uh, it's changed owners since then. I had no bugs, no mildew, no loud teenagers, no rude staff and the pool was clean and inviting! I also did not have to walk through the bar to enter the pool. There are two entrances one gate in the fence and one in the bar (makes it nice when you need a drink). Let's figure this, people have died in other motels in Ocean City and all over the country, as long your not sharing a room with a dead body, that's not really a good point. If you were struggling trying to reach the American Dream by being a business owner, then all the negative reviews stop people from going, which in turn slows any money they could have for renovations. As I see it, if your looking for a place, not a palace then this isn't too bad. You can't find another room this cheap, hell you can't even CAMP there for this cheap. It's a room.

They were bent, broken, with sheer curtains which you could see right through! The bathroom had NO blinds at all! The carpets had cigarette burns and were never vacuumed, there were food crumbs everywhere. There were 2 sets of drawers in the room which is where we set our luggage because we were too afraid of setting our belongings anywhere else! We REFUSED to shower there because of how dirty the bathroom was. Now for the beds...the one comforter had a huge burn hole in it that went all the way down to the mattress - which shows you they do NOT change the top covers! Sheets only! I swear I have bites from unforeseen creatures in that bed! When we saw the maid go around, she only carries towels and sheets with her. I saw no vacuum and no cleaners! Oh yeah, the outside top railing is loose, so no leaning, as you may end up falling onto your vehicle! Also no trashcan! So if you have trash, you must walk OUTSIDE to go throw your trash away with everyone else's. That may not be a big deal for most, but seeing condom wrappers and used tampons in there is completely disgusting! We have a friend who lives nearby and stated this place is known for prostitution! Whether that's the case or not, I can not verify. The pool outside the hotel bar looked as if it were never cleaned, and was never occupied during our stay by us or anyone else.

We were tired and hot, the AC in the car was out. I was wanted to take a shower, maybe have a drink and go to bed. We knew after driving around the place that The Alamo wasn't a five star hotel, there were folks out back playing horse shoes but we thought what the heck, how bad could it be??? I didn't go in the office but I was told it was dirty. There were no real parking places so I drive up as close as I could to the building with our room in it. As I walked in my bf said \"The receipt says no refunds.\" The musty smell, lack of carpet, one ragged curtain over each of the two windows and falling apart dressers helped me understand why. I went to look at the bathroom and it was worse than I could have imagined. The toilet was wedged in the corner so that even I being only five foot two would not be able to use it properly; there was NO room for my knees. The sink was stained beyond belief and the shower was a tiled hole complete with the echoing drip, drip of a rusted shower head and two spigots. It was late, I was hot and tired and cranky. I took a shower being careful not to touch the walls. The water was warm enough and the pressure was good. I came out of the shower to see my bf fiddling with the TV, it would NOT work and there was no remote. We don't watch TV anyway so not a big deal. I did want a drink so we went to the bar which was part of the property. I won't go into THAT because this is a review of the hotel, but EW! Back in the room we decided the sheets were clean enough to sleep on and we got ready for bed. Looking at the door I noticed light streaming through on all four sides. I was glad it's summer. To drown out the sound of the people playing horseshoes behind our room we turned the AC on, it clunked! It did bring in some cool air but it was loud. I had a drink in me, and I didn't care anymore. It wasn't an uncomfortable bed and the pillows were nice. After a so-so rest, we got up and left before seven. All that was $75. We stayed at a very nice place for less than 40 the next night.

Norman Bates drove our bags to the room in the golf cart. Once we entered the room, which note...had no number on it, nor lock, we realized that someone had possibly died in the room. We proceded to open the drawers, and quickly closed them for the cockroaches were escaping...! We then decided to go attemp the shower. After putting on our wet suits and snorckles we decided that the mildew may eat threw our shoes. So we decided it was safer to bath in the ocean. We thought that the horrible experience may soon end...until we turned down the bed sheets. The air conditioning....did not work. but it wasent so bad because the blankets weere well ventalated with ciggerate burns, the sheets looked like they have not been washed since 1972. And, the mattress looked like it hadent been replaced since moses parted the red sea. There was not much left of the walls, for the holes and roaches were consuming the rest. The Alamo....was truely the WORST experience our our entire lives.

I was mislead by the photos on their website and I won't forget The Alamo! In all my 40 some years of traveling, this was the absolute worst motel I have ever stayed at. My first impression was it looked like an ethnic Bates Motel. The office reeked of body odor and stale smoke and we were greeted with the No Refund signs all over. No wonder, that's how they make their money. Once you see the room - YOU'RE STUCK! They did have number on the room doors and that was the nicest part of the room. Thank goodness the air conditioner was working properly, but there was a tree air conditioner on, I guess trying to cover up the smell of decaying bodies. We were afraid to touch anything. The walls had holes in them and some of the holes were patched up, probably with old cooking. There was no overhead light, we had one lamp, but it didn't have a lampshade. The so called furniture in the room looked like it came from the Salvation Army dumpster. The dresser mirror wasn't attached to the dresser or wall. Thank goodness we had a TV with cable, but the TV stand was missing some of it's particle board covering. There was a dresser in the closet area, but it was missing a drawer. The bathroom should have been condemned. The fixtures looked like they were pulled from The Titanic, there was so much crust on them. The tile was peeling up and curling showing the wooden floor. The bathtub and shower stall hadn't been cleaned since the Eisenhower administration. We had to close our eyes when we showered. We laid OUR towels on the floor because it was so dangerous and LEFT them there. I didn't want that toxic stuff in my car.

This place was creepy, like something out of a stephen king novel! The one armed bandit that checked us in had a wife-beater tank top with many unidentifiable stains on it. It was $110 for a day and a half to stay in a third world country. We knew something was wrong when there were no numbers on the rooms. We asked a pregnant teenage girl who was hanging sheets outside on a clothesline which was our room and she didn't speak english. Our room had raw light bulbs dangling from the ceiling with numerous insects racing in and out of the fixture. There were no curtains and no bathroom door, we had to hang a sheet to keep from entertaining the other residents. The mildew and bady hair was so thick in the bathroom, that we considered \"holding-it\" until we could get to the beach the next day. We had to wear shoes and clothes in the shower. There was a bunkbed in the first part of the room and my brother was wracked with concern over which bunk to sleep on; the one closest to the insect superhighway(ceiling) or the dark damp urine smelling hole (bottom). My husband, infant son and I slept fully clothed on top of beach towels on the nasty bed. The other \"residents\" came knocking on the window to ask if we had beer. A terrified woman approached my husband and proposed that we all go find a different hotel to share, COMPLETE STRANGERS!! The toilet paper was mildewed, we wiped with napkins from the car...thank you burger king! No tv, no clock, no phone, no ac, no locks, and no refunds! Prisons have higher hygeine standards!
