The room was air conditioned which was needed. I normally don't sleep well when away, but I had the best nights sleep here. We weren't disturbed by doors clashing or the cleaners. We prepaid the breakfast which was good, you made your own coffee out of the machines, but it was proper coffee beans, really good coffee. There was a very large pastry selection, with fresh fruit, yoghurt, dried fruits, cooked meats and scrambled eggs, fresh juice. The area is very nice, we walked to the left of the hotel along the river, passing parks and cafes on the way. There is a bus stop outside to the left, no 50 to the centre which is 1 euro 50 or 3 euros return. We bought a 3 day pass which worked out cheaper, as you could also use the underground. The bus took about 15 minutes to get to Plaza Mayor, 1 night the road was closed going to the Royal Palace as there was a parade on, so we ended up walking, but it only took about 25-30 minutes. The weather was really hot when we were there, went to the Sorello museum which was very interesting, spent a day at the zoo and a day in the Retiro Park. Taxi was 30 euros back to the airport (which was considerably cheaper than getting one to the hotel, it cost 43 euros!)

Keep in mind that the Madrid metro is NOT traveler-friendly due to lack of escalators at several stations. Within walking distance of the city center but it's a 30-min uphill walk.

The hotel really stands out in the area because of its stylish build. The location is great too, especially for football fans, the Atletico Madrid stadium is only a few metres away. Also if you're into football, many away teams that play in madrid stay there, FC Espanyol were there when i was there. A taxi to the city centre only costs roughly about 7 euro, the bus stops right outside and the metro is about 10-15 minute walk. There are only a couple of bad points about the place. 1. There is no bar in the hotel, they serve alcohol in the restaurant but if you want a relaxing drink for the evening you will have to go elsewhere. 2. There is no iron in the room, I know this is only a small thing but if you have all your clothes crammed into a suitcase you don't want to be walking around madrid in wrinkly clothes and 3. The housekeeping can be noisy. I put this down to the fact all the rooms have wooden floors.

A taxi from most of the tourist areas is around \u20ac10 and the airport \u20ac30. The hotel also hires out bikes and mopeds.

We got excellent value although some may not be as lucky, and checked in with no problems straight away. After seeing pictures beforehand I didn't think it could live up to it but it did completely. The staff spoke good English and let us choose a room, including one allowing smoking although I am not a smoker myself. Excellent facilities in the room, nice on-the-wall TV with all the channels, also probably the best shower I have ever used, plenty of room for storage and nice single beds. From our window we could even see the royal palace. The location was very pleasant and literally 2 minutes from the Vicente Calder\u00f3n stadium, where we went to watch a match on the Sunday morning. Also not far from the centre and also Principe P\u00edo shopping centre, which we really enjoyed. The walk there is a very pleasant one, with lots of runners, cyclists and dog walkers. Great atmosphere. During the trip we encountered a problem with a stolen passport but at the reception they gave us all the help we needed and we can't thank them enough. We never went for breakfast as we didn't buy it included and went elsewhere, but there seemed to be a great choice. Wi-Fi also wasn't used by us but they gave us the instructions if we wanted it for phone use straight away. Room cleaned every day as you would expect and to a perfect standard.

Breakfast is good, and if you reserve the night before, you get a discount. WiFi is complimentary. There are small local groceries and restaurants nearby where you get value for money. Room is modern, clean and comfortable. WiFi is complimentary, which is a big plus. The minus is there is no coffee/tea maker, or electric kettle in the room for boiling water. You could however request a thermos of hot water to be sent up from the restaurant (free). When there's a game at the Estadio Vicente Calderon, the area was very congested, and buses were re-routed.
