Well these are the things I look for. Good helpful enthusiastic staff, good nights sleep in a comfortable bed and a restaurant and bar for a meal and a drink. Not a lot to ask? Well the Weinmeister failed on all these basic requirements. The staff should be flipping burgers at McDonald's. They had no idea or interest in what they where doing. A receptionist watched as I spent five minutes trying to use the coffee machine, dead behind the eyes. I attempted a meal in the evening and the waitress came over and said there weren't any menus. We spent fifteen minutes playing a game where I asked if she had steak and she said no! Pasta? No, Human meat? Err.............no! Just how dumb is that? The room was the size of a postage stamp and the bed took up 95% of it. Not bad. It was comfortable. The problem was I couldn\u2019t sleep in it because of the noise. What hotel would use heavy, loud metal doors, a door that echoed around the whole hotel every time it was shut? Doors so loud they keep you awake all night. Then being on the 5th floor we where directly below the beauty spa. So every morning at 7am the sound of high heels and doors slamming started until my alarm went off. I checked out today and was greeted by a rude and very self-opinionated burger flipper who thought run the hotel (in essense, a jobsworth!!) who demanded my credit card even though I explained there where two company cards behind the reception. She demanded several times for a card, she mumbled, tutted and rolled her eyes and then looked me up and down as if I was a piece of crap. Nice. She called over her fay manager and I watched for several minutes as they talked in German about the situation and me. He talked to me like I was a piece of crap even though he was just the manager of this McDonalds restaurant. My passport was snatched off me and photocopied; I left my business card, signed and existed. The icing on the cake and a fine metaphor for the quality of the hotel and my stay. This hotel calls itself a design/boutique hotel. IT IS NOT. Any hotel that gives you a 10% discount card for Superdry is not cool and should be sued through the trades description act. The staff are rude and the food, we will never know. The best thing about the hotel? Free Internet. But I can get that for free at McDonalds and I\u2019d get fed and I could probably get a better night sleep. If you have to stay in the Weinmeister good luck to you, my advice would be stay in the Hotel Casa next door it\u2019s where we ate the night the Weinmeister had no menus!!!!! http://www.casacamper.com/berlin/default-de.html", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durres, Albania", "Title": "\u201cModern & Innovative!\u201d", "Author": "doriis", "ReviewID": "UR120918479", "Content": "The hotel is very stylish with an amazing facade and an impressive interior .

This week was the turn of The Weinmeister Hotel conveniently located on Weinmester Strasse. Before reviewing the hotel I will preface my criticism by saying that the staff are lovely, friendly and speak excellent English for those that don\u2019t speak German. If this hotel were located in New York you\u2019d comfortably pay double and be grateful. What really annoys about this hotel however is the design. Here we have a throw back to the pre-crash days of \u2018style over substance\u2019. How does this manifest itself then? Well take the guest room; a generous black tiled shower room but somebody forgot to include any form of shelf on which to stand a shampoo bottle. The tv? Well it\u2019s a beautiful looking Mac TV in seductive mat silver. The problem is it\u2019s fiendishly complicated to actually call up a tv programme. I\u2019m no Luddite; I\u2019m writing this review on a MacBook Air, my phone is an i-Phone and I have an i-Pad at home so I kinda know how Macs work. Never the less I was unable to find out how to turn the so-called tv on/ off using the remote. When I did get tv using the mouse the picture quality was as poor as you\u2019d have found in Mitte in the old DDR days. The Mac sits on a desk but don\u2019t think you could actually do any useful work at it because the designer has seen fit not to provide you with anything as handy as a chair \u2013 no they rather think that you\u2019ll find a hard brown cube of upholstered MDF a better proposition for you to sit on. The bed is also mounted on a monstrously high raft of upholstered MDF and is stylishly positioned so as to prevent your partner reaching his/her side of the bed without climbing over you. Oh and by the way the bed is equipped with what I can only describe as \u2018horns\u2019. Not sure why but I bet they serve no purpose. The lobby \u2013 bar- breakfast room must be an operational nightmare and I pity the poor staff. The small public area is divided into niches with sloping curved plasterboard walls in which sit high backed chairs. It need hardly be said that the chair heights don\u2019t allow you to eat your breakfast comfortably given the designers \u2018form\u2019 in the guest room. The problem is that when you are sat in this forest of niche and chair that you can\u2019t see anybody and they can\u2019t see you. You\u2019d die of thirst waiting for the coffee waitress to spot you and then reach you through the maze in the morning. Finally what is the tie in with Superdry all about? Staff wear Superdry shirts and on arrival the guest is presented with a discount voucher for the Superdry shop next door. What do I want with that? I can\u2019t see the hotel demographic of creative/media business traveller and well off middle-aged couple rushing to claim their 10% off. I was long gone by the time the store opened anyway. Whatever next? A Bench voucher on arrival at the Adlon? Superdry is after all the London market stall brand that pretends to be Japanese.

The staff were friendly although they couldn't give us much good advice on the couple of occasions we asked them about stuff in the local area.

The hotel is modern and clean. Yes, it's a 'design' hotel, which may put some people off, but we didn't find it too 'cool' or the people too 'posey'. Our bed was large and comfortable, but quite high - we literally had to climb into bed! It seems like some of the practical things in the room were sacrificed for design elements - for example, there were no wardrobes, only hooks (this didn't bother us as we didn't unpack our things during our stay). The iMac and free internet access were very helpful! The location isn't bad - we arrived at the main train station, took the subway to Alexanderplatz and walked to the hotel in about 10 minutes. The walk to Museumsinsel took longer, but was definitely do-able. Service was friendly and helpful - reception was happy to help us order taxis, print out itineraries, etc. For the rate we paid, I thought the hotel was very good value. Our stay was very enjoyable and we would be happy to stay here again. Tip 1: one thing that was strange with our room - the shower cubicle was separate to the bathroom and directly faced the bed! So while your roommate is showering, you could sit on the bed (or be practically anywhere else in the room) and, uh, watch! Friends of ours stayed in another room and said that their shower was also separate to the bathroom, but was tucked away in the corner of their room, rather than on display. So if you're a little more modest, I'd recommend that you specify you'd like a room that has a more discrete shower cubicle. Tip 2: if your room rate doesn't include breakfast, check out Strandbad Mitte (a few blocks away from the hotel on Kleine Hamburger Str. 16: www.strandbad-mitte.de/index.html) for breakfast (see photo attached).

We loved the IMAC, with free internet access and TV in one, loved the bathroom and the view. The room was very cold due to draft from the big windows, but we just closed the curtains and worked the aircon. Maby it was due to the arctic weather outside. The breakfast was delicious, very healthy with yummy fresh fruits and juices. No danish pastry for the boyfriend. We have been to Berlin before, so we knew the location, and you should stay here in \"Mitte\", if you want to stay close to funky cafees, shops and restaurants.

It was an Arctic -18 outside but the rooms were always warm and cosy and the underfloor heating was a welcome treat. There's an imac in every room which proved incredibly useful in keeping my boyfriend entertained whilst I spent an excessive amount of time in the amazing shower. The staff were friendly and helpful - in fact, after my mentally challenged boyfriend left our bag in a Berlin cafe on New Year's Eve (containing my purse and phone) the hotel receptionist retrieved the bag and posted it back to the UK for us.

So cool So hip at 40 I was lost, let me explain no wardrobe, no drawers, the new cool, leave your clothes in your suitcase for your 4 day stay. Nobody to show you the few gadgets, how to turn on lights etc, too busy serving the beautiful magazine people. Meant to stay for 4 nights, went to bed, hard as a rock,very uncomfortable, and then the workmen started at 7 am downstairs.

We stayed here for a weekend in November and will definitely be coming back. Check-in was great. The staff are ultra-friendly and spoke better English than we did. The lobby/bar/restaurant area is very homey - although there isn't much floor space. The design is impressive as you come in - we missed the front door when walking past it the first time. The rooms are small - and the huge beds mean there is even less floor space - but you don't go to Berlin to hang out in a hotel room do you? The bed was SO comfortable. The linen was so fresh. The Mac TV is very functional (I'm a Mac user myself but never use mine as a TV). A jug of fresh water was provided in the evening which was a really nice touch. Pyjamas were provided too which are very comfortable - and another nice touch. The bathroom is small but the shower is great. Shower gel and shampoo was fantastic - a London brand but I can't remember which one. The neighbourhood the hotel is in is very cool - loads of small clothes shops, bars and restaurants. It is pretty much on top of Weinmasterstrasse Station which is very easy to get to on the subway. Alexanderplatz is a short walk too. I live in Dalston, London (\"the coolest place on the planet\" according to many) but this area beats it in many ways. There isn't too much more to say really as the hotel is so compact - which is great.

The room was quiet even though it faced on the street and the unusual arrangement of having the bed be the central feature in the room with a bathtub behind it worked for me, but then I was alone. The room is not terribly large and I tripped over an upholstered cube placed at the foot of the bed, presumably so you could sit on it while tying your shoes? The bed, on the other hand, was quite comfortable. The location in Mitte would be hard to beat. The breakfast is OK, not the usual German buffet, but much cheaper that the usual buffet too. The staff spoke good English although they patiently endured my German when I told them I wanted to practice on them. I thought the staff was a group of genuinely friendly people and I enjoyed them alot. The one, mild, criticism I had was the quality of the food in the restaurant. I thought it would be better to concentrate on a more limited menu that the kitchen could handle. As it is, the menu is too extensive and the food tastes like it's prepared elsewhere and warmed up there. It wasn't truly bad, but it wasn't very good either. It was, however, relatively reasonably priced, especially for a hotel restaurant.

The staff, however, was nice enough to offer us a room in the back of the hotel as construction was done out front (although we should point out we barely even noticed, since all the noise took place during the middle of the day while we were out sightseeing). While the rooms were rather small, they were beautifully designed and made excellent use of the space. The bathrooms were wonderfully appointed and the bed was very comfortable (even though it was encased in a giant plush headboard contraption which ate up most of the room space). The best feature of this hotel is the iMac in every room (with free internet access) put in place of a television \u2013 brilliant idea!

Yes, it's hard to find the entrance. I think this is exacerbated by the construction going on in the street out front as well. It was the construction workers who pointed us to the door, saving us from walking around the block with our luggage. I posted a picture here of the entrance, so you know what to look for! The staff at the Weinmeister were awesome. All friendly and helpful. The restaurant is a little odd, but that's what you get at a design hotel - something out of the ordinary. I think it's better as more of a lounge for meeting and munching, as opposed to going for a romantic dinner or the like. The location is awesome as far as restaraunts/galleries/shops go, so you shouldn't be hanging out at the hotel anyway... We had a standard room and got a really great deal (the \"opening special\"), so not sure what the rooms normally go for/value would be. The rooms are high on design, but low on function. I imagine it could be a little annoying if you were there for more than a few days - I was there for four nights, and it was okay. The rooms are very quiet and the bed is super comfy, which is a plus. The downside is that there's nowhere to hang your towel if you want to use it more than once, nowhere to put your soap/shampoos in the shower, nowhere to set up a couple of suitcases (except on the couch and chest) - little conveniences like those. Also mentioned in a previous review - the windows don't open. I had no issue with this. There's a thermostat to control your temperature, and one of the windows did open a few inches for fresh airflow, if needed... These are all things that can be balanced out by the friendly staff and the great location, though. It's no doubt a \"trendy\" \"hip\" hotel, so to that degree, you know what to expect a little. I'd definitely stay there again...that is if I can afford the normal, non-special rates... I should also note that I didn't see any dust or issues with construction/cleanliness when I was there, so perhaps that's wrapped up now.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Weinmeister", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1791773-Reviews-The_Weinmeister-Berlin.html", "Price": "$122 - $237*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Weinmeisterstr. 2</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10178</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1791773", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/29/59/83/the-weinmeister.jpg"}}
