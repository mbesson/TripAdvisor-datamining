{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Okay but need facelifts Stayed at this hotel for 2 days in mid January 2008. This hotel is okay for the price and the room is comfortable enough. There were some problems though. Smelly toilet n the hot shower didnt heat up until at least 15 minutes after it was on. The main problem with this hotel is that it got flooded during rain. We had to walk through ankle-high flood water one night during rain n the next morning when the rain is over the place looked kinda messy and dirty. Location-wise this place is good. Very near to the market, shoplots, convenient stores, etc. The great thing about this place is very great n friendly staffs who were able to help u n also nice swimming pool. I hope this premise can be upgraded cos it have lots of potential. Give this place a try if u have only little time in ur room n are out most of the time.", "Date": "Jan 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR702680935", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mizz_ida"}, {"Content": "good spot in Legian Nice little place. Quiet. Rooms close to the pool may be especially good (though not large enough for our group.) Didn't even use the pool, because we ended up going back to Waterbom (twice!) but it looked fine. Family room was adequate--my 5 year old loved watching Transformers in Indonesian on the tiny TV. Bathroom a little grubby, but ok. Beds comfortable. A/C worked well. Breakfast (included) was very nice, and we had a couple of other good, simple meals at the hotel restaurant on their breezy patio. Staff very helpful and friendly, although sometimes there was a bit of a language barrier. Hired one of the hotel drivers for airport pickup and to go to Ubud--good experience. All in all, a nice, brief stay, with plenty to do and see and eat within walking distance. We headed away from the madness of the Kuta area pretty quickly and into the more peaceful hills.", "Date": "Jan 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR627411850", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nm_mom_traveler"}, {"Content": "Fantastic little hotel in Legian, Bali       hotel view 2", "Date": "Oct 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR677337793", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fred_in_london"}, {"Content": "Nice budget hotel       pool", "Date": "Jun 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR511953783", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Snookystraveltips"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d661312-r13054711-Bali_Village_Hotel-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "661312", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
