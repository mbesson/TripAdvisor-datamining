The room is a bit small, but the place is clean and everything is quite well, didn't expect it from the looks outside the building. The staff are young and they are really professional on their work. They are a very friendly people. The breakfast was not that bad, it's quite sufficient. I recommend this hotel, it's near the center of rome, plus it is near to all public transportation, so if you came back late at night there is no worries at all. Hope to come back to them soon.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cgreat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "John s", "ReviewID": "UR126503482", "Content": "I'm a student and I happened to travel a lot, I stayed in this nice and cousy hotel in the month of March. They mada my stay in Rome the highlight of my trip in Europe, because their accomodation was very nice and it felt like I was home. The staff was very nice and very helpful, plus the gave me tips on how to move around Rome conveniently. The position of the hotel was also convinient, it's near the Terminal station so even if I came back late, I still got the chance to come back to the hotel without a problem. The room was nice and neat and the breakfast is good and sufficient. I suggest this hotel to every traveler who wants to make his stay good in Rome.

And we stayed in different 3 Hotels: 1) Des Artistes - it was perfect, nice staff very good breakfast. 2) Then Andreotti - it's was okey, staff was not so friendly and don't speak much English. But breakfast was very good. 3) Then we came in this awful place. It's very mean place. You can decide on your own: - they didn't bring to us any new glasses - shampoo and soap only when we ask on the reception - and after last cleaning brought only one towel. It's room for two. - breakfast is very-very bad - you can take only one coffee and it' very bad and one croissant. I never see something like this before - we book our hotel through HotelTravel.com and they did a nistake in the voucher. And we had to pay but those people ask us for a 100 euros for room instead 70 like on site. And argue with us and threaten with police. It was last day in Rome and we had flight. At least if you ask such money you had provide a good service. My advice never stay in this hotel :( I'm very disappointed they screwed up the last day of our honey moon.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "\u00c5rhus", "Title": "\u201cVery good for the price\u201d", "Author": "Romelover68", "ReviewID": "UR25098436", "Content": "It is very OK, good central location.

We had gotten off the bus in Rome and needed two nights. Hotel Adventure was the first hotel available, and not too far to walk with our luggage! I did not find a problem with it. We stayed in a comfortable clean room on the fifth floor. It was quiet. The shock was the size of the bathroom, especially the shower, which I could hardly get into. The whole bathroom was approx 1m x 1m and fitted a toilet, bidet, sink & shower. The breakfasts were good, and I really enjoyed the coffee - anyway you wanted and bottomless. We paid 80 Euros a night for a double.

Advice.. check if you have a clean one! Pull out the tucked away part of your sheet and inspect for any particles. False advertising..there is no FREE internet access.
