My visits have lasted from three days to eight days. My first stay there was shortly after they opened, and I can say that the quality of rooms, service and breakfast has not faltered at all. It is a simple, low-key hotel by Tokyo standards, which I appreciate -- there are not lots of people bowing as you enter, running to the elevator to push the button for you. Instead it has an under-stated, professional and cordial staff, ready to help in any way possible. I enjoy the buffet breakfast, which offers both western and Japanese choices. There is no reason to eat lunch or dinner in the hotel.I have stayed at many hotels in Tokyo, and this is by far the quietest. In fact, I have never heard any noise from the rooms, which are located on the top floors of an office building. The location may seem a bit out of the way, but as a previous reviewer wrote, it is a five minute walk to the Mita Subway Station and only a few minutes further to the Tamachi JR Station, so you can get anywhere in Tokyo very quickly, then return to the peace and quiet of the Celestine. The rooms are a good size for Japan, and very comfortable. I should warn you that the mattresses are very firm, but you will find this nearly everywhere in the country (historically, their standard is a futon on the floor). You will have everything you need -- television with CNN and BBC, high speed internet access, and robes, towels and toiletries replaced daily.My only complaint is that it is a long ride on the Limousine Bus to and from the airport, because there are a number of other stops, which are not necessarily on the way. You can take the Narita Express train to Shinagawa Station, which is not far from the Celestine, then take a taxi to the hotel, but this is inconvenient with luggage. I will likely stay here again many times in the future, and I will do so happily.", "Date": "Jan 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR171023743", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "pinky45"}, {"Content": "Great Business Hotel I was on business here and although couldn't find many reviews decided to give it a go! It was a great location for what I wanted, it's not too far from the Tokyo Tower. It is quite a new hotel, the rooms were a good size for Japan and had flat screen TV, mini bar and free coffee/tea - also a lounge on 14th floor with free soft drinks all day. The bathroom was good too, very powerful shower. The staff were very friendly and happy to advise anything. The Mita subway station is nearby (5 min walk) and is so efficient. Breakfast and dinner is good. Would definitely recommend - even though no swimming pool or gym.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR890500889", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Mary014"}, {"Content": "Stylish and Modern Hotel I stayed in this hotel for a few days while sightseeing in Tokyo. The hotel is located in the Shiba area, right next to the NEC building and close to the Tokyo Tower. It is clean, and modern, and the reception staff are polite and fluent in English. The rooms are located on the upper three floors of the building, and the reception is on the ground floor. The hotel is clearly intended for business travellers, though it is also suitable for tourists given its central location. However, families with children will definitely feel out of place and would probably be better served elsewhere. The rooms are on the small side, but reasonably sized for central Tokyo, and they are fully featured, e.g. minibar, bath, safe, cable TV, and free Internet. There is a dining/bar area, and free drinks are provided in the reception area. The hotel is quiet inside, and the rooms are secure and kept immaculately clean. The area immediately surrounding the hotel is mainly business establishments and is perfectly safe to walk around after dark. If you walk a short way towards the nearby university you will find a range of shops and a selection of excellent restaurants. The hotel is around 5 minutes walk from the Tamachi JR station (Yamanote line), and is also very close to the Mita subway station (Mita and Asakusa lines). These stations allow you direct access all of the important areas in central Tokyo, e.g. Shinagawa, Ginza, Asakusa, and Ueno. To reach the hotel from the main Airport (Narita) you will want to take the airport train service to Tokyo station, and then the JR line to Tamachi station - this takes around 1.5 hours so you will need to leave plenty of time. To reach the hotel from the domestic airport (Haneda), you take the monorail to Hamamatsucho station and then the JR line for one stop to Tamachi station - this takes around a half hour. Do not take a taxi to/from the airport unless you are willing to spend a lot of money! In summary, this is an excellent hotel in central Tokyo that is geared primarily towards western business travellers. It is well connected to the transport system, and my stay there was pleasant and problem free.", "Date": "May 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR864079794", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "cwalton"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u56e5\u5060\u9288\u3083\u5115\u9289\u7b3a\u5064\u9289\u70aa\u5142\u9288\u67ab\u5133\u9289\u70bd\u4f29\u9287\u71b4\u4e9c   showReview(23327685, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR686130944", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u9287\u59d0\u4eed\u9287\u59d0\u4eed15"}, {"Content": "\u95ae\u6212\u7d30\u9287\ue1bb\u8151\u9287\ue1be\u669f\u7ecc\u6d2a\u6794   showReview(23089691, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR745268159", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "takeyon"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u253f\u504a\u9289\u70bd\u5062\u9287\ue1ba\u5120\u9289\ue042\u5157\u9289\u5908\u5136\u9289\u70bd\u5057\u9288\u70b9\u5157\u9289\u64b1\u5063\u9287\u5c7b\u4eed\u9288\u56e5\u4eef\u9287\u3125\u745d\u9287\u693c\u4e9c\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u9286?#x201d;   showReview(20547796, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR180314260", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "\u9287\u3123\u4eb8\u9287\u00b0\u5011\u9288\u64b1\u20ac?> \u9287\u3123\u4eb8\u9287\u00b0\u5011\u9288\u64b1\u20ac?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "Sch\u679anes Hotel, gute Lage, herrlicher Blick \u7709ber Tokio   showReview(13983408, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR870897851", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d479492-r23072009-Celestine_Hotel-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "479492", "Price": "$234"}}
