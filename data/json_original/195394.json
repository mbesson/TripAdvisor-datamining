We got into the lift and went up to the second floor where we had a smoking room. Our room was at the very end of the corridor and as we walked down, the lights flickered like some sort of horror movie. We opened the door to the room and as usual, were greeted by 90s student decor and upside-down framed paintings nailed to the wall. The mirror at the dressing table was too high up so you couldn't sit down and use it. The full length mirror was in the wardrobe and there wasn't enough room to open it as the dresser had been put against it. The tv was in the corner and not at an watchable from the bed. There was no ash tray so we had to call reception to bring one up. In the bathroom, the shower was broken, there was mould on the ceiling and only one bath towel for two people. The room was stuffy and we couldn't open the window as there were no directions and it wasn't your standard window, so we had to call reception again. We noticed Continental Breakfast cards on the bedside table and thought it would be nice to have breakfast in bed as we were going out that evening and returning late. It said that they needed to be hung on the door before 5am, so we hung them on the door at 11pm before we left. We came home at 4am and went to sleep in the uncomfortable bed. We woke up at 9:45am as we had asked for breakfast to be brought up at 10am But when we checked the door, the cards were still there. We rang reception and the woman on the desk spoke to us like we were stupid saying that we needed to have them on the door before 5am, which we did. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was brought up by the manager who apologised for the delay but demanded we pay an upfront \u00c2\u00a34 tray charge which was not stated on the Continental Breakfast sheet. We'd ordered cereal, toast, yoghurts and drinks, but there were no yoghurts and no butter for the toast, so we had to ring reception again and the manager brought us some butter but said there was no yoghurt left. If he had explained that to us when he gave us the tray rather than just leaving it, we wouldn't have had a problem. He said he'd compensate us with something else, but nothing has arrived. I'm actually sat on the bed in the hotel writing this review and we still have another night here. They don't offer refunds unless a staff member is abusive to you so there's no chance of us getting put \u00c2\u00a3110 back, but in all honesty I wouldn't pay \u00c2\u00a315 for this hotel. Funnily enough, Fawlty Towers was on the tv whilst we were getting ready to go out.

In addition, the fire door was regularly jammed open as the door closer was too weak to close the door against the resistance of the carpet pile. In bringing this to the attention of the duty manager on Saturday morning, he was very polite and apologetic, asuring me that this would be corrected by Monday at the latest. We left on Sunday afternoon with no change in the situation. I did wonder if such an approach to my safety would spill over into other areas?

If I had paid the \u00c2\u00a3330 cash price I would have been very disapointed but I have seen some reasonable deals for this place. The whole place is a bit dated but the rooms are clean as is the bedding and towells we were provided with. Bathroom was fine and the shower was great. Check in was easy, from walking in the door I was in my room inside 5 mins. Breakfast is again OK - a wide selection of hot food and continental breakfast. Service from the staff is again OK, most seem to be Eastern European and don't know much about the area but they are pleasant enough. One complaint at Breakfast was that they were removing my plate as I was finishing my last mouthfull - is that great service or just too eager?!!? The hotel is a 10/15 minute walk to the nearest Tube (Chalk Farm) and you can be in central london within 15 mins from there. All in all, no problems, clean enough hotel but I would be unhappy if I had paid \u00c2\u00a3110 a night my vouchers covered.

The carpet was stained in places and there was no air con (as previously mentioned) and the tv was an old fashioned box type as opposed to the new slim line ones.The bathroom was OK but in dire need of renovation - all the enamel was chipping away in the bath, so we just used the provided bath mat and showered instead of having a bath (which we do like to do after a long days sight seeing) We did notice that some of the rooms on the 5th floor had new carpets but not sure about new bathrooms! Our weekend break only included continental breakfast and the person checking us in for breakfast emphasised \"continental breakfast only!\" didnt ask if we would like to upgrade to Full English if we wanted. The continental breakfast was ok. Dishes cleared away very promptly but we didnt have table cloths for breakfast.

When asked why the mattresses are not checked, she replied that as they had 100 bedrooms and therefore there was not time to check mattresses!!!

This made shaving and or applying makeup a bit of a problem. We almost had to resort to braille to carry out these functions. The main problem was that on the Saturday night there was a wedding reception with an exceptionally noisy disco which seemed to vibrate the full first floor where we were staying. (We were right over the disco). Bearing in mind that a cot had been provided, what was the mindset which allocated those rooms to us. At 11.40pm I phoned reception to ask how long the disco was going to continue and was told - another hour sir. That was obviously not the right answer. They volunteered to find out and ring me back. They didn't. At midnight I went down to find out what was happening and was told that it had finished. (From reception you cannot hear anything) With that I was satisfied and went back up stairs to the bedroom and found that the noise was just as bad as ever.

The hotel (fortunately) has no control over the location and things go downhill from there. I arrived mid evening after a long journey. The room had been prebooked by my company. Unfortunately I had only just read the reviews before leaving home and hoped they were wrong. I was given the key to room number 1 which I advised was in the basement. I went to the room and found there was no window, no air conditioning and no extractor fan in the toilet/bathroom. I immediately returned to the reception and was told there were no other rooms. I pointed out that the room I had been shown was not highlighted on the website where there is talk of balconies, trouser presses and other missing amenities in the 'concrete cell'. The girl replied instantly with a 'We have no control over our website' mantra that I think had been trotted out many times before. If I had booked privately I would have walked out at that point but my accomodation had been arranged for the purpose of work and I was in an area of London I did not know. Therefore I switched to the 'make a scene in the lobby' strategy which I find often works. Suddenly Room number 18 became free. This was still in 'the dungeon' but at least had a window. The window was about 6 feet from the road and situated on a level with exhaust pipes of a busy road with lots of stationary traffic due to road works. Smelly and noisey! The curtains were designed to be closed with a pulley (missing) and finished about two inches above the window ledge. Handy by a public road. Apart from the traffic fumes and road noise the room was OK although there was still no air conditioning or toilet extractor (smelly for non traffic reasons!). There is no wi-fi available. I was booked in for breakfast. There were tinned mushrooms, tinned tomatoes, tinned peaches, tinned apricots and tinned fruit salad. A real tribute to the canning industry. You could have your eggs in any way you wished as long as they were scrambled. From the even texture, colour and watery surround I suspect they may have been powdered. On the second morning they were crowned with a scattering of parsley (not tinned!). The sausages were a cheap catering variety with a pinkish grey sludge in the centre that was probably suitable for vegetarians and surrounded with collagen skins. There was a tray each of ham, salami and cheese on the first morning. The quantities diminished day by day and they were not even re-arranged to fill the gaps. By day three the ham and cheese looked a little sorry and the salami did not even put in an appearance (lost the tin opener?!?). On the last morning the breafast room was 10 minutes late opening and the waiter was stressed. It was a little unnerving to see him ripping open the sliced bread wrappers and fondling each slice with his uncovered hands as he arranged them by the toaster. There did not appear to be many private travellers around but there were a number of teams of workers staying at the hotel who, from their vans and clothing, were in the civil engineering and associated fields. Yeoman stock all but you do get a good grounding in some basic Anglo-Saxon expletives! All in all an unsatisfactory experience that my company paid well in excess of a \u00c2\u00a3100 per night for.

Main reservation about the hotel was its location which was about a 10 minute walk (up a wee bit of a hill) from Chalk Farm Tube Station, we'd previously stayed in Russell Square which is much more central and seems a nicer area.

I'll start by explaining that I'm a veteran business traveller and have stayed in many hotels in the UK and Europe. I am currently employed by a company with a head office near Hampstead so I stay in the area approx once a month. I usually stay at the Premier Inn, however, it was fully booked and so my colleague put me in the Brittania for two nights instead. Briefly, the hotel is in need of major, full refurbishment. There were gaps around the rotten window frames in my room. The decor was very poor (both in taste and condition) and there were stains on the furnishings and carpets. One of the two lifts broke down shortly after I arrived and so this led to long waits for the working lift. On night one, I was on the 3rd floor, I think. (As soon as I saw the room I complained and tried to change it but they were full) The noise levels there are unbearable due to sound reflecting off the block of flats opposite. I had to sleep with the windows open due to the excessive heat (there was no air conditioning and it was so hot that I had to sleep naked!). I got no sleep as it was very noisy outside - street cleaners, ambulances and fire engines - not to mention the normal traffic noise. Oh, and the bus stop outside just adds to the engine noise! In the morning I complained and insisted on a different room for the 2nd night. I was given one near the end of the top floor. These rooms were of a better standard than the lower floors, but even this standard was the bare minimum of what I would have expected. Again, it was terribly hot and I had to sleep with the windows open, but the room was much less noisy than the previous one. TIP - you must request a room that is NOT opposite the large block of flats, this will be quieter. Also, there are no nets at the hotel windows so the flats just look into the hotel rooms! Parking - the car park is ridiculously small and takes approx 8 cars. Some spaces are taken by staff. The on street parking is not available until 6.30pm, so if you arrive when the car park is full there is nowhere to park until the restrictions are lifted at 6.30pm. I got there around 5pm both days - on day 1 I had to haggle with a builder who was trying to get the last parking space - I won!! On day 2 I got the last space. Fortunately, my manager came up to my hotel room when I booked in and so she saw how bad it was - or else I wouldn't have expected anyone to believe me! We now reschedule company meetings if the Premier is full, rather than expect me to stay in the Brittania.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWOULD HAVE BEEN OK IF WE HAD NOT BEEN IN THEBASEMENT\u201d", "Author": "Ted1037", "ReviewID": "UR74718970", "Content": "The room was large and comfortable with a good bathroom, the only problem was it was in the basement in the far corner of the building.

The restraunt was ok and the food a reasonable price but a limiited menu, there was only one public internet access but it is close to pubs, shops, laundrymat etc. While we were there the front drive was blocked every day by Builders vehicles making it very difficult for taxis and hire cars to stop outside. The enterance is by a revolving door which makes it very difficult to get your bags in and out.

Overall the room and bathroom were clean but I hated being in a basement room the lack of a window or natural light was awful. On arrival the receptionist was very helpful (we were really early) she took our luggage and locked it away for us, but on our return we were faced by a totally different person who was snippy and rude to everyone. After a hot night we were anxious to get breakfast and leave for the day, on our return we were subjected to the receptionist having a heated debate with another guest, on return to our room we found that a floor fan had been left for us, this was a blessed relief as a I didn't know how I was going to sleep another night in 'the cave'. After breakfast, (which was okay) my husband asked the receptionist to book a taxi for us, when we checked out he asked her if it was black cab or a minicab she then went onto say we NEVER phone black cabs and you asked for a taxi at 11am, its only 10.30, he was only asking what type of taxi was picking us up, then she barked, take a seat or wait outside! We were glad to leave, the experience overall was not good at the end of our holiday, To be honest we were to tired to argue the point with the staff, the basement room was not what I would have expected but to be fair when you looked up the building from street level it doesn't look as if those rooms are better and reading the reviews they seem to be worse. The other thing was that there was a wedding on at the hotel on the Saturday night and as our room was below the reception area it sounded like there was a stampeding heard of elephants above us.

However, the girl on reception was most friendly and although we had arrived almost two hours before the set check-in time we were promptly given our room key and directed to the room. The room was on the second floor and was an adequate size for a double room. Although we had specified a non-smoking room on our booking, the room smelled of stale smoke. The bathroom was slightly musty and while clean could have been doing with a good old fashioned scrub with the use of some elbow grease!! The wardrobes were dusty and the window - framing the not so beautiful view of the back of a neighboring block of flats - was filthy... Also, the window, of the old fashioned sliding variety, was jammed open and refused to close! (more on this later....!) Having unpacked we went downstairs for a spot of lunch in the bar. The menu was limited and after a lengthy wait I set off in search of someone to take our order... Finally an unfriendly lady in a suit appeared and I was barked at as I placed the order, only to be told that all the ingredients for what I had ordered were not available. Having waited a considerable time she finally re-emerged from the kitchen and almost threw the plates in front of us. The food itself was not great. A trend which was followed with breakfast the following morning. Having spend the day touring London, which the hotel was conveniently located for, we returned to the hotel tired that night. The room was stuffy in the warm June heat, but even with the heat I again attempted to close the window slightly to prevent all sorts of night-time creatures from joining us in the room. However, this was to no avail as the window would not budge. With the window still open we closed the curtains and settled in for the night - only to be awoken at 5.30am by a family of pigeons balancing themselves on our window sill. A most unpleasant awaking!! On entering the dining room for breakfast, we were greeted by a most unpleasant young man, who told us to hurry up as breakfast was finishing in ten minutes. This at 9.45am when breakfast was to be available until 10am and indeed at 9.55am the kitchen staff promptly arrived and started to remove the platters from the serving area. The food itself was again poor, the selection very limited and the tea/coffee cold - we did not return for breakfast the following morning! As we were leaving the hotel for the day we asked the receptionist (a different girl from our friendly girl the previous day) to ring a taxi for us. She did so however the taxi company contracted to the hotel could not get us to our destination, which turned out to only 5 minutes walk away....

Situated on the fifth floor, its decore was old fashioned and sparse and the walls and ceilings displayed damp patches and dirty marks. The bathroom was dirty and the shower fittings hadn't been cleaned for god knows how long and had gunge oozing from them. The kettle provided for the tea and coffee facilities had black bits floating in the bottom which were coming off the rusty/burnt element so didn't both to make a drink. The radiators didn't work at night and the room was cold. When this was reported to reception the response was that we couldn't be moved because hotel was full and they didn't have spare heaters but we could have a bottle of wine if we wished to help keep out the cold. We declined their offer as didn't see how this would help our seven year old son! The food provided in the evening was not nice at all. A hot buffet style, the meat was kept warm on hotplates and was dried and curled up. The only saving grace this hotel had was that the reception staff were helpful and the breakfast was edible and satisfactory.

I was very anxious as there were some bad reviews but booked it regardless. I must say it was the right decision as this hotel had so many good features- much more than the small unimportant features that pernickety people had pointed out. On arrival at the hotel we were extremely concerned as the outside was very dated with large windows which made it look like a hospital. However, on entering the building there was a welcoming reception, a pleasant bar and a nice looking breakfast room. As we arrived at 8am and check in wasn't until 2pm the hotel staff allowed us to leave our luggage- Free of charge! They were extremely helpful and friendly throughout our stay- i cannot stress this enough. My friend and I didn't want to book tickets for the theater from home as icy conditions made us unsure of whether we would even make it to london. Anyway, we booked tickets in london and the hotel were more than happy to print off our reservation- free of charge. After checking out, the hotel staff let us leave our stuff again. They then let us into the luggage room, go and change in the toilets, put stuff back in the room and leave for a night out before returning again to pick up outr luggage and leave for our bus. They were fine when we left our bags from 12pm-10:30pm! They were always wishing us a good day/night and really made our visit pleasant- especially when the majority of people that we encountered in London were rude, patronising and obnoxious! So i'll sum up points about the hotel that i found to be true (rather than writing an essay on each point! haha): - It is rather dated with flowery wall paper but it is spotlessly clean with maid service daily. - When i was there refurbishment work was starting- beginning on the 4th floor so soon the hotel should be completely rennovated- after that i have no idea what people could complain about! - clean towels daily - Less than a 10 minute walk from chalk farm underground and extremely easy to find - Neighbourhood is a quiet town- but felt extremely safe walking home. - Amazingly helpful staff - full english breakfast, continental food also available. I would suggest arriving for breakfast earlier though as stuff was there and still hot at 9:45/10pm but selection wasn't as big (understandable) - Fully functioning lifts - television with freeview, ensuite bathroom, tea and coffee facilities. - only ever had to change once on the underground. so basicly its (at the most) 2 subways away from madame tussades, london dungeons, victoria, kings cross, oxford street, london bridge, piccadilly circus etc. - It is in zone 2 so it is cheap to reach via the underground. A daily zone 1 and zone 2 ticket costs between \u00c2\u00a35 and \u00c2\u00a37 depending on the time of day and most if not all attractions are in these zones. We never travelled out of zone 11 and 2 and went to the london eye, big ben, the aquarium, london dungeons, madame tussauds, oxford street, piccadilly circus, london bridge, westminster abbey etc. Basicly it is a cheap, extremely clean hotel which is extremely close to everything you would want in london.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCould do better\u201d", "Author": "Hector1", "ReviewID": "UR53307615", "Content": "Thankfully only stayed for a couple of nights.

The bar menu, the buffet and then they have this other menu that know one seemed to know when it was good for? The bar menu is simple ,as it should be, but the food quality wasn't up to par for what they were charging. Hamburgers were better quality at a cabbie stop than here. That was my daughter's opinion and ,after tasting both, I agreed. The buffet was dreadful. We tried it once for breakfast. Watery scrambled eggs and luke warm. Bacon was dry and rubbery. The suasage was a mushy and flavourless. All for 21 GBP total for 2 people. Now this is my primary complaint. The morning that we ate breakfast they had run out of glasses for juice. The reason? The staff was fussing over the money in the till and who had paid, who hadn't paid and this was the norm for the restaraunt for our entire visit to the hotel. It took them ten minutes to realize they were out of juice glasses just from their disorganization. I don't really think they have from a customers view thought out how the flow should work. You enter the main lobby and then from there you walk into the bar area and from there is the main dining area. To get a drink form the bar you have to back around the front to the main desk to tell them you want to order. If you approach the main dining area the first thing you see is the till to the right. people we saw were confused as to where to sit in order to get service. Do you sit down first ? Do you pay first? Overall an excellent stay and if we go back to London we would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cDid the job!\u201d", "Author": "NickBristol", "ReviewID": "UR26756955", "Content": "We went to a concert at the Forum in Kentishtown and found this hotel to be in the ideal location to use as a base for the evening concert and then a shopping trip in central London the next day The reception was good and the hotel generally ok - just a bit dated in decor.

It is in a good location with great access to Central London by tube or bus. It is not expensive, myself and my wife stayed for two nights (room 516) at a rate of either \u00c2\u00a389 (double room only) or \u00c2\u00a3110 (double room and breakfast) per night and one great perk is the fact that parking is free for the duration of the stay. In terms of the quality of the hotel it is extremely poor. The rooms are very dated, the furniture is shabby, the beds should have been burned ten years ago and the whole place does smell with a combination of damp, decay, cooking fat and stale beer. We did try the breakfast one morning but gave up after the first mouthful, the scrambled egg were luke warm and had a texture as though they had been mixed on the floor of the car park prior to cooking, the hash browns - well lets just say it is a rare talent that can make hash browns with no potato. I literally spat out my first attempt at eating them. In terms of cleanliness - the bed linen was changed each day but due to the overall 'feel' of the hotel nothing ever seemed to be clean, the whole place just feels rank. The staff were very good, efficient, courteous and knowledgeable and you just have to feel sorry for them as I am sure they have to contend with a constant barrage of complaints throughout their working day so how they manage to maintain such a positive front is remarkable. So who is this hotel suited to? romantic weekend - no, family holiday - no, suffers of allergies - no, business executives - no, construction staff working away from home - yes. Don't want this to sound pretentious but in it's current state that is exactly the type of client that this hotel will suit, guys who are away from home during the week who are out to work early, do a hard days graft and then want to get back, have a shower, a few drinks in the bar and then bed - perfect. But the main advantage of this hotel is the free parking - if you are in Central London for a few days mid week it will cost at least \u00c2\u00a310 per day for the congestion charge, then say to park a car in a central London car park for a day another \u00c2\u00a340, so when you factor this into account, staying at the hotel and then getting the tube into London for day, you can reduce the room rate by a good \u00c2\u00a350 per day so really the best way of looking at this hotel isn't to say it is a hotel at all, but to look upon it as an upmarket car park! As the title to this review suggests consider other alternatives before booking into this hotel, otherwise I am sure the vast majority of people WILL be disappointed. Do not book the breakfast, there are two good cafe's within a two minute walk that offer great food, cheaper than the cost of the breakfast.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashbourne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPoor Value,Shabby Rooms.\u201d", "Author": "stevemacAshbourne", "ReviewID": "UR20526671", "Content": "Hello, I hated this hotel,the price was simply a rip off.The hotel maybe well positioned,but the rooms are awful.There is no matress cover,the beds are uncomfortable.The rooms are falling apart.

We arrived there for a late check-in on a Saturday night to find a raucous nightclub going on in the hotel bar and the lobby filled with degenerate teenagers (we overheard one saying to another: \"Touch my iPhone and I'll slice you!\") Not exactly a warm welcome. As we were at the front desk, we heard another guest complaining to the receptionist about the noise from the nightclub. The receptionist rudely told him there was nothing more they could do but have the music turned down, and that the party would end by 1:30am! (Sorry - isn't a hotel for sleeping?!) This was not a good sign. However, because we had pre-paid for the room, we went ahead and checked in anyway. Unfortunately our room was on the 1st floor directly above the nightclub/bar so the noise and base were ridiculously loud and the receptionist refused to move us, claiming all rooms were booked. To make matters worse, the room itself was fithly. There was dust and grime on every surface and the bathroom was repulsive. Not only did it look like it hadn't been cleaned, whomever had last been there didn't even bother to flush the toilet!! Truly disgusting. We tried to settle in eventually, and complained to the hotel night manager several times about the music, and he basically couldn't care less.
