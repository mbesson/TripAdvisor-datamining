We had stayed here before and weren't impressed, but the convenience made it tolerable. That was not the case this time. The bed was horrible -- one of those cheap fake mattresses that have a hard edge. We got a very poor quality of sleep, not exactly how you want to start a vacation. Then, we took their shuttle to the airport the next morning and the driver was extremely rude to us and the other passengers. We were the only ones who tipped her and problably shouldn't have after the way she acted. We just didn't want to lower ourselves to her level. When we returned from vacation, we called the hotel and told them we were outside on the curb with our luggage and even though the hotel is less than a quarter of a mile away, we waited at least 20 min. for the van to show up. We watched the Holiday Inn, Day's Inn and Adam's Mark vans circle the airport numerous times, pick up passengers and return to the airport again while we waited. Then, when the driver arrived, we waved to him to signal that we were his passengers and he stopped at the very end of the pull-up area even though the curb area in front of us was unoccupied because we were the only ones still waiting on a shuttle. We had to pull our luggage clear to the end of area while he stood and waited on us never offering to help. Then we rode to the hotel with the air conditioning turned off and only his front (driver) window open.

The hotel is at the end of a road leading to a business office, and it's behind another hotel so it was not easy to see right away, but it's still easy to find. The building looks fairly new, and the lobby and room were clean and modern. The room itself was a typical size with two queen beds. There was enough room to move around.

Also, it's the only hotel in the airport area that does not provide a airpot shuttle bus (informed by the cabby driver). And it's only a 5 min drive to the airport!
