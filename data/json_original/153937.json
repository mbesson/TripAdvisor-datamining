In fact we only found out about the ball when we came back to the hotel and discovered tables and a stage being set up.The noise was incredible - with huge speakers blasting around the atrium so that even the bedroom door (on the third floor) reverebrated. Even with ear plus in, I couldn't get any sleep until 4am. It wasn't amusing either for my heavily pregnant wife.The staff at the hotel were totally unsympathetic and quite surly when I complained the next day. Some form of apology would have been nice but it wasn't forthcoming. One just gets the impression that they do this all the time and that the business from hosting all night balls is clearly more important to them than revenues from guests who have paid good money for a room supposedly to sleep in.Take my advice - steer clear.

We were told that our room was far from the noise; however, this was not true. Our room was on the top floor, but that didn't prevent us from hearing the very loud party that went on until 4:00 am because the lobby is open. We saw very few other guests during the time we stayed at the hotel and wondered if the hotel made most of its money from renting out that stupendous lobby. Aside from a noisy Saturday night, our stay was fine. The only other complaint that I have is that the hotel does not seem clean. It is our impression that the cleaning crew merely makes up the bed and replaces the bath towels. Having given our negative feedback, it is only fair to list some positive points. The location is wonderful; you're within walking distance of the National Palace, for example. And the hotel staff is friendly and accommodating. In addition, we were pleasantly surprised to find a business room containing two computers, both with access to the internet, for the hotel guests. The lobby-level restaurant serves a wonderful brunch during the week. And, that lobby is so beautiful that it's listed in tour guides as something to see in the Zocalo. The birds in the enormous wrought-iron cages in the lobby are some of the vestiges of the aging hotel's former glory.I probably would not stay here again.", "Date": "Sep 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR957660057", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Travelbug5000"}, {"Content": "Beautiful hotel in good location This hotel is located away from the main tourist spot in Mexico city which is the Zona Rosa. It is however fabulously located for the Zocalo, the cathedral and for Templo Mayor in the heart of the Historic Centre. The hotel itself is very imposing in a beautiful building. The inside is based around an enormous foyer with a Tiffany ceiling and Art Deco ironwork. The big foyer is however used for weddings and other parties. We were there over a Saturday evening, and when we arrived we were asked to sign a letter to say that we knew that there would be a noisy wedding there and that we had been informed and waived any right to claim compensation for noise. We appreciated being informed, but not being asked to sign waivers. And it was noisy, but we slept reasonably well with ear plugs. The hotel room was large and luxurious, as was the bathroom. We had a safe and mini bar, AC and all the usual stuff. Service in the hotel was a bit indifferent and they didn't always carry out things that they had promised to do. Our room didn\u9225\u6a9b overlook the street, which was just as well as drummers played until late in the square and the traffic was very busy. Not many places to eat nearby, but having said that, we did eat very well. We ate at two of the big nearby hotels which had terraces overlooking the square, which was a fabulous sight in the evening, being full of dancers and music. Our best meal was at the place which is on the top floor of the building next to the Holiday Inn overlooking the square, where they sell Mexican artisan goods. We didn\u9225\u6a9b eat dinner in the hotel, although the menu looked good.

We, too, were presented with a disclaimer to sign.We were able to flee the night of the noisy event to a very nice hotel two doors down on the Zocalo and were spared paying for the noisy night in question. As we returned from dinner the next evening, we encountered two other refugees from theCiudad's noise checking into our new hotel. The Gran Ciudad is lovely, but the rooms, while nice, are not as architecturally chichi as the decor in the interior atrium. By all means, stop by the Gran Ciudad Hotel, check out the great atrium and the stunning tiffany glass ceiling, but don't stay there. It seems the management finds loud parties too lucrative to turn down. Because the hotel rooms are situated around the central atrium, sound does indeed carry.

This hotel is gorgeous, but with the absolute worst service and overall accomodations I have ever experienced. I made my reservation one month in advance, but when I arrived the reservation was not in the system. No problem, I thought, I have the confirmation number and printed proof of my online reservation. The girl at the check out desk was rude and literally shrugged her shoulders. Luckily, the manager stepped in and found us a room. However, he said we'd need to switch rooms the next day. When we went to the new room, it had one tiny double bed. This despite the fact that we were registered as three people. I called to inquire, talking to the same shoulder shrugger as the previous day. She offered nothing, saying the hotel was full. I asked if there was a cot they could roll in. She huffed -- literally -- and said there wasn't enough space in the room. I convinced her that there was and finally she agreed to check on it. So, all seemed decent. Then, as we were leaving in the afternoon, the eye roller stopped us and asked to sign an agreement. The agreement said there was going to be a wedding reception in the hotel and we agreed to the fact that music would be playing from 9-3 a.m. Did we have a choice but to sign? No! It was either agree or leave. At this point we were literally on our way out the door and didn't have it in us to sacrifice a day in the city to find new accomodations. We signed. The party ended at 5 a.m. I got absolutely so sleep, completely lost the next day. The manager offered nothing.

I haven't got a bad word to say about it. However, if you want a quieter location, this hotel is right in the thick of things  you'd probably be advised to stay elsewhere in Mexico City or at least choose the rooms away from hustle  bustle of the Zocalo which had an all-night Easter rock concert during our stay.
