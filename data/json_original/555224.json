The best T however was the train sub, near to Andrew T and with its own bus to the station this Hotel reaches most of Boston, ill supplied with maps and tea in the rooms and decent Planning but filled with built form of each sort of an Architect's dreams, without coordination, but the Big Dig made Boston walkable apart from the tree roots and some of the paved brick that has come apart. Watch your feet for the pieces of metal sticking in the paving in odd places and the litter. Boston needs a Big Vacuum on a large mechanized machine. Machines are large in Boston, that alone makes it a good Boys visit, the white line crossings need care, but if they turn in and run you down as a bookshop lady complained at lunchtime they are liable. The Hotel was large also, the room great, the bed giant, the bathroom well maintained, the plumber very pleasant although we blocked his toilet late Saturday night, the desk people were great, the help in Boston is good, the books and people working charity for children superb. The coffee was American!, the tea absent except in the main concourse, plenty of it, the Hazelnut Milk is great in coffee. Internet OK, relaxation and the Jacuzzi and swim small but very welcome and well maintained. The staff would talk with us that made it great. Very accommodating, I think we were not the easiest customers as first English to land from Somerset ? with questions on simple matters. Breakfast here is booked at table but was great. Wife made and filled herself with Waffle, not her usual trend! This site is fairly new it will become better as companies take over empty sites, the traditional housing around was good, we also saw some coastal and old town, very pretty in summer I expect, we were snowed and poured upon, so felt the pain of cotton millers, but when it was shut for commercial reasons they were earning a much better pay than UK equivalent, so hard work long hours and dangerous to health but in the hey day of USA it would have been high living. However what Union workers actually get from company one knows not. The place is still colonial and very well run by the Mexican and Caribbean work force, African American Indian features are common so one is not completely overrun by Boston finance and high rise, streets wide except in old brick paved. The Hotel was a mine of information of a helpful nature and always there to help with a good smile. However if you go inside Spring Winter take Clothing or Visit Macy's the hotel was well heated but you cannot escape Boston winds and it is dry and desiccating for West Coast English, so after landing buy hand cream, lip salve, plenty to drink, everything is bulk and the rental would be good as they will not allow the wonderful fish slab cooking in the rooms. But stick rigidly with the rules on travel and accommodation, the TSA took the lock off my case, I thought I had been robbed, then left a courteous note inside of a routine check, so I was glad there was no dirty washing, as you can wash everything at this hotel or send it out if you prefer. I took too much but was very glad of the woollens and coat, hats you need hats and gloves, Great visit, thank you. Never saw a Beaver, they obvioulsy have more sense than us English in winter and deserts as the saying goes about the midday sun. Do visit the Muddy. Take a boat trip too. All well set up and wander about with a camera and a pencil, you can draw at Isabella Gardener it is encouraged, they have my eraser my wife \"put back\" so you can use that too, it is a High Quality Craft shop version for the airplane, which was not as tedious as expected, or buy one of the eraser bears you can find in shops.

I stayed over the weekend for one night at the Courtyard South Boston. I was underwhelmed by this hotel, it's average. The room had a decent view. The hotel only has 6 floors so ask for a room on a higher floor if you want a view. The check in clerk seemed busy at our 3'sh check in time but the room was ready. The good: -free parking and a very easy trip into Boston. We had no issues (once we figured out where the hotel was) with getting in/out of the city from this location. -convenient to shopping (target, best buy, etc) if you forgot anything at home -no bedbugs, at least in our room. I check every single time in every hotel I'm in. -wasn't as noisy at night as staying in the city itself. I travel a lot for work so I'm used to it but when traveling with my kid for a random trip, I want him to sleep well. The bad: -my room was not 100% clean. There were hairs in the sink and on the bathroom floor. There were also a few on the blanket. There was an empty ice cream box on the floor with a wrapper/stick in it. We did not complain about this and just picked them up with a tissue. They seemed really busy and that's probably what they would have done anyway. -our TV would not work right at first, the lady at the front desk was nice about it and they came up to fix it while we were at dinner. Minor annoyance, but still, I usually don't have problems like this. One of the marriotts I stayed in had a glass of wine waiting! -the air conditioning was really loud in our room when it is gearing up to reach the temperature on the thermostat. We just wound up shutting it off in the middle of the night, it kept waking the kid/me. Could just be an older room, I'd test it during waking hours if you are staying there. Not their fault but the people next door to us started smoking in their room in the morning. My kid has asthma so we had to check out early. They nicely offered to move us to a different room for the couple of hours but it just wasn't worth it. We just headed to our destination earlier.

After check-in, we dropped our luggage and were out in the City most of the day. Got back to the facility in late evening. Tried to use bathroom and then the real issue encountered. First the bathroom has an enclosed shower; however, the enclosure requires a ceiling height glass door (probably about 5/8\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thick) to pull in the ledge to prevent the water from running into the rest of the bathroom floor. The door was too heavy that it must have bent the hinges and the door cannot be closed at all.

You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even use the toilet without getting your feet wet. Raised this concern to the front office staff. Literally brought the staff to the room and showed the issue. Their response \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sorry about it and we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything at this hour. Tell us in the morning (Sunday) before we leave the facility and see if we can fix it. On Sep 18 morning, we left the facility a daylong outing in the city and prior to leaving, we reminded their staff to fix the issue. We returned back early evening hours. Upon entering the facility, we asked the front desk if they had fixed the issue. The staff acted with a strange face \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as if they are not aware of any issue to be fixed. Total shock.

Other issues observed: mold in shower, the room door lock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c makes too much noise that it wakes up the guests. This issue seems to be prevalent to all locks in the facility.

One would think that the housekeeping staff would check some of these basic stuff. It does not seem to be case. The facility looks pleasant from outside. They do provide a shuttle service to the airport - for $5 per person; we did not use this. We did not use other services such as bar, breakfast services and gyms that it offers. I would have given higher rating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if we did not have encountered the above issues.

I had to request another room, the night clerk thought he could send someone up to kill the mouse but I knew that was not practical. It had already ran for cover under the bed and into whatever hole it came out of probably. So they did move my room and te rest of the night was uneventful however the next morning when I spoke to the manager he said they'd have to look into it. He called me later that day and said there was no sign of a mouse and therefore could not make any compensation. He actually made me feel like he thought I was lying. I had even given them the particular snack that the mouse was eating and he said it didn't look like a mouse had been eating it. i requested they setup a trap with that foodstuff in it and they would probably catch a mouse but I never heard back from them.

The area surrounding the hotel is just residential, there isnt much there to be honest, although we did happen to find a great restaurant round the corner for breakfast. The hotel was clean, spacious and the rooms were an amazing size and standard considering it was only a three star hotel. The hotel staff went beyond the call of duty to help us brits find our way around Boston and we couldnt have done a lot of it without the help of the reception staff. The only minor complaint I had, was eating in the restaurant for breakfast etc was very expensive and although the food was good we didnt do it again. Another small niggle was we were told there was a shuttle bus that picks you up from the airport, that is true but you need to ring the hotel first. Maybe it is slightly naive of us but we assumed that the bus would just be there, we were unaware that we had to call first and ending up spending 20 dollars on a cab. I'm pretty certain this was just our stupidity though! We loved Boston and we wpuld definately stay at this hotel again.

The hotel seems more for a crowd that is looking for peace and quiet. The pool/hot tub area is small, but great for couples. The lobby has a nice bar area and a free computer station (awesome!) but would not be an appropriate place for children to be let loose. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I know some complain about the location, but in all reality, we had no problems whatsoever. Our GPS found it perfectly fine, the T station is literally a 3-4 minute walk, and you pass a Dunkin Donuts right on the way if you want to grab a quick breakfast before heading into the city. The restaurant that does the food delivery for the hotel is 224 Boston. That restaurant is delicious! If you don't want to order in and pay the delivery prices, the restaurant is a 5 minute walk from the hotel and safe enough to walk to. I recommend the lobster mac n' cheese or the salmon.

From Andrew, you are 2 stops from South Station, where you can take the Silver Line Bus to Logan Airport.

The room was huge, twice the size of rooms I'm used to. I was afraid I might be under a family of kids but it was relatively quiet during my 2-night stay.

We weren't able to book a hotel downtown on an October weekend. The cheapest price for a three-star was twice what we had paid for a four-star in August 2008.

You will not have the best view, the best food, the best location, or the best rooms you've ever stayed in. You won't tell your friends that they just HAVE to stay in this hotel when they come to Boston the next time. That being said, this hotel is just fine. The rooms are spacious, clean and new. All amenities (e.g. free internet) are taken nicely accounted for. You'll sleep well in these beds. Free parking is another cost to consider when comparing to downtown hotels. The hotel itself seems to be in a safe if nondescript neighbourhood. If you want to take the subway, the station itself (Andrews Square) has some grubby-looking characters milling around that one will see in any big city and other most parts of Boston, but no one gave us any trouble or even asked for spare change. If you're not accustomed to big cities, or are elderly or a single woman walking alone, it might be wise to cab it after dark, but that could go for just about anywhere in Boston outside Fannueil Hall. I'd reiterate what an earlier poster said about directions to this hotel. If you are driving, get your directions directly from the hotel website. Do NOT use google maps or the like. Type in the hotel address into Google maps and you'll arrive a mile or so south of the hotel. We grabbed a taxi twice at night from around Boston Common back to the hotel and the fare was less than $11 before tip each time (no traffic to speak of) so it's not too far away even if you initially think the hotel's in the middle of nowhere.

The ride from the airport was only 10 minutes but unfortuantely it was a 40 minute wait before we were picked up. We had a problem with the ride back to the airport as well. We called the front desk the night before to request pick up in the lobby at 9:30am, unfortunately, our ride left without us because our name wasn't on the list for pick up for some reason. I have to say, the front desk clerk was very sympathetic and sprung to action. He called a cab company and said the hotel would pick up the tab. And when the cab company was taking too long, he arranged for another staff member to drive us in the hotel van...so we made our flight in time. Our only other complaint was the breakfast.

Overall, we were very pleased with the accommodations and would definitely stay here again. Our stay started off well. We called for the free shuttle van pick-up from the airport and it arrived within about 15 minutes, the time it takes to get to the hotel. The hotel appears to have been built recently and most everything looked new. Check-in took about 1 minute and we were given a room on a high floor, which had a nice view of the Boston skyline (we were able to watch the fireworks from our window). The room was only average-sized, but was very clean and had all the basic amenities you might need. The room temperature was controlled by a digital thermostat and the AC worked great. The television had a very large channel selection. The bed was comfortable, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slept on softer mattresses at other Courtyards before. The pillows were soft and numerous. The bathroom was very clean and of average size. The room also had a refrigerator and the carpeting and sheets appeared to be very new. This hotel is not in the downtown area, but we got a very good rate for that very reason. The Andrew T stop was only a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and just two stops from downtown Boston. It is very possible to be in downtown Boston within 15-20 minutes from the moment you walk out of your hotel room. For this minor inconvenience you can save a lot of money on your hotel room and not have to pay for a taxi from the airport. I found the area to be quite safe and the comments from other reviewers about the area are overblown. Right next door to the hotel is a shopping center where you can eat at Applebee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Olive Garden, or shop at Stop N Shop, Target, Marshall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Best Buy, or Old Navy. We recommend taking the 16 bus from the Andrew station (or in front of the Stop N Shop) to the Franklin Park Zoo (contrary to the sign at the corner of Washburn and Boston Streets, it does not stop there). Adult admission is only $12.00 and the bus ride was 15 minutes. The hotel also had a nice pool and hot tub area that was open until 10:00 pm every night. The pool water was not cold and the hot tub temperature was just right. The staff was very friendly. When I asked if there was a microwave in the lobby area, the concierge offered to have one delivered to my room, which they did 10 minutes later. The hotel also had two free internet stations for guests to use and a free coffee stand. We did not use the fitness room, which was open 24/7. Maid service was excellent. The grounds were nicely landscaped and impeccably clean. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what I paid per night. I purchased a vacation package on Priceline.com (4 days/3 nights, fees, taxes, and roundtrip airfare for 2 from NYC for only $660.00 total). I just know I got a very good rate and I would absolutely stay here again. This was not the Four Seasons, but it was a great value for the accommodations we received. Marc T.

Was looking forward to the hotel after reading the rave reviews and was prepared for the location away from downtown. The shuttle service was pretty fast at picking us up from Logan and took us straight to the hotel. We were informed that the shuttle only runs to the airport, and would not run us to downtown. However, the front desk staff had in-depth, printed directions on how to walk to the nearest train station (Andrew) which was only five minutes away. The area around the hotel was somewhat quirky. It was semi-industrial and residential, and located close to a huge shopping centre with a Target and Old Navy. We walked to downtown on Massachusetts Ave several times, and even though it was a somewhat run-down area, we didn't feel unsafe or in harms way. However, there were homeless people and a meth clinic along the way, so it is somewhat dodgy. The walk to the train station was easy and very safe. The rooms were very clean and in good shape. Beds were comfortable, the pillows were perfect, and the decor was nice. The views weren't great, and were mostly of the 93, but we weren't in the room enough to care. The only other quirk was a lack of blankets on the beds. Nights can be a little chill The staff was very helpful and was always polite and courteous. The accomodated us by holding our luggage after check out until our evening flight and arranged for Enterprise-Rent-A-Car to deliver a car for us at the hotel. Huge kudos to them! Another HUGE perk was plentiful free parking, which wouldn't be possible in a downtown hotel. Finally, the restaurant had a breakfast buffet that was $12.95 and considering that it was a hotel restaurant (where prices are usually exagerrated), it wasn't a bad deal. There were waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, cereals, muffins, fruit, and bagels. The waitress was interesting. The first day we ate there she was extremely attentive and was very fast. She had excellent service and was very friendly. The second day we ate there she was stressed over an issue in the kitchen as we would hear her screaming in Spanish in there, and was forgetful of our orders and dumped all her personal problems on us. Not the most relaxing breakfast. Overall, the Marriott Courtyard was an excellent hotel with clean rooms, wonderful front-line staff, and stellar service.

Every aspect of my stay met or exceeded my expectations. The hotel is only about 5 \u00c2\u00bd miles South of Boston Logan Airport. However, picking up my rental car at about 5:00 PM, it took about a half hour to get to my hotel due rush hour traffic and my not being familiar with the area. A landmark to look out for when heading to the hotel is the large square storage building that tries to look like a fortress. The hotel is very close by. The entrance of the hotel is dramatic, especially by Courtyard standards. There is plenty of free parking all around the hotel. Check-in was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marriott fast,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd taking less than a minute. I had reserved a King room which was guaranteed and requested a high floor. My room, #429 met both requirements. I was able to get an AAA rate of $139 per night which I thought was very good. My room was beautiful. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is contemporary and comfortable. The king bed was very comfortable and had a selection of both feather and poly-fill pillows. There were night stands and wall mounted lights on each side of the bed. I appreciated the fact that there was an outlet on the lamp into which I could plug my cell phone. Across from the bed was a large unit which contained the clothes closet, held the TV, and was also the work desk. The TV had a large number of cable channels, but I was surprised that there was no Pay Per View programming. The desk had a very comfortable office-style chair. The hotel offers complimentary high speed internet service via a Cat 5 cable. I was able to connect to our company VPN easily. Running the Speakeasy Internet Speed Test showed a download speed of just over 1MBPS and an upload speed of about 700KBPS, reasonable fast. Opposite the desk were a queen-size sofa bed, coffee table, and floor lamp. The couch was comfortable, but I did not try the sofa bed. Lighting in the room was very good. From the window I could see the back side of a mall and downtown Boston in the far distance. The hotel restaurant is only open for breakfast, but the hotel has an arrangement with a local restaurant for room service. I did not try the room service, but did have breakfast at the hotel the next morning. The breakfast buffet was $10.95 and included cooked-to-order eggs and omelets. There was also a good selection of breakfast buffet items. The hotel is located in primarily a residential neighborhood. The homes are fairly old, but it seemed like a nice neighborhood to me. If it had not been below freezing, I would have walked around. All aspects of service at the Courtyard were excellent. I asked for directions to get back on the freeway and instead of handing me a map, the front desk associate took me outside and pointed out the way to go which I thought was an example of great service.

The staff were generally very friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and clean. We had no complaints about the hotel itself other than the location. As two young British women, we found the neighbourhood wasn't good - even during the daytime. We were accosted by people regularly just on the walk to the T. We didn't feel particularly safe and it wasn't a great location for a holiday hotel when you don't have a car. ( We stayed later at the Holiday Inn Select, Government Centre, which was much better - It was central, you could walk pretty much everywhere and the Beacon Hill area was really nice too).", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "Family_two_boys", "ReviewID": "UR8379665", "Content": "We recently stayed at this hotel for six nights and really liked it - especially the proximity to \"the T\" (Boston's subway line). It was about a 10 minute walk to the subway with two small kids in tow, probably faster for unencumbered adults. It is 3 subway stops away from a centrally located subway stop called \"Downtown Crossing\". The room with 2 Queen sized beds was generous enough size-wise to allow our energetic 3 year old to run back and forth. Bathroom was clean. Trademark Marriott sparkling linens adorned the beds. One thing we really like about the Marriott chain is that they are entirely smoke-free. The only thing we didn't like about the hotel was the expensive breakfast - was about $12 per adult and they charge for all kids ($7 for kids). At other Marriotts that we have stayed at, kids under 4 eat free. But, there is a wonderfully divey diner nearby (Bickford's, right behind the adjacent Holiday Inn), which serves the best French Toast and is much more reasonably priced (although their coffee leaves something to be desired!).", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "rhode island", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel..\u201d", "Author": "octofire", "ReviewID": "UR8378793", "Content": "This was our second stay at the Courtyard South Boston this year.
