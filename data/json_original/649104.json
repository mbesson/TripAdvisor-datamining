One was a high priced B&B in San Juan, then a luxury resort in Fajardo, then this one. Each was a different experience, but overall we enjoyed this one the most. The surf in front of the hotel has a very strong undertow and large waves. If you are an experienced surfer or boogie-boarder, you may be in heaven. My bf and I are used to the New England beaches and loved to play in the waves then lie out in the sun there, but I wouldn't let kids in that particular beach. There are calmer beaches for kids within a very short drive, so I would still recommend the hotel overall to families. The staff is very friendly. The free use of beach chairs and towels was a great amenity. We used them every day. The gated parking was also a plus. I wouldn't walk around the neighborhood at night, mostly because not all the locals seem to like tourists, but driving out to restaurants then back into the gate was fine. We washed clothes at the local laundry-mat, and the owners there were also friendly. The hotel staff is great at giving directions to attractions and restaurants. There are a handful of nice neighborhood places to eat. This is a nice central location to both the rain forest and the ferry and beaches of Fajardo as well as Loquillo. Personally, I would skip the food kiosks one exit down on the public beach - some of the locals there seem to hate white folks. One restaurant actually turned their back on us and refused to serve us, but if you speak spanish you may fare better there. There was a fridge and microwave in our room and a grocery store within a 2-3 min drive. That was a nice combo if you're looking to save money a few nights by eating on the balcony at the inn, watching the waves crash on the beach. My only complaint was that the bed was uncomfortable. We had one of the best rooms in the place - a king with an oceanfront balcony. The bed seemed like an older mattress which was supported by a wooden platform (no springs to be found). The sheets and blankets are also lower quality polyester blend, low thread count. Neither one of us could sleep well, and I found myself missing the soft squishy beds with softer sheets at the previous resort. The breakfast was average on our three mornings, and it seems that it's hard for them to time the hot entree for many guests, so you may have to wait 15-30 mins if you want that. There is plenty of bagels, pastry, coffee, oatmeal, fruit, etc.. set out if you are on the run. Overall, I would recommend this place.

They'll even rent you a boogie board. We thought we may need a tour guide for El Yunque rain forest but after Mario, one of their stellar staff members, gave us a detailed map and hand wrote in all the instructions on where to drive to and where to stop and what trails to take, we realized Mario was the best tour guide around - and he didn't even have to accomany us!

The bathroom showers even have one of those built-in soap dispensers with shampoo and body gel.

We'd read some glowing reviews, so we were expecting a modest little inn across the road from the beach, but we weren't expecting the run-down neighborhood it sits in, nor the fact the the beach across the road is only for surfing. The gorgeous, well-worth-the-trip Luquillo Beach is a short drive (maybe half a mile?) away. If you know these things going in, you won't be disappointed with the Luquillo Beach Sunrise Inn. There is ample security, so if the neighborhood's not the greatest, we nevertheless felt very safe. The complimentary breakfast was good, if a surprise every day. Hope you get the homemade carrot bread, which is to die for! The fruit is fresh and good. If you're not too picky, you'll enjoy the food, and the terrace is very pleasant. Be prepared to share a table with other guests; that's how it works. The kiosks (kioscos) near Luquillo Beach feature all kinds of foods for later in the day. We recommend La Parrilla, which is Kiosk #2. Eating where the natives eat and where the tourists eat taught us that Puerto Rican food is blander than \"tourist food.\" The inn loaned us all the beach towels we needed and would also have loaned us beach chairs, if we'd needed them. The service was incredibly friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable, but not fancy, but the view was just right. Remember, this hotel is a good $100 a night less than the cookie-cutter resorts. It's not for the resort crowd, but for people who want a more authentic experience and great hotel staff. We were spending our nights there and our days at the beach or on excursions, so we didn't want a resort experience.

The staff at the hotel, especially Sherry and Demian were extremely helpful in making reservations for local attractions (a snorkeling trip and an English language tour of a beautiful area outside of Fajardo with stops at the rock formations, the lighthouse and a wonderful walk through wet lands). What I liked best about this Inn was their high degree of organization. When we checked in Sherry gave us map that showed where the local restaurants were, and even pointed out one that we should stay away from (because they charged more than the menu indicated). In their lounge, adjacent to their open air dining room, they had menus for all of the restautants in the area, arranged in a logical and easily accessible manner. They also kept a notebook with comments from other guests about the restaurants. The breakfast served always included some type of hot meal (when we were there we had pancakes, French toast, breakfast pizza, and some tropical scrambled eggs). The breakfast were more than ample. Also, there were beach towels, and beach chairs that are yours for the day by just asking for them. The room was well equipped, with good air conditioning, and a wonderful balcony overlooking the ocean. I liked having a sink outside of the toilet/shower area. There was plenty of storage including a large dresser that would be locked. There was also a desk, two nightstands and a few chairs. My only complaint was with the bed.

He did manage to put our mind at rest and he showed us to our room. On the way, we spotted a huge iguana, enjoying the noon day sun. The room was fine - it was clean and well maintained. The king sized bed was roomy, although the sheets were scratchy and the mattress uncomfortable. The balcony overlooked the water and the view was spectacular. The complimentary breakfast was great and they also sold water & beer downstairs (although you could walk to the corner store a block away for cheaper beer). Damien also gave us some handouts of the Rainforest and the local places to go for food. We stayed two nights - on the Friday night, I was awoken at midnight by children literally screaming at the tops of their lungs, while hanging out on the beach. The night before had been peaceful and quiet -- so maybe it was because it was *officially* the weekend? All in all, the hotel itself was fine... although I didn't sleep as well as I would have preferred.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Villa, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location with great views and helpful staff.\u201d", "Author": "randyehrsam", "ReviewID": "UR76571590", "Content": "We had a great time enjoying the wonderful beach.

That said, if you end up there, and want to go to a decent beach not too far from San Juan, then Luquillo is a good bet. And if you are in Luquillo, the Sunrise is a great place to stay. It's nothing fancy, but the folks who run it are great. Really solid customer service. Great breakfasts. The rooms are small and dated, but have nice balconies with ocean views (over the parking lot and a street). The bed was a little soft, but pretty comfortable. The A/C made a weird noise, but worked well. Overall it was okay, and again, probably your best bet for that area if you don't want to stay at a resort. The location can't be beat, either. It's across from the surf beach and a 5 minute walk to great swimming beaches. I do want to note that the area around the hotel looks really sketchy. We went to buy a bottle of wine at the local corner store, and it reminded me a bit of the inner city of LA. Pawn shops, guys hanging out drinking beer in front of the store, they sold cigarettes by the singles...that kind of place. And the local pub does security checks before you are allowed in. That being said, everyone was super friendly and we did not feel at all threatened or like it was dangerous--but I wish someone had explained the neighborhood a bit so I thought I would describe it. If I was a woman alone, I would not walk around that area at night. Also, you need a car to do anything. This part of PR is very much like LA, where everything is in strip malls and you need a car. One final point--if you do go here, I recommend not taking RTE 3 or RTE 66--both are ugly, strip-mall laden patches of asphalt that have a ton of traffic and stoplights. An alternative route is 187 or 189 (I can't recall exactly) that takes you along the beach and through groves. It's quite lovely and we actually got to San Juan quicker using it.

Unbelievably, they also lend guests beach chairs and beach towels so you don't have to bring your own!! There was secure parking for the car, which could be key in the area. They let you print boarding passes for free, too. This is not a sterile Sheraton but it was quite clean and nice, with a balcony facing the ocean in our third-floor room. We chatted with other guests at a long shared table during breakfast. The B7B is located on a surf beach in Luquillo, one of the most beautiful beaches on the north side of PR. There's a surf shop a block away. Walking down the successive beaches you encounter a surf beach out front, then a reef (good to snorkel, they explained, but you must be a strong swimmer), then a semi-calm bay beach, then a very calm public beach with full facilities. On the day we were there it was clean and full of families. You are near enough to Fajardo that you can drive for 30 minutes to the area where all the kayak tours leave in the evening to tour the bioluminescent bay, which I would definitely recommend as an outing. The entry to El Yunque forest is quite close, also. You could easily be based in Luquillo and do El Yunque. Within Luquillo is a famous strip of beachside kiosk restaurants that open both to a street and to the beach. We ate at a burger kiosk because our son was getting tired of mofungos and other local foods. The menus are semi-gourmet and highly varied among the kiosks. You could walk there from the B&B but you might want to drive. I understand that the whole area is very busy on weekends although it was quite quiet a lunchtime on a weekday.

Very family oriented, too. Some other things to know: The restaurant Pasta y Pueblo just lost their license, for whatever reason, I think because they let their license lapse. So, this is not an option anymore for eating out. However, we found a new restaurant that has high quality food, and a pretty atmosphere on the square, it was called El Fugon, or something like that.

They have a computer with Internet access, free of charge, a huge veranda where breakfast is served along with chaises, swings, and chairs just to lounge when you want to read a book for just enjoy the sun and sound of the ocean. Another safety factor is the parking lot which is enclosed in a locked gate at night so you don't have to worry about your vehicle. Inside each room is a \"safe\" with key to lock up all valuables while you're out and about.

It's friendly, helpful staff really helped make our trip wonderful with great suggestions for activities, restaurants, and directions. It's not a \"resort style\" hotel, but that's not what we were looking for... we wanted quick beach access, clean rooms, and helpful service - and that's exactly what we got and more! Damian at the front desk helped us out tremendously. In fact, we originally had reservations at another hotel in the area which didn't work out... so at the last minute we called Luquillo (they'd been booked when I originally contacted them). Damian worked it out and was able to get us in, even though the hotel was booked pretty solidly for the entire week. The rooms are basic, but comfortable and clean. All of the rooms in the \"main building\" have a balcony looking out at the ocean (and what a great view it is!!) except for the two rooms on the ground floor. Even so, they're close to the ocean too! There is a building behind the main one which has around 4 - 5 rooms as well... and what they lack in ocean view is made up for by being extremely spacious and in a lovely garden setting. They're even \"eco-friendly\" rooms using solar power for a portion of their energy, if I'm remembering this correctly. We toured one that had a kitchen and living room, plus patio... it would be great for a family to spread out and really enjoy each other. The rate includes a nice hot breakfast with accompanying pastries, cereal, coffee / tea / juice ~ all served on the second floor terrace looking over the ocean. This is a great place to mingle with other guests, but you can also find your own quiet table. Much like a B&B experience. They have creative entrees that are brought to you personally, but the rest is self -serve. Otherwise, there is no on-site restaurant... nor is there much that's within walking distance. However, keep in mind that within a couple minutes' drive, there's the AMAZING collection of \"kioskos\" along the public beach! They have everything from a sit-down \"nice\" restaurant which takes credit cards, to sidle-up-to-the-bar pool table restaurants, to wonderful traditional Puerto Rican food stalls. It's a pleasant hour's walk along the beach from the hotel if you want to make an afternoon of it, or just a couple minutes in the car if you just can't wait. There's only one restaurant which takes credit cards (the first one at the far left) so remember to bring cash to those. The beach is wonderful, too! It's directly across the quiet otherwise residential street, and the hotel will offer chairs, towels and boogie boards. To the right is La Perla / the Wall where you will see surfers enjoying some nice surf. Beyond that by around a quarter mile is a long stretch of undeveloped, pristine beach which is a Turtle nesting ground at certain times of the year. To the left is a fantastic walk as well along 2 - 3 large coves with some hotels but still pretty unspoiled in places. Coral lines the shore, and after a nice walk you will come up to the kiosks on the main public beach. There you can rent equipment for various sporting events. While the hotel is in a quiet, pleasant neighborhood and you'll need a car to get around, it's centrally located along the northeast coast with quick access to the main roads east, west and south to all the main activities like the rain forest, snorkeling/scuba, and kayaking. In the town which surrounds the neighborhood you can find larger stores like Walgreens, etc for necessities you might have forgotten... but you're not at all stuck in a commercial zone once you're at the hotel.

I would say that if you are staying during the winter when surf is higher, use a greater amount of caution or walk up the beach.

Ours was in the back, but it was very large. Now the cons: - Neighborhood was sketchy. Now we were there Easter week, one of the busiest for locals. I didn't mind the noise or the revelry, though, I don't mind being around people having a good time. But the area was...run down. Ugly houses tightly packed, most with bars needed for security, some looking abandoned. Not really a place I would want my wife walking at night alone. Think a seedy part of Daytona or Myrtle Beach.

But the beach itself was crummy, littered with garbage and not recommended for swimming. You have to walk a good 1/4 to 1/2 mile (or more) west to get to the nicer beaches, and the famous Luquillo public beach was even further. - We stayed in a room in the back - no view.

That said, there are things that are definitely important to us in a vacation spot - cleanliness, great staff, a great view, fun things to do, and a room and locale that relaxes instead of stresses. Luquillo Sunrise Inn has all of these things and plenty more. After several very helpful emails back and forth with Luquillo's staff, we arrived to be greeted by Sherri and Maria, and given an abundance of info about the hotel amenities and more info and maps about the surrounding area. Our room, although we'd looked at photos online, was definitely a surprise, in that it exceeded its online description and appearance, and was so extremely, meticulously clean, from the crisp linens to the spotless tables and chairs! The room itself was roomy and breezy, and the balcony was so large it was like having an entire additional small room to hang out in - this one with a terrific palms-and-ocean view. We left our screenless balcony door open most of the time we were in the room - and for those of you with a fear of bugs, rest assured that we didn't see a single bug during our entire stay. (I know - we couldn't believe it, either!) The breezes were great. The bath area was nicely equipped with toiletries, tissues, coffee maker and supplies, and towels, and although we'd read \"complaints\" about the water pressure, it was perfectly fine to us, and the shower was very roomy and beautifully tiled in rich brown tones, with louvred windows to air out the bath. The floors in the main room and balcony were tiled, too, which helped keep everything nice and cool and tidy. There are no phones in the rooms (we didn't care, as our cell phones worked just fine), although there is TV, which we didn't use either, except to muddle our way past several unwanted satellite stations in order to check the Weather Channel a couple of times. The decor is simple, kind of modern-island - not overdone, not particularly dated, just very streamlined, appropriate to the setting, perfectly comfortable, and very nicely kept up by the room attendants/maids. Anything we asked for was promptly and politely brought up with a smile. We spent three nights at Luquillo, and let me just say that three nights - while we were grateful for them - was way too short! Our first day, we arrived in the afternoon, unpacked, gazed at the view from our room for a while, and then ate dinner at Guava's, which is just down the block from the Inn; the food was very good and presented beautifully (especially the Guava cheesecake, their signature dessert!), and our waiter Jimmie was also super friendly and attentive, although the bar atmosphere didn't really live up to the great food and service. The rest of the evening we just enjoyed the Inn itself; it's hard to explain unless you've been there, but the relaxed atmosphere and island ambiance combined with the security of the property (we'd read reports on Luquillo being \"dangerous\" at night, but never felt that way) and the gorgeous views made it the perfect place to just hang out and rest after our long flight. The second day, we enjoyed the Inn's top-notch breakfast service; plenty of fresh fruit and breads, coffee, sweet juice, and a hot entree made to order by the also friendly kitchen staff. Then we drove over to El Yunque for a full day of hiking - highly recommended (it reminded us of the foliage of Jurassic Park or the TV show \"Lost\"), especially on weekdays when it is said to be less crowded. The only downside to El Yunque was that parts of it were a bit too touristy for us, but that element is easily avoided by sticking to the less-busy trails and finding your own way up the mountain. The second night, we visited the famed Luquillo food kioskos, and especially enjoyed #12, El Jefe Burger Shack (recommended by the Inn's staff) where we had very good \"slider\" mini-burgers and had fun talking to their waiters and meeting the El Jefe resident cat, Mocha; we also wandered down the row of kioskos, and made another great find in #8 (forgot the name, but it's something \"Sylvia\"), where we chatted in our meager Spanish with the lady cook and watched her use a leaf to deftly fold over the flour casing for the delicious crab and carne empanadillas that ended up being one of our favorite foods during our visit. The third day, with great directions given to us by the Inn's Demian, we drove over to Old San Juan, where we promptly got turned around in the narrow streets and eventually called upon the friendly local police to direct us to a parking garage (our minimal Spanish came in handy again at this point!) Once in Old San Juan, we especially liked St. Germain Cafe, where we had an amazingly good lunch and fun conversation with the manager and wait staff, and we also had a blast at both the El Morro and San Cristobal forts, which were impressive overviews of San Juan history and also very cool photo ops. Our final day, Demian was kind enough to extend our checkout time for an hour so we could explore the beaches in front of the hotel (a mere 50 feet or so away); we checked out a couple of complimentary towels, and wandered up and down the shoreline, where we met a couple of local fishermen and just enjoyed our last few hours in Puerto Rico. True, there is no on-site restaurant or pool at Luquillo Sunrise Inn (save the more than adequate breakfast service); but unless those are things that are necessary to your particular vacation, you'll never miss them. The Inn might not be best for kids, who will probably not find enough to do at the Inn itself; but for experienced travelers, those who appreciate a more local feel to their accommodations, or those looking for a place that offers a high level of personalized customer service and pretty surroundings at a more than fair price, Luquillo Sunrise Inn is a hidden gem that we would definitely recommend.

Some recommendations: - Rent a car and explore the area!! You'll be able to walk to a surfing beach and a swimming beach, and if you'd like to take a long walk you can get to the Balneareo (public bathing beach), however you can get to some great places for day trips and for dinner and lunch with a rental (i.e., San Juan, Fajardo, ferrys to outer islands, etc.) - I recommend reading over the restaurant review book in the Inn's office room to find great places to dine and even activities. Some of our favorites: Parillo (in the Kioskos), El Jefe Burger Shack (also a Kiosko), La Estacion (***** absolute favorite, a bit of a drive toward the El Conquistador resort). Guavas is the closest to the hotel, and the food was perfectly fine, however it was not one of our favorites (bar atmosphere doesn't match up with the more modern food). It is, however, a good place to grab a drink or take in the live music (which we missed each night we tried, so can't comment on). - Don't skip the breakfast!

One final comment: breakfast is served on the covered terrace, and table sizes allow for different preferences. There are tables for two, four and six, plus a long table for folks who want to meet fellow travelers. Another way of sharing information is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 The Notebooks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153, one for restaurants, the other for tours, taxis, and general advice. These notebooks are left out for guests to share their experiences (good and bad) with other guests. Note: I feel a little guilty giving this resort a rating of \"above average\" rather than \"excellent\". For us it was truly excellent. It has defined its niche and executes on an \"excellent\" level. However, I don't want to mislead the folks who are looking for a glitzy establishment. If that is what you think excellent is, you need to look someplace else. This is an inn. It is not a resort. There are no cabana boys bringing you drinks and no spa to get your seaweed wrap.

This place truly has the feel of a bed-and-breakfast, and in fact comes with a decent breakfast (frozen waffles one day disappointed, but were followed by excellent omelets the next). Staff could not have been more courteous or helpful with directions and advice on local activities. Rooms were spartan but comfortable enough (especially for the price). This place is well worth the money and definitely worth leaving San Juan to spend a night or two near the local activities and to get the feel for a relatively small town. There are no other hotels here and only 3 high-rise condos. But there is access to a supermarket, drug store, and a few decent restaurants and bars, which mostly cater to locals.

It is a small beach, with rip tides and very rough surf. (Great for surfing, but not much else). 2 - The other walkable beach was unexceptional. However there is a gorgeous, well kept Blue-flag beach about 30 minutes walking (5 minutes driving). 3 - The location immediately South of the hotel was, well, sketchy ... I've taken the NYC subway through Harlem and Brooklyn at night, we negotiated San Juan at night without a hint of fear... but the neighborhood to the south was a handful of buildings about 1/2 of which appeared completely abandonded. There were literally more stray dogs than people for a few blocks. And the people we did see, were the ONLY people on the island who were not overwhelmingly friendly. Just taken aback. I do not KNOW if the area is unsafe. It just made me feel unsafe. As long as you have a car, and don't wander around alone at night, I'm positive it is safe... just less than expected.

When we arrived we were awestruck by a spectacular location on the Atlantic side. The waves were continuously crashing on the beach and a warm breeze never, I mean, never stopped blowing in from the sea. We were greeted by the most friendly of staff who were very helpful and easy going. They showed us to our comfortable and clean room. The place was magic in our eyes. The inn is kept spotlessly clean and it is easy to see the great care that is given to keeping all aspects of the inn in top notch shape. The parking area was gated and we felt very safe leaving our rental car there. Lequillo itself is a bit rundown. The short drive from the main highway to the inn will show that. However, we never felt unsafe. The people we saw and spoke with along the way were beyond friendly. One night we went down the street to Guaves for dinner and walked back on the sidewalk and beach. Again it was like a dream. The wind was blowing and the waves crashing. A group of guys had gathered on the sidewalk with their various drums and they were playing like there was no tomorrow. We enjoyed the free performance. Further down the beach we watched a couple who had just pulled their car over to the sidewalk, turned up the music a bit, and were practicing their latino dancing in the warm, humid evening moonlight. This seemed like the Puerto Rico we came to see and experience. Our hosts were wonderful and usually shared in the breakfast with us each morning on the patio.... again overlooking the Atlantic. Fresh fruit, delicious coffee and usually a hot cooked main course awaited us each morning. Damien was a staff member who stands out as being particularly amazing. He always was their to help (did he ever go home?). He gave us the best recommendations for local eateries and activities. As a matter of fact, we had our best cheeseburgers ever at L'estacion.... and we are from New York!!!! We will definitely be coming back here and can recommend this place for all.", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cA great place for a romantic get away! amazing service\u201d", "Author": "jxntourist", "ReviewID": "UR19707869", "Content": "Hi Everyone, My husband and I loved our stay at the Luquillo Sunrise Inn!

During the first night I got some wierd kind of heat rash and the staff was really helpful in directing us to nearby farmacies and offering some temporary medication to relieve the my symptoms. The breakfast is also good (warm breakfast is included with your stay). We were undecided between this inn and a hotel in fajardo because we were going to go to culebra and thought that the fajardo hotel would be better because it's closer to the marina.

The room was very clean, with nice showers, fresh towels, and helpful information on local activities. The staff at the hotel was incredibly helpful. They provide beach chairs and towels free of charge and are more than willing to assist with whatever comes up, including discounts on activities through preferred providers. The free breakfast on the veranda every morning was a nice touch. Enjoyable activities included Scuba Diving with Pure Adventures Puerto Rico (out of Fajardo), kayaking in the bioluminescent bay, and hiking in El Yunque. The beach in front of the hotel is OK. It gets a lot of local traffic and there is some trash on the beach. I'd suggest going a few minutes to the Caribbean side of the island--nicer water and beaches.

I woke this morning at home in Wisconsin swearing I heard the ocean waves. The Inn was actually recommended to us by our private El Yunque rainforest guide (John Druitt---Highly recommended as well--just google him). Having never stayed in Puerto Rico or near the rainforest I had no idea what to expect. Our expectations were met and exceeded. I have to admit, when we drove through the neighborhood initially, I was a bit hesitant at what we would find for our hotel. It is not part of a long line of beachfront sky rises. There are a few in the area, but not many. At first the neighborhood seems a little questionable--didn't stay long enough to really find out and we really didn't have any problems. The property is well secured with a gate, etc. at night so we felt completely safe. This property lies across the street from Luquillo Beach, but it really doesn't matter, because it feels like you are sitting right on the beach. The patio area is on the second floor and has hammocks and lounge chairs to sit and just listen to the waves crash to the shore. I can still hear them now as I type. The rooms were very clean and well taken care of. Floors were all tile, no carpet. Which seems to be the best anyway for beach front property. The staff was amazingly friendly and knowledgeable about the area, the wildlife, the activities offered, etc. They offered free beach chairs and towels to guests. Boogie boards and snorkel equipment was only $5/half day (I think). Cannned soda/bottlled water was available for $1 each.---very reasonable. We had 3 rooms between 3 couples. Room 24 was on the upper floor and had a private balcony which is always fun. But, the other two rooms 11 and 12 on the bottom floor were of no lesser quality by any means. And they were very convenient for lugging suitcases, etc. I did not notice if the two lower floors had a refrigerator, but 24 did. No blow dryers in rooms, but front desk had them for use. Breakfast in the morning was continental and then a little later french toast was served to order (everyone had the same thing, but it was brought to you fresh not assembly line). They even brought it to us on our lounge chairs....while we overlooked the beach. Now can you beat that? I thought the prices were very reasonable (with tax) $115 for lower and $135 for upper. Our only regret is we didn't plan to stay long enough. We stayed at the end of a cruise and had to head home in less than 24 hours. I would recommend staying at least 2+ nights. You MUST see the rainforest which is just a short journey ---and is visible from near the hotel. Food was available at restuarants around the neighborhood, but not many choices in walking distance. A car would be necessary. Several food stands called \"Kiosks\" offered options, but again not walking distance. Guavas just one block away was ok. As far as the beach goes, it was a bit choppy the 24 hours we were there, and I get a feeling that is typical due to location. We had a blast body surfing the waves. I'm told the scuba and snorkeling just a little ways away is great. Oh and the sunrise.

We chose Luquillo over San Juan so that we would be away from the crowds, still have a very nice beach, and be close to El Junque. We accomplished our goals. We stayed for two nights/three days and had only good things to say about the Sunrise Beach Inn. We had one plumbing problem which started overnight the first night. We let the front desk know it. We were still on the terrace enjoying a very nice breakfast when we noticed the owner and manager were already in our room checking into the problem. They moved us into another room, on their own, and made the repairs while we were away for the day. They were very apologetic about the problem and need to move to another room, but they did everything they could, so it was not an issue. We always look forward to breakfast being served, since at home it is usually breakfast on the run. So this was a treat! What could be better than breakfast al fresco with the beach and surf just at your feet? Another reason to stay away from San Juan was to experience Puerto Rico more like a native than a tourist. We accomplished this by having each of our lunches and dinners at the \"kioskos.\" The kioskos are like mini-restaurants, all in a row, some in shacks, some regular buildings. They all had tasty local food, which is what we were looking for. In San Juan, we could have eaten at all the American chain restaurants, but then why leave the mainland? Ask for advice at the front desk as to which kioskos to go to. They can tell you based upon what your needs are. Some are more of a bar/party atmosphere, some more for families and quiet, and others are more fast-food like. We had our first Puerto Rican pina coladas at one of the kioskos (don't remember the number) which was recommended by the hotel manager.

It's a local hangout, definitely not a tourist joint, and you need to speak at least a little spanish to order a drink, but it seemed friendly and safe. We had a great time there.

I would say that the rooms are about the equivalent to a 3.5 star hotel, and the breakfast in the morning is really delicious - all fresh made to order; no cookie cutter buffets here. The owners, Gary and Marcia, care very much about the hotel and their guests, and are constantly working to improve the property. The week we were there they were personally sweating it out in the garden, planting new flowers and doing general clean up. Their love for the hotel is evident in all the many details. They would do anything for their guests. The rooms are exceptionally clean, nicely furnished, and have lovely bedspreads all personally selected by the owner's wife. Each room has a balcony overlooking the ocean, and you can open the doors and listen to the ocean at night. There is free internet too, and secure, gated parking on site. All kinds of travel information is available from the hotel staff and they will help you book tours and plan your excursions on the island. They really know a lot about which tours are best and won't steer you wrong. I have to compliment the housekeeping staff; they are very trustworthy. One morning I accidentally left my credit card and cash sitting on the night stand while I was having breakfast, and when I came back, the room had been cleaned already and the cash and credit card were still right where I left them. Now that's honesty! I was told by the owners that they drug test every staff member, so they are very careful not to get people who might steal or cause other problems. (Theft is a big problem in Puerto Rico - don't leave anything unattended anywhere, including the beach, your car, or your purse in a restaurant.) The location in Luquillo beach is perfect - right across the street from the ocean, with a gorgeous view. Only thing about Luquillo Beach is that the properties surrounding this hotel are all kind of ghetto-ish - the hotel is the nicest property in the area. Also, there are tons of stray dogs everywhere, including on the beach - some are quite sorry looking and not in good health. And there are some homeless people and winos wandering about. So if you are looking for an upscale neighborhood, this is not it. But if you simply want a nice place to stay, and a convenient jumping off point to other attractions in Puerto Rico, then the Luquillo Sunrise is definitely it.

The area is fairly rundown, but that's not unusual for Puerto Rico where you will often see a nice hotel right next to rundown buildings.

A full buffet of typical continental breakfast, plus a hot entree that changed every day (french toast, scrambled eggs, breakfast burritos). Everyone on the staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel is separated from the ocean by a road, but not a busy one. There was some glass by the road, but once you were on the beach it was clean. The waves were pretty high, which we liked, but if you want a calm beach, you can walk to Luquillo Beach about 20 minutes walking by beach. We walked via beach to the kioskos for lunch, about a 45 minute walk. Great lunch at kiosko #2 (La Parilla), but can be expensive ($20+ for an entree). We chose to have several appetizers instead. We ate dinner another night at #9 (Conga), we enjoyed that even more and was not quite as much. The hotel is a convenient location for visiting El Yunque -- only a short drive from the hotel. There is not really a shopping area to walk to from the hotel, but there is a grocery store, Walgreens, pizza place and Mexican restaurant just a short drive across Hwy 3.

The lack of street signs made finding the hotel a real challenge, but the staff 'talked us in' over the phone with no problem. Once we knew where the place was we had no trouble find our way around, although one way streets (marked and un-marked) made things interesting. The rooms are clean and in great shape. Everything works. There are no phones in the rooms, but our US cell phones worked just fine so that was not an issue. There is cable tv, but no ESPN or movie channels. The ESPN thing is a big issue for me, especially during college football season. We spent Saturday evening at the Brass Cactus for dinner so I could catch up on game scores. There is no refrigerator in the room, and ice doesn't last long, so we got use to room temperature drinks. Not a big deal, but worth noting. The staff hooked us up with a day of scuba diving and a day of snorkeling on the catamaran Spread Eagle II. Both were great experiences. We paid less than everyone else on both trips by booking the excursions through the hotel. I actually saw the manifest on the Spread Eagle II, and we each paid $15 less than everyone else. The restaurant recomendations made by the staff were accurate and helpful. The included breakfasts were much better than the usual 'complimentary breakfast' you get these days.

The hotel itself is ordinary. The view from the balcony is extraordinary. However, they should add bar stools, because the balcony line obstructs your view once you sit down. Every morning they have a nice fruit collection, grapes, grapefruit, kiwi, bananas, apples, mango, etc. Toast, bagel, jams, juice, coffee, etc. and a hot meal too, which ranged from breakfast burritos to pancakes to french toast. Nothing fancy but prepares you nicely for the day. The beach across the street is spectacular and a second beach down the street, a two minute drive or long walk, is ideal. From this location we snorkelled, kayaked in the biolumenescent bay, hike the El Yungue rainforest, drove a good drive to the Caves of Camuy and just enjoyed the beach. Damien and Suzy are very helpful. If there is anything you want, they're willing to help make it happen. You would not find more helpful service at a Ritz Carlton. There is a little beach shower just off the edge of the parking lot, which is gated, to help keep sand out of the hotel room. We had read a few comments about property crimes before we got there. However, we never once encountered anything suspicious whatsoever. We walked along the beach at night and never gave it a second thought. The snorkelling excursion was our favorite via the Spread Eagle II, recommended by the hotel staff. The hotel staff provides a list of local restaurants that they recommend and over the course of 6 days we tried nearly all of them. Kings was my wife's favorite. Metropol was my favorite. Neither of us cared for Sandy's. Everything is was very nice. We would certainly stay there again. We loved our experience and if we ever return to Puerto Rico, we will likely return to this hotel.
