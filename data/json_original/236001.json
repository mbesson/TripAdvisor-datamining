{"Reviews": [{"Content": "We loved our stay at the Ariston The staff is a delight. We had a great home base to see Florence and Tuscany. The Hotel became our home away from home and the staff became our family. This affordable hotel is clean and is close to the grocery store, Post Office and several restaurants. Our stay was fabulous and the staff went out of their way to help and make it happen. Our stay was all about good service. The bottom line is that we recommend the hotel for those on a reasonable budget and would love to return once again for another wonderful stay.Robert  Harriet, Los Angeles", "Date": "Sep 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR160782266", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "HoldingHands"}, {"Content": "good deal, great location i've passed through florence many times (used to live there, still have friends, though alas w/o guest space) so I know how easy it is to get royally ripped off in this town. the ariston is modest but really quite a good deal. clean, reasonably priced, and a very helpful, friendly staff--heard the woman at the desk speaking excellent english. the best thing about it, though, is the very central location: not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say it's far away from the main sights. santa croce is five minutes' walk, the duomo, the uffizi, and ponte vecchio ten minutes, at least for this former new yorker, and there are plenty of nice little places to eat in the santa croce / sant'ambrogio neighbourhood if you know how to avoid the tourist traps.", "Date": "Sep 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR854930055", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "govab"}, {"Content": "MAKE THE BEST OF IT ... we did and the Hotel Ariston played a major advantage to       Via Fiesolana, the passage way to excitement and quiet relaxation", "Date": "Jul 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR523756194", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sketchbox"}, {"Content": "Hotel Ariston was a safe haven! My class stayed at the Hotel for the CSU Summer Arts Program and the staff went out of their way to provide us with excellent service. The staff helped us with our luggage up the several flights of stairs and was always available 24 hours a day to help with any problems or emergencies. The night staff made sure the hotel served as a safe haven for our group by keeping undesirable people away from their guest and advising about local customs that are foriegn to us Americans. I also enjoyed the cozy accommodations for breakfast and they make the best cappacino in Italy! I would definately recommend the hotel for any person coming to Firenze to check out the prices are resonable and the staff is friendly.", "Date": "Jul 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR730084378", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PalmdaleAngel"}, {"Content": "Stay away from Ariston Hotel       Small TV (who watches TV in Florence anyway)", "Date": "Dec 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR132606966", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "anmegk"}, {"Content": "Not bad for the price I was quite happy here considering my budget. It was a good location with walking distance to sites and markets, and the woman that greeted us was outstanding. Out of her way friendly to assist us with where to go or with any questions we had. I thought the breakfast was average, but definately eatable, with cake, soft cheese and biscuits, and toast. On the down side there was no lift with all rooms up stairs, and our room had a dodgy bathroom handle, where we could have trouble getting out of the bathroom. Water was also sometimes not hot but just warmish.

We were dependant on the Florence buses to commute within florence and due to the irregularity and low frequency of these buses, it did prove to be quite inconvenient. Also there are no decent restaurants near or in the hotel, The food served in the restaurant adjacent to the hotel was frankly speaking quite pathetic !!The hotel in itself is quite decent barring the ultra tiny elevator. The receptionist was extremely helpful and he even went out of the way to help us out with rail as well bus information. The room we had was neat and clean and the bathroom too was quite spacious.", "Date": "May 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR840814690", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "You get what you pay for In this case basic accommodation, clean but not a place to linger.

We spent 4 nights here. We found the staff to be very friendly and accomodating. They made reservations for us for the Acadamie, but curiously did not know where we could get gelato!

Our only complaint was that the bathroom flooded every time we took a shower, and there was so little space between the wall and commode that we had to sit sideways!
