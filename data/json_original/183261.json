Toilet bowl had black markings around it which appeared to be mold from lack of cleaning. The seat was dirty which we cleaned w personal carry wipes. The sink also had some residue in it and the shower/ tub although clean lacked pressure. We found the Teri cloth like robe for the suite (1) only, rather funny I thought. Positives:The staff here are polite and helpful, bed is a bit hard but fine for 1 night, breakfast was more then adequate but buffet not worth the $.

We had to call the police ourselves and no one really talked to us about the incident at all. They even implied that WE left our door open!!! The security system in place is ridiculous and I do not believe that any guests can feel safe in a hotel with such a weak security system. I did not see a security guard on site, and the front desk was empty at night - with staff coming out from the room after hearing people at the desk. I did not think that a hotel would have such little regard for the security and safety of their 'valued guests'. We definately did not feel valued at all and it was devastating that the police arrived around 730am.......we called at 1am...and again at 2am. To top it off, the fire alarm went off several times throughout the night and the elevators stopped working....so when we had to leave the next day, we carried our luggage down the stairs. Prior to leaving the hotel, we spoke to the front desk and was told that there was nothing they could do at the moment and that they have until noon to send the report to the police (the report that records the key card entry) and I called them around 420pm....still nothing.

The main reasons we chose the Maritime Plaza was because we found a good rate on a travel site and because they had a pool. Location was pretty good as it's only a block away from St. Catherine's Street. The room we got for that \"good rate\" was the smallest room on the entire floor. We noticed on the floor plan later that the other rooms were all much larger. We noticed the room was very dusty when we first checked in, so I'm not sure if it was sitting empty for a while. There were also a few dead bugs on the window sill. The door was also stuck. We couldn't get in at first and thought the front desk staff didn't program the key properly. A bell hop was passing by and offered to help and even he had problems opening the door. He had to really put his shoulder into it to get it opened. At least 3 other neighbours had problems with their keys and/or doors as well. Before the bell hop helped us, we went back down to the front desk to tell them, and they were quite rude. It may be just the typical Montreal attitude, but it certainly isn't acceptable in a service industry. I noticed another reviewer also found the front desk staff rude and implied the problem was the guest's fault. The bathroom was also very tiny without much shelf space. It was fairly clean, but the tub was filthy. My wife was going to take a bath and ran a towel across it to clean it. When she looked at the towel, it was FILTHY! She wound up not taking a bath. Water was very slow to drain out of the tub too. Another big minus was that there is only 2 elevators for a 14(?) floor hotel! A huge tour checked in at the same time as us and we had to wait for a very long time to get to our room. The bell hop chose that particular moment to transport the tour group's luggage to their rooms, locking one of the two elevators out of use!!! So there was only one elevator to transport all those people up and down a 14 story hotel! I could not believe it! Parking is extremely expensive and the lot is extremely narrow. We had a large rental car and it was a very tight fit getting it down the ramp and into the parking spot. Parts of the ramp are single lane for cars going up and down! Fortunately we didn't meet any cars going in the opposite direction when we were on the ramps because it would have been difficult to back up or down those narrow ramps. The pool was very nice. It's a salt water pool and not heavily used. There's an outdoor patio facing Guy street, but it was too cold to use when we were there. Another plus was that there was a safe in the room.

I'm guessing that the pictures were for the executive class rooms, because it was quite beautiful and new on the website. We stayed in the regular double room, and it didn't really look like that at all in person. The hotel seems quite old, a lot of things are run down. Elevator was slow enough that we just walked up and down the stairs. The restaurant/bar had a bit of a early 90s feel to it. Rooms seemed clean, but old. In other words, though it was clean, it still had the feeling of dirty. We rented several rooms, and all the beds consistently felt as if a bunch of kids had spent the last 10 years jumping up and down on them and killing the springs. Worst of all was one of the beds had a metal spring coming out of the bed. That made for some gashing cuts on my friend's leg! Ouch! Again this is just a product of the furniture being old. I guess the plus side was the location. You're right around the corner from Ste. Catherine and a few minutes walking to Crescent Street. Also getting out of Montreal was very easy as it was very close to the highway. In our case, the only downside, was we probably needed to be closer to St. Laurent, so it was a $10 cab ride away and not really a walking distance type destination. We booked on hotwire on the Unpublished Hotel Rate, so I was a bit disappointed when this came in the same class as 3-star which is supposed to be comparable to Holiday Inn, Radisson, Double Tree. We later passed what looked to be a much newer Holiday Inn, also in the downtown core, and I was a bit envious.... Overall, it's a place to sleep, but basically only that. I wouldn't spend much time in the hotel. And if you needed to prioritize location (especially to Bell Centre, to Crescent Street or to Concordia U), it's a place consider.

Problems encountered: elevators broken. this meant that on a morning that I had to leave by car with luggage and work materials, I couldn't get an elevator down for 20 minutes. I almost hit rush hour in Montreal - however I was late getting back to my office in Ottawa. The Breakfast: I need breakfast by at least 6:30 so I can leave the hotel before 7. Unfortunately their breakfast starts at 7:00. The Pool: As a business traveller, I like to swim before my morning shower or departure. Not possible, the pool doesn't open til 7 a.m. Mattress: second rate. Radio: I listen to radio. call me old fashioned. The radio in my room was awful. Horrible tinny sound. Ruined each of three mornings getting ready to start my day where the only news and traffic report I'm going to get is between 6 and 7 as I will be in meetings from 7:30 to 5:30 p.m. Check In: The first room they offered was on the 2nd floor (214) Avoid if at all possible. There had probably been a smoker in the room. It had a view of a parking lot. It was VERY noisy (fronted on a very busy street). Carts: Lots of available carts. However, the wheels need alignment so you don't crash into the doors and on the narrow elevators. Choose carefully. I went down to complain, another front desk person (Paulo) gave me a room on the 5th. And offered complimentary breakfast (which had been part of my rate that the first person should have told me). The room was fine. All was good. On check out, I told them why I probably would not be back. They told me that I should have asked for an \"executive room\", higher up in the hotel, better mattress etc. I told them that if that was supposed to be part of my corporate rate, they should have offered in the first place. (One of the people kept saying, you should have asked (??).) On the whole, the staff were friendly and helpful. Neither my colleague nor I will go back for either of the two visits we have upcoming in June. But if you need a good price with a few amenities like pool, it's not a bad deal.

I went into my first room but there was no way I could stay in there. The room smelled damp and dank, the carpet was not clean, the bed linens had stains and there were hairs on the sheets... it really was all too much for me within 5 minutes of walking into the room. So, I called the front desk and told them I could not stay in the room it was very dirty. When I went back downstairs I was given an upgrade at no extra cost to the executive suites. This room was probably more the calibre of a regular clean room. It was clean and didn't smell as damp as the other room. My view was excellent...I didn't quite know how to use the heat, but when I called they sent a guy up with another additional portable heater. The bathroom was pretty clean but the shower only had one strange setting... very forceful I guess and when I tried to change the setting the entire shower head fell off. So, I had to get used to that small but powerful force of water for my showers. They have wireless internet which was good and the location is excellent.

One of the elevators is almost always occupied by a service cart, so the other is full of people and stopping on every floor. 2- Beds suck. They look pretty and all. But upon arrival I noticed hair on my pillows. Wasn't my hair. When I got in to sleep it was like owww. Hard bed. Uncomfortable and I didn't sleep well probably cause of the bed but also because 3-Dusty- the air vent was filled with dust. I noticed that my allergies start acting up soon after I got in the room. When I later discovered the dust in the air vent, I knew why. 4- Exercise room, really? Three cardio machines (that's all) and all of them are about 20 years old. I went in there and two people were already using the gym, so no room for me, literally. Ok I could have used the stepper, but if I wanted to climb steps I could just walk up to my room (and avoid the 10 minute elevator wait and 10 minute elevator ride). 5- Waiters have amnesia??? I went to breakfast which was subpar, everything seemed to have come frozen in a box and warmed up oh and they charge $15 for that. Ok also by the time I grabbed my food, someone else was sitting at my table and drinking my coffee. When the waiter came over he acted like it was the first time he had seen me (even though he had seated me 3 minutes earlier). 6- Coffee maker and DVD player were in the room. Coffee pot was broken and dirty. DVD player did not work even after I followed the directions to a T. 7- Tub did not drain. Like everything else in the hotel, probably due to years of neglect (and piles of hair). At the end of my shower (with the drain open) I was standing mid-calf deep in water.

No one ever appoligised to us. we tried to talk to the staff to tell them about the broken phone and alarm but they kept ignoring us and talking to the manager in french instead. it was a terrible experiance.

In a week the restuarant they advertise was only open three times, they didn't have set hours and you could never plan to have to arrange a meal, so you had to walk somewhere else to eat and there isn't a good place to eat for at least two blocks or more. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone that has to stay in it for more than one night! I do not believe this hotel ranks a three star rating it should be lowered to at least a two star.

In a matter of 3 days incl that very night, I had spoken to front desk, head of housekeeping, and deputy manager. The General Manager never returned my call. In brief, they claim that nothing was left behind and that nobody else occupied the room after us. Hmmmm. Makes you wonder doesnt it? Much as cleanliness, service, friendliness of staff are important, I think it is as equally or more important to feel that you can trust anybody that works in that hotel - after all, it is home away from home.

I stayed there with my boyfriend in mid-November 2004 for 3 nights. We booked directly through the hotel's own website, and paid $95 Can. plus tax per night. Indoor parking was available for $11 Can. plus tax, which I must add is a very reasonable price to pay for hotel parking in Montreal. Space is at a premium here, and I have searched high and low for cheap hotel parking charges, and this is the cheapest I can find. So those people who complain about having it being too expensive have obviously not looked around. I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised by the amenities in the hotel at this price. We had a room with a queen-sized bed, with down duvet and pillows (lots of them), a cotton bath robe free of charge (unless you want to take it home with you), Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries (in generous-sized containers), and lots of space in the room and windows the width of one whole long wall. The bathroom is a little bit small, but is in line with most other hotels in Montreal that I have stayed in. It is also clean. The sheets were definitely not stained, and they have a policy not to change the sheets every day if you are staying for more than one night in order to be more environmentally friendly. Frankly, why would we expect the hotel to change our sheets every day when we don't do that at our own home? But they will change them if you tell them to. The staff at the front desk was very helpful and professional. I wouldn't say they were really chummy, but you don't go to a hotel to make new friends with the staff anyway. They were efficient and polite. What more should we ask for? They were also bilingual. My boyfriend is francophone and I am an anglo, and the person at the desk switched between English and French fluently and willingly. We didn't use the pool or the exercise equipment because we didn't have time even though we would have liked to because the pool looked very inviting. The hotel is in such a good location that we spent most of our waking time out on the streets, shopping, taking in the sites and enjoying the restaurants. It's only a block from rue Ste. Catherine, the main shopping street downtown. It's got tons of good restaurants and neat shops, and we didn't mind the walk at all. In fact this hotel is in a particularly good location because it is kind of at one end of the shopping stretch so we could just start at the hotel and went east, do the whole strip, and come back and have a capuccino at the Second Cup right at the corner where the hotel is before heading back up to our room. The coffee shop is open till very late at night, so it's great. Besides, we got our exercise out of the walk. The only complaint we might have is the heating. It's a bit excessive in the hallway. But we could open our window in the room to let cool air in, so it's not too bad. After all, this is not the Queen Elizabeth, and we shouldn't expect that level of opulence, considering what we paid. In fact, we were so pleased with our previous stay that we are going to stay there again this Christmas (2004).", "Date": "December 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as expected.......\u201d", "Author": "BBora", "ReviewID": "UR2863053", "Content": "Frankly, almost cancelled my reservation after reading some of the reviews here.
