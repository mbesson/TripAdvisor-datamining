No phone, no alarm clock, a tv that did not work (with no remote). The two rooms we had were literally right off the breakfast room, so forget about EVER sleeping in here. (Not that we wanted to.) The shower stalls are so tiny I could not even bend over to shave my legs! I looked up at the bathroom ceiling one morning to find mold ALL over it. ughh!! Everything else seemed clean. The rooms were tiny. Barely enough room to drop a suitcase or two. We would NEVER have stayed at this hotel if it were stateside, but When in Rome..... The Staff here was so kind. All spoke English, had a helpful tip to offer, teased my children and made us endless cappuccinos with a smile on their faces. For the price, we didn't expect much so we were not disappointed.

Having travelled quite a lot, I tend to pick up the statements that are most consistent throughout the reviews to pinpoint the actual facts instead of personal opinions. This usually gives me a good idea of what to expect. having read all the reviews of Hotel Galeno, I felt it safe to book the room through Lasminute.com. Firstly, the rooms are cheap. I booked a double room for 5 days, including a weekend, and ended up paying \u00a3180, including breakfast. I thought this was quite cheap, and as such, didn't expect any great luxury in this 2 star hotel. We found the Hotel very easy to find. On the main road, there are signs pointing to Via De Villini, on which the Hotel is located, and we didn;t ecperience any troubles getting there either. It is a 15 minute walk away from the Termini station. Hacing seen the picture of the front gates and the path to the front door, we found it very easily. The front door you see from the gate is the entrace to the block of flats, but there were signs at that door pointing to your left (left side of the house) where the entrance to the hotel was. We were early, checking-in time is at 14.00, and we arrived at 11-ish, but the staff at the desk happily asked the cleaners to do the final clean up while we checked in. All the staff spoke great English as well. The room itself was not small, I'd call it cozy, or homey. It was clean, very clean in fact, the bed was comfortable, there was a telly wit the basic Italian channels (but who goes to Rome to watch telly in a hotel, really!) and shampoo samples, soap, two sets of clean towels and lots of spare toilet paper. It was obvious the room was old, but it was comfortable and big enough for two people. The toilet had a shower (which had a showercurtain which could be pulled in front of it, the space was not big but it was used well) a toilet, a basin, a sink and a mirror. Also, our towels and shapoo and soap got changed / refilled every day, our bed was made everyday and the rubbish taken out. The cleaning staff don't speak much English but you don't really get to see them, they are very discreet. We didn't have a hair dryer, but every time we asked for one from the staff, they happily provided one. The room did have green, fitted bars in the window, but these didn;t bother us. You could still open the windows and they were there for our protection, the window opened to a courtyard that was also used by the people who lived in the flats above. Having left our grear to our room, we asked for a place to eat. they recommended this great restaurant (where we ended up eating every day, the value for money is great [pizza = \u20ac7, pasta =\u20ac6 etc. and the service is awesome) and gave us a map to the city and also giving us some valuable adise on where to eat, what to go and see, and most importantly, what to avoid. Breakfast was good in my opinion. It's not a buffet, you sit at the table and the staff wiull bring you a tray of goods. You get to choose between coffee, tea or hot chockolate, and also you are provided with a white roll, yogort, a sweet croisant, juice and pre-packed melba toast. It kept us going until lunch time easily, and we like to eat! The toast itself proved to be a good snack to take with you if you decided not to eat it at the hotel. The location itself was very good too, it was off the main road and therefore quiet. It is located close enough to the central to either go by foot or to take the metro, which is also quite close. We weren't bothered by people in next rooms, either we had really quiet neighbours or the walls were not paper thin, but we also had a good nights sleep. There also is a small market close by and the previously mentioned great restaurant. In conclusion, I would say Hotel Galeno is a good value for money and a great place to stay. The staff speak English well, and those who do not (the cleaners, and some of the breakfast staff) speak enough to get understood. Always remember that in Italy English is not spoken as commonly as in some other countries. The location is brilliant for rest and for access to central. If you are looking for a luxury hotel with too much space and for some strange reason plan on spending a lot of time inside your hotel room while in Rome, you might want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, it is a great place. I will definitely go again. P.S A bit for Finnish people: Hotellissa on toissa aivan loistava suomalainen tytto, joka on painonsa arvoinen kullassa.

Fortunately - no problems in this regard!

The room had no luxuries (TV was free to air - no English channels), but my daughter's request for a hairdryer was, again, immediately met with a loaner. The breakfast was ok.

Our upstairs room was small with just enough room for the double bed, if you needed to sit down it had to be on the bed. However it was sufficient for our needs as we did not intend to spend any time there during the day. The room also had an ensuite washroom which contained a shower, toilet, bidet and basin and looked quite modern, I was surprised by the quality of the fittings, they were quite good. Due to a problem with the extractor fan trying to work through closed vents, black mould was growing on the upper walls, and it was quite pronounced. The thin towels were changed regularly each day during our stay and opened packets of mini soaps were replaced with new ones. I did notice that that during the morning there was no hot water, so it was just as well we took our showers in the evening. There was also a television mounted high on the wall, but watching it was a bit of a guessing game as we don't speak Italian. The bed was remade each day but I did wonder how safe our belonging were if the maids let themselves in. We did not have anything stolen though. The staff on the reception desk did speak English, which was good, but with the exception of one young girl who was helpful and friendly, the other receptionists were rather indifferent in their attitude, not exactly rude but not friendly either. The breakfast was a very basic affair and comprised of one white roll, a pre-packed croissant and two small crisp toasts in wrapping with a small selection of jam and butter portions and a choice of tea or coffee. The coffee was very poor, I'm still wondering just what it was. The hotel is situated in a quiet area a little away from the bustle of the main tourist areas. This could be a plus if you value a good nights sleep. When we found our bearings we discovered the hotel was just over 1 mile away from the Termini railway and bus station. We got quite used to walking there, though it did entail crossing a busy road junction, to catch the tour buses. There is a Pizza restaurant right on the doorstep of this hotel which we unfortunately over-looked until our last day. Its on your left out of the main gates on the opposite side of the road and just before you reach the main road. It appears to be used more by the locals than the tourists. The pizzas are quite good and the staff friendly despite not speaking much English. Definitely worth a visit.

The bed was comfortable and surprisingly large given the proportion of the room. The continental breakfast was traditionally European. It consisisted of fresh hot bread (if you arrived early enough), packaged crossant and melba toast, along with fresh espresso and juice. It was quite good and the packaged items served well as snacks later in the day. The towels at the hotel are paper thin so American travelers used to thick terry cloth should bring their own. Also, bring your own toiletries because the hotel does not supply anything other than toilet paper. The desk staff was cordial enough (some more than others). The maids are very polite. However, the building the hotel occupies serves as an apartment complex as well and the residents are not very kind to tourists. Fellow hotel guests were very nice and enjoyed chatting about their trip so far. The neighborhood around the hotel is very quiet and the hotel is not close to the more tourist populated areas of Rome. If you are into people watching, this hotel is perfect. Cafe's and gelato shops are close by and have tables outdoors. However, the staff at stores and restaurants in this area do not know how to ease the language barrier. Know your Italian, or bring a great phrasebook. The Chinese restaurant three blocks from the hotel is surprisingly good and there are plenty of street vendors that can offer a deal. This area of Rome closes down early so if you want to enjoy the nightlife or a cybercafe, you better call a cab.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, NH", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay here next time\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2215153", "Content": "I booked through a travel agency for myself & two grown children. It was clean enough, but claustrophobic. We were given a room on the first floor. It looked onto the patio which is walled in but we still felt vulnerable. There was no security screen on the window. The room was suffy, although clean. Our towels were not changed. I left my money clip in the room with maybe 10 or 20 euro in it (shame on me) which was gone when we returned and the window we had locked when we left was now open. The telephone was broke. Sometimes they would help us make a call from the desk, sometimes not. It did seem safe. We walked everywhere so bus lines were not an issue. But there was just something about it -- perhaps we felt no one really cared if we stayed as guests or not. I will look elsewhere for a hotel.", "Date": "June 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cNot again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2079270", "Content": "I booked a trip for myself and a companion on go-today and was given Hotel Galeno in my package. We traveled during late November when there would be less tourist. There was no hot water the first day and no explaination as to why. Some of the desk people were very nice but a majority were rude. We were told that breakfast was served until 9 but we arrived at 8:45 and were treated quite rudely and told that they prefer if we come earlier. Although it was definitely not a problem since the breakfast was not worth it anyway (prepackaged soggy bread). Also the hotel was a bit off the beaten track but bearable because the train station was reasonably close. We had to constantly request fresh towels and have the heat turned on in the evenings. When we just ignored about the heat, I requested an additional blanket and was asked by the hotel desk clerk if I had a medical problem and maybe that was why I was cold (apparently he did not think its possibly because it is winter). After the first two days or so, we just dealt with it and thought of it as a misadventure of some sort. However, on our departure we specfically requested a wake up call and was not given one until the shuttle picked us up. We booked the shuttle service with the hotel and obviously there was some type of understanding between the two- tell the hotel patrons one price and then the shuttle shows up (and you have to get to the airport with no time to waist) and then the shuttle quotes a MUCH higher price. I would not stay here again.", "Date": "May 19, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Galeno", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d296959-Reviews-Hotel_Galeno-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$58 - $188*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via dei Villini 10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00161</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "296959", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d4/1d/d41dee2f337e52a0602b7ea9fa3ad1b29large.jpg"}}
