{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Two wonderful places to call 'home' in Florence My daughter and I spent the first night of our Florence vacation at Antica Dimora Firenze. It was beautiful! The staff was so helpful! The hospitality was wonderful, they loaned us laptops and DVD's to watch movies. There was a breakfast included but we slept through it. The next day they took us to The Market House, which is a sweet little apartment that they have for the rest of our 11 nights in Florence. It was a wonderful place for a Christmas family reunion. My son (studying abroad) met us there and we really enjoyed being able to give him a home away from home' for Christmas. The kitchen was stocked with olive oil, coffee, tea and a jar of biscotti that kept being refilled. (They even had milk in the fridge for us.) Every three days, maids came to clean and change linens. We were in a great location right near a market and able to but fresh food to prepare meals if we didn't want to eat out. We were within walking distance of everything. At Christmas a special Christmas cake and a poinsettia appeared from the staff. We loved out time together in Florence and the people from Antica Dimora Firenze made it all so fantastic. They even ordered out taxi to the airport as we had to leave at 4:30 am to catch out flight. I would highly recommend both of theses places to stay as well as any of their other properties.Nancy", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR940842253", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Elizabeth051"}, {"Content": "Beautiful, cosy hotel in a great location We stayed at the Antica Dimora hotel for our honeymoon in December 08 and it was absolutely perfect!

This is not a problem, although it was a bit of a strange feeling - if others were having breakfast when we opened the door, they saw directly into our room.- the breakfast room has one main table, and you feel as if you're having breakfast with your extended family, as strangers sit next or opposite you.All in all, on the plus side, the decoration was really of impeccable taste (both the rooms and the lounge/breakfast hall), giving you a warm and pleasant feeling. The receptionist was very helpful and offered to provide us with a map of the city, suggested itineraries for sightseeing, and even places to eat (don't miss the nearby pizzeria Zeus after a tiring day of sightseeing - quite simple but offering delicious  authentic Italian food).The breakfast itself could be somewhat improved (no honey?), but it was adequate (nothing fancy though).In terms of location: we went by car, and had to park at a private underground parking 10-15 min walk from the hotel. Although relatively far from Ponte Vecchio, Uffizi, Palazzo Vecchio  esp. from Palazzo Pitti, these main sites were still reachable on foot (20 min walk or more). It probably felt longer because of the heat. It was however very close to San Lorenzo and the Accademia/San Marco, and an OK distance from the Duomo.One last comment about price: we paid 100 euros per night through a special offer (rather than 140), and we felt the hotel was a good deal also because of this.", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR472338108", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "elan_Switzerland"}, {"Content": "Very pleasant experience       This was the bedroom that we were in.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR572248667", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "zeroeight"}, {"Content": "The Tornabuoni House is Great Our family of four just returned from a vacation in Europe that included four nights in Florence, Italy at Antica Dimora Firenze's The Tornabuoni House.

After rolling our suitcases from the train station through the dusty streets of Florence on a warm day, we arrived at this little inn's address with hope and expectation. We were not disappointed. We received a warm welcome in lovely English from Amanda as soon as we came in the front door. The public area of the inn is full of comfortable chairs and cheerful colors.Our room was spacious and equally welcoming, with jasmine flourishing outside the window. This inn is very different from most others, both in its price category and well beyond: everything is designed to make you feel that you are a guest in a soothing private home. There are beautiful fabrics for the curtains and bed canopy, scatter rugs on the floor, well-chosen prints (that you enjoy looking at!) all over the walls. The closet had loads of hangers, and a sachet. Drawers were lined with pretty paper. The bed was large and comfortable with a lovely Indian spread. We found hooks to hang our hats, a table and chairs to use as a desk or for breakfast, and good reading lamps, along with the usual hotel conveniences. The bathroom exceeded expectations. The shower had a drenching rain showerhead, a handspray, and a tile bench. The large old marble sinktop was marvelous, and there was excellent lighting, very good toiletries, and fine linens, including thin, absorbent bathsheets (linen?) that dried overnight.

SInce I was travelling with my 75-year old parents, this was a real concern for their middle-of-the-night needs. The self-serve breakfast at Antica Dimora Firenze was sufficient, but not spectacular.

We make our own breakfasts, usually return home in the afternoon for a light lunch or snack, then out for dinner every evening. The property was very well stocked and maintained, and the patio would have been fantastic if the weather was warmer. The decor is very charming, and the kitchen adorable. The only major downside was the very unfortunate smell through the bathroom due to recent rains. We realize such problems come with old buildings in old cities, and my mother and I were still very pleased with the flat, but most others might not feel as comfortable. Additionally, the flat has no telephone service. Luckily I had my mobile and could call for taxis or other necessities. If you don't travel with your mobile, be prepared to use a nearby pay phone.The location of the flat is a bit far from the historical centre, but you feel like a real Florentine. Across the street is a fabulous fruit, veg  cheese market which is open nearly every morning. Additionally, next door is the Cibreo restaurant complex which is delicious, and La Giostra (our absolute favourite) is a very short walk away. We usually travelled to and from the city centre by taxi.We were welcomed to the flat by Umberto, who helped us find all the local necessities (including a nearby grocery for my Diet Cokes and the local wash  dry for our laundry). As a tip, I recommend asking the maid to come every day rather than every 3rd day to make life a bit easier for you.And finally, I feel I need to make one comment about the service from the Antica Dimora BB. Two months in advance, I had asked them to make dinner reservations during our stay. They emailed me back confirmation, then I reconfirmed again a week before our arrival.

Her tips were great for shops and touring the city - she recommended going to see The David at 5:30PM - when there are NO crowds - she was right!! We loved a nearby restaurant called Tito's, another not too far away called Za Za. We would stay here again, and look forward to trying the Il Poggiale outside of Florence next time too.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR384059973", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MrKins"}, {"Content": "Great place to stay!

The staff were incredibly helpful and spoke fluent English. They explained the city to us with their map, showing us where many of the sites were that we planned to visit. They made excellent, local suggestions for dinner and even called restaurants for us to make reservations. Our room was very quiet, very pleasantly decorated, good hot water, adequate air conditioning, firm bed. They gave us a bottle of wine as it was our honeymoon. Breakfast consisted of coffee, tea, a fresh pastry each day, bread and cereal. Good location, about a 10 min. walk from the train station (with luggage--sidewalks are narrow!)

We enjoyed two large, comfortable rooms, one of them having a small balcony overlooking an interior patio. Reasonably priced. The bathrooms were very good with lots of hot water. The place is very quiet and restful at night; one does not notice the other guests. Everything is squaky clean.The breakfast, included in the price of the room, was very good and generous, including fresh fruits, cheeses, breakfast meats, hot and cold cereals, coffeecake, etc. Coffee was excellent and is available thoughout the day. At night one can have biscotti with vino santo as a nitecap.Location is very good; all major sights are nearby, e.g., 5 minutes to the Academia; 10 to Piazza de la Signoria. One can also walk to Santa Maria Novella train station, about 20-30 minutes.Staff is friendly, knowledgable and helpful. Their recommendations to good, moderateley priced restaurants nearby proved to be accurate.Their web site is user friendly and presents faithfully the reality of the place.

Our bedroom had a canopy bed, antique furnishings, a beautiful color scheme of pale blues, crimson  cream.
