The restaurants in this Chinatown are very good. King's Noodle is always a good choice for authentic noodles in an authentically shabby Chinese restaurant. Our new favorite dim sum restaurant in this area, now that Bright Pearl is closed, is Rol San on Spadina with its variations off classic dim sum themes, excellent service and very nice atmosphere. The hotel is minute's walk from Kensington Market with its cool retro hippie vibe of vintage stores (our fave is Courage, My Love), two great bakeries, cheese shops and various groceries and culturally themed restaurants. A must visit is the redesigned and renovated Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) also within walking distance. Don't miss the Bernini sculptures or the room dedicated to Ruben's \"Massacre of the Innocents\". The free and fairly frequent guided tours are fantastic. The second floor, pretty much all Canadian art and landscapes is like a walk in the wilderness.

The gentleman at the front desk- I forgot his name but he shined with his excellent customer service- helped us out by showing us a map of the city and giving us a lot of useful information. We entered the room, it was clean- the bedspread was clean and you could smell a light scent of bleach in the room, which both my husband and I liked. Everything worked well in the room. The water pressure in the shower was great. The coffee maker worked. We had to pay for parking but I was prepared for that and had budgeted for it, and it was only $20. The one elevator was not in use- but that didnt slow us down. The only complaint I have, and it isnt really the hotels fault is that the ATM in the lobby- our cards didnt work in it (we are from the US) so we went downstairs and right outside is an HSBC bank and we were able to get cash there.

Parking is located in a lot directly under the hotel, but with all of the other signs in the area, you may have to look carefully to find the entrance to the underground lot. The hotel itself sits over a shopping center and food court (I wouldn't recommend the food court). You'll need to take the elevator to the Super 8's lobby. The hotel provided me with a parking pass so I could freely leave and re-enter the parking lot at no extra charge (which I believe is a fair-enough $10/day for Toronto). This property was a nice surprise for us. Check-in was relatively easy and efficient. Our room, on the same floor as the lobby, had a large jacuzzi bathtub IN THE BEDROOM. I'm assuming this room was a honeymoon room or something. At any rate, the in-bedroom bathtub was functional, but the jacuzzi function was not. The room had a king-sized bed, a decent TV, a microwave and a fridge. Have no fear, in addition to the in-bedroom bathtub was a regular tub/shower in the bathroom which was clean. Unfortunatetly, I give the shower only 1 star out of 3 stars. The water pressure was okay, but the drainage was slow, and I couldn't figure out how to get the water warmer than tepid. Our room faced the smaller, and much-less busy street at the back of the hotel was very quiet. I assume that rooms facing Spadina Street in the front, may be much noisier. The complimentary breakfast was nothing to write home about, typically \"continental\" style with no hot food available.

Were were trying to balance quality and price. Typically we like to keep our cost around 100. The pics and location seemed good from the description on various travel websites, so we took a shot. We were hesitant to begin with because our first thought was \"Super 8 motel\"? Who wants to stay at a motel? Let me assure you that this is NOT a motel...it is Super 8 HOTEL\" As we pulled up we realized that this place was right in the heart of Chinatown! At that point we were not sure whether that was good or bad. It was a windy day and there seemed to be quite a bit of trash blowing around. In addition, there was graffitti on quite a few buildings (most). Again, this made us wonder if we made the right choice. As it turned out, we never felt \"unsafe\" during our walk to and from the ACC. We returned to the hotel around 11-12 at night and there were still people walking around and we were never uncomfortable. When we first arrived to the front of the hotel, we found that it was in the middle of a block, and didn't really have anywhere to pull over to check in, or even drop anyone off. Luckily traffic was light and I was able to briefly stop and my wife jumped out to go inside and register. I continued on and drove around the block. I later found that there was a parking garage located beneath the hotel (and mall) that had access from a side street behind the hotel. Had we known, we could have just pulled directly into the parking garage (Chinatown Parking Garage?) and gone inside to check in from there. Parking was on ten, which I thought was quite reasonable, as we have stayed at places that charge up to thirty. Once I found the proper place to park (P3 - indicated by small signs), I grabbed our stuff and headed to the elevator. As it turns out, this hotel is located above a mall. There is a neat glass elevator that you take to the 3rd floor where the hotel lobby is located. Entering the lobby were were quite pleased to see that is was relatively modern, clean, and up to date. After checking in, we proceeded to our room. It was a King, and included a small fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. It was clean, had plenty of room, had a dresser, desk, tv stand, two nightstands, luggage stand, side table, and shelf for coffee maker. I was quite impressed with everything we got for under a hundred. And to top it off, breakfast was included. It wasn't anything great, but it was breakfast none the less (continental), saving us the time and cost of going somewhere else to eat. All in all I thought this place was very nice. The staff was very nice and helpful. At breakfast, when the line was getting backed up at the two toasters, they even went back and pulled out another one to try to reduce the wait. The place is well kept, relatively modern, clean, quiet, and safe. I would absolutely return myself, as well as recommend this place to anyone who isn't looking for a \"high end\" three hundred dollar room. Also, it is only a couple streets over from Young and University, if you are looking to walk those streets.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience ever!

The rooms were clean, lots of room, and the fridge/microwave was a great help... we also had great service from front desk, even though the weekend we were there it was very busy-- they still got us checked in early, and were eager to help us with directions, etc. We were lucky enough to have the first room next to the main lobby, which I thought was going to be very noisy, but with the air conditioner going, we had peaceful, quiet nights all along! An added bonus was that we were right next to the kitchen area, so breakfast was quick and easy- no frills however-- standard continental fare-- the beds were super comfy - even the shower was great!

My friends had booked and paid for a room for three people, with a king bed and pull-out couch, for $150 US (including tax). When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that they were putting an extra $100 safety deposit on the bill (which we were not told about previously). Although we were told the next day at check-out that this would be removed immediately, they never verified who was checking the rooms to actually see if any damage was done, or verified that they knew of any damage that was already found in the room. PARKING: The staff at the front desk seemed really unsure of how much the parking would cost. There is a parking garage essentially behind the hotel, but also used for the mall customers so you can either pay through the hotel or the parking garage; I believe the hotel charges $19 plus \"extra fees\" for one night. The sign on the garage says 30 minutes ($2), 8a-6p ($8), 6p-8a ($6), max weekend rate ($10). My friends and I parked on Friday night at 4p and left Saturday at 7p and were charged $30 through the parking garage (so we are unsure of how you actually get the max weekend rate). There is no one working in the garage to ask about the rates, just a machine. INTERNET AND CABLE:There is a computer in the lobby for people to use but the internet never worked the two days we were there and there was no printer. We were told that we could get internet in the room, and were given an ethernet cord to use for free as we were told we would not be able to get wireless. After a few hours of the ethernet not working, we were able to collect to a wireless network in the room through the hotel. There was a cable television in the room with about fifty channels. BREAKFAST: The free continental breakfast included bagels, muffins, croissants, three types of cereal, orange and apple juice, and milk. Breakfast is served from 6-10a, we arrived at 9, and everything seemed well stocked. ROOM: There is a small refrigerator and a microwave in the room. My friends and I booked a room for three people, with a king bed and pull-out couch. Unfortunately, we were only given two bath towels and two pillows in the room, which was disappointing as the hotel was told there would be three people staying in the room. There is an air conditioning unit in the room, but even though it was turned to full blast and freezing cold the air only circulated about one foot away from the unit (the room was hotter than it was outside and the windows are not able to be opened). LOCATION: The hotel is attached to a tiny Chinese mall, however to use the elevator to get to the hotel room floors you have to have a hotel key. There is only one elevator and it takes at least a few minutes to arrive to your floor. The hotel also seems to be in a fairly safe and quiet neighborhood. It's about a twenty minute walk to the CN Tower or to the ROM, and the subway and streetcars can be taken right on Spadina as well.

Also disturbing was the below street parking ramp although a camera and a push button mic was there the sign said \"this is not a two way intercom\" so I guess they could hear you and see you if you had a problem but they didnt have (or want) any way to talk back?? very odd, also odd was the one elevator in use would decend at a real snail pace but no one put it out of service we didnt know and was unsure what was happening and got off after 3 minutes on the next floor.

There is a streetcar line just outside the hotel, that can take you to downtown sights, or connect with the underground subway for points north and beyond. We were warmly greeted on our arrival.

There was a minifridge,microwave and coffee maker in the room, with a small eating area in front of the TV. The bathroom was also spacious, and all appliances worked well.

Their \"Super Start\" breakast was your basic continental fare. The coffee was good. It wasn't fancy, but it was done well. Potential negatives for someone: the hotel is in a mall, on the third floor, so entry is a tiny bit funky. But there is a sign at street level, and the elevator itself was quite safe.

We asked for extra sheets and he took 10 minutes to bring them to us and they were the wrong size. So the next time, he took another 20 minutes.

The first night we slept in, so didn't get our room cleaned (which is ok, I don't blame them for that). The next day we specifically left earlier to make sure our room got cleaned.

It was the cheapest I could find, $420 airfare + 4 nights booked in May. Pearson International Airport is out of the way of down town, so a Bus, Subway, and Streetcar are needed to get to the hotel if you want to do it cheap. (Take the Airport Rocket to Kennedy Station, then take the Green Bloor-Danforth line to St. George Station, and the Spadina Station (Or any street car that says Spadina, for that matter) Streetcar from there will get you almost to the front door of the hotel. The cost is $2.50, and the ticket transfers the whole way). Otherwise you're looking at an $18 shuttle that will only get you there 30 minutes faster. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was too early to check in, but they happily held my bags while I took the chance to explore. Check in was easy, and the front desk staff was courteous and very helpful in giving directions. The room was spacious and clean with a king bed, TV, microwave and safe, plus the coffee maker and usual accoutrements. The view was wonderful, directly facing Spadina with a good view of the CN tower from my window on the 3rd floor. A cursory inspection led me to remove the bedspread and throw it in the corner where it stayed the entire week (I always leave the Do Not Disturb sign up, for security and because I don't want my toothbrush used to clean the toilet). The blanket and sheets were clean and very fresh (I love the hotel sheet smell), and the mattress was very comfortable (a pillowtop). I slept great the whole week, which is very rare for me when staying in a hotel. The room configurations differ, but I was given a desk as well as a classy looking luggage table. The room was clean, other than the greasy(?) bedspread, which I was happy about. Bathroom amenities are surprisingly of good quality and front desk staff were happy to give me more throughout my stay. Breakfast was sparse, continental style, but we're staying in the Super 8, not the Embassy Suites. No made to order omelette aux champignons, but good coffee, juice, muffins, bagels, cereals, oatmeal and spreads. It was filling and I had no complaints. If you are worried about security, there is a desk attendant 24/7 but I never felt unsafe in that area or hotel. A fitness center is advertised as an amenity with this hotel, but when I tried to use it I found the door locked. You may need to ask for a key to get in, but it wasn't a big deal for me so I didn't raise the issue. For a dinner out, I strongly recommend Laksa, a Thai restaurant a few doors down going north.

I normally stay at Courtyard Marriotts or Hampton Inns, occasionally a Ramada. I have fairly high expectations of hotels since I have to live in them for a week or more each month. I'm not a snob, but I don't settle for a room that is filthy or a bed that is too uncomfortable to sleep in. I hope that gives you some context for my review. This Super 8 is right in Toronto's Chinatown district. It clearly caters to a mostly Asian customer base. This hotel was almost brand new when I stayed in it for leisure. It was very quiet and very clean. The rooms were small but not cramped. The staff were very polite, but did not speak very much english. The parking was a bit inconvenient and expensive ($20!), but not any worse than the rest of downtown Toronto. The room rate was the cheapest downtown by a good amount (maybe $50!). Definitely a good value for the dollar. BUT, the beds are rock hard. This hotel is part of a larger building that houses a shopping mall that resembles a very cramped flea market inside. Our second floor room had a very large window that faced into the building, overlooking the first floor of the mall. The escalator was literally a couple feet from our window running parallel to it. It deposited people on the second floor directly outside of our window. It didn't feel very private, but when the drapes were closed it was no big deal. And when the drapes were open the people watching was really amusing!!! Weirdest view I have ever had from a hotel window, thats for sure. MY BIG WARNING about this place: I can't find words to express how HARD he beds are. When I stayed there they did not have any optional mattress pads or anything to help soften the mattress. I hope they have some by now, but I have no idea. I even took the comforter and folded it triple underneath me and it was still too hard for me to even lay comfortably for a few minutes. I honestly think the carpeted floor would have been softer. Before this trip I wouldn't even have believed they made mattresses this hard. I literally lay awake all night. I have never had a worse night's rest. To be fair, my boyfriend and a few male friends all slept alright on those beds. They did complain that the beds were rock hard, but they still slept. I think anyone without a curvy shape would be ok. Unfortunately I have lots of curves, and I found that the bed had my spine bent out of shape no matter how I lay. We were scheduled to stay in this hotel for 2 nights, but had to check out early and move to a different hotel just because of the hard mattresses. I was very bummed about that because other than the mattresses it was really a fantastic value.

I didn't use any of the public transportation so I don't know how well placed it is in relation to train stops but it's on a main street, Spadina, and in the middle of Chinatown. At night, the area around the hotel felt somewhat shady because the streets were pretty empty and somewhat dirty but it was not terribly uncomfortable. The hotel is inside a mall-ish complex so the elevator is accessible by anyone. There's no doorman or guard to watches who enters the elevator although it's probably surveyed electronically. To access you room's floor, you had to swipe your room card, which prevented people who aren't staying in the hotel from accessing hotel floors. However, I was uncomfortable going to my floor if anyone else was on the elevator. Free wifi in the lobby. You sign out an ethernet wire for internet in your room.

After searching around and finding hotel in the downtown area about $150 for tourist level hotels, I stumbled on reviews about this hotel. The rate was $118.00 in September, but I also managed to book it for a seniors rate at $110.00 which is a great price. I happened to be able (at last minute) arrange my sales trip in Toronto and stayed with them for a few nights. The hotel location is right in the middle of Chinatown between Dundas and Queen Street on Spadina. Perfect location to catch the street car to Yonge Street or walkable in 20 minutes. Also very close to Kensington Market. If you love asian food, this is a great location as there are plenty of options in the area or ventured to Queen street for streetside cafes. The rooms are spacious and clean (clean being the most important of all). The front desk agent mentioned they've only been opened for a year. Amenities were basic, so if you can't live without a specific brand of shampoo or bath wash, make sure you bring your own, as they have a generic Super 8 one. Room are equipped with microwave, minifridge, coffee maker and work table. Not much closet space or dressers, so if you're staying long, you'll have to literally live out of your suitcase. The main lobby is on the 3rd floor. The elevator is off to the side of the mall, which is on the lower floors of the hotel. The hotel itself is only about 3 floors, with some rooms overlooking the mall. Our room was on the 5th floor looking out onto Spadina, with a view of downtown and CN tower. There's a small gym and a dining area where they have a help yourself continental breakfast. There's one computer with internet in the lobby to use, for free. The dining area sits about 30 people so you may have to wait for a table. Breakfasts consists of a variety of cereals, toast, bagels, croissants, coffee, tea, orange and apple juice. Nothing spectacular but it's included so no complaints from me. You do need a key card to go up to your floor (with the exception of rooms on the 3rd floor), so security is pretty good. The area felt very safe, even walking back from dinner at 10:30 at night. The staff were not overly polite but were not rude. I guess indifferent would be a good way to describe them. Overall I would say it was a decent and good stay. It's not exceptional if you compare with a 4-5 star full service hotel but if you're looking for something basic as a hub for exploring the city and don't require the use of any hotel facilities (spa, pool etc.) then this is good value for your dollar. It's not in the heart of the shopping district but certainly close by transit or walkable if you don't mind walking.

We were not disappointed. The Toronto public transportation system is excellent and a great value. One $9 pass allows either a family or two adults access to all public transportation (on weekends).

We exchanged American currency for Canadian at the airport for a fee. You can largely avoid this if you have an ATM card with prius because there are banks all over Toronto that accept your card.

Overall our experience is that if you accept the limitations, the hotel is reasonable at its price-point. We had two rooms, one a king, the other a double-double. The king (8323) was one of the rooms on the lobby level (the third floor, with the shopping centre occupying the first two) that look down into the atrium of the shopping mall, and was actually the worst of them as the internal escalator from the mall to the hotel passed right outside our window - see picture. For other readers' benefit, the rooms that face the atrium are 8323/5/7/9, 8331/8, 8340/2/4/6, 8350/1/2/3/4. Although initially unhappy with this allocation, we realised the benefit is that it is incredibly quiet when you are sleeping as the mall is closed. We simply never opened our curtains so no-one could look in. The air-con in this room was relatively quiet in operation with the fan set to low, and although normally a light sleeper I got good nights' sleep each night with the air-con left on. The second room (8324) looked out over a side street and was very spacious. I think on balance that as a couple, we would have preferred the bed size limitation of a double compared to a king for the extra room space. Walking round the hotel corridors on the lobby level (we didn't manage to get to the 4th or 5th floors where there are other rooms) we were aware of the fact that there were strange smells in the corridor around the high numbered rooms (about 8340 and above). I have no idea whether this relates to comments by others about the smell in the rooms but these rooms are above the main part of the mall, which may be relevant. The breakfast is inclusive, a do-it-yourself cold buffet with disposable plates, cups & crockery in a small area with stainless steel seats & tables. Plenty of cereal, breads, bagels and croissant, yoghurts, tea, coffee & juices. Very few tables so a fight for space at times. It is perfectly OK but not luxury standard. Is the hotel safe to walk round ? We walked in and out of the hotel at various times of day and night and never felt threatened, but overall we found Toronto had more down-and-outs and beggars than other cities we visited in a six location visit to North America, so don't expect to visit Toronto without meeting vagrants. Because Toronto has banned smoking in public places you will find people from the shopping mall gather outside the hotel entrance but at no point did anyone openly beg for money there - though this did happen in other parts of Toronto we visited. The biggest disappointment for us - and this seems consistent with other recent comments - is the poor quality of customer care. There were several defects with the room when we arrived -clock, fridge and microwave not plugged in, remote control for air conditioning not provided (air-con in atrium and outward facing rooms were different), rooms poorly serviced during our stay, bed covers stained by previous occupants, and a long delay at check-out even at 6.15am. Maybe the pre-dominantly Chinese community that work at this hotel have not adopted the service ethic that Westerners are expecting in an hotel ? There was free wireless (802.11g) internet access in the lobby area and free wired internet in the rooms - take your own RJ45 lead, though. The coin operated laundry was a benefit to a family of 4 on a three-week North-American visit - no soap powders sold there, though, so had to purchase a larger quantity than was needed from one of the chinese market shops that are in the vicinity.

We are a family of 5 ( 3 young boys aged 7,8,10) So we need a room that will accomodate us all and still give us room to move about. Our room had plenty of space for us to move around and not feel cramped at all! We arrived in downtown T.O. and easily found our hotel. Parking is in an underground lot attached to the building that hosts the hotel. Tell them when you check in that you have a vehicle so they can give you a pass for in and out access. Our room was a good size and the furniture was in good shape. However, there is limited drawer space with only two small drawers to hold your clothes. The room was semi clean, we have a child with a nut allergy so we usually scan the room upon arrival. Obviously the family before us had small children as we found our room covered with stickers on lamp shades, door handles, lamps and even on the toilet and fridge! The floor was not vacuumed, but do they really still do that at hotels? The floor was sprinkled with oreo cookie crumbs and other various crumbs that would stick to your feet as you walked bare foot. The bathroom floor had dirty shoe marks on the tile that left a shoe imprint like someone had walked on a wet floor with dirty shoes. The hallways smelled like the outside of over heated veggies from the market stands or garbage on the streets. Am I fussy, well I guess I am but I really hate when places are listed as clean but you cannot let your kids sit on the floor to put on their shoes. I guess the part that bothered me the most was that the fridge in the room did not cool down, so the food we had for snacks did not stay cold unless we put ice in the fridge. Hmmm. We were able to walk to most places easily and that was a sure bonus, we even were daring enough to walk after 11 pm from the Roger's Centre without any real fear of danger. Are we stupid? Probably so! One of our little guys stubbed his toe on the fold out couch one night and I went to the front desk for a bandaid or some first aid supplies. I sat in the lobby for 30 minutes. There was no one on the desk in that time, and soon many people we gathering, waiting for a person to come to the desk. Finally, when they returned I asked if they had an alcohol wipe and a bandaid to clean up his foot. I was told that I should have brought my own first aid kit, and that they did not give out alcohol of any kind especially a wipe... and then asked what a bandaid would do for a stubbed toe anyways? Hmm let me see...clean up the blood that was on his foot/cut and maybe even take the stain out of the carpet that he made upon impact with the couch. In the end we ended checking out a day early. We found the airconditioning very loud and we could not sleep with the noise. The Air conditioning is located directly beside the bed under the window. Aprox 1-2 feet from the bed and it was so loud that we could not even hear the television over it! In all would I stay there again? Most likely no. I think I would spend a few more dollars and stay closer to attractions, and have a more luxurious room. However, for families that require more room, this is a wonderful place.

We also had a view of the CN Tower (an advantage for some but not others). The location is good, a short walk to the bars and cafe's on Queen Street, and 10 mins walk to the entertainment district. We visited most of downtown and didn't use public transport once (although we were lucky as the weather was goegeous). Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a cheap hotel downtown.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cInexpensive hotel in the heart of Chinatown\u201d", "Author": "irdohr", "ReviewID": "UR15970776", "Content": "Inexpensive and clean hotel, with very professional staff.

Parking is location in a parking garage below though take note it is cheaper to pay the garage fee instead of getting a parking pass via the Hotel. Also there is a addition fee apon checking in ($60-$80) but if you will get that one time fee back but I stayed for a wk so it might only apply for long stay customers. The room we stayed in \"8338\" was a 2 queen beds (memory foam) with couch, flat screen tv, full bath, all amenities that were listed were included. Our view from room gazed over the inside of the mall but there are 2 other floors that will give a outdoor view. Elevators and escalators provide access into the Hotel. Only drawback is that there was no wifi service it was landlines but if you forget your cables you can simply go to a lower floor and purchase one at the many stores in the mall for a decent price. This Hotel has only been open for 2 months so I am sure that they will improve and streamline everything to make any future visits excellent.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Super 8 Toronto", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d671288-Reviews-Super_8_Toronto-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$100 - $158*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">222 Spadina Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M5T 2C2</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "671288", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/03/e1/03e1bdc56b9420f3bb4f9f3c472c16594large.jpg"}}
