I am very type A so am even to this day surprised I allowed my friend to book me in a hotel in which I was unfamiliar but I went with it. I am so glad I did! We arrived to this CUTE hotel which was conveniently located just steps from the Spanish Steps. We were met by smiles and attention by the hotel clerk who made us comfortable while our room was prepared. The hotel is small but couldn't be more charming. Our room was tastefully updated in modern ameneties and again, while small, made the best use of the space. The beds were comfortable, the hotel was quiet and in the morning, we had a lovely breakfast in the dining room which was included in the room rate. I am so glad we discovered this gem and will definitely be back!!!", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Yorkshire England", "Title": "\u201cLocation location location!

As for the others, it's hard to be too friendly when the English is a struggle.They arranged our ride to the airport for the next day and helped us bring our (lots of) luggage up to our fourth floor room in several trips in their tiny elevator (normal for European boutique hotels from what I've seen). The room was clean and comfortable. It was small, which is also normal for European hotels, but we had all the space we needed. I liked the hardwood floor, which made the hotel room seem cleaner than most.The bed was comfortable. Keep in mind there is no A/C if you stay there in the summer.

It was a delightful start to the day and left us well nourished in anticipation of a long day of Cobblestone hopping. Only downside, the walls were a bit on the thin side, and to be in a busy area, it could get a little loud.

I arrived late in the evening and I was greeted warmly and welcomed with a cocktail from their bar. My room was modern with a black leather headboard, large bed, balcony, lovely slick black tiled en-suite bathroom. It contained good air-conditioning (needed in August), a mini-bar, reasonable storage space and a safe to put valuable items. The rooms are cleaned very well by the friendly staff daily. The guys at reception are warm, friendly and very helpful for any queries you may have. They will give you a handy map of Rome to show you were everything is located. In the mornings breakfast (7.30am-10am) is a self service buffet style affair, you can eat as much or as little as you want, in a clean inviting room with everything you need to get started on your adventures; cereal, cold meats, fruit, croissants, pastries, bread, juice and you will be served coffee to your liking by a very friendly woman who always has a smile! One of the main advantages of this hotel is just how centrally located you are to so much, Trevi fountain is a few minutes away, so is the spanish steps. Right beside the spanish steps is the Metro/train station 'Spagna\" which you go through to a) use the metro system which is very convenient (i.e. only a few stops to the Vatican) and b) you can walk through the tunnel to get to the wonderful Borghese Galleria - it's all signposted and very easy! You can walk to the colosseum, the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Piazza del Popolo, Museo dell 'Ara Pacis, Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Capitoline Museums and more... for those of you who like shopping you will be spoilt by the high end shops around the corner, i.e Prada, Versace, Chanel, Emporio Armani, Gucci etc However, there are more high street shops on 'Via del Corso' i.e. Gap, Adidas, Diesel, Zara, Levi etc. In the evenings you're again spoilt by the plethora of restaurants in which you can dine that are close to the hotel...as well as places to indulge in delicious gelato (ice cream)Finally, if you haven't been to Rome before, when you go out and you use the toilet, in some places when you're ready to wash your hands there are no taps! Look at the floor you will see a pedal, press down and hey presto water!

She couldn't answer that, but nor could she give me a decent room. Instead I got a dark, narrow, grubby room facing the window, which not only caught all the traffic noises from the street, but also was right underneath the buskers who often stopped immediately below me to sing to the diners below. The bathroom was horrible; it was a very small cupboard into which they'd tried unsuccessfully to fit a WC, washbasin and shower. It simply wasn't possible to use any of these things properly.
