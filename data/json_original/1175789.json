It is very very clean and the staff were all very friendly!! I have stayed at 4 star hotels that were not as clean as this was. I really can't complain about anything that reflects directly on the hotel. I could hear the plumbing (toilet and shower) of the room upstairs and the dumpster truck came rediculously early which woke me up at 5:45 am. However, the hotel can't control the city trash truck and when you stay in an old hotel you have to expect that there will be little noise insulation. They did have a free continental breakfast with fresh hot waffles, biscuits and gravy, cereal, yogurt, coffee, juice, donuts and some other things. The pool area was small but clean and appeared to be well taken care of and in working order. While most of the items in the room (furniture, television, etc) were old and basic the comforter was above average and there was a nice variety of pillows including throw pillows. I thought it was a nice touch. I wouldn't mind staying here again if we needed a clean and comfortable place to sleep after a long day of shopping and sightseeing; however I would probably look at somewhere newer and fancier for a special occasion trip.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bentonville, Arkansas, United States", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price, but not great\u201d", "Author": "Tawana B", "ReviewID": "UR137077240", "Content": "Stayed here with my husband on our honeymoon.

After dropping the kids off at camp, we planned on staying another couple nights. We liked the price...and the fact that we could use a roll-away for the 5th person for only $5. My first clue should have been the price for this hotel was better than any we had seen for the weekend. There were very few rooms booked for the weekend, but somehow the hotel managed to put our room right next one with barking dogs. You'd think with 80% of the rooms open they would have put the family with dogs somewhere else. When we complained, management said \"Call us at 10:00 if the dogs are still barking.\" We have young children who need to be in bed well before 10:00. It also appears the hotel has no policy on quite time, because this same family played LOUDLY in the pool right outside our window until after 10:30. When they got back to their rooms, the dogs started up again. When the hotel finally brought the roll-away, there were no sheets for the bed, just a blanket. I asked the hotel manager if we could get some sheets. His response was that is what the blanket was for. I guess he planned on my kid sleeping on the mattress without any sheets. It was rather hard for me to understand how he couldn't find a sheet in a hotel which was relatively empty. (he did finally hunt down a sheet after I pressed a couple more times). The lock on our door also didn't work. The hotel sent a maintenance man at 8:00 a.m. to fix it -- while we were still sleeping!

The beds are new Sealy pillow tops with luxurious bedding and lots of pillows. I understand the older mattresses are now in a name brand hotel up the street. Pay for a name brand, get an older mattress, stay at Dockers and get the best. And for $50.00 a night through Orbits it was the best price I could find for the time. They zone the streets,red, yellow, blue, for mapping and Dockers or any hotel on yellow or Green mountain rd looked clean and well maintained and just off the strip. The red zone or 76 was crowded and due to traffic I would not recommend. If you are a smoker you will find all the hotels in Branson are non smoking but Dockers does accommodate you with benches outside of your room and smoking allowed on the premises. This is important to know since some do not allow smoking on the property and can actually fine you if you smoke in there rooms. The free breakfast was always enough for us. Cake doughnuts, toast, English muffins, 4 types of cereal, make your own waffles with regular and sugar free syrup, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, milk and hot chocolate mix. The coffee pots in the rooms make 1 6oz cup of coffee with these special packs so bringing coffee will not help. If you ask they will supply all the coffee you need. The Dockers restaurant across the parking lot may not look great on the outside but is very clean and appealing inside with an all you can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, with breakfast for 4.99 and lunch for 5.99. They also offered meals like burger's and fries for 5.99, or liver and onions my favorite for under 10.00. You can purchase 2 day passes for Silver dollar city for the price of 1 day and other discount tickets through this hotel and they will deliver to you an actual ticket not a voucher which I suggest. SHOPPING AND SIGHT SEEING: Branson is the equivalent to the Christian Disney Land and if your patriotic and love singing then you will have a great time. If this would offend you, I suggest you do not go to Branson at all. From the pledging allegiance to the American flag at the Branson Mall, to the Christian singing at your morning breakfast, it is Southern hospitality at it's best. We took the private cave tour offered at Silver dollar city which is by lantern for an extra $10.00 at the end of the day. They offer free tours throughout the day but this one is for only 20 guests lit only by lanterns, if you are physically fit and are not claustrophobic you may love the experience. Yes there are bat's flying around, I suggest wearing good walking shoes and carry a jacket. You will need to be able to walk squatting or bent over many times to fit through the caverns so be prepared. BEWARE of timeshares unless your into the whole free or discount tickets for 90 minutes of your time, they are everywhere. I heard these tours are high pressured sales, and more like 2 hours out of your life, many people must get roped in since there are lot's of places re-selling them. I understand the purple building on 76 across from the fire house does offer tickets at 2 for 1 with no strings attached. I suggest checking them out first or just pay the price with a coupon that you can find in any brochure down there rather than give up 2 hours of your vacation. The blue route did offer an Amish store along with some souvenirs like 4 t-shirts for $10.00 and a VF discount store at the shops of Branson meadows where we found new clothing for under 5.00.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat pet-friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "mimimingo", "ReviewID": "UR72410078", "Content": "We just returned from a 4 night stay at Dockers Inn.

The room was not vacuumed in corners & at walls, dust was thick on headboards and also when I went to plug their clock radio behind nightstand. Clock radio gained half hour overnight,. And TV remote did not work, nor did the one they replaced it with. We stayed off-site near the pool area. When discussed with staff, she replied \"we haven't had a housekeeping complaint in 3 months\", which I found hard to believe. The location was good and the pool area nice.

They too were booked, but the front desk clerk noticed there were a couple of rooms not bookable due to repairs being performed. The clerk went \"above and beyond\" to determine the status of the repairs. She did all this while being extremely busy with other guests checking in and out. After determing the issues would be repaired that day, we got two rooms for the weekend. I was extremely impressed how pleasant she was to work with and how diligent she performed her job! I was telling my wife that I wish I had an entire staff of her to work at my dental practice! As for the hotel, it was a fantastic hotel! The rooms were extremely clean and the beds were wonderful. Excellent service and clean rooms at an affordable price is all that I ask in a hotel. I assure you that when we return to Branson, we will definitely stay at the Dockers Inn.
