{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect spot for 2 young lovers After navigating the infamous twisting narrow stairs up to our room we found our room to be wonderful from the view to having our own bathroom. The only thing that keeps me from rating the room at 5 stars was the fact the bed had a seriously hard, wood divider running the length of it resulting in us sharing a rather tight half of the bed. The staff was excellent and the room was very clean. Vondel Park and the Leidsplein square where you can get anything to eat, drink, or smoke were literally only a 5 and 10 minute walk away respectively. The hotel can be a little noisy after the late night crowd returns but It is still a great place to stay and when I return to Amsterdam I will be staying at the Park! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Vondel Park / Leidsplein area.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR933551107", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Phillyfreedom08"}, {"Content": "Quaint and well located but NO LIFT and STEEP stairs beware       Hotel entrance", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR860971776", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chrisnoc"}, {"Content": "3 Nights at the Parkzicht We stayed at the Parkzicht for the weekend and found that it suited our needs in terms of location. Our room (room 5) was at the back of he building and was ample enough in size although it did appear to lean perhaps a bit much towards faded elegance.It's just as well that our room was above the reception/breakfast room as I would have felt sorry if someone had a room beneath us as you couldn't place a foot anywhere without these huge creaking sounds!! Although beakfast is included in the price it was only worth getting out of bed for once. The 2 slices of cheese, cold meat and cold boiled egg (with bread) did not prompt any incentive to get out of bed for (although I did manage a portion of honey on cold pre packaged toast). The room was clean with fresh towels supplied each day.The bathroom was spotlessly clean and quite modern compared to the room itselfAll in all I think that the Parkzicht was a bit expensive in terms of value for money and the breakfast was dull but the manager and his family were welcoming and efficient.One last thing, don't whatever you do choose to stay here if your elderly/disabled as the Parkzicht is quite typical of many older Amsterdam hotels with a staircase that presents itself as being similar to the North face of the Eiger.", "Date": "May 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR867614640", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "euroweekenders"}, {"Content": "Stay at the Park!!!
