{"Reviews": [{"Content": "So disappointing I have stayed in several different apartments in Amsterdam over the years; this time as I was only staying for four nights I could not book my usual venue so I ended up in a Hoksbergen apartment (number 19 the attic). It was seriously disappointing, a big let down. It wasn't cheap; it certainly wasnt value for money. It is advertised as having a fully equipped kitchen. Well, there is no freezer compartment in the refrigerator so forget ice for drinks; there is no conventional oven (only a microwave). Two ancient and battered pans were supplied.The apartment does not have: chest of drawers; wardrobe (there is one small set of open shelves); CD player; DVD player nor telephone. The carpet area in the living space is very old and tired. towels supplied thin and scratchy. There is a mezzanine floor with two single beds - a double bed in the main living space - so it is best described as a studio. Luxury charges for substandard accomodation.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR188531584", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "eclectic6"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1186568-r21810093-Hoksbergen_Apartments-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "1186568", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
