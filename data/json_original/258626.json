You get the blanket which also takes the place of the sheet, a kind of combo thing. The AC worked wonderfully and kept us nice and cozy. We had one problem and that was a leaky toilet.

There's no good place to leave the car when checking in, and the valet staff seemed disorganized and unprofessional. -Staff at the desk seemed pretty indifferent about their jobs. It wasn't a warm or friendly welcome. -The walls were extremely thin, creating noise problems even in our 10th floor, exterior room.

It is definitely a good value/price ratio. The inside of the hotel is open, so you can see almost all doors of other rooms of the hotel from wherever you are. Staff is very nice and polite. The fridge that is in the room is actually just a mini cooler, not really a fridge, so they brought me an actual mini fridge because of that.

The swimming pool area is not very nice, and the pool is small. The clock on the wall was broken all days there, until I pointed it out to the pool keeper. The restaurant at the hotel - eh... I tried going there for breakfast once, but it seemed to be chaotic, I was not sure if it is a buffet or order type, and there was no information at the front desk about it. This hotel is one of very few I have been to where they do not have information about the hotel channel on TV, even though TV was really good. No nice views through the window - just buildings and empty dirt lots... The hotel is quite new though. The nice part about it - you can walk to the Galleria Mall, which is a huge plus for two reasons. You can park there in the mall's garage- a huge minus for the hotel - they charge you for parking, 24 dollars a day (in Texas??? really??? I did not have to pay for hotel parking in San Francisco!). Another huge plus of the mall being so near - that's like the only thing there is to do in Dallas. The most boring city I have been to. The food though is really good there.

Secondly, what little staff they had was extremely unfriendly. I was basically asked what I needed when I went to the front desk and was handed the key to my room. The third thing that irritated me was the fact that you had to pay $20 to park your own car maybe 50 feet from the entrance of the hotel. I am used to paying to park but $20 is extremely unreasonable. (TIP: If you ignore my review and just really want to stay at this hotel. Park your vehicle across the street at the Galleria. It's free!!! Tell the front desk you arrived in a cab.) Lastly, we heard strange sounds in the middle of the night coming from our restroom.

I stayed in one of the outside suites (x20) which has more space than many rooms. The room itself was very relaxing, a good sofa area and large flat screen TV (I personally hardly ever switch it on). The bedroom was open and airy - the bed up to SPGs high standards was very comfortable and easy to sleep in. For a change, the AC actually cooled the room so this was a big plus. The bathroom was spacious. The staff were all very helpful and super-friendly. I arrived around 1.45pm and had to wait till 3pm for my room (which was upgraded as I'm SPG Platinum so that was a big plus - thanks). Waiting was comfortable in the lobby and it gave me a chance to grab some lunch. I only had a couple of gripes: My big concern (and I expressed this to the staff at the welcome reception) was the comfort at the desk for working - I had a couple of hours work to do at my computer and after sitting in the high stool for 40 minutes I had to leave the desk - it's simply too uncomfortable to work. Unfortunately the sofa wasn't conducive to working either - so if you plan on working in your room, and assuming all rooms are the same, you may want to consider the Westin on the other side of the Galleria. Personally I like the style of this hotel over the Westin but those desk stools are seriously uncomfortable since the front rises up and digs into your legs. The assistant sales director said nobody had ever complained ... which amazes me. (My recommendation would be to have ergonomic chairs that are comfortable to work in over designer wire stools that look chic). The location next to the Galleria provides plenty of choice for shopping and food. Another reason I booked this hotel is it has an indoor pool - unfortunately it was closed due to maintenance when I was there. My other gripe was the electric outlets next to the bed (though this hotel is better than some) - at least this hotel has a single outlet available on the left side of the bed (opposite side to the clock radio) - surely hotel designers realize people need bedside outlets! And the clock radio has no \"sleep\" function - so while it can charge my iPod and play tracks from it, if I just want to listen to the radio and have it shutoff automatically ... well fortunately I have an app for that on my iPad - wifi was mostly good - though other reviews suggest otherwise.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abilene, TX", "Title": "\u201cGood location, good price\u201d", "Author": "txninja", "ReviewID": "UR116121109", "Content": "We got a steal on our rooms at this hotel, and I'm glad that we had the chance to experience it.

We have stayed in a number of hotels in the Dallas area over the years (Westin, Crowne Plaza, Hampton, Hyatt, Hilton, Adam's Mark, Sheraton). By far the Westin Galleria is one of our favorites. But we saw a good deal at a \"4 star\" hotel at Le Meridien so we thought we would take a chance. We knew about the $20 a day parking policy before we got there so it wasn't a shock to us. I think the parking was excessive, most valet's I've used before are 5, 10, or 15. When we got there I was relatively impressed. The first valet, Kenny, took the stuff up to our room and was very helpful. He got in and out of the room so fast I had to track him down to give him his tip. The other valet's, on the other hand, were horrible. They were slow, and inattentive...I was not as generous in my tipping as I usually am with valet's because (at $20 the tip should be included) and the service sucked. The room was a poor attempt at being chic, but failed miserably. The room was all white with accents of black...it was a bad attempt at french decor. You could tell, by the white paint how dinged and worn everything was. A word of advice to the hotel, using soft or colored lights would go a LONG way in making everything look better. The pool was just about the same, poorly kept. One person who came down to swim accidentally pulled the railing out of the concrete twice, getting in and out of the pool (talk about poor workmanship.) Housekeeping only came 3 out of the 5 days we were there, and we had to ask for it almost everyday. They came one day at 3pm, one day after 5pm, and one day we had to ask the front desk to send them when we left for dinner at 7pm because they had not come yet. The first time they did a poor job (put dirty towels back on the rack and barely made the bed.) The second time they did a little better but not much. The last day was the only time they vacuumed and actually did a decent job cleaning up the place. On the morning we left I called the front desk and asked them to send someone up to help with our luggage. We waited over half an hour and no one came. I walked down to the valet to ask for help, they clearly had not been notified. I tipped one man $5 to help us, he came to the room with the cart, but I had to put all the luggage on the cart myself, and when we got to the car I had to load the trunk myself. (What did I just tip for?) I know this is going to come across as a snobby review, but for a hotel that claims it is 4 stars, I expected MUCH better.

My first few stays were nice. Overall, this is a pretty good option in the area. Modern hotel with modern furnishings, good TV in the room, nice lobby, good indoor pool. However, the WESTIN GALLERIA is a much better option, and depending on your corporate rate, they are the same cost, since Le Meridien charges you for parking. Here are my main complaints: Consistency of service: As a loyal Platinum level customer, I expect to be treated consistently well each time. However, service here is very inconsistent. Depending on who checks me in, I will either get placed on the top floor, or I will get placed on a lower floor. The top 2 floors are reserved for Starwood Elite members. They give you a robe, free water in the rooms, candy... However, there have been times when I get these amenities in the lower rooms, and times when the upper rooms do not have them. For instance, I just had to call for water and a robe and I'm on the 5th floor. Build Quality: I noticed that although the rooms have nice-looking mod furnishings, they are not of high quality. The table lamp for example, had the shade part just fall off as I was adjusting it. The toilet paper holder has fallen off the wall on 3 different occasions in 3 different rooms. Amenities: There is no kitchen here, I am not sure why one of the people posted this. They give you an empty fridge, that's it. The gym is rather smallish, and not enough free-weights. The Marriott, Westin, Intercontinental in this area have much better gyms. Parking based on my corporate rate is $10.00 a day. I am not sure why they charge you valet in this area. Westin does not charge for parking! Pool is nice, though it's indoor. The Westin has a nicer more resort-style outdoor pool. The Marriott on Quorum has a pool that is indoor/outdoor which is a nice option. There is no lounge for Starwood elite members - so no free happy hour. They do however offer free breakfast if you are a platinum level guest. Cleanliness: On a scale of 1-10, the room has a cleanliness average of 7 for me. I've found the random long hair here and there, and even though this hotel is only 1.5 years old, it's age is starting to show on the doors and walls (scratched up). I stay here because I'm a loyal Starwood customer and I like their points program. The overall Starwood brand has good hotel options in most cities for the frequent business traveler. However, it only serves as my back-up place when I can't get the Westin Galleria as that place tends to get overbooked. Overall the staff is pretty good. They are nice, polite, and responsive.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel but not great, valet parking in this area is unnecessary!\u201d", "Author": "the_wosh", "ReviewID": "UR108002950", "Content": "Renovated hotel - skimped on odd things like the elevator panel.

I called down to the front desk and engineering wasn't around at that time to replace it. Then I discovered the toilet paper holder was practically falling off the wall so it was slanted down. The soap dish rack was also broken in that wasn't fastened to the shower wall properly. Albeit minor, these things don't make for a good impression for a hotel that you'd consider more upper-tier. Their elevators have \"soundscapes\" - instead of literally elevator music, I heard rainfall one night and crickets last night. Loudly. Overall, for the value, it's a good place to stay.

Christ was our bellman/valet and he was very friendly and prompt. When we got to the front desk, there was a line of about 5 people waiting to check-in in front of us, with only 2 hotel staff at the check-in desk. When we got to the front of the line, about 15 minutes later, we were told by Taylor that there were no clean rooms available at the moment and that we would be notified as soon as something was available, most likely in about 20 minutes. We went to the bar grabbed a drink and sat down in the lobby. After an hour had passed, I went to check on our room. I again waited in line at the check-in desk for about 20 minutes because there was only one person working the desk. When it was finally my turn, I was told that my room had been ready and someone tried to find me but couldn't so the room was given away. What? I watched the front desk the entire time we were waiting and no one even made an attempt to find us. My name was never called, no one came looking for me. Luckily, Bookie was able to call and find a room for us. Had I never gone up to the desk to check, I probably would still be sitting in that lobby. The room was nice...nothing to write home about. It just seemed like we were in a modern, 2-3 star hotel. Not a 4 star Le Meridien. Maybe I expected too much. All in all, I was disappointed. The food was eh. The service was eh. Won't go back.

When we first got into our rooms, the door was stuck. We had difficulty opening and closing the door throughout our stay. Ok, not a big deal. We can get over this.

Thank God nothing was stolen) Next the lights in the bathroom did not work. It was an intermittent problem so when we called for help, the lights did work. Of course they did not work when we needed them, like in the morning when we wanted to take a shower and when we had to use the bathroom at night. Ok we got over that fine. Next our linens were not clean. They had a very strong musty smell to them. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to make a big deal out of this. We just called the front desk and asked for fresh linens. When they brought the next set of linens, they smelled worst then the first set of linens. Ok now, so are starting to get annoyed. So then we again called, told them that we did not have clean linens wanted a set of fresh linens. The guy finally came with fresh linens. While he was making up our bed, someone came over the radio ( the walkie talkie) and told said that we were going crazy! Did someone at the front desk just call us crazy for asking for clean linens?!?!?! Now mind you we were not rude, or even angry at this point. We were slightly annoyed. Next we decided to go to the bar and get some drinks. We told someone at the front desk that we were unhappy with being called crazy and he said for our inconvenience he will comp our drinks .

The usual disappointing part of the stay is the mandatory valet daily fee of $20, but after getting the room as such a discounted price, this is usually overlooked easily. The entire hotel has a very modern feel, and has a great atmosphere overall. On this particular stay, I was placed in room 1003 (three doors away from the elevator on the 10th floor). All through the night, we could hear the noise (or vibration) of the fast elevator zipping up and down. It was weird because it was louder in the room than in the hallway in front of the door. Before arriving at the hotel this time, I did read a few reviews that mentioned the elevator hum, but figured they were just being dramatic -- and I was wrong. This hum seemed very minor until you try to sleep while air and heat are not blowing. It's nearly impossible. My alternative solution at 3am was to turn the A/C fan switch to \"on\", but to my surprise, there is no such option. Other than the three-day roar of the elevator, the stay was very enjoyable. We tried to dine at the bar area Christmas Eve night (assuming it would be hard to find anything open), but after looking at the elegant menu, decided to get up and go find something normal to eat. I also visited the business center during this stay and was very impressed that everything actually worked correctly, as in so many hotels, there's usually something out of order. I would recommend this hotel to a friend (or even to myself in the future), but only if the room booked is at least 50 yards away from the elevator! :)", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Woodlands, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWOW!

We booked the hotel based off the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. But after staying only one night at this hotel, we had to check out and find other accommodations in Dallas. The problems started with the open concept of the hotel itself. Few reviews mention this, but the hotel is designed with an open-air concept that exposes most rooms to the expansive lobby/bar/elevator areas. The rooms are not sufficiently sound-proofed to limit the reverberant noises originating from the main floor. In fact, at 2am we heard a piece of silverware fall onto the lobby's marble floor from ten floors up. Not to mention earlier in the evening when we were subjected to loud music and crowd noise from the bar area. Bottom line, if noise is an issue for you...take note. Second, as a four-star property we expected the room to be immaculate. The bathroom floors had stray hairs in the corners; the walls and doors were worn and chipped. And the bathtub was far from new. There is a fridge in the room, but it doesn't work. Third, wireless internet service is complimentary, but when we arrived we were told that they were having server issues. In other words, no wifi anywhere in the hotel. They gave us an ethernet cord to connect in our room, but that did not work, either. The only place where the internet worked was in the business office on the main level, which was busy with fellow travelers checking their emails. The hotel staff had no idea if or when the wi-fi service would be back. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful, and some of these issues were certainly out of their control.

The staff here consistently far exceeds that of any of the SPG properties in Dallas, they are polite, calm and unfrazzled (they seem to be very well trained and know their stuff), and efficiently execute (both what they are supposed to be doing, but also I can honestly say they have made good on every service promise they have made to me [wake-up calls, room deliveries, dry-cleaning, replacement of breakfast hang-tags, valet, room service]) So while i've stayed elsewhere before finding this gem the consistent service, SPG / Platinum recognition, and North Dallas convenience makes this a winner property for me. As a side - not sure how this hotel fairs with the leisure travelers since its not close to the core of Dallas but the feel of the hotel is calm and relaxed... admittedly it doesn't have the \"resort\" amenities, but then again its not what the hotel is going for I don't think", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but not much more...\u201d", "Author": "heathercade1", "ReviewID": "UR69837065", "Content": "I recommended Le Meridien Dallas North to some of my out of town friends - my best friend lives next door @ Villa Piana - so the location was great & they could walk to the Galleria.

Being upgraded with my SPG Preferred status. The room was very quiet. Good location with easy access to 635 and North Dallas Tollway. The valet did get me bottled water for my drive when I asked. Dislikes This property is old and lacks the charm (local art, funky decor) of other Le Meridiens I've visited. Room service meal was not very good. I know not to expect 5 star, but I did not even eat my salad as the dressing was very mayo-y....like mostly mayo, gross. Also, they delivered the wrong dessert. But I was too tired to call down and ask them to exchange it. Also, they only brought one set of silverware, napkin for the two of us. I LOVE Le Meridiens bath products, but my bottle marked lotion actually contained shampoo. The towels were very scratchy. Paying to park (20). I could easily have parked my own car in the lot right by the front door. I rate this property as average because it is nothing special.

Found a great prepaid rate on the Starwood website. Since is was such a reasonable rate we booked a suite! Check-in was fast and efficient, as was the valet parking. Since we are Starwood Preferred Guest members we were on one of 2 floors for SPG members. Our suite was a corner room on the 10th floor. There was a large living room with doors into the bathroom and bedroom. Had a large sofa, refrigerator, bar height desk with 2 stools. The bedroom was small and the closet was not huge but was big enough for a weekend. There are no drawers for storage at all, so could be a challenge for a longer stay. The bathroom was OK, tub/shower combo, toilet and a single sink vanity. Not ultra luxurious but clean and efficient. Free wi-fi was available and seemed to work just fine. We tried room service for a late lunch. It arrived very quickly and the burger and fries we ordered were really good. Service in the bar was quick and efficient, but it should have been as we were nearly alone there. We never saw more than a handful of people there over this weekend, they were obviously not very full. Also tried the breakfast buffet, it was fairly good for a hotel breakfast. Service was good and attentive in the dining room. I don't really understand a trend I am noticing in recent hotel stays; there is not a lot of printed information in the room about the hotel. I suppose it is a green trend, but I like having a hard copy of what the hotel offers, when, where, and so on. The phone in the room has a single button to push for service which is answered quickly, but some things you hate to call about, ie, where is the pool, what are the hours, hours of the restaurant, etc. As mentioned by other reviewers, the only parking option is valet. Since the hotel was not full it never took long at all to get the car retrieved. All staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful.

However, this was a belated Mothers Day get together and the area was close to my brothers place, as well as being easy to navigate to for my mother. Check-in was efficient, courteous and helpful. I had booked two rooms but the gentleman was not able to find them next to each other, as a matter of fact they were on the exact opposite side of the hotel from each other. Thank you for that!! (did I mention the other room was for my mother?? I kid, I kid, but seriously, could you put her on a different floor please??) The rooms are nice and spacious with room to entertain guests if need be. The flat screen lcd can be extended out and positioned to face the sitting area or the sleeping area. The mini fridge in the room does work, don't let them tell you different. It seems they are in the process of setting them up for minibar service and probably do not want people getting to comfortable with them being empty. However, the one complaint I have about the rooms is that one of them had black marks all over the walls. This is something I noticed in the hall ways as well. It's as if someone went through with luggage carts chipping off the plaster on the corners, and marking up the rest. In both cases house keeping should have made some sort of an attempt to clean and cover up. The decor is bright and modern, and it's a shame to let these things detract from that. On the same note, they have these modern looking hanging lights next to the bed. It's a set of three and one was broken with a bulb out in another. Again, these small details might give the impression that they are over looking other things as well. In the lobby there is a very nice bar/meeting place for you and your guests to enjoy a drink. It's nice that its out in the open and not hidden away, and by how many people were constantly there, it seems they agree. Nothing leisurely about the pool though. Unfortunately, it's an indoor pool and when I went to check it out I was very disappointed. I could hear the screams of small children and when I opened the door I couldn't hear myself think. All of this was cause by two small children and an adult. For this reason I can not recommend this hotel if you are looking forward to relaxing poolside. Overall this is a great hotel if you need a place in the area and are not looking at it as being a romantic weekend getaway or anything. A business trip or family get together/meeting place better suit this hotel.

It's located directly across the street from the Galleria, and was no more than 20 minutes from all the different activities we planned for the weekend. Location: A The hotel itself looked very new, fresh and clean with a modern decore. We stayed on the 9th floor and our room was spacious, with a nice view of the surrounding city. The beds were comfy, the floorplan open, the decore nice and new, and there was a large 42\" flat panel TV mounted to the wall that swiveled out to accomodate just about any location in the room. Hotel & Room Condition: A Service for the most part was pretty standard. The front desk was friendly and did their jobs well. Nothing above and beyond, but still good. The valets were friendly and fast. Service: B Parking was not ideal. They only offer valet parking. No self park. This tacks on an additional $20/per day + taxes + tips. As mentioned above, the valets were friendly and fast, but if this is mandatory, just include it in the room rate. The way they have it makes it feel a bit deceptive. Parking: D We were gone most of the day doing various activities. Each afternoon when we got back we found that housekeeping had not arrived yet. For whatever reason (the hotel was far from full), their schedule had them stopping by around 4-5pm, which was inconvenient. Once there, they did a very thorough job. Housekeeping: C The room comes with complimentary wifi. Service was very spotty. 50% of the time it didn't work at all. Another 40% of the time it was incredibly slow. The last 10% it worked adequately, but still not very fast.

What makes a Hotel is the Staff,which includes everyone from the top down and how they treat you and here the friendliness is outstanding.From the Front Desk Manager to the housekeepers we were always greeted with great Texas hospitality. If you need a shuttle ride,the drivers are very hospitable and effecient on driving you to your destination and picking you up.That's rare again in a Shuttle Service. The music played in the Lobby..newly renovated by the way..accents the chic decor,very pleasant upon entering too.The rooms are very cleanand large, has a comfy couch..with a nice size 42\" TV ,and comfortable beds that you really don't want to get out of in the morning,and the BEST aspect is that the room had a fresh scent,again rare in most Hotels.The Bathroom..has two doors to enter,and you can imagine the space it provides,one of the largest we have encountered traveling all over the country. I rarely put a great Review on Trip Advisor,but being honest,you can't go wrong staying here whether it be Business or Leisure.By the way..the World Famous Galleria..is walking distance right across the street for the people who love their shopping. All in all..you will surely enjoy your stay here when in Dallas! You may find other \"cheap\" Hotels up the road..and we did in a past trip it was terrible stay at that,but you get what you pay for, so I do recommend staying here,trust me you will enjoy it.. By the way..the Business Center is state of the class and the workout area will get you a decent workout..go there everyday for mine. In this newly renovated Hotel,they did a great job. Come here and experience a claasy,chic,and most friendly Hotel.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cAwesome location...\u201d", "Author": "Charis16", "ReviewID": "UR53302363", "Content": "If you are looking for a place close to the Galleria this is it.

The check-in was quick and they were quick to change us from a double room (priceline.com) to a king suite at the first request. The room was decorating to beautifully in a chic decor. The bathroom is large and wonderfully decorated to match the rest of the room. The TV is huge. It has directly beneath is all sorts of \"hook-ups\" for AV wires, VGA cables, etc. We attached a VGA cable from my laptop to the TV and watched DVDs. We didn't try the room service and kept a Do Not Disturb sign out so I can't comment on those. The one thing I did love was the free business center. I was able to print our boarding passes and maps for the region we would be traveling to without spending a penny.

Beware discount travelers. You can book a room at this hotel for a competitive price online. Realize that there is only valet parking at a rate of $18 per night. There is also no vending onsite. Bring drinks and snacks or be prepared to pay at the mini bar or room service. Otherwise, the place is really nice. It is upscale and hip. The furnishings are reminiscent of IKEA style (but higher quality). I found the provided \"premium\" shampoos and conditioners not to be up to the hype. A coworker had to go buy their own. I found them satisfactory, but I am a short-haired male. Sometimes the hotel seems to be trying a little too hard to be hip. There is odd ambient music in the elevators. Many times I boarded the elevators with a guest that had just checked in. The look on their face when a soundtrack of chicken sounds started playing was priceless. The business center is lackluster. There are Macs that aren't fully functional (once again, hip over practicality). Also, the fax in the business center doesn't work. The rooms feature a very hand bar with stools, as well as a large flat screen tv that can be angled to any viewing position in the spacious room. Wireless internet access is marginal in the rooms. It works fine in the lobby. If you are going to need full speed internet access in the room, I suggest bringing a long cable. I like to browse while laying in bed, but my 10ft. cable wasn't long enough. On off-peak days, the wireless in the room was usable.

Also, the close proximity to the Galleria is great, we enjoyed the mall quite a bit. 2 comments about the service- after a night out in Downtown Dallas my friends and I were craving some late night snacks and the room service menu didn't have much that appealed to us at the time.

We called the front desk and they suggested that we have the valet drive us to wherever we wanted to get food and then bring it back, which he happily did! I have never heard of such a thing but it was incredibly thoughtful and convenient! Also, the next morning I went downstairs to the lobby in hopes of getting some coffee and breakfast with my friend. Unfortunately the bar area had stopped serving food but we asked a man in the area and he said he would have whatever we wanted brought out to us.
