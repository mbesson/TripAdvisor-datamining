{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great villas in Seminyak It's an expensive hotel but it's so private and so beautifully appointed you can't be disappointed by this very special property.Located directly opposite of The Legian, the sister property i don't especially like even if the veiw is ten times better, The Club at The Legian is a very small resort of only 11 villas with pool and a large pavillion where you can have a drink or take a nice and delicious lunch by the large pool resort.But if you decide to stay in this resort, it's mainly for privacy because each villa is secluded in a nice garden with a 10 meters pool and a very comfy day pavillion for private dinners or breakfast. You'll have the advantage to have a private butler, always available on call and the staff is really nice and helpful. It's one of the best service i've had the chance to experience in an hotel.The layout of the villa is excellent with a small sitting area with a Bose entertainment system; a large bedroom with an impressive bed and a bathroom with twin vanities, a rain shower and on a wood deck a very sexy bathtub. All the doors of the villa can be open for an airy house with direct connexion between inside and outside.About the decoration, it's simply amazing and very original and you'll feel so relaxing and cool in every space of your private villa and garden you'll want to stay here for lifetime.Moreover, you'll have all the advantages of a club lounge with complimentary minibar with a good selections of soft and alcoholic drinks, a bottle of sparkling wine on arrival, a selection of CD, DVD and games in your room, a complimentary unlimited laundry and complimentary cocktails and canap\u8305s on the evening.You'll have no view on the sea but an access to The Legian for the view and the beach leisures is always possible; You'll pay no less than 650 US$ per night but you'll never forget this fantastic experience and if i have to return back to Seminyak, i'll always choose this ultra fashionnable and excellent resort even if i don't like the management...", "Date": "Jan 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR862859736", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ccrr77fr"}, {"Content": "\u93c8\u20ac\u6942\u6a38\u4f04\u7490\u546e\u5e76       Outside bath", "Date": "Jan 10, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR209046017", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "piccolo-cologne"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u253f\u5058\u9288\u641e\u5131\u9288\ue76c\u5136\u9289\u7b3a\u4efe\u9289\ue042\u5069\u9289\u7b3a\u5113\u9289\u253f\u5046\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(21745413, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR783092085", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Das Legian bietet perfekten Service!   showReview(19002268, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR812883550", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Garonga"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6dec\u5045\u9289\u253f\u4f04\u6434\u51a6\u4ecc\u9287\u3123\u512b\u9289\u5b28\u511b...   showReview(20348384, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 26, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR464537605", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d811531-r12782075-Club_at_The_Legian_Bali-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "811531", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
