Firstly, we were on a budget and were not looking for anything luxury, just a place to sleep. If you want to stay in the heart of Amsterdam, in a basic, clean and comfortable room then this hotel is perfect! When you come to Amsterdam for only two days you should be out sight seeing...not sitting in your hotel room watching T.V! Before booking you should be aware that it literally is on the red light district and it is noisy. Not in periods, not in short bursts, CONSTANT noise as the red light district starts to get busy at night, right through to about six in the morning. For us this didn't matter, as after a long day of travelling and sight seeing we were able to sleep through this. It is one of those scenarios; common sense is to realise it is on the red light district, you know it before you go, do not whinge about the noise when you get there. Had a straight forward check in process, walked in to the bar, got the key and paid. Each time you want to leave the room you hand the key back to the bar maid and request it upon your arrival. Simple. The room isn't fantastic but you get what you pay for. Beds were quite low, a bit like a futon, but comfy enough. Really suprised when we got there and found that it wasn't shared bathroom and shower facilities, you get a key for your own bathroom as well which was literally two steps across the corridor from our room. REALLY steep stairs..... I would say if you are disabled or have any problems with mobility this hotel is not for you. Overall, the above disadvantages didn't bother us in the slightest. It really depends on the person and their circumstances but if I go on a similar trip to Amsterdam again I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kavala, Greece", "Title": "\u201cIn the heart of red lights district\u201d", "Author": "savvikos", "ReviewID": "UR125746395", "Content": "A chip solution in the heart of Red Lights District", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn absolute bargain in the heart of Amsterdam!\u201d", "Author": "PascalS22", "ReviewID": "UR121458327", "Content": "This hotel is ideally located for visiting Amsterdam. Whilst basic, my hotel room looked exactly like the picture on the website (there have been some reviews stating otherwise). I stayed in a single room, so maybe the variations in room may exist for doubles. The staff at the reception area in the Pub were always were friendly and helpful. Although, like some other reviewers I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still not sure how the security works\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you request the keys to a particular room number and whoever is behind the bar hands it over.... often the staff would change\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so how could they verify that they were giving the key to the right person? There is so much to do in this area and everything seemed to be a short walk away. It is in the heart of the red light district with many canals and restaurants very close by. I arrived from the main train station and walked to the hotel in around 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 15 minutes. Whilst there is a lot of noise and action outside the hotel, I could hardly hear anything from my room. The steps to the rooms are very narrow and steep\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not a huge issue for me, but would require careful attention if carrying full size luggage. When you consider the location, tidiness of the rooms, and friendliness of the staff for the price charged, this hotel is an absolute bargain.

All four reviews are correct. You check in with a lady behind the bar. She was nice and helpful. Very steep steps. One luggage per person & use the handrail to be safe. Single bed room was tiny by US standards, huge by Tokyo standards. Basic sleep accommodation, Euro type low sitting bed. bare desk, hotel, one lamp, a wind-up clock that needed to be wound, clothes closet. Bathroom vent was loud. High water pressure, very hot water. Comfortably heated, regulated by opening the window. Barred window had ugly view of roofs. Window bars probably a good idea since I might climb out the window to get on the roof. Since I'm in the middle of the RLD, I expected city sounds. Got the expected ones, and none of the unexpected, thank goodness... sirens, woman shouting/fighting in street, church bells ringing, distant car horns, street sounds, etc. Have to leave key with bar each time you leave. Very quiet in dawn/early morning. Street & hotel construction ongoing. Paid 55 euro for Sunday night stay. Would I spend that on this hotel again... possibly. Amsterdam is a great city.
