There was three of us sharing a room. The hotel would not take the card I booked the hotel with from last minute web site. I had to pay fort he hotel on another card which I did not want to do. The room we had was very small if fact it was difficult to get around the beds. There was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room although when we asked for them we were given them. The shower door let all the water out of the shower unit so before we could shower we had to mop up the water on the floor. As the room was quiet wrm we wanted to open the windows to let in fresh air, however the window handels were broken and we had a hard time opening and closing them. The light screen to one of the lights above the bed was missing and the bright light was very bright indeed. The staff were friendly enough, but we were told that drinks were served by a drinks machine in the dining area which had to be paid for. The breakfasts was on the whole reasonable, but the portions were mean! and the full English breakfast had no mushrooms or tomatoes and the beans were served in a tiny pot. speaking of tiny, the orange squash was served in a sherry glass so one gulp and its was gone. Whilst I understand the need for profit it must not undermine the pleasure of the guests stay. There was no over night porter or staff at the hotel and the lounge area, a small room off the main corridor, was locked up at night so don`t expect any socialisation after dark. If you have a serious disability then you will be very disappointed by the stairs of which there were many and access to the building was not accessible to wheelchair or people with mobility issues.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stavanger", "Title": "\u201cNo room for the cat\u201d", "Author": "tonycStavanger", "ReviewID": "UR120429272", "Content": "I have just finished reading an earlier review by Redwards81 of this hotel and completely agree with his comments. He wrote that you could not have swung a cat in the room. I say that there was not room for the cat. With my wife and I and two suitcases in the room, it was absolutely full. My specific comments were: - It was not big enough for a double bed. - The room was too hot but with the window open, the wind caused the window to rattle. I had to stuff paper between the two parts of the window to keep it quiet. - There was no soap in the shower soap dispenser. - Sitting on the toilet was very uncomfortable as my knee waqs pressing up against the shower. - The towels had seen better days. - Breakfast was a joke. The orange juice was served in a shot glass. One liitle swig and it was gone. - The food was either toast/preserves or cooked. Somehow they found a container for the baked beans which was even smaller than the orange juice glass. - We were the last ones down to brekfast so they started cleaning the other tables while we were still eating. The smell of detergent, mixed with the smell of food, was very unpleasant. - The nearest car park was 5-10 minutes walk away. For all of these pleasures, we paid \u00a3125 on checking in.

Tiniest rooms I have ever seen, even by European standards; I am NOT usually picky about this, but there was actually not even enough room to open my suitcase on the floor and walk around at the same time. Floors are very creaky and the walls/ceilings/floors are super thin and transmit every step, cough, flush of the other toilets, etc. You need earplugs or don't plan on getting any rest. Bathroom: F-. My shower stall had more mildew and mold than I have ever seen in my life, I took photos to show the front desk. To be fair, my friend said his bathroom was clean, but both of my different rooms were moldy. The drain did not drain properly, so I ended up standing in the water while I tried to get clean. Breakfast: A. Traditional English breakfast or a smaller option of cereal, toast, etc. Food was delicious and included in the price. Service: A. The front desk employees were very nice, friendly and helpful. They moved me to another room when I complained, although it ended up just as bad, at least they tried. Location: A. About 6-7 min walk to Pimlico tube station. Access to everywhere from there. The street where it is located is very pretty and classy. Price: C. They charged me 89 pounds a night (almost $140) for a TINY (not exaggerating there was barely room to open my suitcase on the floor) room, the quality of which was ridiculously awful. By London standards, I suppose that sounds cheap, but not for what you get. My experience: First room had EXTREME mold in shower and very noisy water pump room right outside my door, which kept me up the first 2 nights. They promised to turn it off after the first night, which they didn't do or forgot to do. Third night I was moved upstairs, but the next room also had mildew in the grout, and the drain once again did not drain, so I was showering in standing water (gross!). Then my heat went out in the middle of the night; I was forced to get out of bed and go downstairs to find someone to turn that \"pump\" back on so that the hot water would go up to my radiator. Why would they turn a pump off (even if it is noisy), if it provides heat to the rooms? After all the filth, trouble, and complaining, and even after I showed them my mold photos, they did not even offer me a discount or a free night or anything. Also, I wish they would include the WIFI with the price instead of charging 10 pounds per night. Kind of a turn-off. Even with some good features (breakfast, location, front desk staff), the lack of sleep on a very busy vacation and the dirtiness and size of the rooms was enough to ruin the whole trip. The front desk staff tried their best to accommodate me, but there was really nothing more they could do; I do appreciate their efforts.

Don't get me wrong--the location is fine, Robert the proprietor is very affable, the staff is helpful and well-intentioned, but it's really tough to pay over $200 a night for a tiny, faded room with a cramped bathroom whose sink and shower don't drain properly, and where the headboards of the beds are literally boards screwed into the wall to save space. The breakfast beverage you assume should be orange juice is actually made from some synthetic-tasting substitute. This kind of pointless cost-cutting just underscores the feeling that you're not getting value for the money. For anyone living on the U.S. east coast, the best way to put it is that if you paid over $50 a night for this setup you would feel ripped off. Since it's London, factor in what you think London is worth. One hundred percent more? OK, then it's $100 too expensive. Lest you think I'm too picky: When we moved on to Edinburgh, for the SAME price we had a beautifuly decorated, two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with 12-foot ceilings, granite-countered kitchen, TV and stereo, complimentary breakfast snacks and wine in the evenings, etc., in a great neighborhood.
