Breakfast I found to be basic- standard cold buffet but the crepes are excellent so do ask for those - they wont be on the table. A couple of things to note if you do decide to book here- there are no lifts so you will have a number of stairs to climb. There is no bar or restaurant in this hotel unlike others on the street. There is no foyer to hang out in, although there is a little garden/smoking area. Ladies bring your own hairdryer/iron! They only do an \"ironing service\" and will not give you an iron. Hairdryers are the zephyr like little ones you find in hotel bathrooms that barely move your hair - be warned!! There is a great little corner shop straight across the road that sells everything from bottled water to deoderant and all at good prices. The hotel also has free wifi which was an excellent plus for us.

As others have noted, the hotel is located within easy walking distance to Sultanahmed Square and is just down the road from a number of dining options. A convenience store is located just across the street, which we found useful for buying bottles of water or snacks for our excursions. There are quite a few stores in the area as well for souvenir shopping, but the immediate area felt laid back and safe. The breakfast spread is truely amazing! Fresh fruit, vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, omelets to order, and home cooked baked goods and home made cheeses. Crepes were made fresh and delivered to the table pretty much as soon as we seated ourselves. The young man waiting tables was eager to serve and quick to offer to refill your coffee or tea.

On arrival, we given a very friendly welcome and told our double room had been upgraded, which was a great start. The room was large, had seven windows looking out over the street and was immaculate (including the bathroom). The aircon worked well, and quietly. There were nice touches such as a kettle with selection of herbal teas. The decor was very grand with lots of gold finish, which might be a bit overpowering in other cities but in Istanbul it seemed to be appropriate. Bedclothes, curtains and other furnishing were all very clean and in good condition. Free wifi worked well (and didn't keep dropping out as in so many other hotels). Small LCD TV had English language channels including BBC World. No noise from neighbouring rooms at all. On returning to Reception we were given, without asking, a very helpful introduction to the local area and recommendations for places to visit, and to eat. Exactly as told, most of Istanbul's biggest sights (Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Islamic Art Museum, Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern ...) and tramway are within a few minutes walking distance, as are about 100 restaurants (the Turquoise was the best one we found - ask for the roof terrace). Breakfast was brilliant - a wide selection of sweet and savoury items, great coffee, fresh homemade bread, and a cooked breakfast on demand if you wanted it. An attentive waiter was always available, though not looming or rushing us. There was plenty of food too, so you didn't worry about getting to it before other guests! And importantly for lazy guests like us, you could take breakfast from 7.30 until 10.30. The room was very thoroughly cleaned every day - the owners of the hotel are proud of a technology they've invested in for cleaning sheets and it shows: everything was pristine. The only minor downside to our stay was occasional noise from the street - due to the busy, central location, and the fact that we were visiting during Ramadan - but the double glazed windows did a good job of cutting it down. When we mentioned this to our hosts, they immediately offered to move us to another room if it continued to be a problem, which it didn't (and we liked the room so much we didn't want to move anyway). None of the noise was the hotel's fault, of course, and would apply to any other hotel in the area. Although there are many good things about this hotel, the best part was the staff: always courteous, friendly, helpful, professional, and good English speakers.

I travel to Istanbul every year - I love this city! I always stay in the Sultanahmet area and I am aware that the hotels there are small with no luxuries. I also expect to get some noise because the area is busy and bustling. But what I got at the Darussade was beyond anything I would call normal. Every step made by anyone anywhere in the hotel made my bed shake- literally. And when i got neighbors above my room I could hear their every move, and the noise was multiplied by the wooden structure. In addition, there is an old house which is being disassembled and which is adjacent to one of the walls of the hotel ( which happened to be the wall right behind my head), so from dawn to late at night the hotel is shaking from the construction noise. I can only imagine how bad it will be when the construction begins. And to make things even worse- the hotel is located right on a busy road so the traffic noise is pretty bad as well. I have been out of the room most of the time but one needs to have a few quiet hours to rest- something which turned out to be impossible in the Darussaade. Even having a sound machine at nightndid not help with the constant noise coming either from the guest of the hotel, or from the street. The breakfast is decent, butbthe waiter stopped being polite after he saw that I did not leave him a tip the first morning. The variety of food is limited and worse than the other similar budget hotels in the area. Everyone in the reviews I read was praising the hotel staff, but I will disagree to some extend. One of the guys at the front desk was very nice and helpful, but the other guy even did not return my greetings and was treating me like a second- hand person. The rooms are extremely small ( even smaler than the other 4-5 hotels in that area I have stayed in), there is no space even to leave your suitcase. The only good point for this hotel is that it is either new, or recently renovated, so the bathroom fixtures are nice ( no luxury, but still nice), the furniture is also new but the bed is already too soft. There is free wireless internet at the hotel, but it is really slow- even for e- mail, and sometimes it just stops. So, if you come to Istanbul not intending to sleep or even to have an hour or two rest during the day, do NOT come to Darussaade. Go somewhere else.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cVery convenient location, exceptionally clean with friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "rjc_56", "ReviewID": "UR113961065", "Content": "We spent 4 nights in Hotel Darussaade and really enjoyed it.

Our favorite place, by far, is the Darussade hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only place we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed two years in a row, and we plan to go back in the future. When we travel to Turkey, we generally spend one night in Istanbul to get over jet lag, then fly to another city for our main vacation, then fly back to Istanbul and stay a few days before we depart--thus we have stayed at the Darussade on four different occasions (and in four different rooms, all of them superb.) You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see from my other reviews that there always seems to be a fatal flaw at other places we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in Turkey: a place may be beautiful, but the bathrooms flood, the heat in the room is oppressive and cannot be adjusted, or the management is rude. In one otherwise lovely place, we had to sleep with our heads practically out of the window to avoid a strong petrol odor. The Darussade is the only hotel that not only got everything right, (thus earning the only 5 star review of a hotel in Turkey by me thus far) but then went above and beyond, far surpassing any experience I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had in any hotel in terms of customer service, largely due to the superlative management by \u00c3\u2013mer Parmaks\u00c4\u00b1z. Specific examples of \u00c3\u2013mer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary customer service include: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Darussade offers a free airport transfer if one is staying four days or more. Last year we stayed one day and then returned a week later to spend three days, and \u00c3\u2013mer arranged for us to get the free transfer. In addition, because we booked two rooms--one for us and one for my mother-in-law, \u00c3\u2013mer offered a second free transfer, which we really appreciated. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 We were able to leave a suitcase full of (expensive) gifts we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d brought from the States for our relatives in Istanbul with \u00c3\u2013mer, who secured it in the office for when we returned for our second Istanbul stay a week later. This allowed us to travel much more lightly, which was really a blessing. Needless to say, all of our things were untouched and safe. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 When we had our relatives over (a party of 6), the Darussade made them feel quite welcome and brought up tea, coffee, and goodies for a very nominal fee. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 When I spoke to \u00c3\u2013mer (who speaks flawless English) before our first trip, I explained that my MIL, who lives outside Istanbul, would be coming with us and that she seemed to be concerned about showing up at the hotel before us (our flight was coming in the early evening). He offered to call her--which he did do--and introduce himself and welcome her to the hotel and assure her that her room would be ready whenever she would like to come in the afternoon. She loved getting this call and indeed felt very welcome and reassured. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 On our first trip, when we had concerns about the room my MIL was given (because I had read TripAdvisor reviews warning about noise by the reception), \u00c3\u2013mer gave my MIL our room and then upgraded us to a room on the top floor with a wonderful water view--for free! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00c3\u2013mer checks when you plan to leave, so if you have an extra-early departure special arrangements can be made for your breakfast. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This year, I waited a little too late to book at the Darussade; when I called \u00c3\u2013mer, there was no room available for the second leg of our trip. \u00c3\u2013mer offered to help us find a nice, reliable, reasonable place to stay elsewhere. As it turns out, the suite opened up, and \u00c3\u2013mer offered it to us for only 5 Euro more than a standard room! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00c3\u2013mer honestly told us that it is much less expensive to get a cab from/to the airport, which is around 40 Turkish Lira opposed to 40 Euro for a transfer arranged by the hotel. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00c3\u2013mer actually gave us a ride back to the airport--in his own car!--as he was getting off work near the same time we were leaving! Who does all this? Really, I am amazed and grateful. One of the reasons why we go on vacation is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get away from it all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd--the stress, the headaches, of normal life. To be met by such kindness, time and time again, just really warms the heart. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all! The rest of the staff also deserve a huge heartfelt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for their kindness, their professionalism, and their own superlative customer service! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 When we returned for our last leg of our trip this year, it happened to be on the morning that the President was giving a big speech AND there was a marathon, so that Sultanahmet was closed to ALL traffic! We had taken a cab, who was forced to let us off on a highway with all of our stuff! We made it up a hill dragging our stuff, then caught the tram to the stop by the hotel. We then called the hotel and asked them if there was any way they could help us. \u00c3\u2013mer was off that day, but the manager of the kitchen met us by the tram stop, took two of our heavy bags, and carried them through the streets. When we were close enough that they could call a car and not get in trouble by police, they did and gave me a ride back to the hotel. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The man at the front desk then rushed out and carried everything and took care of everything nicely. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The maid is super sweet and nice and does a really good job. Everything is as CLEAN as can be. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The young waiter is very nice as well. After the first day, he remembered what I like to drink and would fix it for me while I got my breakfast, then carried everything up to the little outdoor courtyard. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The pastry chef is PHENONEMAL!!!! I teased her that I hated coming to the Darussade because I always leave a few pounds heavier and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all her fault! She bakes the most amazing little apple cookies. The expensive pastry shops around the tram have nothing on her. She also makes wonderful borek and savory \u00e2\u20ac\u0153salt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cookies. Really, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the customer service by \u00c3\u2013mer and all the staff that keeps us coming back. But the Darussade also earns high marks in the following areas: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Location. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat it. The Blue Mosque, St. Sophia, Topaki Palace, and the tram (which goes to the Covered Market and also to the ferries) are all within super-easy walking distance. There is a ton of restaurants at every price point, cafes, and shops of every kind all around. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Cleanliness. Absolutely no complaints here. Our rooms have always been immaculate. And my MIL is VERY picky. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Appearance. Lovely. Fifeteen-foot ceilings (in rooms 204 and 206) with gold ceiling medallions, extravagant crown molding, brass beds! The outside of the hotel is also just as pretty as can be, cleanly whitewashed with window boxes full of flowers. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Comfort. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Delicious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the word that comes to mind. The linens are wonderfully crisp. The air conditioning is independently controlled in each room, and quickly adjusts to the temperature you set--a Godsend after a horrible experience at a super expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel (at the Dedeman, in Konya) that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow individual climate control. On a less substantial note: the Darussade is one of only two hotels in Turkey that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve encountered that include hair conditioner in their freebie grooming products basket--very convenient if you forget yours. A long review, I know, but our positive experiences with the Darussade have been so plentiful that it takes this much space to hit the high spots that occur to me, although there have been many, many more. Thank you, \u00c3\u2013mer and the rest of the Darussade staff!

This went a long way to ensuring we had a brilliant holiday, and for that I am incredibly grateful.

You still have the ability to turn on and off, set the temp and fan, but at night it will blow warm 18c air instead of cold (AC) 18c air. 2. the breakfast is handy, filling, and there is a decent variety for everyone. 3. the walls are a little thin - but this is a Turkish thing, not a Darussaade issue.

We had a deluxe room so will make comments about this room. It was nicely decorated and very clean. We did hear prayer time early each morning but that did not bother us. I don't know if this happens all the time or only at Ramadan. Our room was at the front of the hotel, generally it was very quiet. I guess the only addition I would make to the room was perhaps a box of tissues. The bathroom was very functional, clean and nicely decorated. I would perhaps have liked the hot water a bit hotter, but as the weather was warm it wasn't a problem. The location is excellent close to all the main tourist attractions. There are no tea & coffee facilities in the room but staff will bring you one whenever you ask. We were also offered tea when in reception one morning.

People in Istanbul are nice, but the nicest people are in Darussaade hotel :-) I would 1000% recommend this hotel: Facts:- Location:- - Centrally located, easy access (walkable) to all famous sites like Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Topkapi palace etc please refer to the website.You could finish visiting these places in the first one or 2 days as its very near.Nice place to walk around small alleys and small shops, please dont forget to Bargain :-D - Easy access to all other parts of the city like Taksim square, Egyptian bazaar famous Malls Cevahir(#1 in Europe) & Forum all within 20 to 25 min by taxi (the easy way) this will cost you not more than 20 TL. Cheaper will be tram, there is a tram station in sultanahmet square walkable distance (i would say 200m or less) its close to the Blue Mosque. - Easy access nice genuine Turkish food a bit expensive since its the touristic part of the city :-) try the kebap in Deverish restaurant oppo to Blue Mosque, nice food and also you can enjoy the Sufi show. Other good restaurants, please ask the best staffs in the world \u00c3\u2013mer and Cemil :-) their recommendations never disappointed us. - You should definitely try the cruise, i would recommend cruise at night, they have pick up and drop facility. Check with \u00c3\u2013mer ;-) Hotel:- - Awesome breakfast !!! Especially the apple cookie :-D, all in house baked cookies and bread, please try the Cay and Turisk coffee - The room we stayed in was opulent! very clean, the bed was comfortable and the room service was beyond expectation, excellent !! - Friendly, most helpful and excellent staff, they always have a smile on their face 24x7, i would like to thank - \u00c3\u2013mer, for making our stay enjoyable,easy and memorable. \"Thank you \u00c3\u2013mer ! you are amazing, you have been more than helpful and thanks for all the tips and suggestions, they were all good, you are the star of the Hotel\" - Cemil, for giving us all the excellent shops and spots of the genuine Turkish restaurants and the best of the best shops in Istanbul for Turkish coffee, confectioneries, etc. \"Thank you Cemil, thank you for everything, you are the most down-to-earth and humble person we have ever met\" - Turan/Soner, Thank you for preparing the best breakfast in Istanbul :-) - Cagatay, Thank you for helping us during our departure, you were extremely professional and very friendly. Keep up the good work !! Places to shop:- - Cevahir Mall (#1 in Europe) this place is huge (Taxi will cost you 20 TL not more) - Forum, its like any other shopping mall in Europe but nice (Taxi will cost you 20 TL not more) - Grand Bazaar, i would give this less priority, since its for Tourist ;-) you need to get your bargaining skills right here ;-) but its worth seeing this place - Arasta Bazaar, smaller than Grand Bazaar, but for souvenirs and other local stuff. - Egyptian Bazaar, amazing :-) you will see all kind of spices, you could buy the natural apple tea as well - HacI Bekir,its pronounced as Ha-jje be-kkir, the best in Turkey for all the Turkish delight. its close to Egyptian Bazaar, walk along side of the new Mosque you see next to Egyptian bazaar 100m you will find it on the right. Once again we had a great time in Istanbul apart from the 35\u00c2\u00b0c + heat :-D but since the hotel was near, we could always drop-by wherever we felt exhausted.

Good: 1)The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and never said 'no,its not possible\" to any of the requests.They responded promptly for room services,arranged taxi's for travel and even packed a delicious breakfast for us at 5 AM when we left one day very early for ephesus trip although the breakfast starts at 7.30 AM.They were also extremely helpful in giving suggestions regarding restaurants,places to shop,massage etc. 2)Warm & hassle free check in with a welcome drink.They have 24 Hrs check in with non-sleepy and alert staff round the clock.You don't have to ring a bell and spend minutes waiting for a sleepy staff to come even at odd hours. 3)Cozy, comfortable & clean room:We stayed in room 101 which is a deluxe double room with a bed room and a well appointed living room.The rooms were a bit small but adequate.But most of the hotels in istanbul are converted old houses and you wont get the feeling of warmth there in new hotels with bigger rooms.The room was immaculately clean and the staff made it a point to keep them clean at all times,even going to the extend of cleaning them twice daily! The bed was super soft contrary to few reviews here and the sheets,pillows and blanket were spotless and dust free.The bathroom was also spotless,with plenty of fresh towels,toiletries which included even a sewing kit and hair drier.The central AC was noiseless and worked perfectly to keep us comfortable.We really appreciated the free wifi (the password was kept ready in a printed sheet in the room), minibar with a variety of drinks & chocolate,programmable safe,lots and lots of storage spaces,cloth sandals to walk on wooden floor and the large office desk. 4)Stupendous breakfast with a buffet menu which surprised me with the variety of delicious items available.Even the items which were not there were prepared and served on request.I particularly liked the fresh baked breads,home made cakes,cookies and the cheese.The perfect way to start the day. 5)Location:The hotel is just a few minutes of walking distance away from major attractions as already mentioned here and so don't go for arranged city tours(the mistake i did) if you are staying here. Bad: Nothing major.The only problem we had on the first day was noise from the room above at night,like they were shifting or rearranging some furniture.But the next two nights were quiet and there was no noise from outside too. Tips: 1)Keep a travel adapter for electrical points to recharge your mobile and camera as all outlets are circular. 2)Book a room on top floor if you want a good outside view as the ground floor room view is restricted to the road outside. 3)There is a similar sounding hotel nearby so keep the address ready for taxi driver.Pronounce the hotel as \"daa-ru-saa-dey\" to make it clear for the turkish driver. 4)Always request taxi service via the hotel staff as this place is famous for taxi scams. 5)Keep extra time for traveling around as the traffic jams can get really nasty.Some areas are suddenly closed for traffic. 6)Make your international calls from hotel phone(they have direct call facility) as the roaming charges may be many times higher. 7)Keep an umbrella handy for rain,sunscreen lotion and sunglasses for day trips like ephesus tour,mineral water for drinking as i had to pay once 1 $ for a small water bottle at one location. 8)The roads are pretty small and always watch for traffic before crossing them. 9)The domestic flights can get delayed suddenly so plan accordingly.Our flight from izimir to istanbul got delayed and the entire evening was spent inside the airport. 10)Don't carry tripods if you are not a professional photographer as many places charge extra for entry or don't allow them at all. 11)Most sites have audio aids as a self help tour guide.Each point of interest will be marked with a number and pressing the number will give you description about the site.don't forget to look for them.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "kumicoul", "ReviewID": "UR66650686", "Content": "For our brief stay in Istanbul, I wanted something that was traditional, rather than a characterless hotel, The darussade was a perfect find.

Rooms - super cute and quaint, wallpaper, wooden furniture, wooden floors. rooms had a quaint european feel to them. large bed was very comfortable, sheets were sparkling clean as was the room. bathroom size was fine, it was super modern and clean. our room on the 3rd floor had an ocean view. Service - one word: outstanding. They did not just meet expectations, they exceeded expectations. staff were extremely welcoming, hospitable and more than competent. we really liked that staff were also proactive, they often volunteered suggestion like \"can we call you a taxi\", \"can we serve you breakfast in bed for free tmrw morning\", etc. staff were also very helpful with info about istanbul and getting around - it was our first time so this was super helpful. Location - in Sultanhamet, literally a 2 min walk to Blue Mosque. From there, Hagia Sofia, Grand Bazaar, National Archealogical Museum are all a further couple minutes walk. Nice area with lots of restaurants. IMPORTANT TIP: taxi drivers in istanbul are absolute thieves. they have a trick where they can change the reading on the meter. we stopped at our destination and the meter jumped from 20 liras to 34 liras. HOWEVER, hotels and restaurants are happy to CALL a taxi for you from \"safe stations\". Do yourself a favour and call taxis to pick you up, these guys won't cheat you and it doesnt cost any extra.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "From USA, living in KSA", "Title": "\u201cCozy boutique hotel with wonderful staff and great location.\u201d", "Author": "sweetpea1978", "ReviewID": "UR52896218", "Content": "I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff was always warm and helpful, the hotel is beautiful. Our room was small but very well-decorated with care taken to every detail. The room and hotel were clean. The breakfast was similar daily like some of the other reviews said, but we stayed for 6 days and enjoyed it everyday. Just ask for fresh orange juice and they'll make it quickly for you. Excellent location, a bit out of the main fray but so close to all of the main sites- we walked to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, the Basillica Cistern, Topkapi Palace, the Grand and Spice Bazaars. Be sure to check out the photo album in the lobby of the original structure in 1997.

The only minor quibble I had is that we requested two beds and the room was equipped with one queen bed and one rollaway which severely limited movement in the room. Other than that (and one little other quibble, below), this place was pretty much perfect. Great bathroom, shower, clean towels; good bed, clean sheets; and central and quiet location (except, of course, for the call to prayer early in the morning but that's to be expected anywhere in Istanbul) with a wonderful breakfast. You can get to any of the main tourist destinations -- which were the focus of this trip -- with a quick walk.
