{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved the place after having read the first review and saw the photos, I was a bit tentative. However, i went ahead to book the place. And as mentioned in one of the earlier reviews, the hotel is undergoing some renovation till early next year. Some noise is there but it's only till 5 pm.The service is excellent (asked for iron and i got it within 10 min). Staff is friendly. I stayed in a refurbished room and it's very nice. Totally pleased with it. The bathroom is a bit small but much larger than i expected. It's much bigger than some of the european hotels i stayed in. It has a bath tub so cant be that small right?The location is super great. The metro is 1 min walk away and there is a bustling Akasaka district 2 min walk away so food and activities are almost at your doorstep. I would definitelt recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR234166196", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Joethting"}, {"Content": "Would stay there again We were booked into the Akasaka Excel by our tour company and were not sure what to expect. We were very surprised. The hotel bedrooms are being remodelled and this will go on into 2009, so there is some building noise on some floors between 10am and 4pm. We had a double room on the 4th floor that had been recently renovated. It was very stylish. It was small, but about the size you would expect for a big city centre hotel, say in New York, Paris or London. We have stayed in smaller New York rooms that cost more. The bed was a bit hard, but not as hard as other hotels in Japan and China, or even the USA. The pillows were supportive. There were all the usual features, an expresso maker and a large LCD TV with CNN and BBC World. The bathroom was of a high standard and although there was no bath (we never use one) there was a very good shower with a large head, flexible head for reaching those nooks and crannies and a powerful body spray. The room and corridors and lifts were clean. The staff were very always attentive and courteous. This is Japan were smokers seem to out number non-smokers, so make sure that you get a non-smoking room and expect people to smoke in the public areas. The hotel is in a good location just across the road from the metro station and a small shopping mall. There are restaurants and bars, cafes, a Subway and MacDonalds nearby. The Cafe Croissant in the same block is good for breakfast. The West Park Cafe, in the same block upstairs, serves really good burgers at a reasonable price. If we go back to Tokyo we would stay here.", "Date": "Apr 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR677920908", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Golden-mole"}, {"Content": "Fly by nite (airport) style hotel My colleague and myself stayed at this hotel for two nights on a business trip. Luckily we have been to Tokyo before and stayed at one of the Marriott chain hotels and it was lovely. This review and my stay at the Akasaka Excel Hotel will not deter me from traveling to Tokyo anymore, but it has forced me to only book with larger chain hotels from now on. My colleague and myself wanted to stay in a location where we would be close to restaurants, people our age and easy access to public transportation. Akasaka Excel is the perfect hotel for that purpose, but the room that I stayed in was horrible! The room, the walls, the carpet, the tiles in the bathroom smelled like smoke. The room was filthy! The top sheet had two holes, brown stains, and white stains on it. My first reaction was to complain and be placed in a cleaner room, but then my colleague called my room with the same complaint. I was so disgusted at the accommodations of this establishment. I can actually say that the hotel reception area was probably the nicest area of the hotel. The buffet was shabby, but good enough to quench your thirst and suppress your hunger.

Rooms were very small as usual in Tokyo so it was not very disappointing. Good location from the subway, I do not really remember the name of the station. Across the street, there are many restaurants and there is dennys right next to the hotel and also the Mac Donald. Staffs are very helpful, Disney bus also stops at this hotel.

The location turned out to be an excellent one, just across from Akasaka-Mitsuke station making it very easy to get to the popular areas in Tokyo without any hassle. The staff are very nice and helpful. The rooms have blackout shades; they certainly came in handy as the sun came up about an hour and half earlier than I\u9225\u6a93 used to at home. The drawbacks were the bed and the pillows. We didn\u9225\u6a9b have to ask the staff to switch out the rice pillow. A foam one was also on the bed, but it was not much better. The bed was pretty hard. If you prefer firm beds, then this place is perfect for you. We like something a little softer however. We really only slept because we were exhausted from jet lag and sightseeing. One other thing to mention; the room has it\u9225\u6a9a own climate control, however you won\u9225\u6a9b get any A/C unless it has been turned on for the whole building (the fan will just run otherwise). You can however open the windows to let in some cool air. This works better if you've asked for a room on the backside of the hotel, not facing the busy street. A Citibank is conveniently close by to make cash withdrawals on your US ATM card a snap. We ate at the Suteki Kuni steak house a few doors down from the hotel - excellent choice! We also ate at the Hobgoblin Pub a few blocks away (see their website for directions) just so Hubby could get an Aussie beer and I could get a British cider; it was a treat as we can't get either in the States. There's a 7-11 right in the hotel building, and a Subway and McD's close by if you're all worn out on being an adventurous eater. If you're still in the adventurous mood, the streets on the other side of McD's are filled with possibilities. Internet is available at the hotel, but it's a pay-by-coin-slot type of arrangement. If you decide to take a cab to the hotel, it's easier for the driver to understand Akasaka-Mitsuke station(pronounced mitts-kay) than giving him the hotel name.", "Date": "Oct 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR920817779", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Care824"}, {"Content": "Fair choice The hotel has very small rooms, I was told this is the case in any Tokyo hotel.

The hotel was in a great location - across the street from the Akasaka-mitsuke Tokyo Metro underground subway station which made it very easy to get around town. If coming from Narita take the N'EX or Narita Express train (1 hour 4 minutes for about 3,000 yen) don't take the limousine (bus) because of the distance (30+ miles) and unpredictible traffic. The train is non-stop from the airport to the Tokyo Station where you can easily get on the Marunouch Line (stop #13) or Ginza Line (stop #5) for 160 yen and walk across the street to the hotel. There were good and bad points to the hotel. The bad, I am 6'2 and therefore requrested a double room for single use and my feet still hung over the bed. Don't expect large or tall beds in Japan. Also, the street noise was noticable so if you are a light sleeper request a room facing the back which is a complex of government officials' homes. The good, other than the location, was that they had blackout screens which really kept the sun out. I hate travelling and waking up at 6:00am just because the sun was shining through some flimsy curtains. In summary, would I go back? Maybe, the bed was small but overall it was a nice hotel - clean, relatively new in an interesting area close to transportation and the employees were very nice.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR732551860", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Mark1368"}, {"Content": "So good we even went back! Myself and my partner travelled to Tokyo in June feeling quite scared about the hustle and bustle and different culture in Japan. However we need not have bothered. The Excel Akasaka was brilliant. We travelled there from narita airport on the Limosine bus (\u62e215 each for an air conditioned 2 hour tour of Tokyo) which left the airport every 20 mins - buy ticket from small kiosk in arrivals centre. We then arrived at the Excel and although the area is fairly busy, it really quietens down in the evenings and at weekends.The room was spacious and the beds were very comfortable (not sure about the rice filled pillows but they were quickly changed). The room service was really great - very efficient and we were amazed how our room was really well cleaned yet our belongings didn't move an inch.It was really useful to have a 7/11 grocery store within the hotel (I think it stayed open practically 24 hours per day) which sold snacks, drinks and international phone cards.For those travelling who are either concerned about japanese food or you get bored of noodles and sushi after 2 weeks, there is a McDonalds and Subway across the road. A 'cafe croissant' for cheap and affordable breakfasts (which doesn't involve eel or grilled whole goldfish and rice) and an English pub called 'Hobgoblin' about 10 minutes walk away. There are also a few Italian Trattorias within 5 minutes walking distance. Although Akasaka is within the government area it still has quite a few really nice temples within a short distance. Our favourites were the Toyokawa nari temple (leave the front of the hotel turn right and then left up the main road and it's about 100m on the right). We went there on several occasions and sat in on the ceremonies. This was very moving. The second temple we enjoyed was very small but informal (passed McDonalds and Subway and continue up the hill)This hotel was great - it is across the road from the Akasaka Mituste metro station (direct line to Shinjuku, Shibuya and Asakusa)Would definitely recommend this place, in fact we went down to Kyoto for 4 days and cut the stay short and returned to the Excel for an extra 3 days. Tokyo is a great city, it is definitely the capital of contrasts. It is loads of fun and we had a great time.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR276020672", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Excellent Service and good value for money       Busy street", "Date": "Mar 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR562145658", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Globalist"}, {"Content": "Great hotel What a great hotel - the photos on Expedia do the hotel some justice!
