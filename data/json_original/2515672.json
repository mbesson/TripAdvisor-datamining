The room was large, and had nice furniture, the shower was surrounded by glass walls and the whole thing felt modern and trendy. There were plenty of aminents, and alcoholic beverages in the minibar plus crisps and chocolate were free. Nice initiative. Sushi restaurant next door that belonged to the hotel had the most delicious sushi we've ever eaten and the serving staff did everything and more that you would be satisfied. Nice pool and bar, etc. on the roof. The block where the hotels lokated is very nice. A small note, however, the bed was too soft. But it's a matter of taste. We were more than pleased with our visit and can really recommend this hotel to anyone except perhaps those with children.

From the minute we stepped out of our car to the minute Mike the Host escorted us into our room and began unloading our suitcases we were treated like VIP guests. Very cool. In honor of our anniversary they sent up a complimentary bottle of wine, which was a nice, very much appreciated, touch. We reserved the \"Large King\" room and it was beautiful. We LOVED the deep glass-enclosed bathtub/shower combo. Very chic. Very contemporary. Not necessarily appropriate if you're travelling as a family or with someone you're not comfortable being naked with though. But as a married couple we certainly enjoyed it! The beds were very comfortable and we appreciated the nice array of complimentary sodas, water, and snacks that were en suite. I'm giving this hotel a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star one for two reasons. One, at $35 I think the valet parking fee is pretty expensive, especially since there are no self-parking options that I could see in the immediate vicinity. I understand it isn't uncommon to pay such a hefty fee for valet parking in the Gaslamp (at Hotel Solamar it's $40!) but still...it seems a little piggish to demand such a high fee when that's our only parking option. Two, there's a rooftop nightclub that has a view of the San Diego skyline that wiIl knock you silly. That was beautiful. What we didn't like was the CIA-level security that began once the club opened at 8:30pm. There were tall, manly bouncers donning black suits and headsets looming in every nook and cranny. Once we returned to the hotel around 9:30pm after enjoying a nice dinner at Pannevinos, we were asked to show our room key several times during our incredibly short journey from the hotel lobby to our 5th floor room. Really? Were we staying at the Andaz or the White House? That just seemed a bit excessive. I was half expecting to get an assigned escort for the evening. Overall, the Andaz is a trendy, chic hotel that we thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend to those wanting a weekend getaway. We followed the recommendations of fellow travellers and requested a quiet room away from the nightclub noise. That was a great decision! I highly recommend doing that! While we still like to enjoy a good club scene we don't like to \"enjoy\" it in the wee hours of the night. One another thing..if you like to enjoy a more expensive, traditional Tuscan dinner I would recommend Pannevinos. But to be honest, the food was good but not for the price. We ended up having a late night snack at Brian's 24 across the street from the Andaz around 1:30am and boy was it AMAZING! A nice variety, breakfast served 24 hours a day, reasonable prices, and great service and staff. We went there the following morning for breakfast and it was positively delicious! We'd highly recommend it if you're looking for great food at a great price!

We took advantage of room service for breakfast daily and for dinner multiple times. The food was very good and delivered extremely quickly. It was however quite pricey (as is to be expected- as room service always is). The complimentary snacks and drinks in the minibar were a nice touch. Complimentary internet access was also a nice feature. I booked our room on-line and was taking advantage of corporate rate program. There was a discrepancy with our confirmed room rate, but upon showing my confirmation, it was corrected without question. I usually utilize the hotel concierge for recommendations and reservations. At the Andaz, there was not a formal concierge but everyone I spoke with was more than willing and able to make our stay at the hotel and the city a wonderful birthday weekend.

There is a roof top pool and apparently a club, which I did not venture to, as the unusually chilly weather did not encourage the former and my age did not result in my frequenting the latter. I was told by the check-in staff (which I thought was very open-minded of them, given my age group in the 50's) that there were 2 clubs, I believe one of which is a wine bar and that I would have a wrist band with free access to these areas if I so desired! There is an excellent sushi/Japanese restaurant in the lobby, Katsuya, which will do take out so that one can enjoy dinner in the room. There is complimentary wine in the lobby from 6 to 8 and always a changing array of fresh fruit in a large bowl at the small business centre in the lobby. I ordered room service breakfast once and it was delivered promptly at the requested time. This is a hotel with a heart, and I truly enjoyed my stay.

The cool thing about the room is the surround sound speakers for the TV. You could listen to the TV from the bathroom and the sound was like a movie theatre.

In any case, the queen room was super small (it felt too cramped for 2 girls) and the bed was pretty standard. The bathroom was designed kind of awkwardly, since I could basically watch my friend through the glass between the sink and the bed. I did have a major issue with the shower-- I don't know if they did it on purpose for a design element, but I HATED the showerhead. The placement of where to put the shower arm was so inconvenient (and I am only making a fuss because I kept getting soap in my eye since I was too short to reach the shower head and had to hold it the whole time while trying to shampoo, so annoying!!!!) I do have to give the hotel some stars: the service was attentive especially when I asked them to get my car charger from our rental car, they knew just where to look. Also the location is excellent and super convenient, right in the heart of the gaslamp district and close to all the shops and restaurants, that deserves a star in itself.

The rooms are not very big, again not a big deal to us, but they are modern in their decor, beds are very comfortable and have plenty little extras (refreshments) to make up for the size. The bad - lots of noise at night (which is why I gave it very good instead of excellent). 3 nightclubs on the property, I believe.

The rooftop lounge becomes one of the city's most desirable nightclubs. The wine bar provides plenty of comfortable seating for stiletto-weary ladies, along with a thumping DJ and a full-service bar.

We rang in the New Year on the rooftop, but there was NO countdown! Whoever the DJ was they should be FIRED! Isn\u2019t the countdown the best part of new years? No one knew the moment just passed by! 2. I waited 15 minutes for the elevator in the \u201cbasement\u201d club to go back to our room. The elevator attendant dropped off a full load but would not let us ride up even though it was the \u201cfor hotel only guests elevator\u201d. He made us walk up the stairs to the first floor only to catch the SAME elevator there. So annoying. The Room: 1. We had a tiny king room. The rooms are SMALL. There is not bureau to put your clothes. There was a bench with a couple drawers. Thank god we didn\u2019t stay long. 2. No floor length mirror in the room, not even on the back of the closet door. How am I supposed to see how my outfit looks? The ONLY mirror was in the bathroom over the sink. There was a magnifying mirror, but I could not use it because whoever installed it must have been 6'5\", and I am a petite 5'2\". The lighting the bathroom was very dim. Bad for bathroom. 3. Clear glass bathroom doors?! Kind of sexy for the shower but not the toilet! I need some privacy there. I would suggest frosting the bathroom door glass, especially since you can see the ENTIRE bathroom from the outside hallway!!! 4. The bathroom sink and shower leaked like sieves! There were giant pools of water all over the floor. 5. There was a refrigerator in the room, but it did not keep anything cold. 6. There is absolutely no sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear full conversations in the adjacent rooms through the walls! 7. No sound proofing in the windows either! All night long there were fire engine sirens right outside.

Then I ordered room service, docked my iPhone docked in their speakers and got some work done in a bathrobe listening to Coltrane.

We had to get past a muscly man in a black suit just to get in the lobby, and another one to get in the elevator to go up to our room. Then the dance music started and we thought we were going to lose our minds. The walls and floors were shaking from the bass beats. Music, conversations, and cigarette smoke just came pumping into our room like there were no barriers. It kept going until 2 a.m. when the club shut down. This repeated again on Friday night.

Free high speed internet, free bottled water, free snacks, free glass of wine in the lobby, and the rates are not out of line with the competition where you will pay a premium for every little thing. I did not stay on a Friday or Saturday evening however there were occasional events on the rooftop during my stay and I was on the top floor - never heard a sound. The rooftop is a beautiful space to go for lunch by the rooftop pool or an evening glass of wine by the fire pit - really nice. Great location a block from all the restaurants on Fifth Avenue.

Alchohol bottles in the room are at a premium price though after having a few drinks at the rooftop bar we may as well have opened them instead.

The wine bar looked pretty awesome but after seeing the prices of the rooftop bar drinks we found other happy hours in the area!! The second night we were out and about going to dinner and a comedy.

I also asked what I would receive as a Diamond member of Hyatt and she did a very thorough run down (which I appreciated because I travel frequently and can't always remember which hotel gives what). We had a junior suite (the worst part about this place was that it only has 3 master suites, so not getting one of those even as a Diamond member AND using a suite upgrade award netted me just the Jr. Suite) and I had hoped to get a great room. If I had known this prior to going then I would have saved my suite award and just paid for the room. As I mentioned above the worst part was my high expectations of the room I was going to get, but outside of that this was a great place to stay.

Again, over the phone they were helpful with describing the dishes and even though one of the orders was messed up, they IMMEDIATELY fixed it -felt like no wait time. We also ordered late at night and the overnight staff was as excellent as the eat-in room service staff during the day, again I say EXCELLENT. *As a side note, in the jr. suite room there were complimentary juices (orange, ice tea, and cranberry), water, sodas, granola bar, chocolate bar and chips. This is not done everywhere and as a business traveler having that stuff come with the room makes all the difference.* The location of the hotel is also central to downtown activities.

And when I arrived, I thought I had majorly lucked out. They let me check in really early (around 11 am) and the room was really sleek and modern looking (which I like). I ended up splashing water on myself and the floor, because I couldn't figure out how to use the modern sink and shower at first, but that's not a big deal. That evening I checked out the rooftop pool and bar and the Quarter Kitchen restaurant downstairs. The rooftop area is awesome, both in terms of the pool and the bar, and the food in the restaurant was really good, probably the best I had in San Diego. However, when I returned to my room for the night, I discovered why my room was so cheap. There is a club in the basement of the hotel, and my room over looked an air shaft/patio area adjacent to the club. From my room I could hear the music from the club fairly loudly, and occasionally also people talking. It wasn't too bad when I was watching tv, but it made it difficult to sleep -- eventually I had to call down to the desk for ear plugs. Luckily I am used to street noise and sleeping with ear plugs, so I was able to get to sleep easily after that, and luckily clubs close early in San Diego, around 2 am, so I only had to deal with it for 2-3 hours. So it didn't completely ruin my stay. However if you are a light sleeper, or plan to go to bed early, the Andaz probably isn't for you.

The customer service alone makes it a must stay. As soon as you pop in the lobby for any reason you are greeted and asked if there is anything they can do for you, whether it is getting you something to drink or helping you get transportation. (There is an Escalade that will take you within 2 miles of the hotel, and the driver was excellent. Very nice.) The rooms are unique, with the exposed showers. If you're staying with a friend or are in a platonic relationship, you probably will have to work around that, but if you're in a romantic relationship it isn't a big deal. I've assume you have seen your partner naked. Don't worry, though, the toilet area is private. No lock but you can't see through the door. While you may look sexy showering when your mate can see you, no one looks cool on the throne, so fortunately you can do that in private. The bed was very comfortable. I was out like a light despite reviews I had heard about noise. About that, the place has a nightclub in it but it didn't bother us. It was noisy in the streets but again, you're in Party Central with all the bars and clubs so if you are upset about that, then you didn't do research. It would be like attending a Steelers/Chargers game and complaining about the experience because you didn't know they would be playing football. My girlfriend and I were in bed watching True Blood on Sunday (we're not as young as we used to be) and the nightlife sounds didn't distract us. The complimentary items were a plus, too. Obviously you have to pay for the hooch, but the soft drinks and water were free. I liked that, usually you have to drop a little for a Coke or Sprite in other hotels if you take it from the fridge . Lots to do in the area. Ask the staff, they'll hook you up. I have read complaints about the security staff being hardheaded when it came to actual guests trying to get to their rooms when the club opened, but I didn't encounter it. I just showed them my room card and they were nice, and would have an elevator waiting. I have a feeling some of the complainers were probably drunk, tired, didn't have the room key handy, and when security just wanted to confirm for safety reasons, the guests copped an attitude. Probably L.A. types. I live there, so I know how they can be. Heck, they even give you a drink (not alcohol, obviously) for the road when you check out. They know you're leaving, they can pull a \"Well, we're done with them, our service ends now\", but nope. A little road soda, juice, or water to send you on the way. So stay here. You will have fun. But remember, this is in a popular location of nightlife. There will be noise. There will be drunk people. But you will have fun.

The hotel is very modern, and has a great vibe. I checked in on Friday night, and because I am a diamond member with confirmed suite upgrade, they upgraded me to a top floor suite with a view of the baseball stadium. The room was beautiful. Unfortunately, because of the noise from the club upstairs (given the Friday night combined with long holiday weekend), I asked for a room change after staying in that room for about 1 hour. Though the room was beautiful and the bathroom was stunning, the noise was actually a deterrent. The staff was extremely courteous, and came upstairs with three room keys, and had me tour three different rooms of comparable size but on different floors and locations in the building to see which one I preferred. I ended up choosing a room facing the inner courtyard in the middle of the building....so it was in effect furthest from the club noise both at the rooftop and on the ground floor. The room was very quiet. The next morning....the manager left me a personal note with apologies, and somehow knew I was playing a tennis tournament in San Diego (probably because of the huge racket bag on check in), and left me a new can of tennis balls, and a note hoping that I'd \"Ace\" the tournament. Thought that was a very nice touch. Breakfast was complimentary as a diamond member, but it was wonderful.....beautiful atmosphere at their restaurant on the ground floor. Very chic....nice American fare, and presented very beautifully. The last morning.....I had breakfast up at the rooftop where they had set up tables with umbrellas. Also very nice. The room itself was very modern. Everything you would expect from a 4 - 5 star hotel. Water pressure was good.....turn down service. Free mini bar for most of the items....(one of the andaz perks). Valet parking is a bit steep, but it IS the most convenient thing in the Gaslamp district.....which is quite lively and vibrant on weekend nights. I also thought that it was nice that the hotel recommended restaurants in the area...and not just their own restaurant. All staff were extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful. I think my only gripe about the hotel was the noise from the club, and also that the pool was closed for most of the day on Sunday for a big pool party....which we would have to pay to get into. The pool party definitely draws in a big crowd, but I think it is rather disloyal to close the pool to its dedicated paying guests who are actually staying in the hotel.

They were hassled by the door men and weren't being allowed in after they gave my name and said they were there for bottle service. The problem could have been handled by calling my room and saying I needed to meet them at the door rather than embarrassing them and leaving a horrible lasting impression!

When I called earlier in the day to see what my party and I needed to do I was instructed to go upstairs give my name and we would receive wristbands. I do not understand how that was so difficult! So we're done with the rooftop bar and decide to get food while one of our friends that wasn't staying there takes a nap in our room.

The Andaz is very stylish and well appointed. I find the concept to be very refreshing and look forward to staying here again. The customer service was superior to any hotels we have stayed in- inlcuding the Ritz Carlton. We also saw a very handsome celebrity that was staying in the hotel- kind of exciting! Check in was a little weird- as I wasn't quite sure where the front desk was but they check you in and escort you with your luggage to your room and explain everything. Most things in the mini bar are complimentary which is so nice to have. Decent sized bottles of alcohol are available for purchase in your room as well. They have a Escalade that will take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel, so be sure to use it. This is a happening place at night! We counted at least 3 bars one of which was on the rooftop. They have a special elevator for guests (to go to your room OR any of the bars) so you don't have to wait in line. It was great when we were getting tired at the end of night because we would come back here and hang out for a bit and then go to bed. The pool is also a happening place during the daytime, worth going to. Shower: it is open with glass but there is a solid door on the bathroom. It's different but it didn't bother my husband and I. It actually made the room feel more spacious. The rooms are not large (which is normal for downtown hotels in any city) but despite some other reviews we did have drawers at the foot of the bed which we found adequate. Ext vs Int rooms: I requested an interior room based on previous reviews of noise and was totally bummed that there is only a view of concrete walls, so I think I'd probably request and exterior room next time. Customer Service: So good that it was noticeable (and this was before we had any issues). They were great in every capacity. When we did have an issue with our shower leaking and they fixed it once, they had to come back again. They handled it well and I was pleased. It is rare to have good customer service anywhere these days but the fact that is was obvious from the minute we checked-in was refreshing. I highly recommend Sunday brunch at Searsucker down the street. It's about a 5 minute walk on 5th street.

Since I am short, I had to step up in the closet to reach. More puzzling was the giant glass wall that separated the bedroom area from the rest of the room. There was very little space between where the wall ended and the table under the TV began. I kept imaging myself walkimg into the wall, especially half asleep. I will say that everything looked clean and modern and both the sheets and mattress were very comfortable. While the room had enough space for 1, I think it would have been cramped for a couple. My parents came out to join me at the end of the trip and stayed in a larger room. Their room was similarly furnished with one important difference - there was a glass enclosed tub/shower in the middle of the room and no, it was not frosted glass.

Imagine our surprise when our taxi pulled up to a super sexy boutique hotel. Sleek in design, immaculate and pristine interiors, we were greeted by eye candy staff who were extremely courteous. One offered to check us in, the other whisked our bags discreetly away (our room wasn't yet available) and another made a complementary espresso for us. The rooms are amaaaazing, like something out of Wallpaper magazine. Very hip, urban and tasteful. Dark wood, iPod-friendly, LCD screens, free WiFi and a cocktail bar already set up for you to enjoy. Complementary drinks are available for you in the fridge (everything from pop, juice, cold water ... oddly the only thing not free is Gatorade) and you have a full mini-bar if you want to make your own martinis. Also available is a complementary snack tray - Pringles chips, Toblerone and granola bars. Sure, it's not Whole Foods, but it's more free food than you'd get on a airplane flight these days. For those who forget things easily, there's a menu available in your room of amenities available - at cost - through the hotel. These include a sewing kit and yes, even a vibrator. I guess you can be prepared for just about anything at the Andaz and they won't bat an eyelash. The bathroom is worth mentioning as a whole separate paragraph. The shower head is detachable and is shaped horizontally. It'd make for a great windshield wiper for your car. No bathtub, but very spacious shower. The only downside of the bathroom - gorgeous as it is - is that it is very tiny and there are no doorhooks so you're leaving your towel on the floor and all of your clothes on the floor. Please Andaz - put in a hook on your door or wall! Complementary thick plush robes are available for you in your closet.

Quality Social is a great bar/bistro across the street. 2.) Ben's 24/7 is a good breakfast spot at the Ramada a half-block away on Sixth Ave -- one of the only spots to grab an early breakfast. 3.) The Hub Deli is also a half-block down Sixth Ave., and it has booze, snacks and other convenience items. It's open late but doesn't sell booze after 10 pm and doesn't reopen until 8 am.

I have to say, my expectations were exceeded on almost every front. You could easily see the staff becoming very snobbish based on the fact that the hotel is such a hotspot, but they were pleasantly down-to-earth and \"real\". The hotel is home to one of the hottest nightclubs in town (on the roof deck), and hotel guests get VIP access (no cover/no waiting in line). On the flip side, this means that the music is pumping until 1am on Thu/Fri/Sat, so I would not recommend this hotel to early riders or my grandmother. But for those who are painting the town anyway, there's nothing like flashing a wristband and being whisked to the front of the line past all the local kids. The pool is located on the roof and is nice enough to be a bit of a scene during the day. You can tell that a lot of people who stay here over the weekend are celebrating something (yes, that's a bachelorette wearing a bikini and a veil in the pool). Lots of champagne drinking at all times. The rooms are stylish but not over-the-top. The bathrooms are spacious, which I always appreciate. One of those fantastic touches is that non-alcoholic drinks from the minibar are free; I don't know why, but I find it incredibly luxurious to actually enjoy things from the minibar without feeling the fiscal guilt of $5 bottles of water. The gym is small-ish but adequate with some free weights, a smith machine, and cardio equipment. One caveat (and I hope management reads this): our room had a very sharp, angular, low wooden chest of drawers at the foot of the bed that is impossible to see in the dark. At various points during the weekend, both me and my friend cut our legs on the furniture. It's just a design flaw and should be removed. Overall, a pleasant stay (aside from the bloodshed).

I've been doing a TON of travel all year and in the middle of traveling around with the family but I had to fly to San Diego for business and looked online and decided to book here as the rooms looked amazing online. I was just in San Diego a few weeks ago before we headed to Hawaii and we stayed in La Jolla in another Hyatt property. This time I was coming alone and wanted to stay in a hipper setting. I haven't stayed in the Gas Lamp area in many many years. I booked online directly on their website and it was quick and easy. I booked and put in my AAA # so they included breakfast daily. Unfortunately my meetings were so early and I had a hectic schedule so I never had a chance to try out the breakfast there but if you are a AAA member I suggest you book with it. I'm also a Hyatt Gold Passport member so they offered to give me a free late check-out up to 2 PM but I was leaving super early in the morning to drive back to LAX so didn't get to take advantage of it. But good to know for you Passport members. The hotel lobby is really gorgeous and really hip. They have personal managers that meet you and check you in. I did the online check-in but they still took some information and my credit card info. They are super friendly and it's cool they offer you something to drink. I usually travel with my wife so I book a King suite but I was coming alone so I booked a Queen suite but online they had an option to upgrade to a King room if it was available for $15 more per night. I opted for that and got the upgrade so stayed in the King room. The really polite guy at the check-in walked me up to my room and showed me the room. The king rooms are really beautiful. He explained that all the non-alcohol beverages are FREE. As well there were some snacks free. Here is a list of things that they didn't charge for: Still water Sparkling water Sodas Tonic Water Ice Tea Cranberry Juice Granola Bar Chocolate Bar Chips Lemonade Orange Juice Coffee and Tea This was the first time I stayed in a hotel where they had this type of set up. It was GREAT. In most places when you pay $200+ a night they charge you $5 for a bottled water or a $4 coke. I really liked this concept of offering these things free. Not only that but the next afternoon when I finished with meetings, I was in my room and a knock on the door and a really polite girl came by to ask if I wanted any more drinks so she gave me 4 bottled waters and asked me if I wanted anyone else. Just a great concept. I never ate in the hotel but they had room service and a restaurant there. There are so many restaurants in the area within walking distance. Definitely hit the Quarter Kitchen restaurant which is down the street. Beautiful restaurant and great food. The shower was really great with high pressure and rainfall from the ceiling type set up with another shower as well so you can use both if you want. Just keep in mind the shower is right in the middle of the room and you can see it from the bed so keep that in mind if you are shy traveling with someone else that you don't want to see you naked. Really cool decor and also a comfortable desk and also a sofa with a large 50' LCD TV. I didn't watch much TV as I was so busy in meetings and when I was in the room I was working. The GREAT thing that I loved is they don't nickel and dime you and charge for wi-fi. They had free wi-fi internet as well they had a cable. The signal was very strong and I ran a speediest.net and get 3 MB connection. In the lobby they have a few computers with a printer so I printed my boarding pass for my flight. Just keep in mind there isn't much privacy there but good enough for checking emails and printing stuff. Everyone was really friendly. The hotel is actually quite big. I was surprised how many rooms it has. The lobby evokes a totally different feel vs. seeing the rooms once you exit the elevator but once you get inside your room it's great. The only funny thing is the elevators always had this scent of men's cologne so they must intentionally put some odor there to smell like men's cologne. I'm moving to San Diego next month and actually bought a new car last month while I was in town. It was in storage but I used it while I was in town. The valet guys were always very quick but just keep in mind it's pricey at $35 a day. I always tipped the guys each time I came back so it can add up if you have a car. But those guys were so quick and friendly you should always give them a few bucks. FYI there is no self parking so that isn't an option. I read some complaints that said there was lots of noise. I didn't find it noisy at all but keep in mind I was there mid-week (Tuesday and Wednesday night). I was on the 6th floor in room #651 and it wasn't noisy at all. The bed was really comfortable and I didn't hear anyone else on my floor. In fact, I think the entire 2 days I only saw about 3 other guests so it doesn't seem like it's so busy during the week. Definitely I'd highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again and recommend it to my friends or clients. Really cool hotel.

My only major issue was the noise..... On the booking, a quiet room was specified and to be fair, they gave me a street facing room on the 4th floor, so I did not experience any noise from the nightclub. The problem was that the orientation of the room meant that I looked out over a nightclub and a 24hr food place and the double glazing might as well have been non existent.

Out of all possible answers including service, comfort, cleanliness, etc., I hope most of you will agree that it is a place you go to so that you'll have a roof over your head at night for some shut eyes when you're away from home. Well, Andaz San Diego fails miserably at the basics of what a lodging's main purpose should be. This hotel's first priority is not with the hotel guests who want to rest after a long day but with the young screaming crew who frequent the night club which this hotel is notorious for. We stayed on a Thursday night (it was not even on a weekend night!!) and the noise level was out of this world. It has the thinnest walls and windows ever!! We could not get any peace from 9pm to 3am. When checking in, we asked for the most quietest room they had since she warned us that we should not be alarmed about the bodyguards standing in front of the hotel entrance due to the night club. She graciously(?) assigned us to an accessible room on the 2nd floor facing out, right above the entrance to the night club!! When we had enough and complained about the noise at 11pm, we were repeatedly asked if we were staying for one night only (not that we would ever want to stay longer), and then moved us 2 floors up but still above the entrance to the night club. Noise level went down from 10 to 9 but not enough to sleep until all the screaming and bickering came to an end at 3am. As an apology, front desk offered us free breakfast and little did we know that this would be the icing on the cake. If noise from the night before wasn't enough, they started drilling and hammering down walls right above the restaurant when there were still guests eating breakfast. By this time, we were packing and running for the doors. When asked how our stay was, I told the front desk, \"Terrible. What good is 300-count European sheets and a complimentary breakfast if you cannot sleep or enjoy them?\" She apologized and asked if there is anything she can do to make amends to our unpleasant experience. I asked her \"What can you do?\" and the reply I got made me wordless. \"I don't know. I'm sorry you're not satisfied but the hotel is new and we are working on the kinks. Maybe your next stay with us would be better.\" Until they work out their kinks, anyone staying here has to suffer? Hmm. Sorry Andaz but we'll never stay here again and neither will any of our friends. So, if you're really insensitive to noise or you just love the vibrations of the nightclub music, stay here. Otherwise, keep away as there are too many better hotels close by that do care about their guests. A friendly suggestion to Andaz San Diego: I would recommend you benchmark Campton Place in San Francisco.

I love the wine bar idea downstairs. being able to chose your size and sample a variety of wines is really a great idea. I loved this. The staff made the entire stay unpleasurable to me. My husband I look young and he is a marine officer (and was often wearing his uniform). They never addressed us or even spoke to us. I saw them greeting several guests as they entered- offering wine and snacks. They never once offered a thing to us (and we stayed for almost a week). I do not know what it was about us, but we felt totally neglected. When I needed help with the printer, no one seemed to care that it wasn't working. It made the whole place seem snobby and uptight which led to an unpleasant experience overall. On a side note, the valet guys were usually very nice and helpful. I would never stay here again.

Upon check-in, we were given a choice of the $15 wine card or a cheese plate and a bottle of wine for our Diamond amenity. Since we were a party of two, I asked if we could have some extra funds on the wine card, to which the answer was no. In retrospect, I think I should have gotten the cheese plate and bottle of wine, since the wine bar is expensive and $15 is really only good for about 1 glass. Check-in was fine. Parking is expensive at $35/night. We used a Diamond Suite upgrade and at first was put in a \"Large King.\" I refused this room and told the front desk this was not a suite. We were then moved to an Andaz Loft. This isn't really a suite. But since I was only there for 1 night, we took this room. We were proactively warned about the, noise from the club above which was appreciated. Even though the Andaz Loft is definitely not a suite, I liked the room. I liked the decor, layout and the bed was comfortable. I don't know what this hotel was like before the conversion to Andaz, but i think Hyatt did a good job at renovating this property. I checked out the rooftop bar/pool and the gym. Both were nice, but nothing memorable. In the evening, we went to the wine bar. There wasn't a soul there, so we had the bartender to ourselves and got some good service. In addition to trying out the wines, we got some appetizers and the pizza and cheese plate we got were very good. One word of note: make sure to only put money on the card that you are prepared to use. Any leftover money on the wine card cannot be refunded, which I was a bit upset about because I saw no reason why they couldn't provide a refund. In terms of the noise, yes it was loud. On the night we were there, it ended at about 1AM. For one or two nights, it would be ok for me and my sig other, since we are both heavy sleepers, but i definitely would not be able to take that noise every night. The next morning we had breakfast and got the best service that we ever received throughout our stay from our waitress that morning. She was very courteous and gave us carte blanche to order whatever we wanted. We gave her a nice tip. Unfortunately, at checkout, the front desk erroneously charged us for minibar charges which we did not take, and also erroneously charged us for breakfast. For some reason, it took a long time for this to be settled, and I left the hotel a bit annoyed with the staff. In summary, I'd probably come back for another short stay, but I wouldn't be able to take a weekend here because of the noise.

(The night before I stayed at Andaz San Diego, I stayed at Andaz West Hollywood... and the two hotels are totally different. Read my review on Andaz West Hollywood) The bad 1) Worst Check In Experience I've ever encountered. We waited for 10minutes to check in. We checked in at 12pm and the hotel staff told us the room wasn't ready yet because the hotel was sold out the night before and check in technically doesn't start till 4pm. My bf and I decided to wait for a room so we can clean ourselves up before we go to the zoo. We wait till 2pm in the lobby and no front desk staff gave us an update on the rooms or offered us a drink while we waited. So we decided to go to the zoo instead of waiting for the room. At about 4:30 we got a missed call from Andaz and I called them back and it appeared that we did not check in yet, however our rooms were ready. I was confused. 2) THe hotel has a nightclub and on Friday and Saturday evenings, it is full of people ready to go dancing and drinking. We got back from the zoo dressing like tourists and we found that you do not get service if you aren't decked out in a cocktail dress with heels or in a suit. No one opened the door for us and when we walked in, the door man asked \"how can I assist you today\" in a tone like, \u2018wtf are you guys doing here dressing like this\u2019? The next night my boyfriend and I got dressed up to go for dinner at Nobu and we found that we got better service if we dressed up. 3) They do not cash travelers cheques. When we went to cash one of our travelers cheques, the front desk agent was confused on the cheque and he went to ask another agent and the other agent said \"I don't know, I never cashed one before\". So he came back with the answer, \"we don\u2019t cash travelers cheques\". This is the first time that I was unable to cash a travelers cheque at a hotel that I stayed at.... 4) They offer complimentary coffee but why offer it if they don't refill it? We went to grab coffee and there was none in the pot. The front desk agent did not acknowledge us with the front empty coffee pot... but by that time my bf and I were already so disappointed with this hotel we didn't even bother asking them for more coffee. 5) When I went to go check out, the front desk agent (Phil) did not acknowledge me whatsoever. When I told him I was there to check out, he asked for my name and room. I told him my name and my room # and I told him that I would not be leaving my room till half an hour later. All he said was \"Ok, your checked out\". He did not greet me or asked me how my stay was, and instead I saw him on the laptop surfing when I was waiting for him to help me AND after he helped me. Five minutes later I went back to the front desk to ask them for a receipt, (I can't believe Phil didn't even offer me a copy of my receipt) and another check in agent help me. He told me that I was not checked out yet. UNBLIEVEABLE!!!!!! Apparently Phil did not check me out. (I was so upset, I asked the check in agent what his name was, and that how I know his name was Phil.) LOUD LOUD LOUD! We stayed there from Saturday to Monday. Saturday was horrible. When I was heading back to my room at 12:30am I saw a girl, drunk out of her mind, crawling in the middle of the hallway and screaming to someone to open the door room. My boyfriend heard people slamming the walls while he was sleeping. The hotel staff were very snobby, unprofessional and stuck up. They gave us a feeling like - you should tip me for opening the door for you, or you don't belong to this hotel because you are wearing shorts and a t shirt. This hotel is not catered to tourists but to locals who like to get dressed up and go to the Ivy Lounge and get really drunk and make loud noises in the hallways. The Good 1. Location was awesome. Central. Close to 5th Ave where all many restaurants and boutiques were. 2. Clean. Hotel was very clean and trendy. 3. Complimentary mini bar in your room which includes pop, juice and 1 can of small pringles and 1 Hersey Chocolate bar and one health bar. Complimentary wine between 6pm-11pm. Complimentary coffee and baked goods in the morning but they don't refill it quickly. 4. They offer a complimentary ride 2 miles within the hotel. But the services just terrible I didn\u2019t want to sit in a car with the workers. 5.

We had been to the rooftop pool at the Ivy around the same time last year and decided to stay there since we would end up at the rooftop pool anyway no matter where we stayed. Check-in was so quick and oh so very friendly. Natasha or \"Tasha\" checked us in and she was absolutely amazing. Our room wasn't ready when we got there so we left our bags with her as we went up to the pool to get some drinks and some sun. About 30 minutes later, Tasha walked up to the pool and personally handed us our room keys and let us know that she had put our bags in our room. COOL RIGHT!? BTW, for those who haven't been to the Ivy (It is now called the Andaz Hotel btw for those who didn't know), it has one of the best rooftop pools we have ever been to and trust me, we've seen some all over the country. The staff there is all very nice and friendly and might I add very good-looking. The room itself was perfect for a young couple like us. Quiet, romantic (we stayed in the Andaz Large King which had a glass-enclosed tub/shower adjacent to the bed) and some of the snacks and drinks at the minibar were complimentary. The nightclub was small but had a nice Vegas-like vibe going on. Perks for staying at the hotel: the front desk gives you a wristband that allows you to get into the nightclub and rooftop club free without having to wait in line with the other 100+ people! We went back and forth to both and had a blast! I could honestly go on and on about how great this place was but I will end this review by saying one last thing. Instead of calling us a cab to the train station, the hotel drove us there in their Cadillac Escalade, compliments of the hotel. If that won't get us to go back, I don't know what else will!

The party lasts till about 2am so you might be kept up until then--not a problem if you were out partying yourself I guess. Although close to the gaslamp district, the hotel is next to the salvation army, so the number of homeless folks that you see can ruin the atmosphere that the hotel tries to create. parking is $30 a night, but you can find parking at the meters. We parked at a nearby parking lot (on 7th and E) for $5 overnight (until 6am, but the attendant was nice enough to extend it to 7:30am for us. We were told we can park until 12noon for $10). If you park at the meters, make sure to look at the sign on the meter as to when street cleaning will take place (some will say tues/thurs/sat, others mon/wed/friday from 3-6am). If you park at the meters during street cleaning, you can get a ticket.

I scored a cheap room through Hotwire, so I was concerned that I'd be treated like a peon instead of like royalty, but that didn't happen at all. The room was beautiful and luxurious, if a little small. There was a great mini-bar, complete with some complimentary offerings such as soda, juice, chips, chocolate, and a granola bar. The bed was super comfy, except the pillows could have been a little firmer. The shower was relaxing. The free wireless was fast and reliable. There was also an ipod dock in the room. The coffee maker yielded just okay coffee, but it did the trick. The hotel also had a great little exercise room, with a few treadmills, elliptical machines and bikes, plus a couple of weight machines. Each machine had its own television and there were complimentary headphones provided. The machines all seemed very new and in great condition. My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to room service the first night and were floored by how delicious it was. The cheeseburger and mac 'n' cheese, especially, were exceptional. The $30/night for valet service seems pricey, but luckily, I didn't bring my car. Andaz's location makes for a very walkable vacation. I easily got to the zoo, Balboa Park, the Casbah, movie theatres, and tons of restaurants and shops on foot. The hotel was exceptionally quiet. I barely even heard other people staying there.

I accidentally booked the wrong nights and the assistant manager with hotwire on the phone agreed to a reduced rate for 2 nights. The Andaz still received my hotwire payment and we agreed I would pay the difference since it was my mistake. I reiterated with the assistant manager I was traveling on business and needed to stay within a specific rate. Thought everything was OK since 2 colleagues recieved hotwire rates even much lower. Instead I was hassled and basically told I was a liar about the agreed upon rate by the general manager. On my second day I was contacted to leave the hotel 3 times. I explained I booked for 2 nights and confirmed again my rate. Upon leaving the general manager looked at the note about my rate, noticed the exact agreed upon amount I mentioned yet INSISTED there was a mistake. I told him I was responsible for the amount above my already paid hotwire and he said the assistant manager who was not there should not have provided my lower rate. He then proceeded to bill me over $100 ABOVE the rate HE SAW IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. When I approached him about this twice he said the assistant manager was not there and that until he figured out why I received such a low rate he would be forced to charge my credit card. I mentioned again my two colleagues actually stayed through hotwire for a rate even lower and that I was willing to pay more just not the $100 more he was trying to charge me. I also mentioned hotwire was on the phone to confirm and he even has a note in system with the agreed upon rate. He said it is \"complicated\" because the manager should not have had the authority to do this. Essentially after the second time I stated it is an internal problem with the hotel and that he was essentially saying he did not believe the other managers note. His response was that he would not bill my credit card until later that day and confirm with the manager. So when I left I was charged over $100 above what was agreed and he wasted over 30 minutes of my time trying to explain this. I had an afternoon business meeting and left without continuing to argue since it was clear he was going to charge my card anyway. Terrible customer service. In addition the hotel was not that great. The bathroom is weird and the shower points straight at your face so I basically had to duck to wash my hair. The entire hotel is very snooty.

The toiletries in the bathroom were excellent and there were lots of little packets of creams and lotions that smelled really nice. Of course the only drawback was the noise from the club downstairs.

When I plugged in my 4.5 star request and saw that we were booked at the Andaz, I was a bit dismayed. Afterall, the customer rating and the reviews were mixed. I can now say that this was definitely a 4 (or 4.5) star experience and not just because I got a great deal. I would say that even at $200-250 per night it would have been worth it. Why? Great service, location and staff. The little freebies (snacks, sodas, water, internet and the friendly free upgrade we received on our second room). And, the incredible rooftop pool and bar. What doesn't work? The standard rooms are exceptionally small and the winebar is dark and uninviting unless you are on a date.

There is some high and low points to this hotel and I can see it will not be for everyone, but I wanted to share my experience. STAFF: My girlfriend and I pulled up to the valet and were instantly greeted by a friendly attendant. Check in was a breeze: The staff noticed I was a Gold Hyatt Member and offered me a complimentary 2p check out (I didn't end up using it, but was quite happy with the offer). The staff escorted us up to our room and gave us all the instructions on using their complimentary Cadillac Escalade service and setting up a time for us to pick up our VIP passes for the club (included with the room). We ended up taking up the offer on the Cadillac service to and from a restaurant in down town and had great drivers that saved us the hassle of walking or cabbing, well worth giving them a tip! Location: The hotel is right in the heart of Gas Lamp. Tons of great restaurants, pubs and nightlife to get yourself into. We did end up at the roof top club of the hotel. It was a great time, but the drink prices were RIDICULOUS. A mixed cocktail (Crown & Coke) is around 12-15 bucks so most of our drinking happened before the club. However, if you are here to party on a Friday/Saturday night, it is well worth checking it out. Room: I was not a big fan of the room. We were in an Andaz Queen and it was real cramped (see pictures). The bathroom was also real compact and for some reason there was an open hole towel holder on the glass of the shower. This caused the whole bathroom to get full of water whenever we used the shower. I'm not sure about the other rooms, but I would probably consider trying to upgrade to a King if I stayed here again. Surprisingly, I did not here any noise like other reviewers from the night club. I think it all depends on where you are located in the hotel and we were on the 3rd floor.

Fortunately we are locals and could just drive home but it was certainly disappointing/angering. The front desk took care of refunding our stay and parking fee right away and offered us free drinks at the bar (which we declined). So at least it was handled well. But her explanation of \"this hotel offers a night-club feel\" is a sad understatement of the truth: the hotel IS a night-club.

Also points off for a key-card fiasco at check-in that stranded many people trying to check in for hours (we didn't get into our room until 6 PM although we arrived at 3 PM, no offer to comp drinks, etc for that), and the fact that the pool/deck area on the roof which is one of the major perks of the hotel during the day allows SMOKING in all areas -- gross!", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cworst treatment I've ever encountered\u201d", "Author": "dasnake87", "ReviewID": "UR56054801", "Content": "The room, the hotel and the nightclub are very nice, However, if you plan on having people in your room after hours, I suggest you stay at another hotel.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcruciatingly loud hotel\u201d", "Author": "athenaert", "ReviewID": "UR55360647", "Content": "The hotel has three clubs and the techno music permeates the hotel rooms.

Also, we heard people talking, and sirens on the stree outside three floors below. Normally I sleep like a rock, but not at this hotel. 3) The bath tub shown on the web site, was not in my room. No hot bubble for us. 4) The T.V. kept freezing every few minutes when we attempted to watch a movie. 5) No controllable bathroom fan. Hopefully your poop does not stink. 6) No TV guide. 7) The TV Speaker in bathrrom is too loud and can not be truned off. 8) The tiny refrigerator was packed full of drinks for sale. No room for my own stuff. $9 for a bottle of water. 9) No non-valet parking. Make sure you remove all valuables each time you drive your car. 10) Homeless people all around the neighborhood, one-way street maze with potholes.
