{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wondeful Relaxing Experience On our recent trip to Bali, we decided to get away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and stay at Tanjung Benoa. Our place of stay - The Oasis. While not carrying the name of one of the big boy hotels, this hotel sure has classy service, wonderful and helpful staff and minimalist decor.We booked our holiday through a travel agent and everything was flawless from the get go. We were greeted at the airport and shuttled to the hotel. Point to note, Tanjung Benoa is about 40 minutes from the airport so if you arrive around noon or dinner time, I would suggest getting a bite to eat along the way.Once we got to the hotel, we experience a speedy check in. Front Office Manager Jaya was extremely helpful. He led us to our room, proceeded to show us around and then gave us pointers like where to have the best Babi Guling and which restaurant to go to in Jimbaran. Thanks Jaya for all your help!We stayed at the Radhana suite, which is the pool suite. There are only two such suites in the hotel and ours was the one that opened up to an infinity pool which faced the beach and the blue ocean. The suite was great, everything that the brochure said. It was equipped with satellite tv, hi-fi set and dvd player. It was spacious and the bathroom was amazing: a sunken bathtub that could easily fit three people, a separate shower room, and a separate toilet. Loved the lighting of the room but found the many switches to be a little complicated, especially if you wake up for a wee in the middle of the night! Other than that no complaints. Sheets were clean, towels were ample and the room was huge.Right in front of the bed were two bay window doors that opened up onto our own private infinity pool that overlooked the ocean. There's an outdoor shower and steps that lead down to the sun loungers just 15 paces from the sea. If you tire of your own personal pool, then a side door leads you to the 70 meter communal pool. This pool is seriously impressive but not exactly conducive if you're into doing laps. Great for relaxing though.The beach was littered slightly with debris which was a shame because the rest of the place was clean. There are also hawkers on the beach but if you make clear you're not interested they will leave you alone.The poolside cocktails are great as are the prices!When we arrived, we were given vouchers for a 30min massage each and we also got a free nasi goreng each. We later managed to convert one of the massages into an hour facial at no extra charge (thanks Jaya again!).After staying two days at the Oasis, Jaya told us that we would be upgraded to a villa at another hotel called the Kind Villa Bintang Resort. Jaya took the time to go check out the rooms for us ahead of our checking in there, and on the final day when we checked out he was there to see us off with our airport transfer.We really enjoyed our stay at the Oasis because of the hotel itself and also because staff members like Jaya went out of their way to make it a wonderful experience for us.", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR182665190", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "dsativale"}, {"Content": "Facts        The Pillar blocking the air con", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR816351486", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "yenzy"}, {"Content": "Loved the Archi       View from the room", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR532112000", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tournesol08"}, {"Content": "Good value for money The first thing you notice about this hotel is location, location, location!Set on the Benoa peninsula just off Nusa Dua, this idyllic nook of paradise is perfect for both families and honeymooners. Unlike the more exclusive (read posh/ stuckup) neighbouring resorts, The Oasis is more laid back and inviting. The most obvious feature is the long, narrow swimming pool in the middle that stretches almost to the beach (only seperated by a narrow strip of grass). Once the beach starts though, prepare to have your breadth taken away.With Mt. Agung in the far distance, the water stretches as far as the eye can see. As this is an easterly facing locale, do try to wake up early in time to catch the glorious sunrise. Don't expect any 9ft waves here. The beach is pretty shallow and you can walk up to 500m without getting your body wet. But, its still nice for a long walk with the lil ones or hand-in-hand with your lover.The rooms are pretty basic, but well maintained and clean nonetheless. Service could have been better, but for the price, not unexpected.Overall, i'd say that The Oasis is well worth it!", "Date": "Jul 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR655383171", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "NazMus"}, {"Content": "Great place to stay and relax Had a stay for 2 nights 6th - 8th of July 2008. It was a pleasant stay in the hotel.First of all, eventhough i am an indonesian i didnt know much about tanjung benoa unless it is famous for the water sports. However, after i stayed in Benoa and had couple of nights in the oasis i can say Benoa is such a lovely place.Oasis benoa is such an excellent hotel in terms of the design, the pool is excellent. It goes straight from the hotel restourant into the beach garden. The winds from the beach creates lovely tides on the pool and during the night it is more beautiful with the lighning under the pool.The room is excellent, i stayed in a pool access room on the 1st floor. The bed is huge, so it makes me and my partner feels like we are only sleep in one side of the bed.The down side would be the toilet that smells not good, and the tv which located hanging in on top of the wall. I had difficulties to watch it. The reception office is located on the 1st level where you have to climb the stairs and go down again to reach it. The concierge was not friendly as they might also busy organizing the shuttle for the guess to go to kuta regularly as scheduled.In general, the positive deminish the negative side which is minor! I love to stay in Benoa, it will be my alternate stay from the busy Kuta.", "Date": "Jul 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR749915768", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ignatiusAP"}, {"Content": "Loved the hotel and the service, not the beach... We stayed in Oasis Benoa for 4 nights in the end of last November. The hotel is very nice and the location is good..the rooms are clean and the breackfast buffet is rich. The pool is big and relaxing and it is also enjoyable to stay on the beach though the sea is not clean and also the part of the beach which is not controlled by the hotel is pretty dirty. In complex the position is much better than the crowdy and noisy Kuta. There is a shuttle bus to Kuta but we never took it, it's very convenient and cheap to ask the reception to call a taxi which usually arrived within few minutes. I suggest the SPA, it's most expensive than the places outside but we all know that you get what you pay for and in the SPA the service was excellent and we also got a special massage to the shoulders for free! In complex a very good place to stay at a reasonable price! The service is very good, they are all extremely gentle and friendly, we were welcomed with a fresh towel and we couldn't get a late check out but we were allowed to stay in the pool area and eventually we also got a room to take a shower before leaving!

The Spa is on the 5th floor - is ok to go up for massage but after you done your massage you need to go down 5 level - NEED another massage. Design is minimalist in the outside, setting is nice.We stay at the pool level which we like, since we are going with a 3 years old. We stayed for new year - SO SO LOUD - if you have kid don't go to this hotel on New YEAR day (we cannot sleep until 2am)For kids swimming is the ONLY nice thing. But i guess we cannot expected from a 3star hotel. The peopleThe people is just so so some of them is rude - But maybe for international tourist you guys will be treated differently. IF YOU ARE ASIA PACIFIC PEOPLE (YELLOW DARK SKIN) BEWARE THEY ARE NASTY and LESS POLITE. The roomBEWARE do not ever stay on room 2108 - 2107. If you are sensitive on sound when you are sleeping. They have a humming noise and banging noise ALL DAY long (their water pump - that they cannot do anything about)The room is clean, TV is hanging (is totally a downer). No lotion is the room you must requested.... during our stay no refill on the SHAMPOO..... ONLY 2 towel we request for 1more (for our kid) is very difficult their response is TOWEL is VERY LIMITED - HAHHAHA this is my first time to here that kind of answer on a hotel. Same as pillowsBath room is a shower with curtain. The breakfastIs NOT NICE - compare to other hotels that we stayed in BALI. NO egg to order only boiled egg and egg of the day. We stayed on DEC so a lot of flies... and the buffet is not covered... so you can feast with the flies. 6 type of hot dishes to choose.....THEY GIVE YOU WARNING IF YOU ASK FOR HOT WATER NOT during breakfast, they will charge you - they telling me with no reason.The pool  TowelPOOL is narrow and long - water treatment so poor.... you cannot open your eyes inside the water - so hurt - I don;t know that they put on the water... My kid likes it since they only swim above the water :-)Since our room on the pool level is kind of the nicest thing.TOWEL ALSO so limited and if you only leaved it on the pool area and not return to the booth they will CHARGE you.... what a JOKEThe view  BeachSmall beach area but is really nice very close to the water sport that you like... Parasail, jet sky, turtle island, banana boat, etc.FOR INDONESIAN TOURIST BEWARE - YOU ARE A SECOND CLASS CITIZENT IN THIS HOTEL .", "Date": "Jan 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR256495133", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "yogaf"}, {"Content": "Loved the Oasis We stayed in Oasis Tanjung Benoa for 4 days.

It is ---.It is a lovely designed hotel. The staff are VERY friendly. We stayed in the Deluxe room for the first half of our visit and then switched to the Ocean Suite. I would recommend the Ocean suite to those who are addicted to natural light like I am. I thought the deluxe could have done with more of it. The deluxe has a TV hanging from the ceiling which I think is a downer. Both were decorated in a minimalist modern style which is attractive. The pool is VERY long and looks magnificent and matches very well with the architecture. At night it is quite a sight. While we were there (Aug 4-9) the pool water was freeeeeezing! There were many braver souls than myself who braved the temperature though. Also, they had ridiculously long pool hours (8pm-7am?)for sanitizing the pool water, at which time the pool was off limits for swimming. But then given the fact I found the water too cold maybe I should not complain about that. The beach is okay and like many beaches of southeast asia is plagued with lots of hawkers. The people of Bali are much poorer than I had anticipated. The Oasis Benoa could do a better job of combing the beach sand. The food is okay as well. We only ate away at the nearby Conrad Hotel once. The food there was 'okay' too. Nothing to write home about.The Spa is on the top. Again, the decor and layout is very attractive. My husband liked 1 of 2 of the massages he got there. I thought my body scrub was so-so. I think they could do with more training on maintaing the customers modesty and comfort (temp etc.)The negative points of the hotel were subtracted away by the very nice staff people we met. In all, I really believe this hotel can be very much more if they would tweak their rough edges.", "Date": "Aug 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR712747631", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Palesa"}, {"Content": "Un last minute fortunato   showReview(20477019, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR872120495", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Peirot"}, {"Content": "Ci torneremo       L'interminabile piscina", "Date": "Sep 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR397408641", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Liujo_72"}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bon hotel   showReview(19889478, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR893989911", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "melolatina"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u5a45\u535c\u9287\u52eb\u7df1   showReview(19172369, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR680162515", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bon h\u4e48tel       Vue de la chambre", "Date": "Jun 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR232837751", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MinetteParis"}, {"Content": "hotel tres sympa       plage hotel oasis benoa", "Date": "Mar 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR290424460", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "coco33Bordeaux"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u5a43\u76b8\u9287\ue0a2\u53c6\u9288\u5a3f\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(19169363, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR515927423", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "quando ci vuole ci vuole   showReview(13788024, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR248035289", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "b-feed"}, {"Content": "Lo amiamo!   showReview(8497207, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR666898580", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Teotato"}, {"Content": "\u9352\u6fc7\u68e9\u9287\ue0a0\u4eb0\u9287\u6b0d\u4eda\u9288?#x201d;   showReview(19161387, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR172886855", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9352\u6fc7\u68e9\u9287\ue1bc\ue196\u9287\u3123\u4ed0\u9287\ufe3a\u4f05\u9288\u581b\u4e9c\u9287\ue1ba\u4ef9\u9287\ue224\u7d35   showReview(19160338, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR559913751", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9288\u3083\u5136\u9289\u51a6\u5061\u9289\u30e3\u4efe\u6fb6\u682c\u03a4\u9287\ue1ba\u5136\u9288\u4ff1\u5157\u9289\u581b\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(19160036, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR583155826", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "S\u8305jour agr\u8305able   showReview(5490439, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR630660859", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Aurelia75"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191333-d609384-r22567692-Oasis_Boutique_Beach_Resort_And_Spa-Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "609384", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
