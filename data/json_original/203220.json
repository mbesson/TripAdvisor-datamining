Yes there are stairs up to the reception but hardly an issue, although no access i could see for disabled visitors which yes this could be a problem so worth contacting hotel.

I requested a room facing the opera house and they had a note of it and we were given room 211 which was spacious enough and a good view. Room and hotel were spotless, maid service each day with clean towels and sheet. Asked for extra pillows which were in our room following our day out. Breakfast basic continental, not alot of room in the breakfast area which was fine for us as it wasnt busy but can imagine it would be cramped in summer. No kettle in room but dont know if this is the norm in Rome. Location fine for Termini - 5 min walk. 10-15 to Quirinale/Trevi area. We walked everywhere and if we were tired coming back we got the metro and got off at Repulicca or Termini. Cafe Strega down the street beer reasonable price 7euro for large and small beer - cheap for Rome!

From Fiumicino airport there is a dedicated train service (30 minute journey) to Rome's central Termini station, the hotel is between 5 to 10 minutes' walk from there. Incidentally the two Metro lines intersect outside Termini station too, so anywhere in Rome is so easy and cheap to get to (one euro for a single ticket!). The hotel itself is spread over three floors (not on the ground floor though). From the street, the first floor Reception is accessed via a short, wide flight of stairs, and the further floors are reached by a lift. This really isn't a problem - anyone struggling to manage a single flight of stairs should think twice about visiting Rome - think seven hills! The hotel is literally next door to the Opera House, making it ideal if your sense of direction is a bit below par and you need to ask for directions back. Our room overlooked the Opera House which is probably the best side to be on. The room was small, as was the bathroom, but perfectly adequate. Yes there are a lot of hotels in central Rome and probably much larger rooms to be had, but certainly not at this price point! It was tidy, well-decorated and furnished and very clean, likewise the bathroom. The bed was comfortable and we slept well every night. Maid service was daily, as were clean towels. We had a decent wall-mounted TV with some English channels and the room had a safe, for which there was a small charge - ten euros for four nights, no complaints there. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful, suggesting restaurants etc. on our way out. Breakfast staff and the breakfast itself were fine too. Rome itself is a fabulous city - so many things to see. Highlights for us were the Colosseum and Roman Forum (amazing they managed to build such structures 2000 years ago), the Pantheon, still in fantastic condition and St. Peter's Basilica. Although we're not religious, the place is awesome in the literal sense of the word. The 320-step climb to the top is not to be missed. Many more amazing sights too numerous to mention. Only bad experience was having a fair amount of money stolen on the Metro, despite being forewarned and taking precautions, but this could happen in any big city. Hats off to the thief or thieves, don't know how they managed it, and so quickly too. But I suppose they do it for a living so should be expert at it! Beware of crowded places and being hemmed in! Weather was excellent, although November is supposed to be the wettest month we didn't see a drop, and it was jackets off in the afternoons. Overall an excellent break and should we visit Rome again we will be going back to the Lirico.

Some reviewers have complained about the steps up to reception which I cannot understand unless you\u2019re infirm, wheelchair bound or as with a lot of overweight Americans & Brits averse to any type of exercise no matter how minor, but if that is the case why book this hotel. The rooms are clean but on the small size but this is a city hotel & time spent in the room is minimal. Breakfast was of a good standard with plenty of yoghurt & fresh fruit plus the usual continental breakfast fare. All of the staff we encountered including the staff at breakfast were very friendly & helpful, reception staff only advised us about bars & restaurants if we enquired, & didn't give the impression as suggested in another review that they did so because of some kind of kick back (but if the restaurant was good would that matter?). The hotel is within easy walking distance of all the major tourist sites & because the weather was so beautiful we didn't use public transport preferring to walk everywhere. Restaurants close to the major tourist attractions tend to be more expensive & not as good as the ones located near the hotel, we used one across the main road from the Irish bar & up a side road which had very palatable house wine at 8 euros a bottle, great pizzas & pasta & on our last visit they threw in free brochette & coffee & the bill which included 2 bottles of wine & an 'extravagant' sea food pasta for me still came in at less than 40 euros! If whilst out during the day you want to picnic, the Spar situated on the main road leading down into the centre of Rome has a good deli & 1Ltr cartons of quaffable wine for just over a one & a half euros.

The Lirico serves a continental breakfast which had a good range of items; juice, hot drinks, cereals, yoghurt, rolls, cold meats. soft cheese, croissants, preserves, fruit and pastries (the ham is particularly tasty).The breakfast room brings me to the second of the two negatives - the tables are just close together for people to get in and out of without causing disruption to other guests if the breakfast room is full..

The room was small, but average on Italy standards, but more importantly, was very clean and you can tell the place is well taken care of. The shower stall was very tiny, if you are a big person, it will be very tough. Ladies, there is zero room to reach down to shave your legs. The bed was firm but comfortable and on a solid frame \u2013 important if your partner is a tosser, like mine. The TVs have no English channels other than the BBC. I get that you\u2019re not in Italy to watch TV, but we would have liked CNN or something to keep up with things at home, and when relaxing in our rooms, it would have been nice to have a channel to watch/listen to. The rooms are quite sound proof; we couldn\u2019t hear people in the halls, in other rooms or anything outside. We slept no problem, which is crucial after long days of walking around Rome. The breakfast room is fairly small but their selection is quite good including hard-boiled eggs, yoghurt, cheese, ham, fruit, croissants, cereal and coffee/cappuccino/tea. The staff at the front desk are very helpful, speak English well and someone was always available to answer any questions and always seemed happy to do so. The rooms do not have alarm clocks \u2013 actually, none of the rooms we had across Italy and Greece had alarm clocks. All places did wake up calls though. The only time this was an issue was trying to read my watch in the dark room first thing in the mornings. No biggie. The elevator was small, but that seems to be standard in Europe. The hotel is about a 10-minute walk from Roma Termini. Pulling luggage across the cobblestone was a challenge. I printed off a Google map with directions so once we left the train station, I knew exactly where we were going. We took the Leonardo Express from Fumicino Airport. As other reviews say, the reception is up a flight of stairs \u2013 about 20 steps \u2013 so you must lift your luggage. Overall, we were both very pleased with this hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oldenburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel in a central position with an excellent cost-benefit ratio.

We thought that the position in the near of the railway station is a little bit critical, but the opposite is the case: a comparable quiet and secure street without any annoying things. We slept in a totally new and comfortable double bed (good for your back!), the room was very clean and the size of the room was totally ok. We know that there are smaller rooms, but we had luck. The staff was very friendly and helpful to find the good locations, ask Toni! You can see at the pictures that the hotel is in front of the Teatro dell' Opera, where you can buy tickets very easy. The rooms are very quiet and is it possible to sleep with open window. We were astonished because of the continental breakfast: boiled eggs, good cheese and raw / cooked ham, a lot of sweet things, and a good cappucino. Poeple from Austria, Switzerland and Germany will like it. For a restaurant go to strega, 50 m distance. The pizza and pasta is very good, the secondo is not the best. So, what are the bad things?

I thought I'd made up my mind with the Bettoja, but at the last minute changed my mind to Hotel Lirico since I emailed them asking them to confirm wifi access and if they would be able to arrange a car for us as we had an early morning flight - both were confirmed. I am so bummed to be typing this, but I was just not pleased with this hotel. It may have something to do with me loving our hotel in Florence and setting an impossible standard for this hotel, BUT I don't think that's completely it. Yes, the location is great, the front desk staff is more than helpful, and almost everything was adequate, BUT the bathroom was just not up to par when it comes to cleanliness. I am by no means a high maintenance traveler, but I do expect a hotel to be somewhat clean! This hotel did not make that cut. In addition, travelers should be aware that you do have to hike up stairs just to get to the front desk, then climb a few more stairs to get to the lift. Not the end of the world for us since we're still spring chickens, but even my BF complained about having to carry suitcases up several flights of stairs just to get to a lift. I WAS aware of this ahead of time and thought it no big deal, but found it a bit annoying when I actually had to climb the stairs when we arrived and every day for the remainder of our stay. On top of that, I was more than miffed to learn that wifi is only available in the lobby - what's the point!?!?! We planned to use our iPhones to map out stops/trips for the day; find places to eat; search shops to visit; etc, but found it silly that we could not do so from our room. Also, irritated me even more when wifi access was the deciding factor in me choosing Lirico. The other hotels required that you pay for internet access. I do feel bad about not liking the hotel because the people were very nice and the car service they arranged actually arrived....and he arrived EARLY, but I just feel like the hotel needs a good cleaning and maybe should up the quality of their breakfast.

The hotel is within 2 blocks of the Termini station and 1-2 blocks from the metro station. It is within reasonable walking distance to the Trevi fountain as well, but it's faster to take the metro a few stops closer. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and spoke excellent English which I did not expect and came prepared with my little Italian knowledge. The rooms are huge for European standards. Our hotel room (311) overlooked the L'Opera and had such a pretty view. The room had a couch, table w. 2 chairs, queen size bed, 2 nightstands, etc.; you can see how big this is for Europe. The bed is not the most comfortable and quite hard, which I like, but be warned. The room is spotless along with the rest of the hotel. The price was amazing for the location and the quality of room. Breakfast was included in our price and was great; it's not a large English breakfast, but had a good choice of pastries, cereal, etc. more of an American Continental breakfast. I really can't find any flaws with this hotel other than the ugly decor, but really who cares about ugly wallpaper with such a great location at an affordable price. I highly recommend this hotel when in Rome. Also be sure to take the concierge recommendation and get your free welcome drink at Cafe Strega; the pizza is to die for and the wine by the glass is a huge goblet full portion and is only 4 euro; it was so good we ate there twice.

The staff were friendly, helpful and spoke excellent English. The room was spacious and ensuite with a comfortable bed, sofa and air conditioning. I would recommend bringing ear plugs with you though- there was no noise from outside, but the interior walls were thin, which wasn't ideal when the man in the next room started playing opera music at 11pm. However, we found that all the hotels we stayed at in Italy had similar noise levels so I wouldn't let it put you off (as long as you have earplugs- we slept fine with them). The breakfast we had was the best we had in a hotel during our trip- cereal, rolls, toast, jams, ham, cheese, croissants, fruit, cake, pastries, biscuits and even (hot!) boiled eggs.

Very easy and any questions I had via email were answered within 24 hours. We also required a restaurant for Xmas Lunch and Tony at the Lirico recommended a fabulous place. Via the reviews we knew there were steps leading up to reception. It was never a problem although at the end of a huge day of sightseeing those steps seemed insurmountable. Checkin was easy and all paperwork for the 5 rooms was ready although we were too early for our rooms so all our luggage was left in the one room that was ready and off to the Hop On Hop Off Bus with a stop back at the Termini which was approx. 10 minute walk. When we called back at 12.30pm our rooms were ready. Across the 5 rooms there was quite a diverse range of sizes although everybody seemed to fit in and the rooms were spotlessly clean. Our own room was a triple which included not only an Opera View but a couch and plenty of space which proved a real bonus as the family seemed to be in our room all the time. Breakfast was your normal continental, croissants, pastries, cold meat, bread rolls, cereal, yoghurt and juices. Coffee was made to order and the young guy working in the breakfast room had us amazed with his ability to remember everyone's order and deliver it to the table to the correct person. Believe me our orders were difficult even for us so full marks to him. We found the hotel in a perfect position for walking everywhere in Rome with many little cafes and restaurants in very close proximity including an Irish Pub which our family thoroughly enjoyed. Staff were all very friendly and very helpful especially Tony although all staff we met were fabulous with a great command of the English language which was great for us as none of us spoke Italian. If I had any complaints at all it would have to be our room when we returned. Although we had a larger room on our first visit this room was small with the smallest shower cubicle I have ever seen. I am not small but not large either yet it was difficult for my husband or I to get into shower. I could not shut the door as it was just too confining. I know this one in particular was small as with all the rooms I saw there was no other shower this small. Just check when given your key if you are liable to have issues with the shower. The other small thing is the lift but providing you do not exceed the weight limit as per posted instructions you will have no issues with it. Quite functional.

I have now had to cancel my booking.....here is why. I gave them my card details on their 'secure site' (and I use that term loosely) as they require the card for authorisation...as a sort of guarantee that you will arrive on the booked date. They promise not to charge your card, and that the bill will be settled upon arrival/ departure from the hotel. However, not less than 20 minutes after filling in the booking form with my card details, I noticed some money had been taken out of my account that I had no recollection of spending. I phoned my bank and they said it had been spent in Euros in a clothing store, probably over the phone or via the internet as no pin number had been used. I immediately cancelled my card and contacted the hotel. The bank said they would send me a replacement card and I was unsure if my booking was safe as the card number I had used to book it was obviously now invalid. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and told me that my booking was safe. At this point I was unsure how my card details had been accessed, and did not know it might be via their site. So they told me they would need my new card number as soon as it arrived, and even gave me a new link to a 'secure form' because I was obviously worried about giving out my card details again. It had all the security features from the other site i.e. the 'varified by visa' sign, 'mastercard secure' etc. And they assured me this was safe. When I got my new card I sent them the new details via this 'secure form'. No less than 30 minutes later another amount of money had gone from my account. I knew it couldn't be a coincidence so after I had cancelled my card (for the second time in 4 days) I phoned Hotel Lirico. They said they had taken an amount out as authorisation on both cards, but it would not be sent to them, just simply 'kept to one side' as reassurance of my arrival. They said the money would go back in once I arrived at the hotel. When I questioned the staff member about the previous amount being different and that it was spent in a clothes store, he got rather irate with me. All in all he was quite rude considering I had just had nearly \u00a3200 taken out of my bank account and I was clearly upset. He couldn't give me any answers and it all seemed a bit dodgy to me. Of course I immediately cancelled my booking with them all together and I'm currently waiting for my new card (the third one in 5 days). I should get my money back soon hopefully. Obviously there is no way to be 100% sure or prove that my card details were stolen through this site. However, it seemed to be too much of a coincidence that as soon as they had my card details, money went missing.....and it happened twice with two separate cards! I had my new card for no less than an hour before the second amount went missing, so I know no one else could have the card number. This does not mean that the Hotel is responsible for the fraud, but the site may not be secure. Someone may have hacked the site knowing full well people would be giving out their card details. I'm sure the hotel would have been lovely, had I actually got to stay there. This is simply a warning to everyone intending to use the official site to book a room. Don't use your card, book through a travel agents and pay by cash if you can. At least then you are covered as the travel agency holds the responsibility for the booking and your money. If you do decide to use your card, keep a close eye on your bank account and follow up any money going out that you cannot account for. Luckily I check my balance every day via a secure web connection so I noticed it. If I hadn't they could have cleared me out completely! Also, make sure you have virus and spyware protection if you do online banking, or if you use your card online at all. Also, if this has happened to anyone else using the offical Hotel Lirico site please reply. I want to know if this has happened on this site before. I think people need to be warned.

Expecting the phone to ring for the wake up call there was just a slight buzz. We over slept, but it didn't ruin our day. So if you are on a time schedule just bring a travel clock with you, just in case. Breakfast was great compared to our other hotels. Fresh gourmet coffee, cereal, filled pastries, bread, breakfast meats, yogurt and fruit. Hotel is located very close to main train termini and another metro stop. Walk to both metros/train station was under 10 minutes. Most of the major sites are 2 metro stops away, which was perfect for us.

The hotel reception refit had just finished and it looks very smart. However, the dining room is smaller than before, if that were possible! Travelled this time with our teenagers and baby. Disapointed to find not a single highchair on the premises which mean breakfast was a complete chore. The rooms were as spotless as before - nothing to complain about there except the hardness of the bed. The air-conditioning was a must and worked well. The main gripe we had was with the advice regarding where to eat and the trips to take. The resturant they warmly recommended we visited on our last night (having been in Italy for almost two weeks and having eaten well everywhere including Rome). It was the worst meal we've probably ever had in a resturant. Not only that they overcharged us for everything, side orders we hadn't ordered, and extortionate prices but it just left a very unpleasant taste in our mouths in more ways than one! The trip they recommended was similarly the worst bus tour to have taken. They didn't follow their published map route which meant we spend hours waiting at bus stops only to find - having rung their offices - that the route had changed and they hadn't bothered telling us! (this isn't the normal Sunday change to routes which you expect with roads closed).

Once we figured out where the street signs are - it was actually really easy to find from the train station. When we got to the hotel, it was basically just as the pictures show. Check in was quick and easy - we were given room 304 I believe which overlooked Via Napoli. The room was small. Whoever took the pictures on the websites must have used a wide-angle lens! I was expecting a small room, but it was REALLY small - cruise ship small. There was a king sized bed (two twins pushed together), 2 small end tables, and a small table and 2 charis across from the bed. We ended up having to stack the chairs on top of each other so we would have room for our suitcase. Since we were only there for 2 days, we packed together in one small suitcase, and it was still a little cramped. My boyfriend removed the bed spread as soon as we entered the room - he does this pretty much everywhere we go, and he said there were some blonde hairs on it - which there were - but having friends who work in the hotel business, I know that bed spreads are NOT washed after every use - only sheets & blankets. So we really did not have a problem. Other than that, the room was very clean. The bathroom was pretty much spotless - TINY, but very clean. The only real problem we had - which I didn't even bother to report was with the air conditioning. You have to put your room key in the wall to get it to work, and it never got cool. I was actually sweating when we arrived at 2:30pm. I turned it on that night when we got back to the hotel, and we left it running all night and it was NOT cool. The second night we left the window open and that worked really well. The street the hotel was on was quiet at night, and it was nice a cool in the evenings. The bed was not exactly comfortable, but I've slept on worse. It was big - which was nice. One side was very hard - which I don't really have a problem with - and the other side was more uncomfortable b/c you could feel the springs. But after our long days of walking around the city, we had no trouble falling asleep. Breakfast was a lot better than I had expected based on other reviews. They had rolls, croissants, donuts, spreads - nutella, butter, cheese, cold cuts, fruit, coffee, cereal, juice, etc. And the people at the front desk were VERY nice and helpful. They helped us figure out the best way to go to some of the sights, and when my boyfriend had a blister, they pulled out the first aid kit to help me find a bandage. Check out was easy and quick. We walked everywhere - didn't use any public transportation or tours. Everything is about 15 minutes walk. We even walked to the Vatican and back. The map they give you at the hotel is better than the map we brought from our tour book and we relyed on that pretty much the entire time. I felt like the area around the hotel was decent. It's like 3 minutes walk from a big shopping area and not far from the Colloseum. There was a homeless man sleeping in the alley alongside our hotel street, but I saw them all throughout the city and didn't feel unsafe. The only time I felt slightly unsafe was when we were trying to find this restaurant at night that my tour book recommended. After about 45 minutes of searching in the dark alleys near the Colluseum, I decided the place did not exist and we gave up. That was the only time I felt like we were in a slightly seedy area - and we left and went back to the Trevi Fountain area after that to search for restaurants. Overall we had a good experience at the hotel. I would recommend it to anybody who is doing like we did - spending a very short time in Rome, who wants to be within walking distance to the train station and major sites without relying on public transportation, and wants a clean, safe hotel to sleep in.", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montijo, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cCosy and pleasant hotel\u201d", "Author": "MauraCarvalho", "ReviewID": "UR15613593", "Content": "We really loved our 2 night stay at this hotel.

We found it difficult to choose a hotel as there are so many, but were very pleased we chose this one. We flew with Ryanair into Ciampino Airport and got the Terravision coach to Termini Station (14 euros each return). You can buy tickets on the internet or at the airport (Prestwick or Ciampino). The journey takes around 40 minutes and they are every half an hour. The bus drops you off at a side entrance to the station, so beware of this when trying to orientate yourself and find your hotel (you can ask for a map of the city centre when you buy your bus tickets). To get to the Hotel Lirico from Termini Station you would be best going into the station through the entrance where the bus drops you off (at this entrance there are two restaurants, one on either side, think one is a burger/steak place). Walk straight through the station to the exit on the opposite side. Once you leave the station, cross the road and turn right, walk along the street (parallel to the station - Via Giovanni Giolitti). Keep going along this street for three blocks, Hotel Lirico is on the street Via Viminale. There is a large Museum on the corner - National Rome Museum. Pass this and turn down to the left. Keep going down this street, the hotel is on the right handside, just past the Opera Theatre. The first few days of our trip the weather was pretty bad, so even although most of the famous sites are within walking distance, we used the Metro to get around. Both the Repubblica and Termini stations are closest to the hotel. Its 1 euro each for a single trip ticket and 4 euros each for the full day. If you are going to go to the Vatican Museums we would recommend you have an early start that morming to avoid the queues. When we were there it was closed on the Sunday, so went back on the Monday, only to find queues with a 2 hour waiting time. We got up early on Tuesday morning and arrived just before 8am, there was only a very short queue, it opened at 8.30am and we were straight in. We also enjoyed the Castle Sant'Angelo (5 euros each for entry). Its very interesting to look around and you can get really good views (and photographs) of the city from the top of the castle. Beware of people asking you to sign a petition against drugs outside the castle - once you sign they expect a donation - we were conned into it! There are independent guides at all the main attractions but the only place we took a guided tour of was the Colosseum. It was 21 euros each for the tour, which included your entrance fee of 11euros. It is worth noting that if you are under 16 or over 65 some of the attractions have free entry - as long as you have documents with you to prove your age. There are lots of restaurants to choose from - one we especially liked was called Pizzeria Est Est Est on Via Genova. Only a few streets form the hotel. Lovely brushetta, great pizzas and nice wine. The hotel itself was exceptionally clean, our room was cleaned and fresh, fluffy white towels replaced each day. Our room was of adequate size, the bathroom was quite small, but again spotlessly clean. The breakfast was fine, but nothing to shout about. The two same cereals to choose from, fruit juice, bread rolls, jams, cheese, italian hams and pastries. We had cappucinos each morning, which were delicious!

The staff was friendly, cheerful and helpful, especially Tony who suggested a wonderful restaurant for my birthday, made the reservations and followed up on our experience ! 3. Breakfast was beyond our expectation - cheese and cold cuts, cereal, croissant (3 kinds), jams, honey, Nuttela, a veriety of coffee and hot drinks to choose from, soft drinks and most of all - fresh fruit (which is not common in rome as we heard). All buffet and plenty. 4. The room was spacious and the bed was a Queen size bed. the matress a bit too hard for me but seemed to be new.

As everyone says, the location is great \u2013 five minutes\u2019 walk from Termini Station, which gives great access to trains, both metro lines, and numerous useful shops. We had a \u201csuperior\u201d room; being off-season, the price was the same as for a regular room. The room was a reasonable size, with twin beds, plus a couch/day-bed, table with two chairs, full-sized full bath, and a little foyer. There was plenty of space for the two of us. I felt that we got very good value for our 85 euros/night. Breakfast was typically European, with fresh hard rolls, salami, ham, cheeses, pastries, juices, fresh fruits, and coffee. You can order a pot of American coffee, or get espresso, latte, cappuccino, etc. - so why settle for a pot of American coffee? The breakfast room doesn\u2019t open until 7:30, but we found that, if we had an early train to catch, the breakfast staff were quite accommodating about letting us pick up some food to take with us. (If you do this, remember to bring something to carry it in.) In response to complaints in earlier reviews about the orange juice: the orange-colored drink is NOT the orange juice. Try the red stuff; it\u2019s blood-orange juice, and it\u2019s quite tasty. The room was quite clean, unless you happened to look under the bed. (Something rolled under there, or I wouldn\u2019t have.) There was enough dirt under there to count as arable land. The beds are, indeed, hard. In fact, if you are looking for a softer sleep surface, try the tile floor. I am the world\u2019s worst sleeper, so, having read several complaints about the hard beds, I brought along a memory-foam mattress topper, and it worked great. I had read complaints about the blankets being filthy, but they seemed pretty clean to me, so they were new, or recently cleaned\u2026or I just have low standards. The sound-soak stuff on the walls was loud, in appearance, but did its job pretty well. I still used earplugs at night, to block out the rest of the ambient noise, but the room was generally pretty quiet. But the place wasn\u2019t perfect. The hotel\u2019s phone system sucked big-time. My husband and daughter were holding down the fort in Colorado, and we planned on talking each day on the phone. I would text-message my husband, and he would call us via the hotel number, so that we could take advantage of the much-lower calling rates for calls originating in the US. Trouble was, the connection would fade in and out with frustrating regularity, and sometimes the call would drop entirely. I re-seated the connections, but no luck. We asked for a different phone, but the desk said they didn\u2019t have any more\u2026and that they thought it was the line anyway. Well, they wouldn\u2019t have said that if they hadn\u2019t had complaints about it before, so I was a bit put out that, knowing the phone lines sucked, they hadn\u2019t addressed the problem. (We ultimately worked around it by buying an Italian SIM card for my cell phone; I\u2019d text-message my husband, and he would call my cell phone. In Italy, they don\u2019t charge the call recipient at all, so it only cost me for the text message. Fortunately, I had already verified that my phone was quad-band, and got the unlocking instructions from our cell carrier, AT&T, before leaving on the trip.) The desk staff is still pretty pushy about the restaurant called Barrocco. Tony, in particular, was reluctant to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer, on that one. They must be getting one heck of a kick-back. Also, despite earlier reviewers saying that hot water was always available, we did not find that to be the case. In fact, on four occasions during our 8-day stay, we turned on the shower only to find that there was no hot water at all. The front desk said to let it run, but we let it run for 8-10 minutes, with no result. This would not have been so bad, except that my son developed a case of croup, and from past experience, a steamy shower was what he needed \u2013 but two of the times we needed to get some steam into him, there was none to be had. Other items of note\u2026 the hotel did not supply a box of tissues, which is fine, provided you are not expecting them to. I would have brought a box from home, if I\u2019d known. Also, we found that the Gran Caffe Portioli, which is on the way home from Termini Station, on Via de Viminale (i.e., the same street that the hotel fronts onto), was a reasonable place to pick up dinner on the way home from day-trips. They do a pizza Margherita for 6 euros; it\u2019s the size of a medium pizza in the US, and their Margherita is just a cheese pizza. They also offer a range of sandwiches, and a small selection of gelati. If we had it to do all over again, we would happily stay at the Lirico. No place is perfect, but all in all, the Lirico offered excellent value for the money.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cCharming a pleasant\u201d", "Author": "JamesPrstr", "ReviewID": "UR11264307", "Content": "Pleasant, very clean and beautifully decorated.

(Apologies for the late review!) The best thing about this hotel would have to be the location. It is just around the corner from Piazza della Repubblica metro station which is so convenient for travelling around the city. About 15 min walk to the Colosseum/Forums. It is also situated on a very quiet street so not too much mad Italian traffic going by which was great! We also had a view of the dome of Santa Maria Maggiore out of our window which was v.nice. Handy supermarket across the road too. The room was quite small but this is the norm for Roman/most European city hotels and lets face it, who goes to Rome to sit in their hotel room?! It was spotlessly clean which is always the main factor for me and the bathroom was v.modern, tiny but modern! Very eh, lurid Louis XVI/flowery style soundproof type padding on the walls which wasn't very pretty but it did the job,never heard a sound! Adequate storage space,tv (lots of Serie A football on much to my boyfriend's delight and welcome distraction while I was getting ready to go out!) ,little table and chairs, sewing kit and lots of helpful literature on things to do in the city,restaurants etc. which was very good. We never had the breakfast so I can't comment on that aspect. Most of the staff however left a lot to be desired which is why I'm not giving it a higher rating. The man when we were checking in never welcomed us to the hotel and barely even looked at our faces, not very pleasant. This continued throughout our 6 night stay and by the end we had taken to giving him an extremely sarcastically bright \"BUON GIORNO!\" everytime we passed; didn't amuse him much but we got a laugh out of it! This was the mood amongst almost all of the workers. The only pleasant member of staff we encountered was the night manager who was very jolly and always full of suggestions of where to go for dinner. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody travelling to Rome. I've been to the city 5 times and this was the best hotel I've stayed in for location, comfort and value. It was also a very safe area and near Termini but not too close if you get my drift...! We were out late quite a few nights and never felt any unease. Check out the nearby Via dei Serpenti for loads of wonderful non-touristy restaurants always full of Italians, which is obviously a great sign.

At first glance, the street it is on does not look like much but you will soon realize that this is the way most of Rome is! Like others, have said, there is a long flight of stairs to get up to the hotel. The people are friendly and to get to your room you have to take a very small elevator that the 2 of us just managed to squeeze into with a suitcase each. Our room was smaller than most rooms I have been in but then again, all you really need the room for is somewhere to sleep at night and to wash. The room was very clean and the floor is tiled, rather than carpeting! The bathroom was also clean, with the usual soap, shampoo, shower caps and plastic cups provided. There was also a shower and a bathtub, though this was half the size of a normal one, so I don't think it would be very comfortable! Breakfast is served from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. The room is small in size with about 9 or 10 tables, however, we never had any problem getting a place to sit, especially if we went early. Breakfast consists of 2 different types of cereeal; one is chocolate puffs a little similar to Kellogg's Coco Pops and the other were like rice krispies but were flakes. (I don't know if these change from time to time but they had the same ones for the week we were there). They also have some croissants and danishes and some hard round bread rolls. There was a selection of different toppings such as nuttella chocolate, cheeses and jams to go on top. You are also offered tea or coffee. The hotel is in a great location and you can walk to every major attraction without any difficulty. The main termini train station is literally 5 minutes around the corner. We got to the colosseum in about 20 minutes, and that was walking slowly to take in the other sites and stopping for photographs. The furthest place to walk to would be Vatican City, but even that is not too bad. The Metro is a good way to get to places a little quicker. If you are looking for machines to buy tickets for it in the train station, follow the signs for the metro and the machines are right before you go through the turnstiles. There is a supermarket in the basement of the building next door. You will get basic things here but it is small. There is a Spar shop on Via Nazionale, which is the next street over and this has more in it and is also open until later at night. There is another supermarket in termini as well so you really will not be stuck if you need any essentials or some food. The best way to get to this hotel from Leonardo Da Vinci Airport is the Leonardo Express. It leaves the airport every half hour at 37 minutes past the hour and 07 minutes past the hour. It costs 11 euro for a one way ticket. The journey takes about half an hour and then it is only a five minute walk to the hotel, which is not bad when you are dragging your suitcase behind you. When we were leaving the hotel, we were thinking about getting the hotel to organise a transfer for us, but that turned out to be 45 euro. So we decided to walk back to termini and get the Leonardo Express again. It leaves termini at 22 minutes past the hour and 52 minutes past the hour. We found it hard to know where to buy tickets for this in the station but if you head towards the train itself, there is a man in a booth who will write you out a ticket for a euro or two extra. This still beats paying 45 euro in the hotel! Overall, we had a very pleasant stay in our hotel. The street is quiet so there are no loud noises at night. There are many restaurants in and around it so you should have no trouble finding something to eat..

You are within walking distance of all of the sights and that is all we really wanted from the Hotel, that and cleanliness. In relation to both points, this Hotel gets a hug thumbs up. The bedroom was small but spotless, as was the Bathroom. It comes equipped with a hairdryer but I would bring my own if I were you otherwise you will spend the whole time in the Hotel trying to dry your hair.... It takes forever. Like I said the room was small and very basic but it did the job for our own purpose because we didnt spend a lot of time there. It is a small bit disheartening as there are a lot of stunning Hotels near by and yours feels very shoddy in comparison but like I said it was suitable for its purpose. The Matrress on the bed was extremely hard, it was the firt thing I noticed as I flopped on to it as soon as we arrived but it didnt ruin my sleep so I cant really complain. The Staff are very friendly, on the first night they advised where to go for dinner, the couple behind us then asked and it was clear that his sppech was rehearsed as he repeated word for word what he had told us. When we arrived at the Restaurant, it didnt look great so we went about finding our own place to eat (thats not to say it wasnt nice, it could have been). Regardless, there are loads of Restaurnats near by. It states on the webiste that the Hotel is located in a Traffic Restricted area and therefore unauthorised vehicles cannot gain entry without first alerting the Transport Department. Becuase of this, we asked the Hotel to arrange a Taxi to collect us from the Airport. This set us back \u20ac50.00 and a normal taxi into the city would only have cost \u20ac20.00 and the train/metro only \u20ac7. We felt a bit ripped off by this, especially to discover that it was not in a traffic restricted area at all. It was handy having the taxi collect us when we had no idea where we were going but it is literally off of Via Nazionale so if at all possible I would advise you make your own way. Overall, the stay was very nice. We did not have breakfast becuase it didnt state whether or not it was included in our stay. We were afriad we would be charged astonomically for it. Also we left the Hotel quite early each day so we didnt really have the time to stop. Thus I cannot comment on the breakfast but the breakfast room looked pleasant. A final comment is that we decided to be very cultured and to go to the Opera one night (it was great - I am not an Opera fan but I really enjoyed myself) we asked Reception if there was any on during our stay and they said no. the opera we went to was literally about ten paces down the road and we happened to stumble on it by chance.

We arrived at about mid-day and our room was already available, which was great. The staff were friendly and exceptionally helpful, they supplied a very useful and detailed map of Rome to help us explore, checking in was really quick and painless (although the luggage lift was out of order and I had to carry the case up about 30 steps). Rooms were compact but with enough room for the two of us, comfy and warm, we were situated on the first floor overlooking the Theatre Di Opera, but even though we were there for New Year there was little disturbance for the whole 5 nights we were there. As in a number of the reviews above the hotel staff recommended the Il Barocco restaurant, which was delightful and the food was spectacular, the 'Veal in a Marsala sauce' was to die for, and highly recommended. Anyway there are plenty of other great restaurants within 2 or 3 minutes walk, the hotel is convenient for most of the tourist sights which are within walking distance, but beware the cobbles can make your feet ache. Alternatively the metro is great value at 1 Euro for 75 minutes travel, or 4 Euros for a whole day. although in fairness we walked most everywhere. One thing we must say about Rome is that around New Year, if you have a nervous tendancy, heart condition or an intolerance to loud noises then do beware, the locals have a tendency to throw loud fireworks bangers (and even catherine wheels) into the middle of the street with complete disregard for anyones safety, also the bottle throwing can be definitely unsafe!!

I had booked directly with the hotel through their website, which is available in several different languages. I paid 350 euros for four nights, which is actually a decent price given that hotels in Rome can easily cost more. One thing worth bearing in mind if you book directly with the hotel is that if you take up a promotional rate then you must either pay in cash or travellers cheques when checking out. In fairness to the hotel, it is in a fairly good location. The forum and Coloesseum can be reached easily; it's about a 20 minute walk. There are two Metro stations nearby and you can get a bus to the airport from near the station. There are plenty of fine churches in the immediate vicinity, but places like the Vatican are only a short tube ride away. Of course there was a downside to the hotel. There is no lift to the reception area which means hauling your luggage up a flight of stairs first. The room I stayed in was small; the room my relatives also stayed in was small and that was meant to be a double room. Their website indicates that rooms are soundproof; having stayed in the room next to the toliet in the breakfast area I can confirm that it is not the case and anyone who stays in that room has my sympathy as you will be woken at six in the morning by staff using that toilet. My bathroom was clean; my relative's bathroom was smaller and theirs was a double room. The breakfast bar is also small; although I did not have to wait for a table, some people did. The breakfast is enough to keep you going until lunch.

We don't like to pay over the odds for a hotel room so try to stick around the 100gbp mark and for that I don't expect luxury but do expect a high standard of hygiene, a comfortable bed and a nice shower. Hotel Lirico delivered on all three counts. I was surprised and very impressed by the way in which the room was decorated (it seems that the hotel was completely remodelled a year or two ago and to excellent effect - have a look yourself on the official website). The staff were very helpful and friendly and all spoke excellent English (embarrassingly good infact). The included breakfast was fine if somewhat limited. There were no hot dishes available but there were plenty of nice local bread products and packets of Italian meat. I have read other derogatory comments about the 'orange juice' provided with breakfast I am not going to break from that trend. The orange was horrible. That said, the coffee was excellent but then this is true for the whole of Rome to my experience. Coffee in England is generally shamefully bad and this fact is particularly emphasised when you go to somewhere like Rome where they obviously take great pride in it (and justifiably so). The location of the hotel is quite convenient although not exceptional. It was about a 15min walk to the 'heart' of Rome (i.e. the Coliseum, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain etc..). I am assuming that the closer you get to these attractions then the more you have to pay for the kind of quality the Hotel Lirico gives you at a fraction of the cost. As long as you don't mind a bit of a walk in the morning and at the end of the night then you will be fine. We didn't mind. I only have one gripe about the hotel and it is a shame that it had to happen at all. The problem arose when we asked at the reception a couple of days in advance if we could book a taxi to take us to the airport. The taxi arrived on time but it turned out that he had been misinformed about which of the two airports we wanted to go to and that this would then mess up the rest of his pick ups for the night (like I really care). He then proceeded to drive like a mad man for the next half an hour en route and charge us 33 percent more than we had been quoted by the receptionist. To be honest it made me wonder whether he had a racket going with the receptionist at the hotel to try and fleece tourists as they left the country. I phoned the hotel open receiving the inflated bill only to be greeted with flagrant lies about how much he had quoted me the previous day. Only a minor gripe though really and wasn't indicative of the rest of our stay in the hotel.

I purchased the vacation via Expedia based on price and location, the pictures at Expedia and at the hotel's web site, and also all the wonderful reviews in TripAdvisor. We were fairly disappointed. First, let's cover some good things about Hotel Lirico: - The location is great, very centric and close to buses, trains, and the Metro. - In addition, the staff is very polite and they do speak English. - The room and the hotel in general were clean. - They have a decent breakfast, with Espresso and cappuccino (which we love), and bread, cheese, pastries, fruits. Now to the bad things . . . (1) Although this hotel is labeled a \"three star\" facility, believe me, it is not. We have been told several times that Europe has a different standard, and we always must take out at least one star if we want to compare a hotel to the American ones. Definitely, this is a 2-star at most. (2) Before you reach the elevator, you must go up the stairs with your baggage, although the hotel staff will help you if you ask. (3) The room we got had a good closet and room to place our two medium-sized suitcases *BUT* it was about 10 ft x 11 ft, and the bathroom not only was small but it had the smallest shower area I have ever seen: it was a tiny square, with an entry way 12.5 inches wide ... Both my husband and I are overweight, so we had difficulty getting in (fortunately the sliding sides were made of plastic that bent a little), and once you were inside, you were not able to bend to reach your lower legs or feet (even a small size person would not be able to do this). We thought we had seen the smallest possible hotel rooms during our past stays in Madrid and Paris, but this one beat them. (4) We did not have a working outside phone line all the time we were there. On the first day, I reported it, and they said it would be fixed. One of the staff came to the room (somewhat disbelieving me) to prove that it was not working. Well, the incoming calls were transferred, but I was unable to call outside or even the front desk for 8 days. Every time I reminded them that the phone was not working, they said it would be reset and work the next day. When I had to make calls (about 4 total), I went downstairs to the desk, and they would make them for me (although not happy at times because I was using their only phone), and one time they charged me 50 cents/Euro for one of the calls ...it was not my fault that the room phone was not working!!! (5) Since there was absolutely no space to place anything else besides the bed and a couple of tables in the room, the *tiny* TV set was placed kind of high up, hanging from the wall. The TV reception was fairly bad for most channels. (6) The bed (actually, there were two twin beds put together) was sooooo hard, it made sleeping difficult. In addition, and unfortunately for us, we got very sick with flu/fever the last three days we stayed in Rome, and we had to stay in our room. It was absolutely awful. We ached and could not sleep because the beds were like wood. Bottom line: Go to this hotel *only if* your most important concerns are location and cost and if you are a thin person. If you are looking for a comfortable stay, you must pay a bit more for a 4-star hotel (which will then be comparable to an American 3-star hotel).", "Date": "January 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palma de Mallorca (Spain)", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "ChusToni", "ReviewID": "UR2884106", "Content": "We stayed for five nights last week.

We found the hotel to be clean and relatively comfortable (although the bed was very hard and there weren't enough pillows or blankets). It is a good location - right next to the Teatro dell'Opera, so you can ask for this if taxi drivers don't know the hotel. There are also lots of lovely little cafes around the Teatro, you can get coffee, cakes and alcohol from the deli up to 2am, big bonus! Very easy to get around - you can walk to a lot of the main attractions (colosseum, santa maria maggiore, piazza navarone) and the metro stop is round the corner in the piazza repubblica. I wandered around on my own fairly late at night and felt as safe, if not safer as wandering the streets of London. The hotel itself - there is no lift to reception, so a big disadvantage if you have heavy bags. We booked via -------------- at a rate of 105 euros per room, per night, including breakfast and taxes. We found a cheaper rate on expedia.com (95 euros a night), contacted the hotel to ask about the difference and they assured us they would put us in a \"better\" room. We weren't; when we got there we were told that the hotel was full and we ended up in a room 2 doors down from reception. It wasn't as noisy as we feared, but still wasn't an upgrade in my opinion. The rooms are very small and the floors are polished wood, which is cold in November. The bathrooms are miniscule, and they have put a strange small bath in the room we had (105) - it would have been far better to put a good shower in. Breakfast is pretty rubbish. Everything is pre-packaged - handy if you are a breakfast bandit and want supplies for a packed lunch - but there is nothing hot or fresh (cheese and meat are all pre-packaged) and the \"fresh\" fruit bowl is fairly old. You are charged if you want more than one drink at breakfast and the juice is - I think - made from powder. However, I know from experience that you pay through the nose for a good hotel in Rome, and, breakfast aside, this would rate as a decent b&b. The staff are friendly and helpful, they all speak english, and the reception is 24 hour (they lock the front gate after 11pm but there is an entry buzzer). Would recommend for a weekend away, but if you were staing in Rome for much longer, it might be worth paying more and staying in a bigger hotel. The Exedra Boscara (sp?) round the corner in the piazza repubblica is gorgeous, but consumately expensive. The Hotel Capo d'Africa looked lovely (down a back street minutes away from the Colossuem), but again very expensive.
