However when I first entered the room, it sounds like I entered the street again. I can clearly hear everything from the street. Of course I went down to the reception and request another one again. As expected, they gave me the usual Non sense, there are no other room available. The room is clean but more like an inn than a hotel. I never understand how the star rating system work. The bathroom has no hook in it. It doest worth the $200 I paid for this room. If you are only looking for location or one night stay, and used to the street noise then this is the choice.

We arrived at the hotel at about 12:00 but were aware that we would only be let into the room at 14:00.

Checking in was easy and the safety deposit box in the room is free. There's a refundable \u20ac20 deposit to pay but no nightly rental as in other hotels. The room was small but you don't really need much if you are using the hotel as a base to explore the city. We only paid for the room. \u20ac11 each for breakfast seemed a bit excessive and there are plenty of places to eat nearby. We had breakfast in El Corte Ingles which is opposite. (Use the lift to the 9th floor - it's a lot quicker than using the escalators.) The room was at the back of the hotel overlooking what looked like a repository for old cleaning equipment. This didn't matter because we didn't go to this hotel to stay in it all day and stare out of the window. The balcony in the room would better be described as a ledge. Just enough room to stand on - I never felt safe on it going for a smoke so I had to keep one foot in the room! The air conditioning is a bit noisy but if you have enough to drink before going to bed you don't notice it much. The bathroom was small and there was no plug in the basin. No worries about that because I always take a spare plug on holiday. The room was clean on the first day and the cleaner kept it clean - we're quite messy holidayers! You can hear/feel the Metro going under the hotel but this is not really worth mentioning. It is not irritating and you have to realise that Barcelona is a vibrant city and not some back of beyond little hamlet. Plaza Catalunya is only a stone's throw away. If you get the tourist bus, get a 2 day pass for \u20ac27 instead of the 1 day pass for \u20ac21. We used the bus to see where we wanted to go on the first day and then on the second day used the bus to get to the places we decided we wanted to go to. Remember to use the discounts in the booklet that you get when you board the bus! Some of them aren't much but a couple of them are for 2 meals for one. La Rambla is busy and there is plenty to see. Keep an eye on your valuables though because the thieves are rife! I thought one little old beggar lady was quite harmless until I felt her fingers in my jeans - she only got a street map and gave it back in disgust! The nighttime entertainment outside the Zurich Cafe (Plaza Catalunya) is a must. The chap who apes the passers by is very funny and it's a good laugh watching the street sellers scarper when the police arrive. Checking out of the hotel was simple because the computer had broken down. Not sure what it would be like if the computer was working.

That's one of the very few plus points (the others are that the chambermaid does a very good job and that they have at least 1 english channel on tv even though it's not enough but then again, it's not an English country)... The size of my room was very small (I guess the large mirror was there to create the illusion of space - it didn't work), the lights were left on for my arrival making it appear to be a 'bright' room during the daytime. Well, if you turn the lights off, the room is almost pitch black...and the view out of the window? well, it's onto other windows and if you're unlucky enough to have a room like mine and you look down, you'll also notice cigarette butts, mops etc. (check my pictures). They really need to sort out the problem with light in the rooms (artificial light is not enough). I really think that some of these rooms should be storage rooms and not actualy bedrooms. Otherwise I think the hotel should knock two rooms out to make 1 whole room. The final point is probably the biggest issue I had with the room and it was a noise issue. Now, I have no idea what the two separate sounds were. One of them sounds like a generator which would make this kind of humming sound and that occured occasionally. The other was a sound which would occur about every 15 minutes - it sounded like a cross between a thunderstorm and an earthquake (this is not hyperbole either). Someone else who reviewed the hotel said this noise did not occur at night - well that's wrong because it absolutely did. Maybe they're just very good sleepers. I hardly slept at all.

Next problem was the room itself, we had a room on the first floor though i had requested a room on the lower levels. The room was tiny and very depresing. Also it sounded like an earthquake every 5 minutes when the metro underneath passed by, the windows would literally shake-it was unbelieveable. I didnt try move rooms because after the trouble we had checking in i just couldnt face him again. Next problem -in the bathroom leading down from the bath were two steps on a really shiny tiled floor-no grip whatsoever. After having a shower my boyfriend slipped on this floor and fell down the two steps and really hurt his back on the steps. He was in a lot of pain for the rest of the trip and still has bruising as a reminder. I never had breakfast in the hotel-my reason was that i refused to pay them any more money than i already had. There was a little 'snack shop' that was supposed to open from7-7. I only seen it open once for about an hour.

The Eurostars Mitre was about 3-4 train stops from the city center and I was not happy as we paid for city center price. We incurred additional expenses buying train passes because of this. The only reason I picked Gran Ducat is because it is right off Plaza Catalunya. For moving us to Mitre hotel they didn't offer to comp us breakfast or any upgrade and I think the hotel we were sent to was lesser quality although it is hard to compare since I never got to stay at Gran Ducat. During their explaining and them trying to answer all the questions I had about transportation to/from city center I saw other hotel guests walking in and out of the Gran Ducat. Also to further confirm my suspicion I asked the taxi driver about how often this happens and how many guests he has been called for transfer (once again my Spanish came in handy) and he said several hotels had funny business going on.

On arrival we jumped into one of the many , many taxis available outside the bus station for a 5 minute trip to our hotel. The taxi driver had slight difficulty in finding the hotel as he had not been to it previously.....maybe due to the fact that there are in excess of 3000 hotels in the city. On arrival at the hotel's tiny entrance we were welcomed by a very friendly young man on reception duty. He had us checked in after a few minutes and directed us to our rooms on the 4th floor of the hotel via one of the 2 lifts available. On reaching the room I opened the door with the electronic keycard and must say I was a bit suprised at how compact the room was. My wife and I had a bit of a laugh about it and entered the room to check it out further. It may have been compact but it was spotlessly clean and had nice fluffy white towels, hot power shower ( in fact very hot water!) and crisp clean bedding. We were only using the room for sleeping in ( or maybe some extra cirricular activities that married couples with kids have when they escape children free for a few days!) so because the room wasn't the size of a pop star's suite we weren't too bothered. Due to the fact that we'd arrived early evening and were quite hungry and didn't know our way around the city I asked the reception staff for a recommendation for a meal and he very curteously gave me a card for a nearby establishment where we had a lovely meal and glass of wine at very reasonable prices. The first night in the hotel did concern me slightly due to the noise of one inconsiderate female on the same floor as us who insisted on knocking very loudly on the door of the room she was sharing with her husband / boyfriend at 3am to gain entry after returning to the hotel a bit worse for wear. If I had been able to get my head off the pillow I might have knocked very loudly on her head but fortunately I was too tired to get myself into trouble with our new neighbours!! There was a bit of traffic noise at night and then around 7 / 8 am again but it is smack in the middle of a major city centre and the advantages of the location far outweighed the disadvantages that I encountered. The following morning we left the hotel and went to one of the many eatieries close at hand for breakfast, coffee and a spot of people watching in the warm Catalanyan sunshine....easily 70 degrees in October. Just lovely. I am reviewing the hotel but I must put in a good word for the city itself. It is one of the most breathtaking cities I have ever been in with regards to architecture and impressive buildings, history etc. I went to Barcelona as a bit of a ignoramous regarding culture and decorum but spent most of 2 days on the excellent open top bus tours which took us around some of the most beautiful sights , buildings , points of interest I have ever witnessed. Stunning place....I recommend to anyone! As a mad footy fan the best bit for me was the trip to the Nou Camp stadium , home of the mighty Barcelona FC but there were plenty of other more \" cultured\" sites to visit in addition. Grab the red bus line and the blue bus line for the trip of a lifetime ....well worth the 23 euros each for 2 days of trips, Eat in the Hard Rock Cafe in the Catalanyan Square for the biggest portions in Barca but do also try the many traditional Tapas Bars in the area. Drink San Miguel but also experience a \" mohito\" which is a mix of rum, mint, lime and some other goodies served in a glass with crushed ice and a straw! Fantastic!! Hit the shops and do a bit of damage to your credit card , the stores sell real nice quality goods. Have no concerns about using the Hotel Gran Ducat as a base if you are in Barcelona for a short city break. The rooms were cleaned daily whether they needed it or not, we had fresh towels every day and the bedlinen was changed twice over a 4 day stay. Some hotels will be roomier and more luxurious but the location won't be as fit for the purpose as the Gran Ducat and in addition the tariff I paid for a 3 night stay in a leading European City was very reasonable. The staff couldn't have been more pleasant or helpful during our stay even to the extent that after we checked out they agreed to hold our luggage until later in the day and even pre ordered us a taxi to take us back to the bus station to catch our transfer to the airport.

Secondly, the room was clean. But that doesn't mean, that it was kind of renovated or else....one of the negative points was that the room was \"lived down\", lots dirty slings and cracks in the wall. No surprise actually the metro seems to rumble along just under the hotel, funny thing however that we could hear the rumbling every few minutes even in the 3rd floor. A very good example for the noise in the hotel. You heard just everything everytime. Day and night. And we didn't have a room with a window facing the street....actually only very few rooms in that house have that. After a look on the floor-room-map: The most rooms are grouped around some indoor space. Don't expect to get any sunlight, fresh air or any idea on the outside weather conditions !! You can just see the opposite wall and if you're lucky, the naked guests in the room opposite to yours ;o)) This hole didn't kill our sense of humour, but it worked very hard on it, really !! The room we where given consisted actually only of one bed, as you can see on the photos. No space to walk, just the bed. Open the door and jump into your bed ! Furthermore the room was a single room and the bed (140 x 200 cm) far too small for 2 persons. But of course we had to pay a double-room. When we complained about this no-one seemed to be interested. Other signs that the room is a single was the single chair in the room and only one available keycard for the door. Don't book in that hotel, because if you get a so called special tourist offer, you will end up in a single room with 2 persons and paying far too much for that. And don't book there neither, because if you have to pay for a double room, the rates will be far to high for that dump. And the other rooms on the map looked also very small. (no windows !!!) Simply overpriced old worn down place. I was just do dissapointed. Due to the small bed and the lack of any fresh air we couldn't hardly get sleep and it was a depressing time. The cupboard included a safe. When checking in, of course the guy didn't inform us about the opportunity to b\"borrow\" a key for a deposit of 10 Euro. We had to go up to the room, to see that the safe was closed, go down again to ask about the situation and then, surprise surprise, we got the information. One really good joke was, that the 10 Euro deposit was put in an separatedly sealed envelope with our room number and put in a box. On departure however we received the deposit via 2 x 5-Euro notes from an non-sealed envelope...haha...so what all the fuss about that sealing and envelope ?!?!!! Just ridiculous. In the end we didn't care any more about the unfriendly reception guy, he was completely ignoring the people. One evening there was a fire alarm, everyone was rushing downwards and asking around. After 15 guests were standing around and asking him, he said \"Ok, seems to be in the 6th floor, maybe I will go and have a look\". Hello ?!?!?!!! Complete waste of money that guy. On departure day I noticed that the cleaning woman must have taken away a white t-shirt from me when changing the linen. Of course, no one at the reception was interested, I don't expect to get it back by post. The note I handed them out, was put aside. I have never been in a place with that unfriendly staff and such a non-interested attitude. Don't make the same mistake as we did !! Don't book there !!

Just be aware if you need a third bed.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cA Gran Job!!\u201d", "Author": "jerrywasthere", "ReviewID": "UR6717359", "Content": "The Gran Ducat Hotel was fantastic. My brother and i visited Barcelona for the first time for a two night break taking advantage of the low cost airline revolution to enjoy the sights, the local brew and of course the mighty barca barca barca football team. We found the Gran Ducat no problem. A two minute walk after a 15 minute journey on the aerobus from the airport. The location was perfect. 150 yards from the placa catalunya and the ramblas. 50 yards from the metro aswell as pubs,cafes and shops on your doorstep. The hotel itself and the rooms were immaculately clean and tidy. The rooms were comfortable although quite basic but more than adequte for our stay as most of the time we spent out and about. Although i can't comment much on breakfast (too much estrella!!), there was plenty of juice, toast, tea, coffe and pastries etc on offer. Dining and drinking highlights were the H3 bar where we enjoyed the local brew and tapas. Very much a locals bar which was fab! Visit the ramblas by all means but be aware that its quite tacky and the pubs are ridiculously overpriced tourist traps. A personal highlight and must for music fans and cheap booze is the manchester bar. Tell barman Jerry we sent ya! Legend! Barcelona is a beautiful friendly city and its safe to say we''ll be back!!!!!!!! Barca! Barca!

The room I had was on the main street and quite large, however ,some of the inner rooms are quite small. This was not a problem, particularly as most of the time was spent out and about. Also the hotel is very conveniant for the aerobus, only a 2 minute walk from the place de catalunya, a major square with bus and underground transport links. For Tapas I would recommend Cocina Vasca on Placa Nova 3, near the cathedral.
