The bathroom was clean and light but there was no window covering and, despite the middle of the floor-ceiling height window being frosted, I felt a little exposed.

Hotel was extraordinarily quiet, which was fine by us. The highlight of our stay was making the acquaintance of the fantastic Matteo, the bar manager. Nothing was too much trouble for this guy and made us feel so at home, waited on us hand and foot and recommended some great eateries. He should be the head of a five star hotel this guy. Overall, great hotel but I think it lacks some investment.

The taxi had no idea where it was so he left us a few numbers away from number 90 where the hotel is, only for us to realize that the few numbers were actually equivalent to quite a few hundred meters... Location is one of the downfall of the hotel. Though you can still get to the subway Republica or the main Termini station by foot, it takes easily 10 to 15 minutes to reach any of these stations. Moreover all the main attractions of Rome are quite far away from the hotel, meaning you either get a cab or have to walk back and from the subway station, which is fine when you are fresh in the morning but can easily become dreadful after a whole day walking within the center of Rome. The direct neighborhood of the hotel does have a few restaurants but it s still a very quite neighborhood with nothing much. The other downfall of the hotel is the front desk. While the staff is quite friendly when calling guests relations on the phone, somehow when you actually face the staff at the front desk, they are all very stiff without a smile and even close to being unfriendly. On check in for instance, while it is done quickly and efficiently, there is not a single welcome or smile or friendly chit chat which you would expect from a hotel of that standard. Same goes for check out, not a single thank you for staying with us, not even bye bye. They just ask you for the mini bar, give you the amount, take your card and give you back your receipt.....It just can t be worse. But well apart from location and front desk staff, the hotel itself is beautiful. The lobby is great and the design of the rooms is just gorgeous. The bed was great and as far as our room was concerned, we did not have much noise problems despite being right next to the elevator. The only strange thing was that there was no boiler with complimentary tea and coffee which has long become standard in hotels of that category. The bathroom was also great with a rain shower, perhaps efforts could be done on the amenities kit as you need to ask for a toothbrush or a comb, which is very unconvenient as you usually realize you need these early in the morning or late at night. Overall it is still a fine hotel. If the front desk was on par with its design, this hotel would really be superb. I guess they ll just need to work on this.

Compared to the prices to some of the other stiffer hotels this was definitely value for money!", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, England", "Title": "\u201cDesign over function\u201d", "Author": "robski_korsikoff", "ReviewID": "UR60188737", "Content": "I have travelled on business to Rome many times in the last 4 years, mostly being lucky enough to stay in one of the top 5 star hotels (Westin, Baglioni, St Regis Grand etc). However, recent pressures on expense budgets (no surprise) has led to my company travel team looking to find 'bargains'. So, at the end of March 2010 I had my first stay at Leon's Place. This is a hotel where 'design over function' seems to be the key theme. There are mirrors everywhere....from reception (where the huge mirror is also a flat screen TV), to the bar, to the lift, to the bathrooms, to the bedrooms (including the doors of the wardrobe and its entire interior!). The seats in reception and the bar look fabulous but are not particularly comfortable. The sink in the bathroom is very shallow and I almost had a flooded bathroom when I was brushing my teeth as there is no overflow in the sink! But, I suppose if you are into that sort of thing, then maybe it is for you....(the mirrors, not the sink....) Check-in and check-out were both smooth and quick. I did have a couple of good night's sleep, although be warned the mattresses are on the firm side. Also, the room was a little warm, and although it did not bother me, a colleague could not activate the air con in his room and was told by reception everything was still on a winter setting so nothing could be done. Not particularly satisfactory. The room itself was small, with the double bed almost filling the floor space, however, there was a flat screen TV on the wall with a number of TV channels available. As many other reviewers have posted, breakfast is not great. There is a very limited choice of cereals and breads but it has to be said that the fresh fruit was VERY fresh and lovely. There was no hot buffet selection, although I was offered scrambled eggs on my second morning....although this had not been offered to me the morning before. Staff on reception were very helpful, reserving tables for us at restaturants and ordering cabs as and when required. Location is OK - about a 15 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain. And for those business travellers out there - there is no busines centre! But that;s not really a criticism, as business travellers are not this hotel's target audience. In a nutshell, I wouldn't go back for business and I wouldn't go back with my whole family. However, I would consider taking my wife on a romantic break here as the room rates are reasonable for central Rome. Nevertheless, I would see what rates i could get at the 5 star hotels mentioned at the top of this review before booking!", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "luanda", "Title": "\u201cGreat Design but\u201d", "Author": "rviegas", "ReviewID": "UR50936693", "Content": "Trendy hotel good ambience but very poor breakfast for the price and finally the heating system didn\u00b4t work very well Don\u00b4t know if next time at rome will stay at this hotel", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSexiest Hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "AdrianneK", "ReviewID": "UR49705726", "Content": "We stayed at Leon's Place after checking out of a so-called 4 star hotel which was a dump.

The breakfast was more gourmet than standard hotel fare and included eggs made to order and freshly squeezed orange juice. Beautiful bed and pillows made us feel like we were sleeping on a cloud. Even the complimentary hotel slippers were of a good quality. The bathroom was quite spacious, including a bath tub and shower, toilet and bidet, although the bedroom is just big enough for the bed for 2.

I looked for the small design hotel and design was one of the main criteria. So this criteria was perfectly matched, starting with the reception and up to the room. We booked standard double,but were kindly upgraded to the suite,as it seemed that we were the only guests in the hotel :) ,as it is brand new and just working on attracting the clients. The room was very nice with a comfortable bed, but a bit noisy at night due to bad noise isolation. There was no information in the room on how to call any hotel services from the room,so we had to go to the reception all the time we needed help instead of calling them . We also found out that they have wi-fi the last day just by chance, as there was no sign or info anywhere in the room as well. Also it was very hot in the room, but by my experience it looks like all the hotels in Italy have this problem in the winter, as they are not allowed to turn the conditioning on by law during this season, as we were explained. I also was surprised with a very scarse breakfast - just some bread, 1 type of cheese and salumi, cereals, joghurts, 1 type of juice, water and fruit salad. I got used to more substantial breakfasts, so had to pay additionally for my omlet or scrambled eggs. Honestly, I thought, that if you pay such a high price for the room, good breakfast should be a must... So that was a nuisance. The staff was very helpful and nice - helped us with restaurants (the hotel doesn't have its own so far), car rental, parkings, vine shop just around the corner (Trimani - highly recommended!), etc. So overall, we liked the stay (but for the breakfast), but the hotel should do something with the noise from the street heard in the room and also with the elevator, which was quite scary, as the noise, which it produced during the move, made me think, that it has to be repaired obviously, which is inappropriate for the luxury hotel.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Leon's Place Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1160903-Reviews-Leon_s_Place_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$184 - $369*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via 20 Settembre 90/94</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1160903", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/fe/d2/hall.jpg"}}
