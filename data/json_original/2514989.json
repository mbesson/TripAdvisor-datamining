It was disgusting, there was also a spot on the wall by the window opens where the wallpaper was torn back about a foot and half with mold growing where the window had leaked when it rained. We never would have known due to the window covering does not allow to see it if ur not looking for it. We found it by accident. There were also hairs on the toilet and shower stall. The rooms were spacious minus the bathroom, if u have a person that is not a toothpick, then closing the bathroom door will be pretty difficult. I was only refunded half the coSt of the stay and I would have to say that I will not be going back again. And the breakfast is OK the next morning but the servers are somewhat clumsy.

I wasn't registered for the conference, so I spent a LOT of time at the hotel. It's basically a very generic, nondescript corporate/conference hotel. You'll see lots of middle-manager types hanging out in the lobby and breakfast area. Very bland decor and somewhat light on amenities, probably because they assume that the typical guest isn't going to spend a lot of time relaxing on the property. The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable. We had a nice, big HD television, and fortunately there were some HD channels available (I'm amazed at how many hotels have installed HD sets in every room but still have only SD channels). Internet is free, and is wired (which is okay with me because it's generally faster than wifi). The free breakfast is very elaborate and includes waffle and omelet stations. The pool area is very small, but clean and quiet (I had it to myself most of the time). The hotel doesn't have a bar or restaurant, but there are plenty of options within easy walking distance. On the minus side: The \"fitness center\" is only slightly larger than a walk-in closet. The staff seems bored and indifferent; you will NOT get a welcoming smile when you approach the check-in desk. Parking is limited, and unless you're lucky, you'll probably have to park in the lot across the street. Oh, and the hotel is evidently popular with visiting youth sports teams; if you're there on the weekend you may encounter LOTS of kids.

The hotel is an average property, in slightly below average condition. Our second floor room was musty, and showed a fair amount of wear and tear. I was bothered by the lack of cleanliness. Both in the common areas and our room, everything needed a good deep cleaning, or better yet a renovation. I am mystified by the other reviewers who thought the hotel was awesome with no problems...I think we all just have different standards to which we hold properties. The bed was okay, at best. The air conditioning unit was loud, and probably in need of cleaning as the air coming out of the unit smelled badly. The bathroom was slightly dirty (hairs hanging down from the ceiling over the shower...not sure how this even happened!), and again everything else was just low quality and in need of deep cleaning. Check in/checkout was okay...not professional, but nothing else was at the hotel anyway. Parking was difficult, as there are only a few spots in front of the hotel, and all other parking is a bit of a walk across/slightly down the street.

We had booked at this particular hotel due to the website layout of the room we chose. We wanted to have one area for the children to sleep in while my husband and I would be able to stay up and read, watch TV, etc in the adjoining sitting area. When we checked in, the room was not like that at all, nor were any of the rooms in the hotel according to the front desk. So we'd paid a lot of extra money (to us, $40 extra is a big deal) for no added value. Also, the cable was out, so we were stuck in a hotel room with the children with nothing to do. Hubby took the kids to the pool while I unpacked, hot tub broken. Plug in the bathtub broken so the kids got a shower before bed instead of a bath which is a pain with little kids. After all of this, the hotel staff did agree to decrease our fee by $30, which took a little of the sting out. The worst part of the night, though, was yet to come. At about 11 pm, there were several groups of teenagers in the area outside of our room which I chased off a couple of times. Unfortunately they kept coming back. This kept my husband and I as well as our younger child awake until midnight. I finally called the front desk after speaking to the teen group chaperone seemed to do little good. I think they must have sent someone up; either that or the kids finally went to sleep. Our drive home stunk as we were worn out because of our miserable night. Unfortunate all around, as the mattresses and pillows were comfortable for a hotel so we probably would have slept well otherwise.

I stayed at the Hawthorn Suites right by the University of Illinois. I have to say that it was one of the most pleasant hotel stay's I have recently had and for as much as I travel that is saying a lot. The people at the hotel were not only professional but were very nice. The rooms were very clean and spacious. I was also amazed by the energy of the staff and how clean they kept the hotel. Each morning I was treated to a hot buffet breakfast which was really good! I just wanted to let everyone know that my stay was great and that I would recommend the Hawthorn Suites in Champaign to anyone traveling for any reason. --KRB", "Date": "March 25, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201csuspicious anonymous reviews\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR826085", "Content": "Interesting that the positive review for the Drury and the negative review for the Hawthorn were written on the same day!
