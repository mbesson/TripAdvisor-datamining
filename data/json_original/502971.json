There was a quite angry russian couple that realized there that the hotel had no cribs at all. So if you are going with your baby, take that in account. The bathroom had a dirty door that was never cleaned, there is a chest of drawers with all of them broken. The soap and paper is really cheap, and almost useless.

The hotel is so close to THai Town, so we had delicious dinner in Thaitown every night. what more... there is CVS, Starbuck right around the corner...just about 1 min from the hotel...The guys who worked there were nice. The room was clean. The beds were not too bad... However, the last night before we left, there were two ladies living next door making a very loud noise all night...it was very annoying...well I didn't blame the hotel. it was something like manner that everybody should realize. ... if I go to LA again, I will not reluctant to stay here again.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cNice choice for all casual traveler\u201d", "Author": "Irene_Lau", "ReviewID": "UR96129346", "Content": "Low-priced, clean, quiet, very convenience (turn left for Starbucks; and turn another left for 7-11 and Walk of Fame).

It is cleaned everyday though by a nice cleaning lady. There was flies everywhere but to be honest it was roasting so I bet you get bugs everywhere in the summer. The pool looked OK but I didn't go in. The breakfast was just donuts and they were stale. We didn't have cars and the people just looked at us like we were speaking another language when we said this, they wouldn't even try to help us get around LA or give us maps or anything! haha they were nice but not very helpful for tourists. They did have a PC with internet and a printer for a charge though for maps and things. Wasn't the hotel that bothered me so much though, it was the area at night. I was aware there were prostitutes staying in my hotel because of the late night noises. There were homeless people near by with shopping carts (they were harmless but it wasnt the nicest thing to have to look at, makes you feel bad if you cant afford to give them food) and on our first night we were off to the local supermarket and we got stopped around 3 times by people asking us for food. We were 18 at the time and kinda terrified. On our first day we also seen two arrests and the local cab driver even asked us why we would choose this area to stay in. One night we were followed to the local Denny's by a car (beware females who dress nicely, in LA people tend to shout out their cars at you alot in the not so nice areas) so we didn't feel safe. Saying that, nowhere seems safe in Hollywood. On about our 3rd day we were talking to this lovely guy on Hollywood Boulevard and all of a sudden this guy comes out of nowhere threatening to shoot him and take his money haha. I do love LA and I wanna go back but next time I am going to stay in the W on hollywood boulevard. There's nice sides of LA and not so nice sides of LA aswell. I knew this before I went but I didn't know exactly where they were, so this is just a heads up. If you can rough it and you are tough enough then by all means stay here. If you like you're like me and you enjoy luxuries and are terrified at night then stay somewhere a little more pricey, it will make your trip alot better. Some of the trips we went on there were amazing, it's a great place but just don't think cause it's Hollywood it's gonna be glam because Hollywood is a pretty big place and it's just not like that.

We woke up during this on the first night and thought we were in the middle of an earthquake!! There wasn't enough pillows in the room so we went downstairs and asked the (different this time) receptionist for some more. He started quizzing us about how many pillows we had! He then said he couldn't help us as the housekeeping had gone home. We told him that it wasn't our problem and that we needed another pillow. He said that guests take the pillows home with them which is why there was a shortage!!! He eventually got us another pillow after we went downstairs and asked him again. I also wanted to use the phone and was told that I had to pay a $10 deposit even though they had my card details. He then said that if I called outside the immediate area, they would count that as an international call, ith a $5 minimum charge so I said not to bother!!! The pool area was nice and clean although there were only four sunloungers. Everyday, the owners/cleaners, who have an apartment next to the pool, would use two of the sun loungers to dry their washing on which was annoying. The washing would be on them all day. The breakfast wasn't very good. Cereal and donuts. You are only allowed to use the \"free\" internet for 15 minutes for the whole duration of your stay!

Free WiFi was a plus, too. And, some good low-budget restaurants in the area- Thai, Mexican. This place was described as \"charmingly seedy\" on Yelp, and that's not far off the mark. They make an effort to keep the place nice. it's not bad, but if you're used to the Hilton or Marriott, you won't be happy here. Not sure how they got such a high rating on Tripadvisor. I wouldn't object to staying here again, but I'd check into other options first - someplace a bit closer to the main part of hollywood, or maybe just a little nicer. TIPS- go up to Grifith Obsevatory. An icon! It's close by, awesome veiw of the city, Hollywood sign, etc. And all free, except for the main planetarium theater, which we skipped, but is supposed to be well worth it. Check out the Frolic Room, one of Hollywood's most classic dives. And great happy hour food and drinks at The Well.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cGreat value - Good location\u201d", "Author": "worldclassinspector", "ReviewID": "UR59003822", "Content": "Stayed here 4 nights during the Oscars and it was really affordable, yet clean and nice.

I think we had 5 nights stay for 3 people coming in at about $383, which was way cheaper than a lot of other places I looked into. The rooms aren't great - don't expect luxury soaps for a start. Bathroom and main room are a little dingy and dusty, so if you're expecting super clean don't come here. Windows don't open so if you're caustrophobic and like to sleep with a window open at night, forget it. The blinds are also a litte gappy so light does come in at night. Room is a bit dark and gloomy due to poor lighting lamps. Fridge is noisy and had to be turned off at night. Other than these disadvantages, unless I found a better deal for the price I would stay here again. The staff aren't overly friendly although the older dude did make a bit of an effort. The free donuts, coffee, cereal and juice for breakfast is awesome. It's very informal but it's nice to come down in the morning for a quick start up before leaving for the day. Free computer/internet use is also cool. The location is great - if you're the person who enjoys walking everywhere, think otherwise because it's about 30mins away to the Kodak Theatre, but the good thing is that the subway is about 2 mins walk away from the hotel.

The smell was almost overpowering when you'd enter the room, but you got used it it. Sort of. You couldn't open the windows more than a crack to get fresh air circulating, so that didn't help. The room was dark and dingy but clean where it mattered most - the bed - which is why we went ahead and stayed there for the two nights we'd booked. The bathroom was not up to my standards of cleanliness. Bath, basin and toilet were clean enough, it's just that there were weird stains on the mirror, the walls, the back of the door...you get the picture. Dire need of a makeover, this place. Location was quite good, within walking distance of many Thai restaurants and other cheap eateries. Felt safe enough to walk around at night. Our room was at the back, off street, so we didn't get street noise, but one night reception (or so they claimed to be) rang at 11pm, waking us to persistently ask for someone called Henry Somethingorother in room 403, who most definitely wasn't staying in our room (which was indeed 403). Our room was also close to the back entry door, so that was kind of noisy with people coming and going, but not so noisy that it woke you at night. I was a bit concerned about security though, since you don't need a swipe card or anything to get in the building (except reception - separate building), so in theory anyone off the street can gain access and loiter in the halls or stairwells. But we didn't see anything like that during our stay. The free parking was good - one of the reasons we chose the place, as well as the surprisingly sunny reviews it gets on Trip Advisor - and it's close to a busy bus stop for those travelling without a car. Finally, the staff. The guy who checked us in was friendly and professional, but the woman we had to deal with to get the login details for the free WIFI was downright rude.

The hotel is located in the eastern part of Hollywood close to the Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue intersection. There is a metro station, Hollwood/Western literally just across the street from the hotel and a bus stop just outside. It costed about 13 dollars each from LAX airport by shuttle bus. This particular area of Hollywood is a little run down but on the whole I felt safe here. The hotel check-in was quick and straightforward and the layout of the hotel is just like a motel style layout where the apartments/rooms are located around the central pool. There are about 3 floors of rooms. Our room was spacious with two comfortable queen-sized beds. There was a clean bathroom which had a bath, a great shower and a toilet. Clean towels were provided although the towels weren't very large. The wash-basin and counter was in the main room with sockets for shaving, etc. This room was similar to many motel style rooms I have stayed in the past. One thing I did notice in this hotel was that you could hear the plumbing system very loudly when people in other rooms had a shower or flushed the toilet. Someone was taking a shower in another room at 9pm on our first night and the sound of water in pipes was very obtrusive although it wasn't a regular thing we did notice this sound on a couple of occasions. This hotel is walking distance from the main sights in Hollywood. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to Hollywood/Vine where it starts to get interesting and about 35 minutes to Hollywood/Highland where most of the Hollywood action occurs. Of course you can always take the metro to these places quite easily. A day pass on the metro costs only 5 dollars. Most people in LA seem to drive everywhere and there are plenty of parking spaces at the hotel itself. The hotel does offer complimentary breakfast. It consisted of croissants, bread, coffee and juice which is available from a counter in the main office. There are tables and chairs by the poolside to eat breakfast. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as there were many other options around the area to choose from but it was good that it was offered.

When we returned from the game, we took a shower, watched tv a bit and turned in around 12:30. There was only 1 lamp in our room, in a corner, that you had to get out of bed to turn on or off. At this time I heard someone in the room above us walking around. I could hear every footsep as the floor/ceiling creaked. Also, when they flushed the toilet above, you could hear the water rushing thru the drain in our bathroom wall. About 2:30 am I was awoken by footsteps above me...about 10-12 trips back and forth and about 6 flushes of the toilet!! Also, a couple men having a brief conversation in the hallway outside my room...sounded like they were in our room!! About 5:30 am, more footsteps from above and more toilet flushing.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFor price, it is a 5 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "Beau_and_Monique", "ReviewID": "UR31156202", "Content": "My wife and I have stayed in many hotels but the price you pay for the Hollywood City Inn, it is perfect given location. I am not sure why you would want to pay mega $$$ for a hotel unless you plan to stay in it most of the time. We found our room to be a nice size, clean and the maids cleaned every day. The guy at the help desk was very helpful and friendly, he helped us with buses etc. Free internet at the help desk. Continental breakfast - danish's, very sugary cereals, tea / coffee etc. We did not use the pool but it looked clean. You can either bus or walk to the main attractions (i.e chinese theatre) however we chose to walk - would probably be 6ish blocks or a 15 minute walk. All the restaurants are in this area and we caught a cab 1 night and it cost about $15. If you like modern Japanese food, I would highly recommend the Geisha House. We also caught a cab to the Viper Room and Rainbow Bar and it cost about $20 one way. I caught a bus to the Getty one day which is relatively easy to do (2 connections - 40 minutes) and my wife caught a bus to the Market. My wife did the dearly departed tour and highly recommends it. The area is fine although it is a big city and like ALL big cities, I would not recommend walking too far at night time if you dont know the area, we found it fine although can't say we walked too much at night time because we were tired from day time activities. As other writers have said, it is right on the cusp of Thai Town and the curries there are top quality (also, places like Burger King are in the area too).

The bathroom is decent but the hot water is only average, 1 night i ended up with a very lukewarm bath. The wall are paperthin and you can hear everything that the next door neighbours are doing and saying, this kept us up quite a bit of the night we could hear everything they were saying and doing (if you get what i mean!) pretty disgusting really. The only reason we stay here is that its about 200 m from the bus stops and the train which is very handy to the city. Another good point is that they let you use the internet for about 15mins which is fantastic most places dont do this.

Whilst the accommodation was good, clean, tidy and serviced daily, we were disappointed with Hollywood itself which is a dump. All the trip advisor reports on LA say you need a car to get about, but we opted to make use of public transport (the underground system and buses) which we found excellent value and operated a frequent service. A day ticket is the best value. It takes about 30 mins to walk to the Hollywood sights (Hollywood&Highland Centre, Chinese Theatre) from Hollywood City Inn but quicker to get the underground which goes from just up the street from the Inn, 200 metres away. Eating out in the evenings within walking distance from the Inn was a mini-problem. There are stacks of Thai restaurants just along from the underground station - fine if you like Thai - but there wasn't much else available. We had a great steaks in the Saddle Ranch Chop House in West Hollywood. We got the bus to Santa Monica Beach (excellent breakfast at Jinky's cafe), hired bikes and rode from Santa Monica to Venice Beach, which was great fun. Also took the underground to Long Beach and to Downtown (El Pueblo worth a look, also Grand Central Market and the Walt Disney Concert Hall) The Farmers Market and The Grove great for shopping. Hollywood City Inn was a good base in a city where everything is so vast and spread out that it would be hard to pick one best location. Breakfast was included but all it comprised was an OK doughnut from a case and some filter coffee, tea or juice. Perhaps this is normal in the US though.

If you leave them alone they will leave you alone....... Sub-Way just a few hundred metres away taking you to Universal Studios (3 stops) Walk of fame (2 stops) , and at $5 for a day pass is considerably cheaper than paying a company to take you.

We didnt find the owners friendly and it appeared our questions were a chore to them (Even at check-in) As we were there 4 days we only encountered them a few times so this didnt cause much aggro. For the price Yes stay there , and use money you save on yourself in LA. Our savings went towards \"front of the Queue pass\" at universal (something I recommend...but thats another story) Pool was clean and spent some hours in it. Recommend the diner (turn left at subway , 100 yards) for your breakfasts. Caters for the locals and not ramped up prices. For Dinner at Sizzlers just another 300 yards further down the road in Thai town. 25 walk (uphill) to griffiths observatory. Downsides : On check out I asked to leave my bags in storage and women wanted to charge me $20 for 3 bags. After questioning this it immediately dropped to $15. Not sure why the charges as the bags dont eat anything.

She went on line and found us this \"deal\". I read the reviews and most of them were positive. We were leaving from central Calif and so I made sure we arrived before dark. The overall experience was pleasant. The staff were very nice. We had asked to stay close to the office since we were 2 women traveling alone. When we got there we were given a room in their 2nd newer building which is a little further from the office. They immediately change our room upon our request. The breakfast was cereal, coffee and pastries. The Metro is only 1 block north. That would probably be a great way to travel as long as you arrived back before dark-I wouldn't want to walk even that 1 block after dark. We went to see \"Wicked\" and arrived back at 11:30. We managed to squeeze into the last parking spot. A car arrived just after we did. I would not want to park on the street after dark for my car and my own safety. Perhaps they have some way of parking your car off site for you if this happens-it doesn't seem there are enough parking spaces if they are booked to capacity. The best things about this motel are the price, cleanliness, staff, beautiful roses around the pool and accessabilty of areas of interest and easy highway access. Early morning walks: both days I grabbed a Starbucks cappucino and went for a walk. I went south toward Sunset Blvd. I went about 0.5 miles. The further I went, the seedier it got with homeless and tagging etc. However, I went North on Western Ave and found the beautiful neighborhood of Los Feliz and enjoyed looking at the homes and gardens. As I further ventured north I found Griffith Park and walked in there. It was beautiful. It was hard to believe that in less than a mile you go from a seedy run down area to a beautiful neighborhood and park setting. So all in all, for the price, I probably would stay there again. It felt safe enough during the day to walk north and into the area called Thai Town. Again walking south down Western Ave and onto Sunset Blvd is a little sketchy and there really isn't anything to see that way.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cOk place to stay\u201d", "Author": "biting", "ReviewID": "UR16107345", "Content": "Ok place to stay.

The room was of a good size and was welcoming and clean which is the most important thing i look for in a hotel room. I disagre with some of the other comments made by previous guests. The room was cleaned throughly every day and we had new toiletries and towels everyday, when we asked for extra pillows they were more than happy to give us some. The staff were very friendly and one man in particular on reception was very helpful, when it came to needing local information. When we were there they even had new beds put in! so they are not hard anymore although i preferred the old ones! As a building it is a little dated and could do with a few repairs and its not in the nicest part of town but after a couple of days you get to know the area and start to feel more comfortable, still wouldn't walk around late at night but then i wouldn't do that in England either! Being a motel style if there is noise at night you will hear it as the walls are quite thin if you are a light sleeper but i found the noise of the other guests didn't go on that long when it was made i guess it depends on whose staying. Overall if you just need a basic place to stay then this would suit, if your used to luxury then i would look somewhere else!

So by the time we got there it was one in the morning. We called our roommates, but they had had a long day and did not wake up when we called, so my sister went to the front desk and asked the attendant for a key (we had proper documents and they were notified that we were coming) and he wouldn't give her a key because he said that he only has one key for every room. So, we just had to fend for ourselves. So by that time I had taken all of our luggage out and was waiting by the door to get in, but when my sister came out, she said he wouldn't give us a key so we just waited by the car and the door trying to wait for someone to come out of the doors to let us in. So we were just standing out there (two girls) in this part of town which looked dangerous with suspicious people walking around looking at us ( I wouldn't recommend walking in this area at night). We tried pulling on one of the doors of the entrance to the rooms, but it was locked. Then my sister went to the other entrance door and luckily it was opened and she went in and opened the other door where I was standing and we were able to get into the hallway were the rooms were located. So, we knocked on the door and our roommates were able to hear us and let us in, but they were half sleep. We were doing things the whole day and we were all extremely tired, so my sister and I went to sleep around 2am and were extremely tired. But by 3:30am, we heard a knock at our door. At first I thought it was next door or I had imagined it because we were all \"knocked out\" sleep. But the knocking kept occurring and I rose up and one of the other girls with us got out of bed and opened the door and immediately closed and locked it because she thought it was either me or my sister, but quickly realized that we were already there. Then this man started whispering \"let me in\", \"open the door\", and started making rhythmical knocks at the door. So my roommate yelled at him from behind the door to leave and he has the wrong room. Then it stopped and we all went back to sleep nervously. Then about 10 mins later, the knocking came back and he tried to open the door because I saw the door knob being turned and we all were very scared by now, so we called the front desk and the told the attendant what was happening and he said that he will take care of it. So we laid down again but the strange man kept talking and knocking at the door trying to open it for about 5+ minutes. We were so scared we didn't know what to do, but keep telling him to go away. But we were so tired we could think clearly like call the police. We weren't going to open the door and confront him so he could come inside our room, we didn't know if he was alone or not and it was just us girls; so we called the front desk again and my sister said \"please help us, the man is still at the door and is trying to come in!\" The attendant sounded annoyed and told her \"weren't you expecting him\" and of course she yelled \"of course not!! Why would we call you to help us, if we knew him!\", so the attendant said \"okay, I will take care of him, but don't call back. \" We were very annoyed by this and then my other roommate went to the door and said, \"if you don't leave, we will call the police!\" Then he stopped whispering and said \"Oh, sorry I thought this was Mike\" or something of that nature, but I am sure he had heard us clearly the first couple of times and then he left. But we were so scared, we didn't open the door to look if he was gone. That morning, we were still frighten to open the door to leave.
