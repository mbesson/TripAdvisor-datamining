{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Just perfect! A single room for 7,140 yen in Tokyo with private bathroom and a free breakfast is quite a deal! The hotel rooms are small but very well-designed, with TV, air conditioning, teapot, etc. The bed is elevated so there's room for your luggage underneath. Staff are very welcoming. Breakfast includes rice balls, miso soup, little pickles, tea, and coffee. There are several newspapers in the lobby, including one in English. There are a couple of computers in the lobby for guest use, so you can check your e-mail. There's also a small laundromat for guest use. It's about 5 blocks from the north exit of the Ikebukuro train station, and the neighborhood is safe although not glamorous or upscale. (Another reviewer warned that you should be prepared to climb stairs exiting the train station, and that's correct. However, it is possible to get from the station to the hotel without going up stairs--you have to exit the station at the south end through Metropolitan Plaza, which has an escalator to street level, and then you have to walk north along a narrow sidewalk, but it won't be easy to find your way.) I split my stay between two Toyoko Inn locations in the same neighborhood. The Toyoko Inn Ikebukuro Kita-guchi #2 (the address is 2-51-2 Ikebukuro) is a couple of blocks away from #1. The hotel, rooms, and rates are almost identical. #2 is a bigger hotel than #1 and therefore a bit impersonal. But both are good choices.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR393311156", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bargainhunter"}, {"Content": "great place though a little far from the station Everything was clean and immaculate.The front staff were very nice.It was raining the next morning after we arrived and they lent me an umbrella so that I could go to the convenience store.I have no complaints about the facilities or staff at all.The complementary breakfast is onigiri and miso soup.I will say the place is a bit far from the station and you have to climb one set of stairs to get to the North Exit so if you have heavy luggage, be careful.Also, you have to walk past some love hotels and other establishments like that, but no one bothers you so it wasn't a problem.It's a little annoying that you can't go to your room between 10 and 3 for cleaning but the staff let me run up upstairs to grab something I forgot. This is true of all Toyoko Inn's though.Excellent value for the price", "Date": "Sep 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR618013764", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "casuaa"}, {"Content": "Superclean and Supervalue I just stayed 2 nights in Toyoko Inn\u9225\u6a9a Ikebukuro branch in Tokyo. They have two hotels near Ikebukuro Station, and the newer hotel where I stayed just opened in September 2007, so everything was spanking new. Ikebukuro is a major commercial area with lots of shops and restaurants. Travelling to Narita is easy by train, or by limousine bus that stops in the Metropolitan Crowne Plaza Hotel adjacent to the station\u9225\u6a9a south west exit.The hotel is about 7 minutes walk from the station\u9225\u6a9a north west exit, and it is best to download a map from the hotel website when you make an online booking. Your credit card details are not required or debited at the time of booking, so they take your booking on trust.The Toyoko Inn is a low cost hotel chain but the hotel entrance and lobby had a smart presence of an almost 4**** quality hotel, well lit, and designed with good quality materials.Next to the lobby is the lounge/ breakfast room with free newspapers, vending machines, and free Internet computers including a colour printer. There are no sofas, only dining tables and chairs. Behind it is an alcove housing the guest laundry room with coin operated washing and drying machines. In the morning you get a free Japanese buffet breakfast of rice balls, soup, pickles and green tea or coffee. When you check in they give you a small complimentary gift: a choice from of a wallet, key chain or socks. Service was always very polite and with a smile. The rooms have complimentary toiletries that are re-stocked daily, Yukata bathrobe, air conditioning unit, flat screen TV with 2 DVD foreign language movie channels, magnifying make-up mirror, hair dryer, tea making facilities, trouser press machine, fridge and room safe. The rooms are not large but are adequate. The view out of my window was to a small courtyard, and not much to see, typical in Japan though. Also a few of the rooms do not have external windows, but like in a cruise ship\u9225\u6a9a inner cabins are fitted with artificially illuminated backlit windows. So if you need a view do ask for one.Everything in one\u9225\u6a9a wish list was provided here. Toyoko Inn have been very successful with their formula of value for money and are opening about 35 new hotels throughout Japan in 2008.", "Date": "Jan 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR887061575", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "walkmun"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d953289-r21258846-Toyoko_Inn_Ikebukuro_Kita_guchi_1-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "953289", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
