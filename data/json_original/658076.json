The room, indeed the whole premises, were very neat and clean.

Beds are comfortable but I think Hotel is little overpriced (Almost 55 E) if I see Location and transport. To get to City you have to take a Bus to Espanaya , bus station is 60 meters away from Hotel's reception. All Guys at reception carry some kind of attitude which sounds like Etap proprietery......They always keep on saying..\"This is ETAP....what are you expecting\" Hotel is not suitable if you are in BCN for more than 1 day and willing to see nightlife etc...it is better to take good hostal in city.

You'll find information stands in the station, so you can ask for help but unless your good with your spanish then you will need to be patient as english is spoken very little we found. Once you get to viladecans station we found the bus stop just outside which takes you to the bus stop by the hotel, advise the driver of the exact address, its a 5 min bus journey. On arriving at the check in desk we needed to show our passports which were scanned to be given to the police, you will need to sign the two copies of paper, your given your passports back. The room was very basic with big bed which sleeps another on the top bunk bed. rooms come with a shower and sink and toilet.. all worked fine. Tv didnt work but that wasnt a problem. You may want to take a towel as our cleaners didnt change them , they will come in and tidy the bed but thats it... maybe worth just doing your own bed and not having the hassle of someone in your room when your out. All in all its worth the money you pay. Right out side the hotel there is a bus stop, with buses to barcelona espanya staion every 15 mins at only 1.30 euros it takes 30 mins so its qucik and very very cheap. you can also on the return journey get the L81 Bus back to viladecans and that pretty much stops back at the Hotel.(night buses run every 20 mins to and from barcelona get the L14 or L16 Night bus) The metro and buses are much better then london, alot more frequent and all air conditioned. Very tourist friendly and expalining the journey route on all bus stops. Get a T10 card in the metro its 6 erous and you get to travel to any metro stop upto 10 times. a single to any metro costs 1.30 euros. Dont bother getting the Hotel breakfast its nasty and not very clean... save the money and wait till 12pm as the Mcdonalds which is next door to the hotel serves better food :) Hope the review helps.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cEtap - Basic & Inexpensive but out of the way\u201d", "Author": "MaryK7", "ReviewID": "UR7827631", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Etap Barcelona (in the industrial suburb of Viladecans) in early May for two nights. We arrived at the hotel late at night after a late flight to find they had lost our booking and we were very lucky they had a room at all. The staff member refused to look at my printed booking confirmation - consequently I was charged twice for the same room (I discovered this later on my credit card statement). I think language difficulties were the reason for this - we didn't speak Spanish and he spoke limited English (and didn't read English). The room though was very comfortable for the price, but basic. Very clean. You get a bunk bed type arrangement with a double bed below and a single bed on top. The ensuite bathroom is basic but new and clean. The hotel was evidently only completed very recently. There is also a TV in the room. Breakfast is an extra 9 euros from memory and is not worth it - croissants or bread with jam, coffee and juice only. Go next door to McDonalds and you'll get a hot breakfast for the same price. There are restaurants a two minute walk up the road and the bus stops almost right outside the hotel - it drops you off at Plaza Espanya in the Centre of Barcelona. The bus takes about 15-20 minutes. The train does not stop near to the hotel and the nearest station is a 20 minute walk from the information provided by them. I strongly suggest you write down the instructions for getting the bus yourself from the hotel info in the lobby. Just a warning, some taxi drivers didn't know where Viladecans was - we had one refuse to take us there. The other two used a GPS or got directions from other drivers to get us there! Overall, probably a good place to stay if you are on a tight budget or have a car, but it is out of the way and we probably spent the same as a hotel in the centre of town because we had to get taxis a few times to get back there.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Etap Barcelona Viladecans", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d658076-Reviews-Etap_Barcelona_Viladecans-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$51 - $59*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carretera de Barcelona, 82</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08840</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "658076", "ImgURL": ""}}
