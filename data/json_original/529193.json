This hotel was a little bit out of the way (public bus to the train station then approx 30 mins on the train into the city itself) but that suited us fine. There is free wifi at this hotel which seems to be very rare across Europe. Small bathrooms (typical for Italy), comfy beds, clean rooms. The breakfast was pretty impressive - probably one of the best I had during my 3 weeks travelling around Europe. Lovely outside dining area which was great for a relax and a few drinks in the evening after it had cooled down. The bar staff weren't that friendly, but the beer was cold!

When you want to eat, you can eat at piazza's (near by pantheon or other nice places) that's big money, because your paying \u20ac6,- euro for a Coca Cola and then the food maybe 15 euro's, but if you go by metro or bus to TRASVERTERE (They are the old streets of Rome) there you can eat very nice and it's is a lot cheeper than when you eat at any other place.

So if you want to do sightseeing but stay somewhere away from the hustle and bustle of central Rome, I would recommend this hotel. The hotel staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. When we first got to our room, the TV was not working. We contacted reception to try and fix the problem. They were unable to figure out the problem at the time, but the TV was fixed the next day while we were out. The hotel breakfasts were good. Directions - From Rome Termini train station, take underground line A and get off at Valle Aurelia. Then take the FR3 train to La Storta. Take a bus from outside La Storta train station to Via Cassia. Get off at the first bus stop after the bus has got on to Via Cassia. Then cross the road and take bus 201 towards the hotel. Get off the bus after 2 stops. When you get off the bus, you have to back-track a little to get to the hotel.

A little far from the city centre approximately 1hr 15min to Coliseum, but for the hotel price and convenient public transportation can't be fussy. From the La Storta FM3 station you can actually take any bus parked outside. Ask to stop at the first stop at Via Cassia. Then take bus no. 201 heading to the left direction. Look out for the hotel on your right. If you do not have your luggage, take the bus no.35 that stops at the train station and stops at the T-junction in front of the hotel. Whatever bus you decide to take, please ask the bus driver for help. They have been very helpful throughout our journey to and fro to city and hotel. Last bus is at 11.15pm. We LOVE our room! The housekeeper cleans it every day. We stayed in other hotels in Italy that only cleans every 3 days (don\u2019t understand why?!). Every day the shower caps, ample towel rolls are replenished in our room. Every room has a mini fridge. At first impression the hotel came across as noisy because it is on the main road. Surprisingly, it was quiet. The hotel shared the same land with an apartment, so we heard budgies singing every morning. This was a joy and we felt at home as we had our own budgies back home. There's a grocery shop and a fruit stall very nearby to pick up some food. Staff were friendly and competent. Especially Claudio who took the extra mile to help us with directions. He took out maps and knew when and which trains, subway and busses to take. Mafalda was friendly and we were blessed as during the conversation she informed us that the airport and train workers will be on strike the day we suppose to go to the airport. We woke up very early and made it to the airport before 9am. Thank you to Claudio and Mafalda for your help. The only complaint we had is the breakfast.
