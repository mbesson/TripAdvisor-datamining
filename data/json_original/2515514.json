The remodelling efforts at this property should go further. It is nice overall, but there are warts. We rented a mini van b/c we had 4 adults with large pieces of luggage carrying delicate equipment. When we pulled into the parking garage, we found that the ramps were too narrow to navigate. We ended up using the parking lot across the street, but it would have been nice to avoid the parking garage altogether.

My only caution is to be REALLY careful when you come out of the garage - the upper level & lower level egress merges into a single very narrow exit and you don't realize that another car is at your immediate right until its almost too late. Just exit very slowly - there is also a sidewalk right at the exit. The rooms were fine for me - ask for a 'odd' number room - all of them are facing the city. The pipes make that odd gurgle, which made me think something was about to come up out of the tub - a little disturbing - but that was the only noise that caused any concern - no neighbor/thin wall issues. Skip the restaurant - so many awesome places within a few blocks walking. If you need a cab to get somewhere, plan on about a 15 min wait - the front desk has to call one for you.

Usually, the Hilton name, regardless of the type of brand that falls under their umbrella means you will have a quality stay. This is not the case with this property. I have never heard such dreadful sounds come out of pipes all night long. The sound was so loud, even when the bathroom door was shut it woke me up no less than 6-7 times throughout the night. Three nights in a row. I had read previous posts about this but I had also read positive posts that never mentioned it so I thought I would give them a try. Afterall, it is a Hilton property, how bad could it be? The walls are so thin you can hear the conversations in the room next to you. Not just noise...but the actual conversation. This past weekend the hotel was pretty full so you couldn't switch rooms. The guests on one side of me were out for a good part of the night and when they got back to their room, they stayed up talking. Not partying, just talking. You should be allowed to talk in your room, afterall you paid for it, right? I had to ask them several times to stop at 3am, 4am and 5am because I needed my sleep. This took place three nights in a row. I never left a hotel so tired. The decor is average, the lobby is very modern and the shuttle service was just ok. I asked for a 6am ride to the airport the night before and I was told they would be ready at 6am for me. It was actually 6:15 when they were ready. You may want to allow yourself a little extra time. The shuttle drivers were very friendly and apologized for not being ready at 6am. The property had a dining area and a gift shop as well as a pool and jacuzzi. All were very good.

Staff - the staff were friendly and helpful. The cookies were quite the treat. The Okay Location - on the outskirts of downtown San Diego - it is a 15 minute walk into the Gaslamp District. However, you do walk by some seedier parts of downtown to get to the Gaslamp, so in the evening, we ended up taking a cab back to the hotel rather than walking. Parking Garage - as most people have already pointed out, the garage has extremely tight turns. I drive a Toyota Prius, so it wasn't as big a problem. However, I am not sure how people with larger cars, SUV's, trucks, etc. can get around those tight corners. Also, parking is expensive at $22/night, although you do get in and out privileges. Bathroom - there was something weird going on with the plumbing, because whenever you used the sink, the drain in the bathtub would start making funny noises. The hotel is clearly older, although they have done well to refurbish the decor of the rooms. Bad Thin Walls - we were awoken at 2am in the morning (and my wife was kept awake for the next hour or two) by (a) people in the hallway coming back from a night of drinking, (b) our neighbor's alarm clock going off for 30 minutes, (c) our neighbor watching TV at God-awful volumes, (d) our neighbors having a drunken argument, and (e) someone in the next room vomiting.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for families\u201d", "Author": "nkcanada", "ReviewID": "UR125808722", "Content": "Stayed one night in the hotel located 10 minutes from the airport while passing through.

The bathroom featured a jacuzzi tub with a shower head looming over the tub - it didn't look safe and showering was awkward at best. There was one small sink and for a large bathroom, it could have been two sinks or a larger sink for the space. There was one bathrobe in the closet and there should have been two. There was no refrigerator, but we made a call to the front desk and one was brought up. My son had brought his Xbox to play games in the evenings. The TV uses a closed circuit which means we had to hack the TV in order for him to get a channel to play on and he couldn't connect to XBox Live because the internet service has not been set up for game play. If you bring a DVD player with you when you travel, you also would not be able to play DVDs on the flat screen TV unless you know how to hack it. We did call an engineer in and he was pretty useless. We knew more about what was going on than he did. My son was extremely disappointed, to say the least. It appears that the hotel expects you to pay for movies and does everything to discourage anyone who brings in their own equipment for entertainment. The parking garage is a bit stressful to drive in, the passageways are quite narrow and if you are driving anything larger than a sub-compact, be extremely careful. I am not sure if the structure meets code. We swam in the pool and used the jacuzzi (located on the fifth floor). Both were clean and in good working order. The room was extremely noisy due to the HVAC system. We were kept awake by the air conditioning system from the room next to us. My husband and I aren't used to a lot of ambient noise at night, so it doesn't take much to keep us up. Some people might not have been bothered by it. We ate in the restaurant (located off the lobby) one evening. Prices were reasonable for a hotel restaurant in the $10 to $15 range for entrees. Food was decent, but nothing worth raves. My husband ordered a burger. My son ordered a chicken sandwich. I had a fresh beet salad. The fresh beets came from a can and the walnuts overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients, but the portion size was large. Service was uneven. Our water was filled regularly, but the food service was slow - especially since the room was less than half-full. The actual location of the hotel was unremarkable. There are no restaurants or shopping close by and we had to drive to the convention center due to the distance. Last time I had attended a conference here, I had stayed at the Hilton next door to the Convention Center and it was a better choice, but that Hilton was a lot more expensive for a suite. For a two room - king size bed and sofa bed, it was $242 per night plus an additional $20 for parking our rental car. There was no breakfast included, although you can get fresh cookies daily and a US Today.

I'm in town quite a bit for work, but it was my first time at this hotel. A few things I noted: 1. Make sure you request a parking pass!! While checking in, I inadvertently forgot to mention I had a car (and was never asked). When I went to my car in the morning, there was a sign saying I didn't display a pass and my car would be towed if I didn't move it. When I ran to the desk requesting a pass they seemed like 'oh well, here's a pass.' There is no sign stating you need a pass, and I assumed you needed your key card to exit the lot but this isn't needed....They just come around and look for parking passes - so make sure you get one. 2. I stayed in 1703, which had a connecting door. Whatever you do, DON'T take this room. Can't say whether it was this specific room or whether all rooms in the hotel are like this but I could hear every breath the guy in the next room took. In fact, while laying one bed at night I found myself laughing at a joke that was on his TV! The connecting doors are paper thin and I don't think he was overly loud because I could hear every sniffle he took. Overall, it was a typical Doubletree. Staff was pleasant, but didn't go overboard and the room was clean.

In my opinion this hotel is definitely a mixed bag: Some aspects were great while others weren\u2019t. Rooms: Our room was large enough and had been recently renovated. It featured 40\u201d flat panel televisions, new furniture, and a new bathroom vanity. In most respects it felt like a modern hotel. That modern feel did not, however, extend to the bathtub or the doors. The doors were not replaced or painted during the renovation\u2014they looked as though they were 20 years old, as did the bathtub. Personnel: Every staff member that we encountered was friendly and helpful\u2014especially in the restaurant. Each time we had a question or special request we were more than satisfied by the kind attention we received. Restaurant: This hotel has one restaurant which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Unlike most of our other trips we ate breakfast and dinner on site. The breakfast buffet, which featured all the usual fare, was competitively priced when compared to other San Diego hotels. Dinners were priced closer to traditional hotel pricing (a poor value). Our only complaint regarding the restaurant concerned the lighting in the high-ceiling areas. Those fixtures used cheap fluorescent lights which gave me a headache and reduced the visual appeal of their food. The booth seating, under an overhang, had incandescent light fixtures\u2014without the headache. Lastly, other reviewers have commented on the narrowness of the parking garage. Although I was skeptical I now believe them. The minivan we rented barely fit on the ramps between floors, and the parking spots themselves were narrower than the ramps. Making this situation worse were the reserved parking spots for hotel staff. It seemed that the widest and easiest to access spots on every floor of the garage were reserved for the hotel\u2019s employees or managers.

The hotel is located close to the airport and Little Italy but a bit removed from the convention center area. That wasn't a huge deal since a taxi to the conference was only $8.00. Got a room on the 19th floor which had a gorgeous view of the harbor. However, the hotel was inconsistent in a number of ways. First, the Internet service was really, really poor. As it turns out, you had to ask the front desk for the \"upgraded\" service for it to be useful for anything but basic email. No one ever told me this nor was any in-room information provided in this regard. Asked them to open up the bandwidth for me and was told they'd do so, but never got anything faster than 0.4 Mbps. I had a number of hours available before the conference started each day but could not get much work done due to the painfully slow connection speeds. Next, the plumbing in this facility was very strange. Anytime an adjoining room (or room above you) used their sink, shower or toilet, my plumbing made loud gurgling noises for about five minutes afterwards. Does this even meet local building codes? I have stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms and this was a first. Speaking of adjoining rooms, the privacy between rooms was non-existant. Honestly, I could hear every single word being spoken on the phone by the person in the next room. This was creepy and definitely is something that the hotel needs to fix and do so soon. The person next to me was obviously staying there by herself. I can't imagine what else I might have heard in other circumstances! The location was acceptable. The room was clean.

We enjoy walking, and found that we could walk to Balboa Park and the Zoo in about a half hour (North on 1st Street, turn right on Laurel which turns into El Prado, and there you are.) Our room was bright, large, and spotlessly clean. The staff member that checked us in fulfilled our request to have the best view available (see attached photos). The balcony was really a bonus and we used it frequently. Housekeeping staff were pleasant and responsive. The room was always clean and made up before we returned in the afternoon. The plumbing does make some strange, and sometimes loud, sounds, but we found that if we kept the bathroom door shut, it didn't bother us. Some of the wood furniture is older but not in bad shape. Chairs were new and comfortable. We had a new flat screen tv. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. We didn't have any problems with noise although the other rooms around us were occupied. We didn't find this neighborhood to be creepy, and felt comfortable walking around at night because so many people were out walking or eating at sidewalk cafes. The hotel staff were mostly very outgoing and helpful. The hotel van driver that came for us at the airport was very informative and oriented us to the neighborhood on the way to the hotel. We did not use the parking garage so i cannot comment on that aspect. We got an excellent rate for our stay and feel that we got a great deal for our money.

There was a water feature in the lobby, which I rather liked. The restaurant and bar areas also felt very updated and were nice. The rooms were basic: clean, comfortable, and okay. A really nice bonus was the balcony and spectacular view of the skyline and water.

The hotel is 4-years young but the building is quiet old. Rooms are spacious and clean, furniture is old and basic, beds are ok but the mattress was moving, old model TV with good choice of channels. No mini-bar or safe in the room. No special attention to HH diamond members. Even complementary water is delivered only on request. One good thing was complimentary in-room Wi-Fi had good and unlimited connection to laptops and smart phones. I couldn\u2019t notice anything interesting, exciting or useful next to the hotel except a 24-hour bail bond office. After 10 -20 min boring walk, you can reach Westfield Horton Plaza Shopping Mall, Gas Lamp quarter and the harbor drive. Taxies drivers are reluctant to drive you there or back since it's too short distance to drive. American breakfast is served In the lobby restaurant. If you are lucky and if the waiter is in good mood and if the machine is working, you may get a cappuccino. Otherwise its only American coffee! The friendly and nice lady hanging around the lobby area (?PR manager / sorry I forgot to ask the name) was quiet helpful and tried to convince me that its one of the finest hotels in San Diego!

The room is nice enough, like most hotel rooms, too bad they don't have flat screen TV, and there were not towel racks in the bathroom. The hotel is very close to Little Italy, that we walked to have dinner, then breakfast the next morning (after our fire alarm incident). It's about a mile to the GasLamp area, we walked over there, but took taxi back to the hotel.

This side of the building included noise from the airport and the Highway. Although loud, was tolerable. The room itself was standard DoubleTree, although the room wasn't visually dirty, walking on the carpet my feet felt dirty. I did like the fact that the coffee maker was outside of the bathroom on it's own table. The room did have an older tube TV and not a flatscreen (not a big deal - it's a tv) We did use the pool two days. They had towels available for pool use and the bartender was there both days. The second day we went out the chairs were all being used so didn't get to lay around. Previous posters comments on the parking. We drove a full size Yukon and the only issue was in exiting the underground garage. We had to pull up and back twice to get it lined up to exit as it was a 90 degree tight turn. Other than that parking is typical for an older underground parking garage. The location was close enough that we walked to Little Italy and down to the water front. The GasLamp district was too far to walk for me. Unless you want to eat at the hotel restaurant Little Italy is the closest place. I believe this hotel is used primarily for airline employees for overnight stays as I constantly saw them coming in and out.

This is my first stay in San Diego. I did some research, read some alarming reviews about the noises, still, I decided to book here because of the location. First of all, the CSR that I called to book the hotel had some attitude problem when I made a request such as upgrading from double twins bed to king bed and etc. Then I was told to enroll in HH account which she gave me an account number but later I found out that the account isn't active so I would get no credit for my stay. Needless to say that CSR was a [--] with an attitude problem. When I came to the hotel, I got my room and everything was ok. The noise from the AC isn't that bad, it does sound like somebody opens your door when it turns on. Anyway, another problem with this hotel is the attitude of the waiters at the Ariana restaurant. The waiters expect you to tip them for everything, even \"take out / togo\" orders. They seem to think that they get paid for standing there and doing nothing. If they have to ring up your order, you are expected to give them a BIG TIP, $2 for togo tip isn't good enough. They won't even look at you the next time they see you if you don't give them TIPs. How pathetic. I don't really understand how the waiters expect to get tip for bringing food from the kitchen to outside doing no extra service that deserving of tip. This attitude problem from the waiters has to change. Especially, the food from the hotel is so horrible and expensive. For the same price, you can go out and buy the same food at half price that the hotel charges. Another thing about this hotel is the narrow parking garage. It is literally NARROW so watch out your speed and make sure you drive very slow in there. The room overall is decent, NOT super clean or new., just standard. Overall I would give a C = 3 stars for everything about this hotel. However, they charges a little over price I believe they charge the price of a 4-star hotel when they are only about 3-star hotel.

The asking price (rack rate) was $209, which seems excessive to me given the location and facilities of this hotel. The Priceline rate was considerably less and made for a good value stay. So, if you can get a discount, this would be a good place to stay. The hotel has been recently redecorated and the guest rooms are attractively furnished as are the bathrooms. Beds have comfortable pillow-top mattresses. A small observation: the in-room coffee maker is unlike any other I have seen in hotel rooms, and I liked it. I generally avoid using hotel coffee makers because the brown liquid that they dispense is not worth drinking, at least not for my tastes. But this is not the case at the Doubletree; the Wolfgang Puck-branded coffee and the unique style coffee maker made for a decent cup of coffee. I had read about the noise problem here on Tripadvisor, so I requested, and was given, a room facing south, away from the airport & highway. Noise was not an issue for us. We particularly liked the balcony. It is rare to have an urban hotel room with windows that open let alone a balcony. This balcony was greatly appreciated and added value to my stay. In-room Wi-Fi access is free to guests. As others have noted, they will provide you with warm cookies at check-in, and they will be happy to give you additional cookies on other nights if it appears that they will have \"extras\". The location is on the outskirts of downtown, which may not appeal to some travelers, but I came to prefer this location because it made the hotel more accessible. On the weekend, I was able to park on the street and avoid the $20/night garage fee. This might not have been possible at a downtown property. It's a subtle point, but It seems fair to say that the Doubletree has hotel facilities but with an easy \"motel-style\" access. I got over my initial apprehension about not being in the downtown core, and came to prefer this peripheral location in the \"Little Italy\" neighborhood. It was interesting to read a previous poster's comment about the mechanical noise made by the air conditioning sytem when it turns on or off - we experienced the same noise, and it was indeed annoying.

The hotel still needs to invest in modern windows and patio doors to provide the quiet and peace one would expect of a hotel in this price range. The interior decor of the room was pleasant, but there are some basic maintenance issues that are still in dire need of attention, namely plumbing and electrical. The diverter in the shower was so bad that you had to wrench the handle to stop the flow of water. Even then, the water would start to drip after a while. I'm sure the city of San Diego doesn't appreciate the wasted water. There were two light fixtures that did not work and one outlet that wouldn't work either.

From the planes taking off every few minutes to the sirens on the highway those things can't be changed I understand. However the noise from the pipes is horrible and wakes you up every time someone sends water down the sink from a room on top of yours. There is no ventilation in the bathroom so those of us staying with someone have to well..avoid the restroom for a while after the oner person goes. Then there is the hotel shuttle back-up noise. You can hear it on the 16th floor even!!! Every time one of their many shuttles backs up. Also for 3 hours from midnight to 3 AM someones alarm clock would not shut off. We complained to the front desk and they really seemed like they could care less; especially since it took them 15 rings to pick up the phone! They said they would send security by but there wasn't alot they could do. I tried to sleep with a pillow covering my ears. Today they are moving us to a room on the other side of the hotel. (Upon my request) I will keep you updated. Also the pool has been closed since yesterday. The nice thing about the hotel is that it is close to little Italy. I highly reccommend Cafe Zuccherro a couple blocks down from the hotel. They have the best lasagna I have ever had... also an incredible bakery inside. (and I am a chef back home) Like everyone says the beds are very comfortable; however if you can't get to sleep because of the noise... what's the point!!!! Book your room somewhere else.

I think they were refurbished as they were more modern looking than those pictured on this site; everything felt new and the fixtures and fittings were of a high standard. The beds were remarkably comfortable - my wife insisted I take pictures of the pillow labels so we could buy the same make on our return home! We found the service to be generally good, although it did not seem to be possible to get help with the bags (nobody turned up on both the occasions we requested help). The car park is a very tight squeeze to exit if you have a large vehicle (we were driving a Ford Expedition and just managed to get out). The bar and restaurant lacked atmosphere, although were good enough for a final drink before bedtime. There are plenty of good restaurants around and about, however, so this isn't a problem. There are a couple of stores within a 5 minute walk (down towards the sea front) along with coffee shops and a variety of restaurants (sushi, Italian, Delis, etc). You can hear the freeway clearly at night, although this was compensated by the great view of the airport, freeway and harbour. Although we live in a rural location and normally have no traffic noise at home this wasn't a bother at all. In summary, we found the Doubletree a very comfortable hotel.
