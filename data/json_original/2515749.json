Clean sheets and warm water (after running the shower for a literal 5 minutes if not more). Kitchenette was adequate. Shampoo is available upon request complimentary, but bring some scissors because the packages were super difficult to open even with dry hands! They have one computer in the lobby for public use, but beware the charge for printing. About a 15-minute drive from a Westfield Mall with fast food (Chipotle, Pei-Wei) and movie theatres. Cons: Cold water drips as you shower that come from cracks in the ceiling. After 3 people showered, a ballooned pocket of water collected behind the paint and I could see that thing popping at any moment. We reported this to the hotel, so hopefully, it got fixed. The particular room had a very difficult shower faucet because to get more than a trickle from it, you had to attempt to tear the thing out before the normal amount of water came out. We did however, forget to mention that the bathroom fan was broken, so be careful going in after someone just had a bowel movement. Free-Internet connection was super slow. Prepare to pay $0.25 per page that is printed, even though there is no sign posted anywhere about it and they only told us about it after we had printed. Parking spaces are very tight and be careful backing out because there is little room. The only person who seemed conscious of customer service was the woman working there. The two men we met generally ignored your presence until they felt ready to help you, they spoke in condascending tones, and barely answered your questions (as if it was an inconvenience for them). They never made eye contact or spoke directly to you, which comes off as rude. Regular check-out was 11:00am. We asked for late check-out and they told us we should be out by 11:30. Breakfast room only had space for 3 small tables and they closed the door right at 9:30 (instead of just not replenishing food past the time and letting people trickle in last minute as I have seen done at other places). Randoms: It generally looks like they installed nice things at one point, but then never updated them or took care of the rooms since.

The building and elevator were decrepit. In my shower stall was a half melted bar of soap to which some unknown person's body hair was attached. I could feel every single spring in the worn out mattress. And a guest in the next room seemed engaged continuously, and for hours on end, in a very loud and confrontational telephone conversation about either a domestic situation, or perhaps it was a drug deal. The noisy air conditioner in my room helped to drown out this unwanted sound. But I still had a poor night's sleep and was only too happy to leave in the morning.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix", "Title": "\u201c1 time only\u201d", "Author": "PhoenixMomx2", "ReviewID": "UR31091661", "Content": "We stayed here due to the rate and ratings that we found online.

Trick is, the buy now feature is a default and you may be making non-cancellable reservations without realizing it. If you are careful and alert, it may be okay to use the on-line booking but if you mess up and need to change it can be a real hassle. Impossible, really. We stayed for 2 nights and other family stayed for 3. They arrived a day ahead and got a room facing the freeway which was loud and the hot water didn't work. They were given a key to go into someone else's room (we figure it was maybe the manager's?) to take a shower the first night and ended up asking for a different room the second night when we arrived. Their reservations, and ours, were switched to the rooms facing the pool. These rooms are being renovated and we could tell that they are trying really hard to make the rooms nice. It looks, however, like they are climbing an awfully steep hill, figuratively speaking, so there are still a lot of rough edges, like unfinished tile work, lack of spacers in the cabinets and nothing in the way of extras like shampoo, conditioner or moisturizer. The towels are pretty small and an inferior quality and they are not big on giving many washclothes. They did have a hair dryer and an iron. The ironing board felt new (the underside looked new and had a smooth action to it) but the cover had a hole in it. The bed was clean and comfortable and the TV was fine. My husband thought the fridge was loud but we rarely sleep that close to one so I think that might be perfectly normal. The heater was really hard to regulate and couldn't seem to find a comfortable warmth and would easily get the room way too warm. I had no trouble with the hot water in the shower but he had it fluctuate quite a bit for him. I thought the continental breakfast was very generous with lots of pastries, cereal and juice. They also have a waffle maker so you can make your own waffle but someone was using that when I was there so I can't report on if they actually tasted good. The only problem with breakfast is that it is not available until 7 am which is not good for an early morning flight. The pool looks small from certain angles and not so small from others but it was too cold when we were there to try it out. We did slip into the hot tub which was nice and warm and that really did do a lot to make for a pleasant evening. This is not a bad property but still needs a lot of work. Seems safe and clean enough so I would definitely would say it would be okay if you are on a serious budget AND it is the best location for what you want.

Easy access to I-8 will get you everywhere in the city. PARKING Ample free parking. DESK/CHECK-IN The staff is efficient and friendly. Our reservation, made on the Day's Inn website, was correct on price and room type. ROOM Described as a suite, it is a reasonable size bedroom with attached kitchen. The kitchen has full-size refrigerator, stove and sink plus a microwave. There are plenty of cupboards, all empty - bring your own pans and dishes. The bath is normal size, with plenty of storage and a nice tub/shower. Carpet and tile flooring appear to be newer. Bed and bath linens were all clean and in good condition. Matresses were very comfortable - firm, but not hard. Each bed had 3 pillows of varying firmness. Furniture is older with some wear, but good enough. Ample closet space. Iron and ironing board provided. 25\" color TV with lots of cable channels. HEAT-A/C Unit was quiet and digital control kept the room at an even temperature. HOUSEKEEPING Room was very clean on arrival and during our 5-night stay. When the bathroom light burned out, a maintenance man arrived 10 minutes after we reported it. POOL Weather was too cool to try it, but the pool area looked well-maintained. NEIGHBORHOOD The street is almost entirely apartments and condos, so the hotel is quiet in front. There is noticeable traffic noise from the interstate at the back, less so on the sides. Nicolosi's Italian Restaurant next door is very good. Dinners are $12-20, with sandwiches and pizza also available. About a mile north on Waring Road is an Albertson\"s supermarket, and also a couple of strip malls. BREAKFAST Free continental breakfast is served in the lobby until 10 AM. Pastries, toast, cold cereal, coffee, juice, milk, and sometimes fresh fruit - that's it. CONCLUSION This place is not fancy. It is clean, comfortable and respectable. It is not in the center of San Diego, but if you are driving all over the city to tourist attractions it doesn't really matter where you start from.

Some of them were worse than the others. But this time I just had to write a review because I want to let others know about our experience. The receptionist at this hotel seemed to have mood swings so one moment she was very nice and helpful and the next she was rude and unfriendly. She was probably acting nice when the managers were around. We stayed at this hotel for one night. We made a reservation over the phone and when we arrived we asked the receptionist if we can see the room before we take it and she rudely replied: \"We don't do that.\" I wanted to see the room to make sure that the streets and the highway surrounding it were not too loud for me to sleep. But now we had to stay there or else we would be charged a cancellation fee. And if she nicely explained this to us, we would understand. Two other women waited to talk to her and she was also kind of rude to them. The room turned out to be nice and the cars were suprisingly not too loud. The room was clean and everything seemed fine, but it was not as nice as the rooms on the photographs. In the morning, at like 9:02 AM we called to see until what time breakfast was served, and the same girl answered and said: \"Until now.\" So we searched for their hotel directory and found out that it was served until 10 AM. We went downstairs and she seemed like she didn't want to deal with us, but she was being friendly to some other customers. So I complained that she told us that the breakfast was over, but it was still being served, and she just said something like: \"Well ... go eat it, you can eat it now.\" I would completely understand if she nicely said: \"I am sorry, but the breakfast is over at 9.\" And even if she made a mistake, she could have at least apologised. So I wrote a letter describing what happened with the receptionist and sent it to the manager of the hotel. I hope that he received it. As I said, hotel receptionists should make guests feel welcome. Their job is to handle guests' requests during their stay. What I felt at this hotel was that the receptionist just did not care and was unwilling to do anything to help us or to make us feel welcome.

Sort of a weird way to do non-smoking rooms, but whatever. The microwave did not work well. There was no rotating plate and I was afraid to use it. The sheets were clean, the blanket was pilled, and the bedspread had cigarrette holes in it, but they were very clean. The carpet was a little . . .odd . . . it felt funny under my feet, but it could be because it was old and the carpet pad had flattened out a lot. The air conditioner was very effective and very quiet. Didn't see any sign of mold, cockroaches or other vermin. In fact . . I know I keep saying this . .but everything was very very clean. The only glitch we encountered was that one day our room was not cleaned. When I called about this, I was informed that because we were staying for an entire week, they only cleaned your hotel room once. When I said, \"But they've cleaned it the last four days in a row,\" basically that was a bonus. If this policy is true, then I definitely would not stay in a place where they won't make your bed and keep it CLEAN no matter how long you stay there. But I asked them nicely to clean it the next day, and they did, and that was the last day we stayed there so it worked out. Everyone was very nice and accommodating, the staff is excellent. Because we booked early and were AAA members we got an excellent price: $593 for a seven-night stay. And yes that included taxes. We felt very safe in the room and the area. The room did start to get a little oppressive towards the end of our stay, because it was shabby, but the kids really enjoyed the cable TV during the evenings. We'd run around and wear ourselves out during the day, then come home and sleep, get up and fix breakfast and run out the door in the morning for a day of fun. The next time I go to San Diego I think I will stay at a hotel by the beach.

Not much to do, the shops are way up the hill so transport is needed, but you couldn't get here without a car. Most of the people seemed long term so they were interested in who I was. They let me hang out washing on the railing for drip dry stuff and had a good empty coin laundry on the upper floor. Felt very safe and suburban.

The front desk worker was rude when I went in to correct the issue. It took 4-5 days for the money issue to be corrected, which affected my vacation spending. The bathroom ceiling above the toilet was leaking in our room, as well (room # 128). They stated that coffee makers would be available upon request, when one was requested, they said they had none available, but would send one up eventually. They never did. They also never informed us that there was a coffee maker available in the front lobby if we wanted to use that one. We opened our door to accept a delivery, to find police officers a few doors down, dealing with someone, and they began to look us over for no reason. That same room was also getting loud visitors whom repeatedly came around banging on the persons door and causing a scene, yelling about calling the cops. We asked the front desk worker about getting a taxi to the nearest Denny's, and were sent 4-5 miles out of our way, to find that there was another establishment much closer than that one had been. Maid service was very inconsiderate and ill-timed. We decided to extend our stay at the last minute, the front desk worker tried to charge $10 extra from the originally quoted rate. On the last night we paid for, he told us in a very rude tone that there were no more nights available after that night, and that the rates would change anyway. He also would not agree to give us the reciept we had requested, after we asked him numerous times for one. He said it would be 2 pages, and when we said that was fine, we wanted it anyway, he said that it \"wasn't necessary\" and refused it flat out. On one of the nights we attempted to pay for an additional nights stay there, the front desk worker refused to make change, therefore sending us to walk roughly 2 miles up the road after midnight, to the nearest gas station, only to find it closed, as well as every other store in the area. After the first night of our stay, HBO was scrambled on the TV and did not come back for the entire time we stayed there. The continental breakfast was not what we expected, the coffee was cheap, the pastries tasted days old.

A number of rooms are suites of the extended-stay variety, and the property seems to atttract a number of work crews on jobs in the area. The pool areas are pretty decent. Access to rooms is awkward, unless you're fortunate enough to snatch one of the handful of parking spaces under the motel's first floor, which has direct access to an elevator. Otherwise, you must climb stairs, or else traipse around to the ground-level parking entrance to get to the elevator. Rooms were clean, fairly roomy and generally in good repair, but still had that cheap look about them. Local phone calls cost 40 cents, plus a nickel for every minute over 15, so Internet access can cost; high speed Internet access is only in the lobby through a kiosk. The weeknight price is good, with welcome-center coupon books offering a $49 rate for one bed; two beds was ten bucks more. Desk staff was friendly.
