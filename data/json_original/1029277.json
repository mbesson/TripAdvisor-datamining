{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very good location 1) the location - is prefect, 2 mins to a U-bahn stations connect you to 4 different U-bahn lines. There is a Canadian food place call Tim's cafe right down stair of the hotel, the breakfast there is super, big portion and not so expensive compare to the city center. The Indian food opposite the street is also very nice but very crowned on weekend evening. There is a supermarket opposite the train station which open on Sunday as well2) the hotel - the staff don't speak English and you need to pay on the day of arrival and althrough they mention they accept credit cards but they actually don't. You need to pay in cash so do bring along some cash.3) parking - the hotel do not have parking space, if you travel with your own car, you need to park at the P+R parking space at Innsbruck Platz U4 station which is only 5 stations away and is free.4) the room - is clean and we book a room with bath room which is very clean and tidy, do expect some noisy from the street as is a busy area but after mid night is pretty quiet and we can sleep ok. 5) check in and out, the front desk operate in scheduled time slot so do book in advance if you check in early or late.In general, we love the location and the hotel itself is kind of ok for just for a place to shower and sleep. The bed is too soft in fact and pollow as well but after one full day exploring the Berlin city, I can sleep on anything.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR496555727", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Bill1218"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1029277-r20677761-Hotel_Pension_Mishel-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "1029277", "Price": "$99"}}
