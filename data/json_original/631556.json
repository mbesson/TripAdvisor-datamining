To reach the hotel from Airport Tegel , even it isn\u00b4t far away, is a little bit difficult using 1 bus, 2 S-Bahn and 1 tram. If you have a heavy suitcase it is tiring. Reaching the city center is easy using tram (2 stops) and S Bahn. We made a prepayment via money transfer over a week earlier and they still wanted to charged us the room and only after our complain they started to look for the payment. If they ask for prepayment their accounting should be up to date. The hotel seems freshly renovated (except for the shaddy carpet in the hall way). Hope you like lilac and pink. ;) My single room was almost bigger then some of the double rooms. Unfortunately there wasn\u00b4t a door or even curtain to separate the bathroom and the toilet from the rest of the room. My room faced the back side and therefor no traffic noise. Since there aren\u00b4t many shop next to the hotel, the breakfast had a decent choice. The closest cash machine is at the petrol station on the other side of the street. Most of the visitors were either older people or families.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBasic and misleading\u201d", "Author": "acluca77", "ReviewID": "UR83647986", "Content": "Very basic...for the price you can get a private room great hostel in the center of town for half the cost and twice the experience.

Location is right next to a busy street which cause disturbing noise in most rooms if you are not used to it. Even if it is located in the northern part of Berlin it just takes 20 minutes with Tram and S-bahn to the city centre, and the station was just outside the hotel - perfect. If you come in a small group of max 5 persons you can buy a cheap group ticket for 16 EUR per day. The only rule is that you must travel together since you only have one ticket. Room was OK but not more. No warmth or cosiness, just your furniture and no more, not a place where you like to spend more time than necessary. One small closet for 4 persons is not enough, you have to live out of your suitcase which is OK for many people. Bathroom was clean and OK, nothing to complain about but not inviting. Good parking possibilities if you come by car, either locked parking space in the back yard or parking garage was available. Breakfast was included in price and gave a reasonable variety to choose from, something for everybody. In the evening there was complimentary tea/coffee on self-service or cold beverages at reasonable cost available in the reception area. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our only problem was that we had specifically asked for (via phone and mail) a room with only real beds and no sofa beds. This was agreed on phone and confirmed via mail but still it did not work. We mentioned this every day to the reception and each time they would find a solution for us but nothing really happened. Price was the same for rooms with sofa-beds but we feel that a confirmation in writing should be a solid agreement. No excuse for the mistake was given to us and no compensation at all. Still, Berlin-Pankow can be recommended for travelers to Berlin who seek a budget price accommodation and intend to spend more time in the city than in the hotel room.", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur", "Title": "\u201cIt was ok\u201d", "Author": "gemmmm", "ReviewID": "UR14597672", "Content": "Dealing with the hotel directly via email was virtually problem free and very efficient as I almost always got an immediate reply. I was promptly picked up at Tegel airport (well, my flight was a bit delayed) and I have to say it seemed like a rather long drive to the hotel. The location itself is not central but the tram station is literally right outside the door...only 2 stops to the S-Bahn and then you can hop on the train and head towards the city centre which really isn't that very far away. There is little else in the area. I noticed only a small bar down the road, an Irish one if I am not mistaken, a small pizza takeaway and a gas station across the road where you can buy some snacks, etc. Not all the staff speak English but most of them do. Service was pretty good, the staff all very friendly and helpful so certainly no complaints in this area. My room was small and basic but comfortable and sufficiently heated even when it was snowing outside. Breakfast was good enough and honestly for the price I paid, I think overall, it was very good value for money compared to what the other mainstream hotels were charging! My biggest dissatisfaction here was the shower which was incredibly tight. The location of the shower head and the faucet is bad to the point of it being dangerous. If you are facing the shower head, the faucet is on your left, about the height of your elbow. It is VERY VERY easy to hit the faucet when you're showering. If you hit it one way, you end up with freezing cold water (well, it was winter when I was there) but what's worse is if you hit it the other way, the water is literally scalding. Needless to say, I had to experience both scenarios several times. The water which felt like it was boiling hot (it could have been!) was not fun... So I'd just say be very careful. All-in-all, I'd say this hotel was ok and if I were on a budget, I would most likely stay here again.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, UK", "Title": "\u201cA confident recommendation\u201d", "Author": "amew1982", "ReviewID": "UR10036601", "Content": "Hotel Pankow was our first stop on a trip where my boyfriend and I stayed in Berlin, Dresden and Prague. And what a welcome place it was! We booked the airport pickup service that the hotel offered (40 Euros from Berlin Schonenfeld), so frin the moment Tobias picked us up, to the moment we left was a real pleasure. The late evening staff got us checked in smoothly, and we were taken up to our room (luggage was carried for us), a warm, spacious and comfortable twin bed as requested. We slept well, and the main road outside was no problem whatsoever. The curtains perhaps could have been a bit thicker. Breakfast every morning was a real treat, with fresh cold meats, cheese and breads, to yoghurt, museli and fruit washed down with delicious coffee. Transport from the hotel was second to none - there is a Tramline (S-Bahn) DIRECTLY OUTSIDE the hotel, where we hopped on and then jumped off at the Pankow Stop (NOT Pankow Heinersdorf), to transfer onto the U-Bahn (U2 line) which got us into the heart of Berlin.
