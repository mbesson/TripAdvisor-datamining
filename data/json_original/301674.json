However, we were offered bottles of water and a quiet seat in the business centre whilst our room was prepared. The staff could not have been more helpful. The room was a standard twin room - perfectly clean, well maintained and serviced every day. The bathroom was also very clean, with towels changed daily. The slight disappointment was the water pressure in the shower - a minor concern! Food in the 'StarsCafe' was excellent and very good value, considering Singapore is known to be expensive. Location good - hop on/off tour bus stopped right outside the hotel The one disappointment was breakfast - again, expensive and catered mainly for Asian tastes (as you would expect), but eggs, cereal, fruit and toast available.

I have stayed at the CK every two month for a couple of years, and I honestly don't recognise some of the complaints, but here's my penny's worth: 1. IMPORTANT: the difference between the rooms in the tower and in the main building (I think these are called deluxe) is massive. The rooms in the main building all have balconies, and are of a MUCH higher standard. So ensure you always book these. It is correct that the rooms can be noisy due to traffic, but not overwhelmingly so (and I am very fussy about this). 2. Check-in/out can be very slow. But I have always found staff to be courteous and helpful, and trying to accommodate special requests. 3. Bad, stale coffee? Cannot be. Coffees for breakfast are freshly brewed from an espresso machine. Otherwise, yes, breakfast could be better, but for an Asian palate it is actually very good, and plenty of options, egg station etc for the rest of us, too 4. Poor location? What? Just across the street from Singapore's coolest al fresco restaurant area Robertson's Quay. Much nicer, with much larger choice than any other area, and added bonus for solo travellers, as it isn't rowdy, and a great spot for people-watching. And 10 minutes walk from Chinatown, 5 mins from Great world City, a large shopping mall. OK, if you're into Orchard Road, you need a taxi, but not exactly a big hassle. Overall, I wouldn't swap CK for anything.

We wanted a base, somewhere to sleep and this served its purpose. When we booked we had the option of bed and breakfast but on reviewing the price we decided that it wasn't worth it as we had researched that plenty of coffee shops offered similar breakfasts at the fraction of the price. Our tour operator had informed them that we were on our honeymoon, arriving on the early flight we got to the hotel just after 8am. We thought being on our honeymoon they may have offered us an early checkin as a good will gesture. Checkin is normally 2pm. They could offer us our room but at a price for 70Sing Dollars excl. tax. Having established that we could keep our suitcases etc there we decided to decline to which then they informed us we could check in at 12mid-day. From research we found out that there was a bus stop near the hotel next door (Miramir). Here two hop-on-hop off buses stoped (at about 20 sing dollars), and the singapore airlines hop on hop off bus stopped (6 sing dollars if you flew with them - remember your boarding pass). At this bus stop the Singapore Zoo bus also stopped at 4 sing dollars each way, with this stop being the last stop (visit Singapore tourist informaiton for more details). The hotel is only about a 10minute walk to Chinatown and Clarke Quay so has good links to the city. Ignore the distances on the map as we were able (with a drink stop off :-) ) to walk from the Marina Bay Sands back to the hotel.

Although it was clean and tidy, the bathroom fittings were aging with some rusting around the edges. Overall though, this room was a base for us going out all day, every day so was fit for purpose. One annoyance, internet connection was stupidly expensive and per electrica item. for example, we had an ipad and two iphones and we would be charged three times for internet. We didn't bother in the end - wifi should be free! The location of the hotel is on the edge of Clarke Quay. If you leave the hotel and turn right on the foot path, you can take the road foot bridge and then follow the river upwards and you will walk straight past restaurants etc which is the start of Clarke Quay. Good way to get your bearings around the city. Next time we visit Singapore, we will spend more money and get a more central location as the MRT was a bit of a walk however the China Town MRT nearest the hotel hosts one of thefamous hawker centres.

The service provided during the stay was horrible...\u201d", "Author": "xtinakoh", "ReviewID": "UR114271507", "Content": "Made a reservation for their suite to celebrate my husband's birthday. Thought I've gotten a very good promotional rate but it turned out to be a complete night mare. First I would like to commend the reservation staff for their good service, but that's about it. Everything after the confirmation of my reservation was a complete nightmare. I checked in with my baby and husband on 17 jun. When we arrived at the main lobby, we were first \"welcomed\" by the bellman who treated us like we were invisible. We were carrying our baby and a few bags and were struggling -- no one came to our aid. We then went to check in at the front desk with our baby and was greeted so \"warmly\" by the front desk staff. No smiles, greetings, everything was mechanical. It felt worse then those automated check in at the airport. We were then given a room,1101, the agent did not even asked for our preference of the room. So I thought this was redundant since i had already specified that I want a baby cot and a non smoking room during my reservation and I was with my baby at the point of check in. We happily took the lift and got to the 11th floor. The first thing we noticed was the overwhelming stench of cigarette smell. I told myself, the smell's just in corridor, they wouldn't be so senseless to give us a smoking room. Guess what? There was an ash tray in the room! We immediately called for a change of room and was then transferred to 1201. What a waste of time and what a \"nice\" check in experience. We then asked for baby cot as it wasn't there as requested. After which, we ordered food to our room. The only saving for the stay was the room service. Service was prompt and food was good. When the room service staff delivered our food, we again asked for the cot and this time, a baby high chair. He told us he was not from the department in charge and don't know what to do. We then called the guest service agent and requested for a high chair, to which, they couldn't provide. To cut short the story, the baby cot came only after 1.5 hours and we even had the hotel staff calling to question if we had reserved for a baby cot in advance! Basically communication between departments was horrible and our request for the cot was not passed down from reservation to front office. There was even a front office staff who called to check if housekeeping had sent the cot up. Shouldn't they call the housekeeping instead of the guest? In the evening, we went out for dinner. When we got back, the carpark was full and we were directed out of the carpark. Valet service was only offered after I told the staff I was an in-house guest at the exit. Shouldn't they ask before directing the guest out? I know this is a minor issue, but combined with the check-in experience, it made everything worse. At the valet, since we had to carry up some stuffs to our room, the valet staff called for the bellman to come. This was something that impressed me as after everything I'd experienced, my expectation was rather low. It turned out that I had to be disappointed again. It took the bellman more than 20 mins just to send the baggage up which he could have followed us and send it up immediately. I wouldn't have expected much from a 2 to 3 star hotel, but from a 4 star? This is rather appalling. The last and worst encounter was at the breakfast. The staff who guided us to our table was unfriendly, no smiles and not even a simple \"good morning\". My husband queued to get a freshly made omelette, when it was his turn, the chef, Ms Nancy [--]\"greeted\" him with a \"YES!?\". When he said he wanted an omelette, she simply started cooking and seemed so unhappy to cook. Upon receiving his omelette, my husband thank the chef, but she just stared back and didn't even smile or gave a reply. What's worse came after this. A foreigner, who was behind my husband, asked for an omelette, she even asked him what would he like in his omelette, i.e. everything or just ham and tomatoes. Is there something with the hotel that discriminates against locals? My husband thought it was just him being too sensitive so he decided to give Chef Nancy[--] another chance. He went back to the counter to get another omelette for me. The same response was given. This time round, her tone was even more rude. And on top of that, when she was about to place the completed omelette on the plate, she put it on a wet plate! The top plate was dry and clean, but for some reason, she removed it and put the omelette on the plate below, which was wet. She could have at least dried it! Overall, the stay was a terrible one. It was supposed to be a birthday celebration, in the end, it turned out to be a disaster. Maybe it's because we were on a promotional rate or maybe the hotel only attends to business guests since this is branded as a business hotel. Whichever the case, the 4-star service should be reflected throughout and provided equally, even if it was a complimentary stay.

We refused to budge and were offered a 'better' room with balcony still a twin though and that we could move into the standard double the next night if we wanted - reluctantly we accepted. The room on entry seemed 'damp' to include the linen. Maybe this is just a Singapore thing with the high humidity. Thankfully the air con worked and within half an hour it was ok. The window to the balcony would only part open and then jammed - joy ! We decided it best to stay in the room for both nights for fear of worse.

When we at the relevant time asked for this (3 times) I was told this was not possible and that I wouldn't have been told this and I had misunderstood - only the swimming pool showers were an option, not the end of the world grant it but as it turned out with no air con and lots of kids splashing about in the changing rooms a 'hot and busy' experience ! CONS - as above and staff on the whole not very helpful or obliging with a Concierge that was hopeless at anything more complicated than hailing a taxi !

Staff at the Kings were excellent... very polite and accomodating to everything we requested and could not fault them at all in that area. The hotel and rooms were all clean, well lit and the air con was excellent which is a must when the outdoor temp is a constant 33 degrees and 75% humidity... even at 3.30am!?!?!?!?! Now whilst the size of our room - which was apparently the the biggest room before moving up to a suite - was not too bad, the bathroom was... well tiny! I'm 6 foot 4 and standing in the middle of the bathroom i could virtually touch both walls, and its in this space where there is a shower/bath, toilet and sink. Not the most comfortable of bathing experiences and I'm a stickler for a good shower before heading out on the town. The beds also got a red card from me as they were waaaaaaay too firm... Actually some of the boys in the traveling party resorted to sleeping on the couch as this was actually a hell of a lot softer than the beds which were probably a shade softer than concrete... I know some chiropractor somewhere is creaming themselves over the first firm bed in hotel history, but give me a soft and cushy sack anytime! And the single bed size wasn't peachy either... almost fell out of bed a number of times... Finally the location is a little bit of a remote one... whilst there are a few hotels in the immediate vicinity, there isn't actually any major MRT lines servicing the area and taxis are heavily relied upon to get you to the nearest station (we tended to use Orchard Road). Though in all fairness its not a massive taxi fare especially when splitting it in a group. Couple of tips if you do stay here... Use the showers in the gym change rooms... each stall is as big as the bathroom in a regular room... dunno if this is kosher with the hotel but hey... got my daily spacious shower fix there with no problems. And to get around rock a taxi out to 'Ion Orchard' and then walk next door to the main MRT station... shouldn't cost you any more than 5-8 Sing dollars per trip... you can try find a bus near the hotel but this way you don't build up a sweat in the sauna that is daytime Singapore. And to all the nightclub fans... look no further than Zouk... about a 5 minute stumble down the road.

My husband and I were relocating to Singapore from the US. His company told us that we were staying at the Copthorne King's hotel for 2 weeks. The reviews didn't seem great, but they seemed OK, so we weren't too worried. We checked in with no issues and went up to the room to wait for our luggage. We had 8 suitcases since we were moving here, so it took 2 people to bring them up. My husband was not in the room when they arrived and the 2 men who brought our luggage would not even acknowledge me. I asked questions and was completely ignored. They just dumped our luggage by the door and left me to move them. I was very upset at being treated this way. Then I had to move our luggage around. The room was quite small. It probably would have been fine if we had a normal amount of luggage, but it was almost impossible to fit our stuff and us in the room at the same time. The room was also very dirty. There were piles of dirt and dust in the corners, the carpet had burn marks, and the shower was moldy and full of mildew. The walls of our room were so thin that we were woken up at night by our neighbors phone ringing. We could hear when they received text messages and we could hear the very quiet music that they played in the hallway. It was horrible! There are no reasonably priced places to eat nearby - especially for breakfast. We ate breakfast at the hotel one morning and it was very good - but it cost us $52 for the 2 of us. Great World City mall is nearby and there is a good food court, but that's really the only option. There is a bus stop across the street, but there is no nearby MRT. My husband begged his company to move us and they would not, They called the hotel and they offered to move us to another room. We went to look at the room before we moved all our luggage, and while the carpet was newer, it was still dirty and while there was less mold and mildew in the bathroom, it still wasn't clean. So we didn't feel that it was worth it to move. When we tried to explain this to the man at the front desk, he just shrugged his shoulders. Eventually, enough high-ranking people at my husband's company yelled at the HR representative and they agreed to move us to the Swissotel The Stamford - which in comparision was heaven on earth.

We arrived at 0900 local time after a 12 hr overnight flight and directed to the Club floor for breakfast while our room was made ready as it was far too early to take instant occupancy. The hotel consists of a main building and a taller adjoining tower. They have managed to squeeze 5 rooms onto each floor of the tower resulting in a room that is barely suitable for a single person never mind a couple with 2 large suit cases. The rooms only have the tiniest single wardrobe with 5 hangers not even enough space to unpack anyway. There are also no drawers anywhere resulting in trying to live out of a case wedged between the wall and the bed. If returning, which we wouldn\u2019t, I would insist on a room in the main building. On the plus side, the breakfast, starting at 0530, is outstanding, and runs until 1030. I would not recommend the \u2018Connections\u2019 Hotel bar, if the sky high prices don\u2019t quickly drive you out, then the resident 5 piece local band certainly will. We were told by the concierge that our Singapore Airlines Boarding card gave us 50 percent discount on the open top bus tours around the city, this turned out to be false as we embarrassingly told after queuing for some time. Avoid the taxi drivers offering you a drive around town as they will take you via a local jewellery factory where you then subjected to the hard sell, very intimidating. China Town provides, by far, the best deals and quality goods and an excellent place to eat cheaply.

We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of February on our way out to Australia. We stayed in a room in the main towerblock, which seemed to be the main area for short stay guests. Frankly we were very disappointed. We were told that because we had requested a non-smoking room we could only have twin beds. Then when we reached the room we were amazed at its size. Not only was the space very limited, but the storage area was tiny too. The single wardrobe had no full length hanging space, and there were few drawers. There was nowhere to store cases so one had to be perched on the luggage cradle, causing an obstruction in passage to the bathroom, and the other had to be left on the floor at the end of a bed, filling the longest wallspace! As mentioned in another review, the bath is hilariously small, in fact I reckon it's an assault course shower cubicle! Away from the accommodation,our package included breakfast. It was OK, but I would not have chosen to eat there had I needed to pay, as it didn't represent good value for money in my opinion. The staff were very good. They were efficient, polite and obliging to most requests. A request to change the down pillow cases and quilts was dealt with in minutes, and the front desk staff were very happy to arrange a late checkout and changing facilities as we had an evening departure. It is a distance from the city centre, but the taxi to Orchard Rd is quite cheapand the walk to Clark'e Quay should not be a cause for complaint for anyone of reasonable health!

Service was much better than I expected, everyone spoke to me in a courteous and professional manner. There was a number of minor irritations but I was able to brush them off as I had plenty of positive experiences during my stay. For example, after settling into my room on the 17th floor in the Tower Wing, I discovered an ashtray. I don't believe I specified a nonsmoking room when I made the reservation or was given a choice. There was a strong smell of perfume while the fan was on, and when it was off, a smell of smoke was noticeable. I liked the room, an odd-shaped room with a nice view of the Furama hotel next door as well as a garden below. I had the fan on most of the time, and that seemed to blank out the smell of smoke so I didn't ask for a room change. The bathroom didn't have a normal-size bathtub but a half-tub with the back elevated so you could sit on it. It would have been nice to lie in the bathtub but the half-tub was not too bad. I ordered room service for breakfast, filling in the order and putting it outside the door before 3 am. The order was delivered on time but one egg was missing. I only discovered this after the waiter had gone. I didn't have to specify I wanted 2 eggs since that was what was on the menu. The hotel's location is not as inconvenient as some have suggested. It is a short walk to Great World City, which is a nice mall with plenty of shops and restaurants. It is right next to the Miramar hotel, which is a stop on the Hippotours. And it is across from Saiboo Street, where you can access the river leading to Clarke Quay. I booked the hotel a month ago and got a US99 rate on Expedia for Friday to Sunday.

Location wise, the hotel is well placed. Chinatown is a relatively short walk (even shorter taxi ride) although you won't walk anywhere quickly in the humid day time. Orchard Rd is also a walk away, although I would recommend using the hotel shuttle bus as, again, the humidity can be insufferable at times. You can also walk along the river towards Clark Quay where you can take boat trips. There are always taxis outside the hotel and they are inexpensive. Getting one back, however, may be more of a challenge - especially in the rush hour. My room was a very comfortable double with quite possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept it. There was a small fridge with Tiger beer and a few other snacks and drinks which, although expensive by Singapore standards, seemed quite cheap compared to a British hotel's prices. The TV didn't always have the best reception but there was a wide variety of channels broadcasting in English and usually I could find something reasonable to watch when channel hopping before going to sleep. There was also very reasonable storage space, lighting and mirrors. The room did feature a balcony, but it was usually too hot and humid to stay out there at all during the day, so really it's just an aesthetic feature. My room faced out to the back of the hotel which was fine for me on a high floor, but not so good for those lower down as the air con units outside were incredibly noisy. Other members of my party were facing out of the front which apparently suffered from traffic noise. The bathroom was prefectly acceptable with a good powerful shower over a bath tub. My only quibble with my room was that the carpet suffered from patches of condensation from the air con. I didn't bother raising this with housekeeping as I really didn't want to end up in a room nearer the aircon units or facing out front. Breakfast featured a very good variety of food from many different nations and you'd have been hard pushed not to find something you liked. The pancakes, made to order, were a real hit with our party, the chicken sausages were not. The coffee was extremely bitter but the tea was a superb brew. Breakfast was presided over by a rather matronly member of staff on the door who eyed up everyone as if they were blagging their way in. I didn't try any of the other restaurants, other than the cafe in the foyer when I wanted something quickly. To be honest there are so many superb places to eat in Singapore that are so much cheaper that you'd be mad to waste your money in a hotel restaurant other than for breakfast. There is a hotel shop but I would advise checking first for items in the shop attached to the petrol station next door (to the right of the hotel as you face out). Their prices are much, much lower. Bottles of water, for example, were a fraction of the price of the hotel shop ones. There's also a very reasonable shopping mall, complete with supermarket, just a 5 - 10 min walk away. Get directions from reception as you'd be unlikely to happen across it otherwise. The hotel has a pool, although it is pretty small. If you fancy a larger pool you can take a taxi very cheaply to The Delta Swimming Complex which has 3 large pools, one of them a dedicated children's pool, and costs very little - something like the equivalent of 60p. It only takes 5 or 10 mins in a taxi. One feature of the hotel which really appealed to us (being there for a few weeks) was the hotel's launderette for guest use. This was inexpensive and powder was provided - bargain! Makes a change from washing your clothes in the bath or having to use pricey laundry services. We initially used the hotel bar quite a lot in the evening but found the service slow, indeed sometimes reluctant. We eventually started going to a bar over the road by the river where the service was superior. There were good business facilities and we were on a deal which included broadband access in our rooms. However, if your deal does not include this it is pretty expensive and you would be better off taking your laptop to one of the many bars in town which offer access to customers. Please note, they take a tough line on people \"piggybacking\" onto other's internet access in Singapore - so make sure you use it legitimately. Generally speaking I was happy with this hotel and found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly.", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cNot bad at all...\u201d", "Author": "Rita07", "ReviewID": "UR11460272", "Content": "This hotel was good.

The bellmen were all extremely helpful and friendly. It is very easy to get a taxi by just walking out the front door, or by letting the bell captain know you need one. I thought this was very convenient. The closest MRT stop, Outram Park, is about a 25 minute walk from the hotel. It's just easier to take a cab. The pool on the third floor is really nice. There is also a hot tub and steam room, but both were not working at the time. There are three restaurants: one is a buffet (which was perpetually busy), one was a Chinese restaurant, and one was an extremely overpriced lobby restaurant serving \"western\" food.

But luckily the pillows and quilt were very comfy. Bathroom amenities were good, got toothbrush and body lotion. Weird shaped hair dryer that could induce one's imagination. There was a problem with the internet cable but was fixed accordingly. The internet charge was too expensive, 50 cents per minute. Called the front desk but not answered. No tea bags, snacks or electric kettle. No alarm clock. Carpet was clean. The opening and shutting of the connecting door outside drove me crazy. No Cinemax/HBO/Pay per movie.

We arrived early in the morning after a 13hr flight and were pleasantly surprised by the hotel - it exceeded our expectations. We were lucky to be allocated a room after a short wait - usually check-in is after 2pm. The 'first' room we were allocated had a double bed and a 'day bed'. It was nice and clean with a balcony with good views across the city. We asked for the bed to be made up for our 12yr old and went out to do some sight-seeing. Upon returning late in the evening, the 3rd bed was still not made up and after several calls to Reception, they admitted that they had given us the wrong room for 3 people, but would send up a roll-out bed (removing the day bed). As it was late and we were tired, we requested that we change room instead of having to move furniture around - they obliged and we went next door which was a 'family' room with 2 doubles. The room allocation error was our only glitch and the new room was very nice, clean and the beds lovely and comfy. Although we faced the front of the hotel, the rooms were very quiet and we heard no traffic noise at all. The hotel offers a buffet breakfast which we had the following morning. There was good array of breakfast fare including Asian and American style food. We opted to take the cheap and plentiful taxis out and about which worked for us. Although we did not eat main meals in the hotel, it offered a retaurant, bar (will live music) coffee shop, pool, gym etc. The Copthorne Kings in our opinion, is a clean well maintained hotel ideal for a short stay. It is a little out of the way, but taxis/transportation is cheap. If we were staying longer, I would have opted for a more central hotel.

We had the pool to ourselves and never saw anyone else use it which seemed a shame. The other problem which has previously been mentioned is its location. You are within walking distance of chinatown, so you can get to the MRT easy enough but its coming back. Its very very humid so by the time we left we were so glad to walk up the steps of the road bridge for the last time! The MRT IS 1000 times superior to the london underground. Its cheap, clean and fast. You never feel unsafe where ever you are. Taxis are cheap but you cant get one during rush hour and when we came from Sentosa island a taxi told us once in it was a fixed price. The price was about ten times more so we got out! Go for the metered ones. Its a good medium class hotel but only worth a few days stop. I would not have been happy to spend more time here.
