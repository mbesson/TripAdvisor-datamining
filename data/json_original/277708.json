Design hotel and rooms are also nicely designed and functional in use. Great element is the free mini bar. Even though only non alcoholic, it provides a feel good moment to grab your drink. Rooms are noisy but I am afraid that European hotels are just not built with proper isolation. Fitness club is on the fourth floor. Not big but enough equipment and also here free bottles of water and towels. The staff is friendly, Christina at the breakfast was very nice. Recommendtion is that the staff can be a little bit more extrovert and pro-active. Food is not great but there are enough restaurants in the area. Area by the way is quiet, no much to do an lots of offices.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cMy second home ... and a nice one\u201d", "Author": "lcorre", "ReviewID": "UR120544888", "Content": "If you go to Madrid like me for business reasons, you'll like this hotel.

As a place to stay when coming to Madrid on business, or for those who are happy to use public transport to get around, it can't be beaten. There are a couple of downsides for the business traveller that you need to consider. Firstly, I was told that there was no iron anywhere in the hotel (except for the laundry service), which was a little inconvenient. Secondly, the wired internet (didn't try wireless) was OK for web surfing but the virtual private network wouldn't function. However, overall a great stay and great value.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "CGC81", "ReviewID": "UR84522544", "Content": "Excellent hotel, I always book it when I go to Madrid.

We could not get the directions at first (google maps aren't that accurate), but this hotel is pretty easy to find. Come out of the Guzman El Bueno station (towards Los Vascos) and look for the closest traffic signal. At the cross roads, you can find a Jamon corner and flower shop. Take the right turn into the street, and walk for approx 300meters. Hotel will be at your left hand side. Now, the hotel did not look very impressive at the first look. However, the check in was done in less than 5minutes, and the room key was handed immediately. Very effective indeed. Internet is free in the lobby, and in the room (i could browse thro my laptop but not iphone). Room was clean, bathroom was neat and clean. Free minibar, and very comfortable room. Breakfast is basic but then sufficient. There is just one lady working there, and she was friendly. I would recommend sitting outside for breakfast. It was very peaceful there. One point though, the exit of Los Vascos street at Guzman El Bueno station closes at 940pm. Which means, you have to come out of another exit and find you way to the hotel (which is hardly another 300 meter walk). It was a bit tough on us coz we arrived at almost 1am from plaza Sol (which was still active at that time), and the street near Los Vascos was literally empty with very few people around. A gentleman was kind enough to help us find the way to Los Vascos street, even though he was totally drunk. The sorrounding area shuts down by 10pm, which makes one feel unsafe. But all in all, we loved staying at this hotel and would definitely recommend staying there.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ecuador", "Title": "\u201cIts too cheap for being so good!
