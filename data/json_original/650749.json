The staff was very helpful in providing us information to use the tram to get into the city center and how to return to the hotel. They do not have a great command of English but the desire to communicate existed. Took care to ensure we knew to pay attention for pick pockets on the tram (no incidents for us). We had room 207 and did not find it to be too noisy even though it was close to a busy intersection with many ambulances passing by due to close proximity of a hospital. Walking to right from the hotel will take you down to a street with many shops. First appearance of the neighbourhood had me questioning the decision to stay at the hotel but it was perfectly acceptable and I would stay there again.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but an Italian Basil Fawlty on reception!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Linda S", "ReviewID": "UR118414389", "Content": "We booked this hotel as we planned, as a foursome, to sightsee in Rome. The hotel had no parking so a bit difficult but we managed. It looks nothing from the outside, set back off the street. But once inside it is very clean and nice, and when we were shown to our rooms we were very pleasantly surprised. The room is quite large, very clean, nice bedding and towels, changed daily. However, several things left a lot to be desired. I had read several reviews previous to booking in, about how nice the Austrian lady owner is, and the staff etc. Unfortunately the nice Austrian lady owner was nowhere to be seen, and we just had a surly unhelpful elderly man, who wouldn't even lift his head in the morning to say hello. He was not at all helpful, and didn't put himself out at all....even to the point of NOT OPENING THE BAR. The little bar was there alright, but in darkness. Not once in the 5 days we were there did he open it. The breakfast was very meagre, rolls, jam and sweet croissant. Served by a very nice polite ?Thai lady, who couldn't do enough for us. We could have done with a mini-bar in the room due to not being able to have a drink in the hotel. So apart from the lack of mini-bar, Basil Fawlty on reception, and no bar to have a drink in, the stay was quite good. Not sure I would stay there again though.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cClean Tidy\u201d", "Author": "MinicoopMelbourne", "ReviewID": "UR117839971", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in august ..

Hotel Monteverde is a very clean and basic hotel, reasonable rates, friendly service, wifi, tv, and close to the tram, just cross the street, and you're there. The tram takes you to the center of Rome (a very short ride), where you can easily walk to the Colisseum and Piazza Venezia, or take the buses to the these places as well as to the Vatican. Very easy to get around in Rome with buses and trams. Hotels in the center of Rome charge much more, so it's worth it to stay at Hotel Monteverde. Very safe and clean area. Hotel has no pool, and no parking. Parking is on the street - just like the romans do. Breakfast is very basic - rolls with butter and jam, packaged croissants, and coffee and excellent cappucino.. Rome is an amazing city, with lots to do and discover. Will stay there again - staff is very nice and friendly.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cNice clean comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "birdieboys", "ReviewID": "UR84633981", "Content": "We were sent here upon the recommedation of a local. The hotel is small, quiet, clean and in a true Roman area.
