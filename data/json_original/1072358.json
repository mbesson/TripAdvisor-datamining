In front of sim lim, and 10 mins walk to Bugis MRT station. 10 mins may seem far but you'll be passing through the shopping district ( bugis st, and bugis junction) so the walk isn't really so bad.

I went down to the Front Desk and asked to have our room cleaned. After a few minutes, they sent someone who swept and cleaned our room. So, I give them points for service. Plus, every time we asked our room to be tidied, it was always done well. No repeat incidences of uncleanliness.) - safe negatives: - the room is small but it will do if you are out all day and then just need a room to sleep in it during the night (if i may add, not as small as I expected it to be though) - the room was dirty when we checked in (but it was alright during the next few days of our stay) - only provided 1 bottled water although our booking was good for 2 adults - no cable television - but it does have a dvd player the lowdown: This hotel is great for the budget traveler who wants a more private accommodation than a backpacker inn. It meets the basic necessities but doesn't have anything more special to offer. My experience was a pleasant one. I would stay in this hotel again.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Value.\u201d", "Author": "EricF32655", "ReviewID": "UR107358203", "Content": "Hotel 81 Rochor is a decent budget hogged. However, it doesn't charge budget prices. We were very disappointed with what we got for $80 USD a night. We requested windows and got a room without windows. The other guests were extremely loud - slamming doors in the hallways at 1am and bizarre things like that. The hotel did nothing about it. The room lacked furniture, so we couldn't unpack. Housekeeping short-sheeted the beds several times and we had to ask for proper sheets. The ones they used barely fit the bed - which was uncomfortable. WiFi was good seed, but booted us out after three minutes of inactivity. Overall, not what we would expect for the money. At $40 less a night, it might have been a decent deal.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chennai (Madras), India", "Title": "\u201cBest Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "cabalaji97", "ReviewID": "UR106459663", "Content": "I think this hotel is the best place for value for money. You have complete peace with walking distance from the market. Even though the hotel is small, it is good for those who stay for short time say one to 2 days. You have manu restaurants for food nearby areas with a lot of variety and hence no food in the hotel makes very less difference.

As you step out of the elevator you have the sudden feeling of being stuck inside of Wonderland with Alice. The poorly decorated tiled hallways did little to hide the fact that the floor was slanted and upon entering the room you felt like you had suddenly grown to four times your size. Yes it was that little. The rooms are tiny and offer very little. Sure there is a TV and DVD player but apart from that the decor is very below standard. The bed felt like I was sleeping on a giant leather bound book, it was that uncomfortable and slippery. We even had to make our own bed as the sheets had not been placed on the bed properly. They didn't even fit on the bed. The bathroom was the worst. The shower consisted of a shower head protruding from the wall in such a fashion that you could actually sit on the toilet and shower at the same time, actually a part of me is still convinced that that is what was intended. Water ended up everywhere, soaking the entire bathroom. Even the windows were covered in a strange green sheet and they couldn't be opened at all. Letting sunlight in the room gave the effect of being in the Emerald City in the Land of Oz. Very strange hotel. Would not recommend for anyone wanting a good night's sleep.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "jakarta", "Title": "\u201cgood budget\u201d", "Author": "kambing99", "ReviewID": "UR17617254", "Content": "great hotel, cheap enough, been stay in this hotel twice, once in standard once in superior.

Aircon works OK, bathroom abit small but good and clean. Location is very good close to everywhere, particularly closed to simlim for IT shopping and bugis.
