The bed was standing at an angle, air conditioning?What air conditioning?- the parking surcharge is ridiculous if you take into account that they say parking is provided in the street but do not tell you what happens on nights that the street get washed.It may be on the banks of the river but there are hardly any restaurants close by and the staff do not tell you much about getting the bus to downtown.

So my boyfriend and i hauled our suitecases the rest of the way...thank goodness i had printed out a map, or i would have been even MORE pissed off.Once we found the hotel, the older gentleman at the desk helped us, with little to no personality. Our room was VERY basic...a bed, a desk, a lamp, a small TV, a phone that didnt work, a window with a mini balcony, and an OLD A/C unit that was loud and didnt blow out very cold air. We stuck it out...the front desk did make us reservations at a fabulous restaurant. The hotel is a good 25-35 min walk into the main city, but we enjoyed the walk, and stopped at a few stores on the way.

The shower cubicle had mould on the tiles and the toilet bowl was badly stained. One of the bedside lamps did not work, the refrigeration unit in the mini bar did not work, the bedroom floor was dusty and dirty and the edge of the balcony floor was crumbling away. The hotel did not have a fire escape. The breakfast, which was served in a dingy and rather smelly basement room, was very poor. There was very little choice of food and the one tray of meat and cheese was sweating in direct sunlight. The coffee and water for tea was almost cold and there were small flies crawling on the buffet table.
