The person working at reception tried to further plunge the toilet but made it worse and flooded the floor even more. Had to bring in a handyman to fix the problem instead of being offered another room (apparently there were none) and was told it'll have to be 'acceptable' as he cannot do anything about it. I will be speaking with the manager tomorrow regarding a refund on my stay as this is GARBAGE. -Dingy looking place from the outside, old television set.

The hotel is next to two hospitals so you can get ambulance noise, but it's not too bad. There are a couple of fast-food joints nearby which are walkable. Room: A decent size, with enough space for us and two suitcases. There is also a small fridge and a coffee maker. The bathroom is also a decent size. Note, there was no lift so we had to take our suitcases up the stairs... please bear this in mind when booking this motel. Cleanliness: Room and bathroom was nice and clean.

I really liked how the blankets weren't floral, which is so cheesy. The room had basic amenities as listed (microwave, fridge, hairdryer, toiletries, heater/AC), and they all functioned well. The room was average in size, and had a closet room that housed luggage as well. The sleep quality was good, although I heard a couple of sirens go past midnight with the hotel being near 3 hospitals. Otherwise, I think my room location contributed to less noise heard (2nd floor, \"away from the streets\"). Proximity from main attractions: Located about 12 minutes from Hollywood Boulevard, the hotel is pretty central if you'd like to explore the Hollywood area. It was about 30 minutes from downtown LA, 45 mins. to Disneyland, and 15 minutes to Universal Studios. It was near the freeway, so it was very easy to get to the main attractions. I suggest getting their Travelodge map, which listed directions on how to get to the main attractions; this was so helpful! Breakfast: The breakfast was basic---fruits, packaged bakery goods, cereal, toast, coffee, juice. It was open from 6:30 to 9:30 am. Customer service: The service was okay, but I would've liked a friendlier greeting from the front desk. The staff were polite, otherwise. Parking: Parking was our biggest concern since it got full after returning from a long day. Although we were able to find a spot every night, I'd say that we just got lucky. Overall: They also had a pool, but it was awkwardly located in the middle of the parking lot. The value was great for a basic hotel and I would definitely go back as I found no major problems.

The first room we were given was a smoking room but when we complained, they didn't have any other king sized rooms, so we got a queen sized room instead. However, this room wasn't even ready and the bed was unmade. When I complained again that this room was also unacceptable, the man at the reception desk just shrugged and tried to fob me off by saying that this was the busiest Travelodge in the USA! What hotel doesn't have their rooms made up by 5pm?!! The next room they gave us had wheelchair access and a wet room so we took this one as at least it had been made up and was non smoking. The room was quite big and had a fridge and a safe, which was good. However, the room looked like it could do with a good clean. The remote control for the TV was disgusting and we put it inside a clear plastic bag to use it, as we didn't fancy touching it! We also had a couple of 'visitors' in our room. There was a small cockraoch in the bathroom (we made sure he didn't return!) and I also had a few itchy red spots on my arms which I can only put down to bed bugs. Unsurprisingly, we didn't fancy the free breakfast in this hotel, so we went to Starbucks each morning. If you turn left outside of the hotel and walk for about 10 minutes, there is a Starbucks on the opposite side of the road. A little further on is a row of restaurants on the same side of the street as the hotel. This is useful to know if you get there late and don't know where to go for dinner. We found a really nice Italian restaurant here. We left the car in the hotel car park and used the Metro to get around. The nearest Metro station (Vermont/Sunset) was a short walk away and it was a very cheap and convenient way to travel. There is a hospital nearby and we did get disturbed at night by the noise of the sirens. Check out time is 11am and we were just about to load the car with our luggage when a man from the reception desk rang up and asked it we were staying another night as we hadn't checked out yet. Fair enough if it was well beyond the check out time but this was at 11:02am! Overall, this is a budget hotel and you get what you pay for.

We visited Vegas, and then drove from there to Los Angeles, California, and spent 4 days here. After rigorous researching as always for hotel rooms, we decided to go with this one. The price is extremely descent and the location is Great! with this being said, the rooms are average, I am not a complainer, I am very flexible, but I do have these 4 points that bothered me: 1- THE NOISE!!! i have never slept in a more noisy hotel room before!!!! noises woke me up every single day!!!! there was people up super early in the morning hammering stuff, like working on construction or something! it was horrible! when it wasn't the noise of this, it was some other super loud noise, I don't know what's up with this place, but there had to be some loud noise waking us up super early in the morning every day and that did really set me off!! I have stayed at hotels right next to airports before and not even there the noise has been this horrible!!! 2- THE TUB CLOGGED: Ok, so we came back from sunset strip and decided to swing by the hotel room and change outfits and freshen up for a bit, I wanted to take a shower, and after a minute of two of being in the shower i noticed that the water was not draining away, the drain was clogged or something for some weird reason cause the day before we showered with no problem, but for some reason, the second day the tub clogged and it was disgusting to be standing in the tub trying to shower with all this dirty disgusting water stuck not draining out! UGH! i was sooo annoyed!!! the next morning we mentioned the incident to the guy in the reception, and they fixed it immediately! Kudos for that!! 3- THE \"FREE PARKING\"....Yes, it does have free parking, but their parking space is tiny!! and so it gets full soon and easily, and if that's the case your screwed! you gotta go around the block and try and find where to park next to some houses! it was a huge pain in the neck for us, as we went partying every night, and every night when we came back to the hotel at about 2 am or so, all the parking spaces were full, so we had to go around the block, cold, tired, and me still tipsy (he drove) and try to find parking. This same process happened EVERY DAY! pretty annoying and inconvenient! 4- SCARE OUTLETS: I have never stayed at a place with so little outlets!! are you kidding me!! we had to pretty much disconnect everything in that room to be able to free the outlets to connect all our crap! we almost had to even unplug the tv to be able to plug our laptop! it was pretty ridiculous, not a major situation, but if you are like us, who travel with lop top, and two digital cameras which batteries need to be recharged, and cellphones which need to be charge and blow drier and hair straightener, then you are in little of a pickle like us! I rather not write bad reviews if i can help it, but I had to mention these things!...now, with all the bad things already mentioned, the place was very clean, they have a super comfortable bed I think california king cause the thing was HUGE!, We inspected for bedbugs and found none, the whole time we were there we didn't find any trace of them, and it's been already 2 weeks since we came back home and apparently we didn't bring any unwanted visitors with us, so I think it is safe to say the place is free of bedbugs, or well, at least the room we stayed at. They also offer: Free breakfast, Free Internet, Excellent location and Excellent room service! I AM DEF. STAYING HERE AGAIN IF I EVER GO BACK TO L.A.

On the down side...it is very close to a major hospital so sirens can be heard at all times of night. There do seem to be alot of homeless people in the area but they do not bother or hassel you. The breakfast included is poor. Don't let it fool you that it's something special. There is a Starbucks etc. just across the road though.

We knew going into it that it would be a no frills motel that would serve as a place to sleep after long days of sight-seeing and a place for a nice hot shower. It is definitely nothing fancy and what we termed \"bare bones\" - a term that my 7 year old learned on the trip. But it was fine for us and our needs. We wanted to spend our money elsewhere. The location was good - it was a 1/2 block from a Metro stop so that was a plus. And it was an easy drive to Griffith Park - which is literally down the street and up the hill. We were not bothered by the sounds from the hospital across the street. The area isn't the greatest and I wouldn't have walked around at night, but further down the road toward the park you could tell the area was getting a little nicer and had trendier restaurants. The continental breakfast was nothing fancy, but it offered two kinds of cereal, fresh fruit, toast, prepackaged muffins, coffee and juice. What impressed me was that there was a worker who's one and only job was refilling the breakfast items. My experience has been that everything is put out early and if you arrive later in the morning chances are you won't get anything. This wasn't the case, as the worker constantly restocked everything, even right up until the very end. We also enjoyed the free internet service available in the lobby. Granted only 10 minutes were free, but that's all we needed to check directions or print out tickets. We did have to pay $1.00 per print out, which I thought was a bit much. As for cons, our beds didn't have blankets on them when we arrived, even though it was after the check-in time and about 5:00 p.m. Housecleaning did come by with fresh blankets before I had a chance to call the desk, though, so that was nice. Otherwise the showers were hot, we enjoyed the fridge and the microwave available to us. The parking lot did get crowded at night, but that comes with staying over the weekend. One disappointment was that the pool was empty. It had been advertised I thought as a heated pool and we had been hoping to use it. But we got a great price on the room, had a free breakfast and it was in a good location so we couldn't complain. The front desk staff were also nice.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice room and breakfast, but exterior factors let it down.\u201d", "Author": "jk80", "ReviewID": "UR119360921", "Content": "Stayed there for a week at beginning of October based on price, good location, and mostly positive reviews. The room was fine, a little small, but fine TV, reasonable bed, bathroom and shower fine. Also had fridge. safe and microwave. Breakfast also absolutely fine, ie what I'd expect for the price, fruit, cereals, toast, coffee, pastries, served for a decent length of time. Service also fine, when we arrived we were offered advice on where to go etc, plus when we complained about noisy people outside our room late one night, the night clerk promptly came up and asked them to keep it down, so all fine. The main issues were to do with the location, and the general sorts of problems you get with hotels of this design. We're always struck by how quickly American streets can go from nice to dodgy in a very small distance and this neighbour hood is no different. Hotel premises, fine and well lit, but as soon as you walk out you've got homeless people all over the place, Thai \"massage\" etc, but then also other nice hotels and reasonable premises too. It's not really Travelodge's fault, but we weren't often keen on going for a stroll around in the evening. That said, there are a number of places to eat nearby, mostly junk though. The second problem is to do with the motel style design of the hotel, ie all of the room's doors opening to a central, open area. It meant that the noise of sirens from the nearby hospital, general car noise, and the noise of some inconsiderate fellow guests often disturbed us, especially in the evenings. None of this would have been so bad if not for the two-inch gap under our door! Even after trying to block it with coats, noise and often, smoke, from outside would come in, and this wasn't terribly pleasant. Again, not 100% the hotel's fault, but not something you'd get with interior corridors and a better door. I don't know if all of the doors had this gap. That said, I'd still recommend the place as it was economical, in a very useful location for getting to things by car or Metro, and the breakfasts were fine.

No elevator and few stairways mean that lugging bags upstairs is a necessary chore. They also cut off breakfast way too early on weekends. But the breakfast is free and relatively nutritious (i.e., not just a prepackaged sugary danish as in similar motels). Coffee is horrible--next time I'll bring my own. I'm from LA, so I don't find the neighborhood as sketchy as some others do. It is down the block from some large hospital complexes, so not particularly isolated. It is also within an easy walk of great LA restaurant/lounges like the Dresden (see the movie \"Swingers\" if you don't know it.)

I waited 3 hours and still nobody came. i could not use the restroom as there was a female friend there and the door would not close u8nless i pushed it and the door know was very loose as i put it on myself without a screw driver. That night after a long day when i came back to hotel around 2am i stopped at front desk as there was no parking. the old guy behind desk was asleep on the lobby sofa. i banged on window for 10 minutes and he finally woke up and told me to park down the street. The next day i went to desk and complained about the door and remote and about 2 hours later they finally came to fix it and told them about thwe desk clerk. they laughed. i wanted to speak to manager and was told no he does not have time for me that he was doing more important things.

Even although when I booked this hotel 6 months prior to my stay & advised them of my contact number and of my 11pm arrival this made no difference, as when we arrived (at 11pm) we were told by this rude man that he had cancelled our room because he thought that we were a no show and that he didn't phone me because the hotel didn't phone international numbers - he cancelled our room at 7pm. The room was still available but would cost $150 extra for our 3 night stay on top of the money he had already charged to my credit card meant that I was paying over double the price I had orginally booked.. He told us to leave if we didn't agree to pay the new amount and didn't care that we were two females and didn't have anywhere to stay or were familiar with the area he just stood there shouting and bawling and waving his hands saying her didn't care & not his mistake. No amount of reasoning with this man was possible. I called the Travelodge Central Reservation number but to be told by the agent that he had not released the room available and could not make a reservation and advised us to take the room for the night. As we were truly exhausted and scared of what to do, where to go etc we had to agree to his terms. However the next day we spoke to the Manager and only because I had my original paperwork he agreed to the rate that I had booked. During my duration there I saw the staff being unhelpful to others too. They were all rude including the Manager. The hotel was good for transport but not a nice area to walk around. The rooms were basic, cleaned daily and had a fridge. The breakfast was quite good but had only 3 tables to sit at.
