We absolutely loved it! I was unsure after reading some of the reviews but have traveled extensively all over the world so was game to try this one. The room was clean and the beds were wonderful...soft and fluffy. The bath was across the hall but I've stayed in places in Europe, such as the canal houses in Amsterdam, that also had shared baths. The bath was clean. The staff was cordial and talked at length about the hotel, answering our many questions. We had tea and the delicious squash bread in the tea room next to the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed reading the journal entries written by other travelers who read the book. Of course, we added our own entry. There was a wealth of history in the photos and items in the tea room and it was great to browse and look at it all. One morning we had breakfast listening to a pianist, a woman who came in off the street to use the piano. She played beautifully and it was wonderful to sit and listen to her while we had tea. We were disappointed we did not get to see the baths in the basement as the owner was away. We definitely will stay there again and are hoping the owner will be present so we can get to the basement on the next visit.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellingham, Washington", "Title": "\u201cSo, so disgusting.\u201d", "Author": "c g", "ReviewID": "UR121009752", "Content": "Ok.

Was in Seattle on business. Talk about steeped in history! This place feels, oozes, drips, looks and smells it. The Panama Hotel was built by a Japanese entrepreneur in 1910 and I loved that I was in same place as the Japanese immigrants, Alaskan fisherman and workers who had landed in Seattle to make a better life for themselves and their families. I am Japanese American and had heard about the hotel before the book came out (and no, I have not read, \"Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet\"). I regret that I did not have time to get a tour of the Japanese Bathhouse which I hear is not to miss. I LOVED my free continental breakfast (fabulous almond croissant and awesome coffee - and by chance met a 90 year old Nisei - second generation Japanese American - woman who lives nearby who came in for coffee on the way to her hairdresser. We had a wonderful time chatting, she had a razor sharp memory of her early years in Seattle, her family was shipped off to the Minidoka internment camp during WWII) in the adjacent Tea & Coffee House. The owner, Jan Johnson, took the time to talk to me about the hotel and to make sure my stay was memorable. I was in Room 118 across from the womens' bathroom (with an ancient brass sign on the door, \"Ladies' Bathroom\") with a clawfoot tub in it. There is a shower two doors down. The hotel was QUIET, the linens FIRST CLASS GORGEOUS, the bed to die for. There is a little sink in the corner of the room. The built-in wardrobe and chest of drawers added to the feel. There was even a yukata (cotton Japanese robe) hanging on the side of the wardrobe I felt compelled to wear. To get to the actual hotel you have to climb two sets of straight up steep stairs - no elevator, so be prepared. It's awesome, nothing like that introduction to let you know you're in for something special. The clerks at the top of the stairs are sitting at a makeshift table to sign you in. They can help lug up luggage if you need. The clerks were friendly. I did ask about a hair dryer and was told there wasn't one but found out later from Jan that there is one available to guests. Not a big deal. I thorougly enjoyed my stay, wish it were longer.

My son sat down and the springs sank nearly to the ground and the bed leaned sideways. Then I went to lock the door and the lock fell out, so I went back to tell the \"check in person\" that this was just not going to work at all. He then called the owner and showed us to a room with a bed that I thought could work for 2 days. That night the \"woman\" in the room above seemed to be doing alot of repititious \"entertaining\" on one of those spring mattresses that actually was hitting the floor above our heads all night. And the room next to us left a light on all night long that shined right into our window and assisted the woman above in keeping me up all night. I had a pillow over my sons ears!!!! I checked out FIRST THING in the morning and stayed at a hotel far outside of town since there weren't any available high time in town.

I traveled with my mother, and we are always looking for different, unique places to stay. If you want the usual very prim and neat hotel, this is not the place for you. If you enjoy heritage and history and are willing to sacrifice a few things for the time you are staying in Seattle, book a room here! In the rooms, there is antique furniture and just a sink. If you need a washroom, there is a full washroom just down the hall from your room. I never encountered anyone while using the washroom, so there was no need to rush. There was a claw-foot tub, which I loved. There are no elevators there, with it being a heritage building. However, the hotel is only 3 levels high, so it shouldn't be a problem as long as you are mobile and able to climb a few flights of stair. The staff are very friendly, and I have maintained a friendship with the owner, Jan. I never experienced any paranormal activity while I stayed there, but I wish I had! besides the occasional creak in the floor from someone walking to the washroom, it was very quiet. One of the best things about this hotel is the cafe downstairs. They have jars and jars of loose-leaf tea, and their baked good are to die for. If they have sweet cheese croissants, buy as many as you can! There are historic photos for you to look at while you wait, and a pane of glass on the floor to look into the basement to see articles of clothing and furniture they found when they converted it to a hotel.

Based on other reviews it seems i maybe more flexible than others who have stayed overnight at the Panama. What i like about it is how real and safe the place feels. Each room has a real antique wooden Vanity, real wool and down blankets, real old mirrors, real windows, real beds, and really great prices considering it in the middle of downtown and cost 1/3 a night the price of surrounding hotels. without the awful pine-sol or cherry cleanser smells. without gray 90's furniture, without b.s framed ambient artwork similar to whats found in fast food restaurants. Bathrooms are shared but i never encountered anyone during my stay. When i stay at a hotel I'm there to enjoy the surroundings during the day, and sleep there at night. Why vacation to watch TV in the rooms right? I stay there every time i visit. PLUS the coffee downstairs is worth it!! WORD OF WARNING!!!! It is a 3 story hotel, and all three floors are haunted by Japanese ghosts. i have experienced there presence first hand, although the (sometimes eccentric) staff will deny this at all cost, especially the owner Jan. (don't even mention it), this was confirmed by a staff member who should remain anonymous. '3rd' floor IS the most haunted, the '1st' floor has little activity. A night during the slow season is best. Experience sounds of people sprinting by your room's door, doors slamming, doors shaking, window sounds, what sounds to be high heels on wood, although the hallways have plush carpet, and if your 'lucky' you'll see 1920's Japanese men and women sometimes speaking to one another and who never acknowledge you. Do not worry though, whom ever haunts this place is friendly and appears to enjoy sprinting for hours in the middle of the nigh(12:00am - 5:00am) though the halls over picking on guests. Most interestingly about the haunting is if you hear the sprinting sounds, they stop if you are about to open your bedroom's door to check on it, sometime appearing as if they stop in front of your door. It stops right when you grab the door knob, and not when you open the door. How do 'they' know? Send your friend or wife off to the hallway bathroom in the middle of the night. close the doors. The sprinting will continue, but only between the bathroom and bedroom!! amazing!
