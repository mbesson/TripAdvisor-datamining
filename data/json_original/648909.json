Felt I needed more time in Ubud so I ended up at the Yulia. It was the week leading up to Christmas and most places were already booked - you can take from that comment that the Yulia wasn't my first choice. It was okay. The location was great. Afternoon tea was wonderful (loved the black rice pudding). Breakfast was nice. The room was...okay...kind of dark. Nice high ceilings but nothing on the walls...it was like being in prison! The bathroom was kind of grody - paint peeling from unending humidity, a bit of mold. Overall the room was fine but in need of updating. The pool is small and they only had 2 loungers. And what is with the naked lady picture behind the outdoor bar?? It was cheap so I can't complain too much. Stay here but don't set your expectations too high.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR251742075", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sfordu"}, {"Content": "\u59d8\u6751\u61c6\u9288\u5a41\u4e92\u6fb6\u6825\u4f05\u9479\ue218\u4eb1\u9287\uff43\u4ee7\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u9286?#x201d;   showReview(19914938, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR336616767", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d648909-r18054095-Yulia_Village_Inn-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "648909", "Price": "$65"}}
