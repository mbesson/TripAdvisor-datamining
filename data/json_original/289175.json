Although you have to walk a few minutes into a teeny tiny street from the main touristy area, (and might accidentally step on dog poop), the street maze is usual in Venice. It was the most expensive accommodation we had in Europe and was the smallest. The bathroom was tiny, the room was basic -bed, side table, lamp, small closet. Our room was located in ground floor where you can see the patio/garden. Its a good room if you like to drink, chat and eat pizza at the patio under the stars, otherwise its a terrible idea if you would like a decent sleep cause you can hear people chitchatting.

While the many canals of Venice provide a unique charm that other cities don't have, the canals can be a challenge in getting your luggage to a hotel. In most cities you can take a taxi directly to your hotel, but not in Venice. On our last trip to Italy we took the train from Rome to Venice and selected this hotel because it was the closest to the train station. The hotel is an easy walk, with luggage, from the train station. The hotel is located at the end of a very narrow street but rooms are large and very comfortable. This is not the fanciest hotel in Venice but it is one of the best bargains. The hotel staff was always helpful and spoke perfect English. The only negative on this hotel is finding it. It would help to have a sign at the entrance to the street but just look for the first narrow alley on your left.

I guess partly because there aren't any roads and everything is shipped by boat. Villa Rosa is an inexpensive hotel in an expensive city. However, it's excellent value, and in an ideal location. We walked to all of Venice's attractions (Venice is not a large city), but I'd recommend having a street map, as it can get confusing negotiating the street network at times.

We arrived at Marco Polo airport and booked our return ticket by coach into Venice at the airport. Make sure you go with ATVO as this is a direct transfer to Piazzale Roma. no stops and takes 20/25 minutes approx. There is another ticket sales booth beside atvo called ACTV which is also a bus company this is the Venice public-transit agency, and is just like our buses with regular stops picking up and setting down passengers so will take much longer to arrive at Piazzale Roma. We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 18 return with ATVO for the two of us. ( Fri to Mon ) We had hired a car to pick up at airport on the monday ! When you arrive at Piazzale Roma walk towards the station over the bridge carry on past station on your left, pass another bridge on your right carry on walking, you are in a small street with shops either side. Look to your left for a food outlet called Quanto Basta there is a small lane beside it, if you look on the floor Albergo S Lucia is written here in mosaic form. Walk down this narrow lane pass hotel Albergo, less than 100 yrds, the Villa Rosa is now visible, ( see Pics ) take next right (small alley) entance a couple of paces on your left. No more than a 10 min walk from coach park. The hotel was very clean and we were warmly greeted. Our room was small, but functional, hey I've no intentions of staying in watching TV. The air condition unit was working fine and boy did we need it. Bathroom was clean shower small but ok. My only moan would be that the matress was as solid as a board, so be warned, we were so exhausted after a days exploring we soon drifted off. Breakfast was a buffet affair basic but adequate, save some money on buying food, fill up here ! Tip, we bought 48 hour tickets for vaporetto water buses from a Tobacc shop. Turn left out of alley walk over bridge shop on right ( 5 min wlk ) saves queing at ticket office, your call. Be aware this small shop does not take credit cards. You have to validate your ticket on a small machine at water bus stop, use as a swipe card hold within 6 cm of the circular panel for three seconds, or until you see a green light and hear a beep. If you don't validate ticket you will receive a substantial fine if card checked by employee. We never saw anyone checked or even asked to see tickets in our 4 days on these boats. We validated ours on our second full day so got an extra day unlimited travel. ( I know naughty. ) If you travel to Lido they have automatic barriers like london underground so you have to validate there !! Worth a visit though lovely free beach, even use same ticket to ride on buses.

Location The location of the hotel is great, it's at 5 minutes walk from the bus and trainstation, also the Vaporeto stop is at just 5 minutes away. It's close to the center of Venice, 10 - 15 minutes walk to the Rialto and 20 - 25 minutes to San Marco. From the railway station other places are easy to reach, we traveled to Verona. Bedrooms The room we stayed in was very taken care off, it had a good bed and looked nice. There was a TV with a whole load of channels. The bathroom had a good shower with warm water and a little terrace. The only thing was that sometimes the room was rather warm and the heating wasn't really controlable. But that's just a little detail, we just opened our window for a while when we felt it too hot. Food The breakfast was OK! Much better than we had in Italy before! There was bread, a Croissant, ham, cheese, jam, chocolate, honey, butter...Coffee, thee...Yoghurt...All well taken care off! Services The hotel has wireless internet access in the hotel lobby.

I had checked out prices and locations prior to the trip but it was a last-minute deal and we were flying standby so we didn't want to book anything and lose a deposit. We were very pleasantly surprised at our find and the good value price we received especially considering it was Holy Week (week before Easter) in Italy. We had a little trouble locating the street and hotel from the directions we were given but it is a reasonable 5-10 minute walk from St. Lucia train station. We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and checked in right away. The room was clean and efficient with enough space for the two of us. The beds were quite firm and the bathroom clean but small. The hotel is well kept but older and quaint. The hotel desk staff (especially Martina) was very helpful and accomodating to show us locations and recommend sights, shops and restaurants nearby. The breakfast room and sitting lounge is just off the entry lobby. The breakfast was a decent selection for a continental service with cereal, breads, pastries, meat and cheese slices and various juices. They serve coffee, espresso and capuccino to order. The breakfast room was usually quite busy but we were always able to locate a table right away. The hotel is located in the Cannaregio district near the first bridge over the Grand Canal at the Ferrovia Vaporetto stops. Most locations for sightseeing are within a 20 to 45 minute walking distance but you can catch the vaporetto to the other islands easily. If you plan to do much use of the waterbus it is best to purchase either a daily (24hrs for 18euro) or multi-hour pass as the cost can climb quickly at 6euro per ride. Obviously to go to Murano or Lido you will need to use one of the boat services. There are a lot of touristy shops and restaurants along the main passage following the Grand Canal so there is no shortage of options. There is a grocery and street market about a 10 minute walk further down past the alley leading to the hotel. If you go over the nearby bridge to St. Croce you will come across some less touristy and more authentic shops for items such as Murano glass and Venetian masks as well as some great food and some quaint out of the way and quiet campos for strolling and people watching. Overall I highly recommend the hotel and felt it was a good value. We paid 100 euro per night for a twin room for our 2 night stay from Wednesday to Friday. If we had booked by phone or via the internet prior to our arrival we would likely have gotten a better rate for those days but this was the lowest cost quoted by the reservation desk when we arrived.

Breakfast was not appealing dry bread rolls were left out on the tables and in addition you were given one croisant. There were no fruit juices, well, there were juices, but goodness knows what they were, one taste of the 'orange' and I didn't bother again. There was 'plastic' ham and cheese but we decided to buy melon and bring that down to eat at breakfast.
