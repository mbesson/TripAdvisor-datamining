Perfectly situated off the main path, private, but close to everything and right next to Mallory Square. I was on the ground floor (2 bedroom unit) overlooking the pool and waterway (unit 113). I loved the grounds, the weather was impeccable and I had a great and relaxing time. There were three drawbacks but not that major. First, was the cruise ships that docked right in front of my room blocking the view (but they were always gone before sunset). Second, was the exhorbitant price paid for this room ($1980 for 3 nights). Third, for being an upscale Hyatt, I was not impressed with the outdated rooms. I'm not sure but it seems that some rooms may be freshly updated and appointed but not our unit. Don't get me wrong, it was clean but not freshly appointed and current like I experience with Marriott and Hilton. Would I go back? Well...YES...as long as I had a better room and better rates! I also got to enjoy the sunset cruise aboard the wonderful Western Union Schooner. This is not to be missed.

The facility has a fine location on the waterfront in Key West Florida. It is very convenient to the popular old town area of Key West. I do not know the relationship between this entity and the Hyatt Hotel chain -- the Club uses the Hyatt logo with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcResidence Club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 written underneath. If you collect Hyatt Gold Passport points you will not get any for staying here. I was very disappointed because there is no comparison between the Hyatt Hotel facilities that I am used to and what I found at this \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdClub\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When making the reservation I was not presented with the usual Ocean Front, Ocean View and Garden View choices. Given the location and the pictures of the site on their web site you might conclude that that all units are ocean front or at least ocean view. I had two units for seven days at a cost of $6615 (including Florida room tax). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think well appointed Hyatt room, think 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decor and furniture. Both units had stained carpets, aging kitchens and worn furniture. Neither unit could see any portion of the ocean. My guess is that over half of the units have no ocean view. Other units have some view (they face south, the ocean is to the west so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to lean) and some units have (I imagine) spectacular views. Because this is a time share operation there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way to tell if the best units are in the rental pool. I asked for quiet rooms. I received two ground floor units. My unit had a patio next to two walkways -- one went between the pool and the office, the other went to the pool area public bathroom. A steady stream of traffic was present on both walks. My unit was an end unit so the bedroom had a window which looked into an area between two buildings. This area was well lit all night. Since the bedroom window had only an old Venetian blind (no blackout drapes) the bedroom was also well lit at night. I solved this by putting a blanket over the window. The blanket provided darkness but did not help with the noise generated by 5 (!) large air conditioning fans just outside the window. These came on and off all night (June in Florida). The bedroom had a queen sized bed (not what I would expect at a $462/night Hyatt) and a TV that did not work. Our unit had a door that connected to a second unit that was rented to others as a studio. The tile floor under the door was uneven so there was a quarter inch gap under the door. This allowed me to hear every word spoken in the adjoining unit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so much for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquiet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room. My advice: call and ask for an ocean view room. If they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer it, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go. The bathroom (also very dated) had a Jacuzzi tub that did not work. It also had a toilet plunger (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen that in a real Hyatt) that, fortunately, we did not need. The fact that it was supplied speaks volumes. Parking is offered at $15 per day. The lot is next to the complex but it is owned by the Westin (next door). When the lot fills the entrance is blocked and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in.

Because I believe this I purchased a week in a two bedroom townhouse with an ocean view. In addition to that week I try to visit KW several more times a year and I always try to get accomodations here. I have stayed at SH many times in a variety of accommodations from two bedroom townhouse to studio. I have also stayed at many other B&B's and hotels in Key West and they were all good but, Sunset Harbor is the best. Sunset harbor has the best location on the island within walking distance to almost everything and it offers much more for your money. Some reviewers seem to be unaware that this is a timeshare which rents vacant units, if you are lucky enough to get one. No, there is not anyone to carry your bags, there are luggage carts and ramps leading to the elevator. No, the studios do not have a view because they are the lock-off bedroom of a two bedroom unit, the one bedroom portion of that unit has a great balcony view and a kitchen, livingroom, dining area and bedroom for slightly more money. No, there is not a restaurant or bar because space is very limited in Old Town and you are within a five minute walk of dozens of excellent choices for both. You could have all of those things if you stay on the other side of the island because space is not so limited there, but you would have to drive and park & pay every time you go out because you are not close to any of the best of Key West. You could stay in a hotel or B&B room which cost more and offers less. Compare the price of a one bedroom unit at Sunset Harbor (bedroom, kitchen, dining area, living room and balcony ) to a hotel room in nearby locations. Since Sunset Harbor is a Hyatt location you also have the amenities located at the nearby Hyatt hotel avaiiable to you including discounts at the restaurants. Key West is the best with history, culture, arts, the ocean and gulf, water sports, funky bars and some of the best restaurants in the states. Budget tip-try the city bus to get to places that are too far to walk. A week pass cost less than one taxi ride and you will see parts of the island that you might never see otherwise. There is a stop at the entrance to Publix which will save you even more money than shopping in Old Town. The bus returns in about 1 hour. I also use it to get to the far end of Duval (it runs on streets parallel to Duval not on it) and then leisurely shop, sightsee and eat my way back to Sunsrt Harbor.

The shower door is at the end farthest from showerhead and valve, so it was necessary to enter the shower to turn on the water. Adding to the problem, the single-knob control is the type that has no flow adjustment and rotates counterclockwise from off to cold to hot. The showerhead is so high on the wall that my 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-3\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd partner could not reach it. When I entered the shower, I tilted the showerhead to direct the spray at the wall to avoid the bone-chilling water that came out at first, until warm water began flow. Then I re-directed the showerhead. Since my partner is not tall enough to do this, I started the shower for her so it was warm when she entered. What does a short guest do without a tall partner? Throw a bath towel over the showerhead, or freeze? After my learning curve ran out, the rest of our stay was pleasant.", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Sunsets\u201d", "Author": "RF2009", "ReviewID": "UR43729598", "Content": "For the second year in a row, my wife and I spent a week at Sunset Harbor in late August.

The one bedroom unit was spacious with the exception of the cooking area. There was a bar with two stools, a kitchen table with seating for four and a large living room with seating for four or five. The unit appeared freshly painted with new bathroom tile and it was clean. The wall decor was fitting for the setting. The bathroom could have used some counter space for toiletries but that was minor. Since there are only 40 (I think) units, the pool was never crowded and had many lounge chairs. There was no bar at the pool but everyone seemed to make their drinks in their room and brought them out to the pool which was cheaper anyway. As others have written, the location was ideal. It was within easy walking distance of historic downtown where many of the museums and harbor were located. We particularly enjoyed the Mel Fisher Museum The trolley car is a good deal as they make 12 stops so you can get to attractions that aren't within walking distance, such as the Butterfly Conservatory, another great attraction. A pass is good for all day and you can get on and off as you please. You can get discounted rates for the trolley and other attractions by going on-line. The Conch train only makes 3 stops so I would recommend the trolley. Since there are many restaurants, shops, and attractions within walking distance we only rented a car when we drove to Miami for a couple of days. Your biggest transporation expense is to and from the airport which is $16 each way. The grocery store Faustino's is within walking distance and it is worthwhile to stock up on food and have them call you a cab to haul you and your food back to the resort. (about 5-6 dollars). Restaurants are pretty pricey in Key West. Sloppy Joe's is a great hangout. Although the cruise ships sometimes block the view of the ocean, they pull out in the afternoon and you will have an unobstructive view of the sunsets. The boardwalk is close by so you can walk along it and see the sunsets. Be sure to go to the Mallory Square Sunset Celebration at least once.

If you want the view, you have to get a 1 or 2 bedroom. We had a 1 bedroom. The living room and kitchen were spacious and beautifully decorated. Flat screen TV and an IPOD stereo in the living room. Our balcony had a table and 4 comfortable chairs which looked over the pool and we could see the marina and the ocean. The property is clean and quite with a nice sized pool and hot tub. They even have some large outdoor grills if you want to cook some steaks. The resort does not have a restaurant or a bar but not sure why you would need one with the dozens of each of those within a few minute walk of the resort. Its a Hyatt so its clean and well kept but it is a time share so they clean the rooms once per week if that matters to you. Wireless internet access was free. We could always get a lounge chair at the pool and there is plenty of shade or sunshine. The kitchen has everything you need including a dishwasher in case you want to cook some meals. The front desk people were all very nice. When we arrived early, they just stored our luggage and called our cell phone when the room was ready. We wanted to rent some bikes and the concierge called a bike rental business for us and they delivered the bikes to us. If the view is important to you then you need a 3rd floor room. The tropical setting can obscure the view from the lower floors. This is not a top shelf luxury property with spas and room service but you don't pay that price either. You can stay at the Hyatt Key West Resort Hotel about 4 blocks away if you want to spend $300+ per night. You can use their pool, beach and work out facility if you want.

The vanity area contained the jetted tub, that was nice, but the bathroom/shower area was nothing to be desired. It's almost like we had a handicapped shower - there was no tub, just a curtain - problem is - you shower and water goes EVERYWHERE in the bathroom. Since they don't do daily linen changes - you have to keep asking for new floor mats, towels... it was annoying. The guide book in the room says to please leave your trash at the door and they wil come and collect it every 2 hours - my trash sat outside our door for almost 4 hours.

Liked that both king bdrms were on 2nd floor & unit had balconies on both floors. 1/2 bath on 1st fl would be make this unit work for 6 since couch is fold-out bed. Female at front desk helpful/cheerful; room ready at 4PM (called @11AM from Cheeca Lodge in Islamorada & told rms never avail before 4PM--seems checkout should be noon vs 10AM). 1st floor had open kitchen design w/dining table for 4 ; we liked counter w/bar stools used for laptop (unfortunately their server not great--accessed internet but couldn't access work email--but did later at Hyatt Hotel that same wknd). Nice touch to have coffee, dishwasher detergent, plenty of towels (used them all by 3rd night--just missed Wed cleaning--you can request more). More than ample dishes, glasses, utensils + full-size frig. Bed comfortable & A/C worked fine. As w/all Hyatts--great landscaping around sparking pool w/plenty of chairs for size of resort & at front of property to provide privacy from paved public waterfront area. Unit appeared spotless relative to shower stall, toilets, floor, frig - but could use a 'deep' cleaning of corners of bathrooms/some tile areas. Can't say enough about location--walk to everything: Sloppy Joes, Blue Heaven, A & B Lobster House (best meal but pricey), shopping, 2nd level bar at Westin to watch sunset, etc. Drove down to Bananas for wonderful breakfast & to look at other Hyatt Vac Clubs--other 2 look nice but at least 10 -min drive to Duvall St. $30 for pkg for 3 nites not bad considering location +in/out privileges.
