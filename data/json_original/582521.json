This is a family run hotel, so they really treat their guests as close relatives. Any issues were fixed at no time. It is few minutes away from the shopping strip with excellent bars and restaurants. We enjoyed the breakfast at the swimming pool terrace with a view to Adriatic Sea. BTW, the breakfast was the best we ever have at any hotel through our entire trip. Just few suggestions: Wi-Fi Internet should be available at any room, not just in the lobby; free bikes should be renewed. I'm going to recommend this hotel to all my friends, and we will definitely come back in the near future.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wakefield", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and great food\u201d", "Author": "JanetWakefield", "ReviewID": "UR116133987", "Content": "myself and six female friends stayed at this lovely hotel on the beach for 4 nights for a birthday celebration, the staff were lovely and the food was great and the desserts to die for, the only downside was the rooms and bathrooms were quite small having said that they were clean, we had a side seaview which was quite nice, the location is great, quite central, all 7 of us would gladley stay here again, we had a discrepancy with our bill which we did not realise until we got back to england, we emailed them on our return and they promptly sent us the difference, which was really good of them, we had a day in venice (great day)and was late back, but they told us to go into restaurant for our evening meal, no problem.

It is a beautiful place on earth, with a fantastic, helpful and friendly family. We felt wery welcome and taken care of. The room we got was large and with a fantastic view, and a great terrasse. The lounge was cool and relaxing. The breakfast was delicios and the poolarea so clean and nice. The beach was just outside of the poolarea, with private sunbeds. To bad the weather was not the best.
