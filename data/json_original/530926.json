The first time I stayed I had two pull down single beds, which for me, were hard to pull down and lock in place. The second time, I had a double fixed bed - which was very comfortable. The rooms are a bit dated, but has everything you need, especially for a longer stay. The kitchen is good - but they don't provide enough utensils and cutlery. The only gripe I have, is that the signal in the block is poor and I find it hard to connect to the internet (via USB, rented from reception). Overall the apartment is clean, quite and well sized, but could do with some modernisation. The staff are friendly and helpful - always saying hello etc. The location is fantastic - you can easily walk to all the central parts in the city. There is also a lounge area on the ground floor as well as a cafe on the 'club' floor, but I would recommend Cafe Rio Frio next door (same building, different entrance) as the food and service is better as is the opening hours.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zaragoza, Spain", "Title": "\u201cRight at Colon sq., great location.

It has great location in Madrid (right at the Placa Colon) next to a metro stop. However, the place is rundown, the furniture has seen better days. The staff is indifferent and at times even quite rude. The price is OK for Madrid but you can do better. There is a lot of noise from the streets coming in, the rooms are quite dirty for Spanish standards. We had a bedrom and a living room with a sleeping couch.
