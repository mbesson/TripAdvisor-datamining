There were some problems with our stay and we needed to reprint a plane boarding pass, but the \"business center\" offered did not include a printer. The staff were not at all helpful to us when we were trying to solve the problem, or when we were looking for a nearby grocery store (a jabbing point in a vague direction was the best the girl could do). The mattresses were lumpy and the pillows don't hold their shape. Worst night's sleep I've had in a long time. Clean, quiet, a good twenty minute train ride to the centre of the city, though. (The nearest S-Bahn stop is at Sresow, on lines 3 or 75.) If you want to fit as much sight-seeing in as possible, you might want a hotel closer to the city. And if you don't speak German at all, skip it.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baarn, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "A.Brouwer", "ReviewID": "UR119330695", "Content": "Good hotel. Altough it is far away from the Berlin city centre. But Spandau has a nice city centre and there is even a shopping mall opposite the Berlin Spandau railwaystation. From there it is a 25 minutes railway trip to Berlin Zoo station. However,the nearest railwaystation is Stresow but this station is served by less trains. There is also a busstop near the hotel at Ruhlebener strasse. The hotel itself is good, my room was clean. The safe didn't work. The breakfast buffet is good, but if you want coffee you must order it. Internet is 5 euros for 24 hours but according to my travel agency it was free of charge. You can also rent a bike for 12 euros a day. The desk was unstaffed when I wanted to check out. There was even no one showing up when I rang the bell! So I left the hotel without checking out.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat find\u201d", "Author": "gillbrian2", "ReviewID": "UR116996331", "Content": "we where going to a gig at the zitadelle so wanted somewhere close. we knew the hotel was a bit away from the city and where a little concerned that we would not be able to get to see much of Berlin centre due to this. BUT... the public transport in Berlin is so efficient, we need not have worried. The hotel was lovely, our room was better than some of the 4* hotels we have stayed in. Everything we needed was there, hairdryer, nice view of the garden, easy to find, clean, a comfortable bed, mini bar that actually had stuff in it! and even bathrobes (unusual for 3*). We paid for the breakfast which was very nice. The staff were helpful without being intrusive. The little bar was well stocked and sitting outside the front of the hotel for a night cap was very pleasant indeed. The area of Spandau if beautiful and we enjoyed a quiet meal at a lovely restaurant only a couple of bus stops away from the hotel. A bit out of the way but a great find and we will stay here again on our return to Berlin.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery rude\u201d", "Author": "bextra", "ReviewID": "UR8677479", "Content": "Everything about this hotel was fine except for the front desk people.

Hotel is about 25 minutes from central berlin by S-Bhan, the local rail system, which was probably at the limit for non car users. If you had a car there was plenty of parking and that would probably have been more convenient. The locality is quiet but the walk from the rail station to the hotel late at night did involve running the gauntlet of the local drunks who inhabit the park area between the station and the hotel. We took to going the long way round. The price per room was fair and the breakfast very reasonable at 7 euros per person. Lots of choice from the breakfast menu. The major downside was the loss of an MP3 player from the room. There is a safe in the room and my advice would be make sure you use it. We had 2 rooms and the room which suffered the loss was occupied by my 17year old daughter and her friend. When I made the manager aware of the loss the reaction was that this was a teenager and it would turn up. The following day the adaptor to the MP3 player was also taken from the room. The unit had a UK connection and would not work without the adaptor. This really made no sense as the cost of the adaptor is probably no more than 5 or 6 euros. I was more annoyed at the second loss as it seemed whoever had taken the item felt they could take something else with impunity. Unfortunately the reaction was very similar to the first loss. These incidents spoilt what would otherwise have been a very nice stay in a very nice hotel", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "SORAT Hotel Berlin-Spandau", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d202452-Reviews-SORAT_Hotel_Berlin_Spandau-Berlin.html", "Price": "$51 - $151*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Heidereuterstr. 37 - 38</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">13597</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "202452", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/60/c9/empfangshalle-mit-lobby.jpg"}}
