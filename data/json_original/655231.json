A perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle of Central station and the RLD. Very smoker friendly, in fact just very tourist friendly in general. Have a pizza from the restuarant downstairs! Thanks for a great stay guys be back soon!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBad acommodation choice\u201d", "Author": "Huseyin C Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126835700", "Content": "The hotels location is very good, but the hotel itself is bad, room was dirty, smelling very bad, when you get shower, the water generally flow into the room, if you do not understand the towel left on the ground, behind the bathroom door!!
