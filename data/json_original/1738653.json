There were 4 of us and had requested for 2 doubles. however, we got 1 room on 2nd floor and the other on 6th floor, the worst part being the lift which goes only upto 5th floor, and you have to climb some very uncomfortable stairs to reach 6th floor, where rooms have a slant roof. So i would suggest an absolute NO to rooms on 6th floor. When I highlighted this to the front desk, was told that hotel is full and they cant do anything about this for that night, but will shift us to 3rd floor the next day. In given circumstances, I didnt mind that. Negatives - Lift: very funny, cant take more than 4 ( and I mean exact 4). Service :- very slow. The room would never have enough tea bags ( and there is no coffee available). We had to ask for tea bags everyday. English skills of staff didn't help the cause. So the most efficient way was to go down to the restaurant and fetch for yourself. on last day we checked out at 7 , but couldn't get any breakfast as the restaurant was not ready in time. So we had to skip! Extremely slow staff and hardly speak or understand English Rooms : Very small size, 100s of channels, but just a couple in English. No view. Breakfast: basic and limited spread.

The price was a bit higher than we could get from a small hotel closer to the water, but the feel was definitely more luxury. The breakfast spread was fantastic, something we looked forward to. The hotel also has a nice roof top terrace with great views but this under-marketed and could get a lot more attention which it deserves. Just 5 minutes awalk from Topacki palace and a 10 min walk to aya sofia, the hotel was centrally located. We were amazed that so many of our friends ended up staying at these hotels that were 20-30 minutes walk from the mosques when there were in fact so many great deals like the raymond that were much closer and more convenient.

Galata on the other side of the Golden Horn is also easily accessible, and the ferries to go further afield are also nearby. My room had nothing in the way of a view, but I spent an afternoon in the sun on the roof and enjoyed a nightcap up there too, taking in the views over the water. The restaurant/breakfast area downstairs (reached through a dark lobby area that is functional rather than inviting) offers a nice surprise: it looks out onto a cobblestone street at the back of the hotel. My room was a tad small, but had everything I needed. Staff was great and on the couple of occasions I saw them dealing with demanding guests, their attitude was patient and professional. They use the terrace as their smoking area, but didn't bother me at all as I spent an afternoon relaxing in the sun, except to occasionally offer me tea or water. There are many hotels in Istanbul, many in fact on the same street.
