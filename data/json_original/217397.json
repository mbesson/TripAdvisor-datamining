Hotels by the airport are always expensive and this one is too but there are a lot of pluses to this hotel: free airport shuttle starting at 5am onwards, suites, free parking, free WIFI, iron/ironing board, fully stocked kitchenette, LCD TVs. Yes, there is free breakfast but not when you have an early flight. Our 5th floor room was very quiet, room was an adequate size (though not as big as other Homewood Suites we have stayed in), & king bed was very comfortable. Strong water pressure & lots of hot water in the shower. There is a Starbucks and other stores/restaurants within walking distance (2 mins. drive away). The cons - the hallway carpet was dirty; the sleeper sofa in our suite was not made (and when I asked, the front desk said their staff does not do that!) and when we got downstairs at 5:03am on Sunday, the shuttle had already left even though I had called at 4:30am to confirm our departure. I got the feeling from check-in to check-out that the front desk staff are not service-oriented nor do they really care about their guests' experience.

The first few stays my only complaint would have to be the food at the complimentary breakfast. Not very good to say the least, but tolerable. The rooms have always been clean and quite comfortable; the staff has been accommodating. Our last 2 stays have left a bit to be desired. Our stay in January 2012, we had room 215. The door sticks making it difficult to get in. It is right near the conference rooms and extremely noisy if there are events taking place. There was a men's conference being held. Apparently the conference room wasn't open and hall was packed with about 50 men. My family had to wade through them to get to the elevator. Most of the men were considerate, but some made comments which made my wife and my 16 yr old daughter uncomfortable. Wanted to punch whoever said something in the face but, I couldn't tell who made the comment and it probably wouldn't have been wise to do anyway. I know that's not really the hotel's fault but on our next stay in March 2012, guess what room we got....again. You guessed it, 215. No men's conference, but a lot of traffic and the door still sticks. The absolute worst was there were bloodstained sheets on the hideaway bed. It was very late when we noticed it because we attended a jazz festival that evening. The front desk was responsive but not very apologetic. Clean sheets were brought to our room fairly quickly, but the damage had been done. Bloodstained sheets are a deal breaker for me.

Based on his colleagues recommendation we stayed at this hotel and loved it! I was worried that being so close to the airport that it would be noisy as I am a very light sleeper. The rooms were sound proof enough that the noise didn't bother us at all. It was ideal for our family as our older child slept on the pull out sofa while the baby slept in a crib in the bathroom so we all had our own room and slept better. I would recommend staying on the lagoon side as the views were great and we were on the opposite side of the airport. We were impressed by the healthy breakfast options that included eggs, meat, fresh fruit, and homemade oatmeal daily along with the more commonly offered sugary options of waffles, cereals, breads, and pastries. Mon through Thu they also had a meal that included salad with beans and other main dishes with vegetables plus wine and beer. We went to the pool once or twice a day. It was basic but kept the kids happy. We were disappointed the hot tub was not fully heated the entire time we were there. I used the gym too. They had two treadmills, an elliptical, large ball, full weight set, mat, and medicine ball. Wish I would have brought earbuds to plug into the TVs while working out. The only other thing I would mention is the full kitchen did not include an oven as I bought food to bake in the oven. My husband's colleagues also enjoyed the place even though they weren't with their families.

We had four people and reserved a two bedroom suite. The suite had a living room type area with comfy chairs and a small couch and a small kitchen with a table between the two bedrooms. Each bedroom had its own full bathroom. There was also an electric fireplace which was nice. Seems a bit unnecessary in Miami, though. There is a shuttle bus from the airport; I called for it after we got our luggage and the bus was there about ten minutes later. There is another Homewood Suites location nearby so be sure you get on the right shuttle. Check-in was quick and efficient. The lobby was nice. The suite was clean and in good shape. We could look one window and see the pool, another, the \"lagoon\". The breakfast was ok. It included some hot food, scrambled eggs, sausage, toast, pastries, juices, milk, coffee. I can't remember if they had the waffle maker. We arrived on a Saturday night so I can't comment on the evening meal. While you're at breakfast, be sure to step out on the balcony that overlooks the lagoon and check out the giant carp that swim over. Bring your room key or you'll need someone to let you back in. There aren't any restaurants in the immediate area so, being tired, we ordered pizza from one of the fliers that were left in room. There is a grocery store about a ten minute walk from the hotel if you need anything. My one complaint is that the walls are somewhat thin and because it's an airport hotel, people are coming in at all hours. Running water and cans tossed into wastebaskets from surrounding rooms are easily heard. Earplugs were somewhat helpful.

I booked this hotel after I read reviews on this website. The hotel is clean and 2 bedrooms-suite is very suitable for family stay. The staff is very nice. I called hotel in the morning of 11/19 before we took flight to Miami to ask for a suite facing the lagoon, not facing the airport. The staff answered they will try and could not guarantee. When we arrived in the evening, we got the suite facing the lagoon! The hotel shuttle is very good, we called hotel at airport and the shttle bus arrived at airport within 10 minutes. The staff is very polite and the breakfast is very good. Before I left I thought about recommending this hotel to my friends for their future stay in Miami. But the departure experience total destroyed my good feeling with the hotel and changed my mind. Here is the detail: On the day I checked out(11/21/2011) I asked Hotel staff at front desk to introduce some shuttle providers to me for transportation from the hotel to Cruise terminal. The Front desk staff referred only one shuttle provider (I did not remeber driver's name, is 'Alfaro' or 'Rodolfo', or something like that. But I do have his phone number:--) and this shuttle driver gave us very bad experience at the end of my stay at Miami and therefore totally destroyed the very good impression the hotel gave me during my 2 days stay. Before we left I talked to the driver at the hotel lobby. Our party have 5 adults and 2 children. The driver gave me the price is $10 per adult, no charge on kids. therefore total price is $50 dollars. We thought this price is O.K. At that time, one of 5 adults was at airport and we asked the driver whether it is O.K. for him to pick up the person on the way to cruise terminal(The hotel is very close to airport) and he agreed to do so but he did not told us there is extra charge for this before we took on the shuttle. However when we arrived at cruise terminal, the driver asked us to pay him $70 instead of $50. We were all shocked by his request and asked him why. He said that the airport charged him $20. I know this is lie since there is no such airport charge at all. we went with him all the way and did not see any airport personnel collect money from him. It is too ridiculous. This dishonest shuttle driver insisted on asking for $20 more dolloars from us and we had no time to keep on arguing with him.(We need get boarding on cruise ship, a cruise line personnel urged us to check-in our luggage. ) so I just gave him $20 to get rid of him. This was very terrible experience and shocked me a lot. Since this shuttle driver is the only one referred by hotel staff. This bad experience totally destroyed my trust to the hotel. I will NOT recommend Homewood Suites at Miami Airport to any person. My suggestion for future guests is doing homework (searching shuttle providers and taxi on the web) by yourself first and not just using the one hotel referred.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLooked great, but looks can be deceiving!\u201d", "Author": "travelingraysgirl1", "ReviewID": "UR120845478", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 1 night. I was already stressed as I had to leave a cruise ship in St. Kitts and fly to Miami and attend at the Miami children;s hospital for a medical emergency. Very stressful vacation. I had chose to leave the Ramada North airport hotel as there was issues with providing a mini fridge and baby crib that were promised at check in the night before. I chose to leave the Ramada and visit at the Hilton as they offered good rates for those that are in need of a hotel and got a discounted rate of $129 for having the list of hotels from the Miami children's hospital. When I arrived at the hotel I was pleased. Very nice hotel and a nice area. The front lobby was warm and inviting and well decorated. Upon my arrival to my room #618 I was very pleased. Everything was perfect and everything appeared clean. Separate bedroom area., large bathroom with separate vanity area, full kitchen (minus) an oven and separate sitting and dining area. Very satisfied at first. Then the smoke started to roll in. I knew when I took the room that it was a smoking room. I too smoke but take it outdoors. I felt like the occupants on my floor were smoking directly in my room. It was constantly smelling of fresh smoke, I opened the windows as far as they would allow 3-4 inches and had the drapes pulled back to allow for some fresh air flow. It didn't help. I started putting towels by the main front door to block the incoming smoke. It too did not help., turned on the fan above stove top to high and left bathroom vents running in hopes of ridding the smoke that seemed to enter our room. Still nothing improved. I have serious doubts about the ventilation system in this hotel as the smoke was overwhelming. On the 6th floor you get off the elevator and race to your room as it is sooo smoky in the hallways too. When I finally went to bed I still could not sleep, kept inhaling second hand smoke from an apparent chain smoker/smokers. It was disturbing me and I could not sleep. I got up to cover the vents with pillows and blankets in hopes to stop the awful smoke from entering our unit. Finally turned on light to do this and noticed bugs on the night stand. I lifted the corners of the mattress and voila there were critters there too. There were bugs on the mattress and on the bed skirt. Ewwww, called the front desk and he sent up security to take a look. Yes, the security man also seen the critters crawling on my bed. I also took pictures and videos which I will add in later. I was told there were no other rooms available and to call them back in a bit. I was in a panic freezing all my bed clothes and anything that was on the floor or near the bed in the full size fridge/freezer provided. Unfortunately this was around 1:00am. I began to research changing my flights and leaving all together for home. No avail, on that one. At around 3am the hotel front desk sent up the security to tell me they had found another hotel for the night for me. I took their offer and packed up the toddler and myself and left this hotel. The security drove the hotel's shuttle bus to the new hotel. The Marriot Spring Hill Suites. I did receive an apology from the gentleman at the front desk that evening of course, did not have to pay for the room itself. Although, the staff at the Marriott Spring Hill Suites were amazed they did not pay for my first night there as a result of the stress they put me under for staying in a bed bug infested room. I liked the feel of this hotel when I arrived. The front desk was warm and welcoming. Tastefully done and very nice, well appointed rooms with a great amount of space, but by no means want to sleep with critters. I am not a professional but they did appear to be young bed bugs.after researching the internet at length until it started to get spotty around 2am. I would stay here again ONLY if I was reassured there are no bed bugs in my room or throughout the building and if they made it a non smoking facility inside as I don't think their ventilation system works well enough to ensure clean air indoors. I did check out their pool area earlier, although I never used it it seemed rather plain in comparison to the hotel. Square, fenced in area at back of property. Didn't stay long enough to enjoy their complimentary breakfast! Won't be back until I KNOW nasty blood sucking bed bugs are eliminated and smoke free throughout entire hotel.

The next morning, I got up early for the hotel full buffet breakfast. There was lots of variety from scramble eggs, sausage, French toast, fruit juices, baked goods, cereals, and of course coffee. The hotel must be kid friendly because there were lots of kids running around enjoying themselves and the food. Outdoors from the breakfast area, there is a patio where the kids were throwing bread to humongous carp. The carp would literally jump 2-3 feet to get at the bread before it hit the water.

The 2 br is 1 king & 2 queen w/2 bathrooms, kitchen, livingroom, & a queen sleeper on the living room. 3 tv's complete the rooms. Room was immaculate and the beds ultra comfortable. The Hotel shuttle will take you to any restaurant within a 5 mile radius at no charge and I highly recommend the Cuban restaurant in the Publix shopping center. Absolutely delicious! The hotel will also contact an independent shuttle service that will take you to the cruise terminal for only $10 pp & no chg for the child. The hotel couldn't be more accommodating. A delicious free breakfast (hot) buffet is just the icing on the cake for this hotel. The next time our travels take us to the Miami airport area, you can be assured we'll stay here again.

I called the front desk and within 15 minutes I was reassigned to another room. I read some past reviews complaining about old style TVs, during my stay I can report that the room had two very nice LG 40 some inch LCD Tvs. They must have been renovated recently. The kitchen includes a medium sized refrigerator, microwave oven, dishwasher and a 4 burner top stove. The kitchen is fully equipped with dishes. There were no issues with noisy rooms due to air traffic from the airport. We slept comfortably every night. Breakfast included scrambled eggs, warm ham slices, sausage, potatoes, yoghurs, fresh fruit, several choices in bread with toasters readily available. French Toast, Pancakes, Orange, Pineapple and Apple Juice, Individual Cereal Boxes and all kinds of milk. Coffee. I really didn't miss Embassy Suites breakfast. Staff was very friendly. The only thing that I didn't like and didn't give the hotel five stars is the fact that the pool was outside of the hotel, had salt water and was not sparkling clean.

The hotel is located near our place of work in Coral Gables and b/c we are HHonor Diamond members it makes sense to book it, rather than the nearby HIlton for the extra space, free breakfast, evening reception and parking. This time we had a two bedroom suite, which we got at an excellent rate, however we were disappointed with our overall stay. It is all the little things that add up and make the difference between a great stay and a frustrating stay. I think the problem at this property is with management and their lack of communication. While the staff are all very friendly, especially the food service staff and housekeeping, nothing gets done and the upkeep on this property seems to be lacking or on a 'as need basis'. For example, our dishwasher was leaking all over the floor, yet it took 4 phone calls, over 4 days to get it fixed and the first person they send said it wasn't broken, despite water all over the floor! Eventually, two men worked 2 hours on taking it apart , while we were in the room, but we weren't offered an apology by management or any follow up. The plug on the drain in one of the sinks didn't work. I reported tthis 3 times....nothing. The dust bunnies in the corners of the rooms were disgusting and never did get cleaned up over the two weeks we were there. The panels around the light switches were grubby. There was mould on both shower heads, which I cleaned myself. I asked for extra hangers and eventually on day 3 got them. I know the hotel staff is busy, mainly with guests who are there on a short term basis usually coming or going to a cruise, but not cleaning the room until 2-3 pm each day is not acceptable. I realise these are all small things, but they add up and make an overall impression. If we weren't HHonor members, we would probably stay at the nearby Hyatt Summerfield Suites. I don't think it would take much to get this Homewood Suites back up to par----some refurbishment before it falls apart and proper management would help. As I said, the staff are certainly willing but I suspect very overworked and doing the best they can. Come on Hilton, hire more employees, pay them more and ask yourself, 'would Paris stay here?

I would advise that if you are a light sleeper to request a room on the lagoon side since there is some noise on the airport side. We were on the 6th floor lagoon side and had no airport noise but 4 of our group were in a 2 bedroom on the airport side and did say they had some airplane noise. We were also able to park our car there for free the week we were cruising, thats a score since they charge $20 p/day at the Port of Miami.

Knowing that the rooms are like apartments, we chose the Homewood Suites - but the way this particular one is laid out, stands above the rest: In a Typical Homewood layout, there is the living area, then a door and the bedroom, with a sink, and the commode and shower separate. However, here, there is a sink in a foyer BETWEEN the living and sleeping rooms, and a separate tub and toilet. One can have visitors, and keep the sleeping area completely separate. They went out of their way to ensure we were all on the same floor. The free wired and wireless internet, as well as free parking were quite welcome. Just across the main street (NW57th ave), there is a Publix Supermarket and a host of restaurants, and even an office supply store. There are pharmacies (CVS and Walgreen's) just one block further. The hotel is easy to find - and in fact is visible from 836. It is just a short 3-5 minute drive from the airport (and it appears as though they have a shuttle, although we didn't use it). The breakfast and dinner, while not culinary extravaganzas, were adequate, and for the price (free) we weren't complaining. The refrigerator, microwave and stovetop in the room were quite handy. Within 10 minutes of the place were: The Airbus Training Center (our destination), a FedEx Kinko's, several malls, Coral Gables (dining, shopping), the aforementioned supermarket and drug stores. Within 20 were: downtown, the cruise port, Miami Beach and Costco. Lest you think I'm biased: there were things that could use improvement -- my room had several burned out lights, the ceiling fan was so noisy that I couldn't sleep with it on, and the air conditioner was on it's last legs. I did NOT report these issues because I had precious little time in my room, and did not wish to have maintenance banging around, nor did I want to move after unpacking. However, I prefer a property where Quality Control is managed properly, and these items are addressed before a guest checks in. None the less, this is a solid B+ property, and I can't think of any place else I would rather stay if I had an extended visit to Miami in the future. One other thing that I did not like - each night menus from local delivery places were slid under my door.

I had the local number for the hotel in my cell, that is important because there is no phone at the airport to request a ride to their hotel.

I called the front desk and they changed our room to right across the hall, this room was nicer & had a decent view of the water. There was a small sitting area in the room with a couch & tv, and a separated bedroom with 2 double beds, a small kitchenette & a decent bathroom. The kitchenette was nice, had a fridge, a pantry with plates & silverware, coffee maker, dishwasher, microwave. The only negative as far as cleanliness goes was the glasses, & utensils. I would definitely run anything through the dishwasher before using it - the glasses were not clean & after that I didn't trust any of the dishes. The utensils had crud on them & obviously not clean. The fellow who picked us up from the airport did not seem to speak English, and seemed to be in a foul temper. In the daytime, the van driver was pleasant & very helpful and took me to the local mall to shop for pre-cruise items & then picked me up promptly when I called. This is a great service, if you don't have a rental car, because the hotel is out at the airport & not close to much. I was able to buy some items I forgot to pack at a Publix, bought some alcohol at a liquor store, and had a manicure at the same mall. The liquor store was the only down side - none of the bottles were marked with prices, and they wanted to charge me the same price for a small bottle of Baileys as a large. I had the feeling there are prices for obvious tourists such as myself, and fair prices for locals. As far as the staff goes, the front desk people were very helpful & the only unpleasant person was the guy driving the van the night we came from the airport. Maybe he had had a bad day. The breakfast in the morning was great, the room packed but the food was good & plentiful, with a great variety & good quality. The staff were great - my son did not get up in time & they helped me find a tray so I could bring food up for the both of us to our room. Couldn't ask for more really in terms of a nice & helpful staff. We got a great price for a hotel room in miami.
