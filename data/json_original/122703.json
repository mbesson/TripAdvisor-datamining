Room was awesome. Push button lights and window screen, relatively quiet but do not get a room close to the elevator (ding, ding, ding all night). Bathrooms are roomy. Workout facility is rockstar. I was here for a meeting, and the food was amazing. Gluten free cookies to die for. They have these shrimp avocado things served in shot glasses, and I literally could have downed 10 of them. The only reason I didn't was because all my other co-workers were beating each other up to get one. Service was really great. They helped us find our boxes, gave us whatever we needed, and were very prompt. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a meeting. Concierge was fantastic.

Service: Fabulous! our drinks were ordered and returned quite promptly, although we did have to get the beer replaced due to some odd bits floating in the glass. My husband and daughter also ordered the Angus Burgers with fries which I tried as well and all 3 of agree it was probably one of the tastiest burgers we have had in a long while. Breakfast: This was included in our rate and I was unable to finish mine, smoked salmon/cream cheese/capers bagel, freshly squeezed OJ, and coffee. Daughter had the ham & cheese panini, and hubby had a full breakfast. Once again it was lovely and the service was really good. Room: Lovely and comfy with a view over the runway, large bathroom with shower and bath, in room safe big enough for a full size laptop, fridge, iron, ironing board, yoga mat, bath robe and amenities. Roof top pool: Small but big enough to cool off in and pretty neat to be able to see the runway and terminals from there. Gym: Looked quite good but not for me, quite a few pieces of equipment. Checkout: Very swift Overall: We enjoyed our 2nd time here, just a shame there is no space for the night before our return journey so that we could take the opportunity to eat a proper meal in the restaurant as last time the food was outstanding.

When the flight was cancelled, we had to stay one more night in Dallas. We chose to stay at the airport grounds due to convenience. The hotel is located in terminal D and is easily accessible by airport tram. It turns out we weren't the only people staying due to cancellation. The check in staff reported she was out of king size beds but when we told her we had gold status, she quickly found a room with a king bed. Ironic, isn't it? we were hungry and tried out the restaurant and were told there would be an hour wait. It was Easter Sunday and American must have cancelled half of it's flights. The restaurant was poorly understaffed. We sat at the bar and due to our exhaustion, we ordered to go. The bartender was very busy and impatient. I realized why...she was the only person tending to all the customers at the bar, the snack area and the orders that the wait staff was putting in for drinks for the restaurant. Yes, she was the ONLY person. She ran around, flying from one end of the bar to the other, and back again and slamming glasses and wine bottles around. Soon we noticed she was so backed up, the wait staff started pouring their own wine. And not to mention the piles of dirty wine glasses, carafes, plates, sitting on top of the counter. We sat for an hour waiting for our food to go. We were lucky. Apparently people sitting down dining had a 2 hour wait. Maybe it was just a bad day/night. We ran into another couple on the elevator who bought food from the snack bar. They couldn't even get a plastic spoon. That's how bad it was. We proceeded to our room. It was right across the elevators. So you can hear everything. The room was very modernized, with a huge window that spanned the entire wall. Everything is electronic, and with a touch of a button, you can control the blinds, the lights , etc. The shower was quite small, the size of one I would expect in city living, such as DC. THere was a tub, opposite of stand up shower, that we didn't use. The bed was firm, too firm. When we woke up at 5 am the next morning, i hit the button \"soft light\", but it wasn't soft, it turned on all the lights and blinded me, instead. The worse part was hearing people talking and walking throughout the night. The rooms were fine, just request away from elevator.

There is a full service Spa. The gym has plenty of cardio and weight machines and along with the outdoor pool are open 24hrs. One downside is room service is not 24hrs. There is free parking and valet (fee) available. The rooms are very clean and while simple, they are roomy and include every amenity one would need. It's not as lavish as the Ritz Carlton or the Mandarin but still warrants a 5 star rating based on the service and location. You have to request a coffee maker but they offer complimentary \"illy\" coffee downstairs in the AM. Bathrooms include a separate tub & shower. Lots of granite. Also included is a yoga mat, bathrobe, iron & ironing board. All aspects of the service provided is exemplary and they deserve to be commended. To have such a nice hotel right in the airport is a real \"gem\". Sometimes the rates can be quite high, but always search for the various deals offered around.

The desk staff noted we had kids and placed us in a room facing the runway (think front row seats) so they could watch the planes take off and land.

We were obviously looking out at the roof of the building below, but it seemed quite futuristic. Certainly not something I would want to look on everyday, but it was really quite interesting for an overnight, and the window comes with an automatic shade that blocks the whole thing out.

It dispenses your room keys without ever having to speak to an agent. We also used it upon checkout and it was still easy to use and there is a drop box to drop your room keys into. The rooms at the Grand Hyatt DFW have been remodeled and the new electronic features (electronic shades & lights) are a nice touch. You can open/close the shades & turn on/off lights directly from a control panel on your night stand. It didn't appear that the bathrooms had been remodeled, however they are very spacious and it is nice to have a separate tub & shower. A nice perk of staying at the Grand Hyatt DFW is you can access the secure side of the DFW terminals directly from Terminal D. You have to let the front counter staff know that you want to take advantage of this and they will contact a DPS official to check your IDs. As long as everything checks out, they give you an entry pass to be able to get through the security checkpoint. You are required to go through an enhanced screening process, but it really was no big deal. Then you are able to take advantage of the restaurants within any terminal (since you can ride the SkyLink) or browse through the shops. Make sure you get there early though, because they can only issue the entry passes through 8pm, but you can stay in the terminal until it closes. We also used their Park Sleep Fly rate which includes 7 days of parking within your room rate.

On a recent trip to Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, Mexico, we were traveling through DFW from Washington DC. Due to forecasted snow on our day of departure, American Airlines cancelled our outbound flight and they re-booked us so that we over-nighted, at our expense though, in Dallas in order to catch the one-day-a-week flight to Ixtapa. You should note that there are two Hyatt hotels at DFW. In terminal C is the Hyatt Regency DFW and in terminal D is the Grand Hyatt. We decided to choose the Grand Hyatt given that our plane was due to leave from this very same terminal. To our surprise, the Grand Hyatt is a stunning hotel even superior to any city hotel in which we have stayed let along the reputation of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153airport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotels. In the event that you arrive at any other terminal, there are regular (free) airport shuttles that will take you to the Grand Hyatt in terminal D. For starters, once one collects their bags in terminal D, it is a very easy walk and an escalator ride to the elevators to the Hyatt. What struck me as we approached the hotel elevators was that the American Airlines check-in (for our following day departure) could not have been more than 50 steps away with the security area literally adjacent to it. Nothing like rolling out of bed and checking-in for your flight! Exiting the hotel elevator, you will be presented with a well appointed lobby to your left and to your right a very attractive bar and restaurant. This hotel also offers conference facilities that are rather impressive. Our west facing room was a suite on the sixth floor that was spacious with a living room and very large bedroom. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is modern and minimalist with a very fancy lighting and (electric) blind/curtain system. The standard amenities are all included. Yet, a peculiarity was noted that we never experienced: you have to call the reception so that they can deliver a coffee maker/pot for the room. This is very odd. Although the rooms are well insulated and may be stating the obvious, you will hear some noise of the departing aircrafts even if they may not be using the runways in front of terminal D. Yet, traffic subsides significantly after 10pm. A quick tour of the property is worth it not just to familiarize oneself, but to appreciate the many amenities. Aside from the expansive conference facilities and business center, it has a very good fitness center, outdoor pool and sun deck. Features that I am sure would come in handy when staying during warmer months. The restaurant is very large and attractive. We have a very tasty breakfast the following morning.

The stay started beautifully, as my American Airlines flight arrived in Terminal D. Minutes later I was in the lobby and enthusiastically greeted by the front desk staff. My slated room was not available, so the associate upgraded me to an executive suite with a runway view. As an airplane aficionado, the large windows afforded a perfect view of takeoffs and landings. And despite the proximity to the runway, the plane noises were surprisingly distant although still audible. The recently renovated guest rooms feature a modern look and amenities. There is a control panel to adjust the window shades and lighting and a comfortable chaise lounge next to the window (ideal for planespotting). The elegant bathroom includes a separate shower and bathtub. The executive suite included a living area with a desk, couch, and flat screen television. Outside the guest room, the Grand Met restaurant has mastered the art of table for one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is a row of seats with personal televisions. The food was above par for hotel fare, and the service was attentive. The fitness center is located on the top floor, and there is also a rooftop pool. For those venturing outside the airport, garage parking is included in the rate. In summary, the Grand Hyatt DFW is not just an airport hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is an exceptional hotel which happens to be at the airport. From the front desk associates to the housekeeping staff, the service was impeccable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c responsive, personable, and spirited.

I don't stay at Hyatt properties unless I have to, as a rule, because I haven't been happy with previous experiences. When I made these reservations I picked it for the location at the airport because our flight leaving Dallas was at 6am. When we arrived at DFW we did not go directly to the hotel but went and got our rental car. The DFW property is very large. We took a shuttle to the rental car location and then drove back to Terminal D where the Grand Hyatt is located. It is $25 to valet but self parking is free and really easy. You park in Terminal D on the same level as the front door of the hotel and there is a direct path to the Grand Hyatt escalators from the parking garage. My wife had an injury to her foot and they were able to get us a room next to an elevator but not right next to it. The room was a standard room but on their 8th floor facing the airport. The far wall is a whole window with automated sheers and blinds that open when the door to the room is opened. In fact all the lights were automated. The furnishings are modern and chic. The bed is amazingly comfortable with a posturpedic mattress. There is a chaise lounge also with plenty of seating, including two office chairs and an ottoman. The bathroom is expansive with a separate shower and tub. There is a mini bar. We ordered room service the following morning. Though my wife was still sleeping, the staff member Rachel, was quiet and able to arrange the table without being inconsiderate. Please note there is already an upcharge to the room service that includes gratuity. Roomservice is not 24 hours. We ordered room service for breakfast. I had the huevos rancheros, chicken sausage, coffee, and fresh berries. My wife had a crab and asparagus omelet with roasted potatoes and tea. The food was good, not excellent, but worth it. The berries were very fresh. The huevos rancheros I thought didn't have the spice I was expecting. My wife's omelet was better. The chicken sausage was processed into a horse shoe and a bit dry. I would pass on it. When you leave the airport, and I don't think this information is obvious on their website, is that you need to get a pass in and out of the airport grounds. To avoid paying any charges for parking you need an exit pass from the hotel each time you leave the airport. My wife and I would stay here again. It isn't hard to fly into a different terminal and get to the hotel and vice versa. We like this hotel for its style, the staff and its convenience.

Loyalty to a particular hotel chain has its perks, but I'm sure they would have been just as gracious to any guest. The porter provided us with fresh ice before leaving, which was a nice touch. The refrigerator had drinks/snacks for a fee which is prominently displayed so there are no surprises. I would have preferred to have an empty refrigerator, but to be fair, I did not ask for one.

I loved that there was enough room for two get dressed at the same time. As a hotel guest, you can request entrance behind security in the airport. The desk clerk called security. They came, filled out forms on my husband and me, and escorted us through the security line. It was required since we did not have boarding passes that we go through the usual security procedures and submit to a pat-down. The security personnel were professional and I was not offended in the least. After you have passed through security you have access to all the terminals through Skylink (which is very, very fast). All shops and restaurants are available to you. If you haven't been to DFW, there are many choices of restaurants. There are boards which tell what is available in every terminal. Pappadeaux's is located in Terminal B (I believe) and is situated on a lower level. It feels like a \"real\" restaurant, not an airport eatery. It was quiet, relaxed and had booths and tables without people running into you with their carryon luggage. After dinner we strolled through the terminals to get some exercise. It was nice of the Grand Hyatt to secure this privilege for their guests. We could have eaten at our hotel or taken the airport bus outside of security to the Hyatt Regency which is also located on airport property. With 2 hotels and all of the airport, you definitely have a lot of choices for dining if you stay at the Grand Hyatt. We ate breakfast in the formal hotel restaurant.

The Grand Hyatt was about 30% more expensive but after reviewing TripAdvisor I realized the extra cost was worth it. After clearing customs, I simply took a nearby elevator to the lobby of the Grand Hyatt DFW. Check-in was simple and I was in the room very quickly. The oversized elevators were great since I had a lot of luggage. My room was a deluxe king on the 8th floor and it was spacious. Having just arrived from London, I was ready to do the minimum that would get me into the bed and allow me to sleep. The extra-high ceilings meant the curtains were also extra-high but the rods made it easy to close them. I had a view over the parking area and never heard outside noises. The Hyatt bed was as comfortable as usual and I immediately went to sleep. When I woke I realized it was daylight but the curtains kept the room sufficiently dark. Even though there was no coffee maker in the room, there was a card stating you could ask for one or simply go to the lobby for a fresh cup of Illy coffee. Good coffee! Went to the lobby for breakfast and was impressed with the modern, miminal decor of the lobby restaurant. Breakfast was great - they had really cool coffee/tea cups. The breakfast I ordered could have fed a family of four. The server kept refilling the glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. Nice selection of newspapers, too. Breakfast could not have been better and it was included in my AAA rate. Returning to the room for a shower I realized the bathroom was also spacious. Double sink, tub, separate shower. Plenty of hot water and enough towels. The entire time I was at the hotel, I could not believe this was in my terminal. This hotel really allows you to escape the airport. Checked out at noon and took the elevator to the terminal. The check-in counter for domestic flights (American) was unbelievably close. I'm glad I paid the extra for the Grand Hyatt because I did not have to catch a shuttle to a hotel. The convienence was well worth the extra dollars to me.

It is what you would expect of a high end hotel. It is immaculately kept and the service is first class. I had a King room on the 2nd floor and loved it, the separate shower was a nice change and a real treat. I was lucky enough to have good weather on the afternoon i arrived so had a dip in the rooftop pool, a great experience, i didnt use the gym as i tend to pass out if i train directly after a long flight but it looked well equipped. I chose to have dinner off site, I wanted somewhere informal to eat as I was travelling alone and wouldnt feel comfortable eating in plush full service restaurant. There is a bar but none of the bar food tempted me, i wanted a good steak and a bud light and some sports on a TV to watch. Not really a criticism i guess as that isnt the theme of this hotel but i do think a bit more variety in dining options would be nice. The one criticism i do have however is i did not have free internet and had to pay $9.99 to have 24 hour internet access. Its been a long time since Ive stayed anywhere in the US that didn't have free internet access in the rooms and public areas, so its strange this upscale business centric hotel does not provide it for its guests. Breakfast in the morning was superb, i would say its the best ive had in the US anywhere. Overall id say for an overnight or conference this is a perfect hotel and not to pricey given what you get, but for a longer stay I would probably go off airport to have better variety of eateries. And please Hyatt, spend a few $'s and give your guests internet access, if motels charging $50 or less a night can manage it, im sure you can!", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel at DFW\u201d", "Author": "EagleDad", "ReviewID": "UR101572858", "Content": "Flew into DFW and stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a meeting the next day.

I was so glad I chose to stay here. I arrived on Friday and departed Monday. I received a weekend AAA rate of $157.00 the first 2 nights and stayed using Hyatt points the 3rd night of my stay. My room was very spacious and facing the runway, which I requested. You can hear engine noise but it really is quite muffled due to the great job of noise isolation. Check-in was quick and flawless. I was upgraded to a 2 room suite due to my status with Hyatt. The room was very spacious and had a large Plasma TV and desk.. The bedding was extremely comfortable and for once I stayed at a property that had what I consider to be the most comfortable pillows. Whats the use of having comfortable beds if the pillows are stiff or floppy, right? The bathroom had a walkin shower and a seperate bathtub. There was a granite topped sink with all the amenities including a travel size tube of toothpaste and a bottle of Scope mouthwash as well as soaps. moisterizers and shampoo. The shower spray volume was very good. The towels were soft and absorbant. The room temperature air conditioner was set to a minimum of 65 degrees. it was quiet and extremely efficient. The restaurant/lounge areas are connected. I had Breakfast and Dinner and the waitstaff was not only competant and efficient, but also extremely courteous and friendly. Sometimes this is hard to accomplish without coming across as being phony, but everyone's genuine goal was to make you feel as comfortable as possible. They accomplished this. If you want to see things you do need to rent a car. I learned from checking out rental rates a month ago that if you rent cars during the weekend on the same day as the rental, you will get some last minute, almost desperate rates just so they can earn some money. I needed a car for Saturday and Sunday. I secured a rental car from Advantage Rent a Car(a subsidiary of Hertz) for $5.00 each day. Thats $10.00 total for 2 days plus taxes which were a lot more than the rental rate. I picked up the car on Saturday morning and returned it Sunday afternoon. If I remember correctly the parking was $19.00 so this was extremely affordable. There are a ton of restaurants and shopping malls in nearby Grapevine. Downtown Dallas took me about 25 minutes to get to once I left the rental center.Six Flags Amusement park, Arlington Stadium and the new Dallas Cowboy Stadium are located in the same area and only 15 minutes from the airport.

Decided to stay at DFW because of early morning flight back to LAX. Hotel is very modern. My room was quite new and everything worked well and was clean. There was a separate regular tub and a stand up shower. The bath was done in black granite tiles - very elegant. Had some minor snafus with staff - I was sent a fax and it took a day to get to me despite asking several times about it - no one knew it was there for me - also some delay with a drink at the bar resulting in a complimentary drink. My meal at the restaurant was excellent - rack of lamb. Restaurant service was excellent. The restaurant and bar are very elegant. You have the option to sit at a private TV while in the bar - something I have not seen before. The restaurant brought me a cute little book light to read by since I was sitting alone. A nice touch I had not seen before. The hotel room comes with a decent selection in the minibar, at a price of course. Hotel is right at terminal D and the security lines were never long there - it was easy to get in there. One unexpected issue was the vast size of the DFW property - I had to get a rental car and drive into town. It took me 1.5 hours door to door from my room to the place I was going in town. Mainly because one has to wait for the rental car bus - ride the bus, then get the car - then my directions to my location were from the north side of DFW but the cars live on the south side and it takes some time just to drive from one end of the property to the other. But this is not the fault of the hotel - just something to be aware of if you are staying at DFW. Hotel comes with e-checkin and e-checkout. I did both - the latter turns out they did not list my gold passport number so I am waiting to hear from them about crediting the stay - it was on the original reservation. I suggest to watch the bill carefully - they billed me for the fax while it was still lost to me so I had to ask to have that charge removed because I did not receive the fax when it was billed. Apparently someone got the fax, charged me for it, and then did not connect with anyone else in the hotel to let me know it had arrived or to arrange for it to come to my room. On top of that, the bill did not mention a fax per se - just business center which I had not been to and did not know even existed. In terms of sleep quality my room was exceedingly quiet. I asked for a quiet room I was put on the 7th floor facing terminal C. I could see the other hyatt in the distance and the planes taking off on the runway behind the other hyatt. I could not hear the planes or much else. There was no noise from the nearby rooms or from the hallway either. There was a conference of engineering fellows from Raytheon while I was there I guess they are a quiet bunch thankfully. I think the hotel was full when I was there but you could not tell except for the lively business in the bar and restaurant. My bed was comfortable. I asked for no feathers and got that. However I had trouble with allergies in my room I am not sure what it was from I took antihistamine the second night which fixed the allergies but kept me awake. The A/C works exceedingly well however it does blow directly on the bed which might have been part of the problem. I had a AAA rate of $207-237/night during my two nights.

Honestly, the rate was almost $100 less than the listed rate on Hyatt's web site and about $200 less than I paid in April. Wow. This time, unlike the first trip, I was given a room overlooking the runways. I have to admit I enjoyed watching the planes come and go. The rooms aren't completely soundproof. You can hear the muffled roar of the engines but it really didn't bother me at all. Also, you are allowed to go into the secured area of the airport as a guest of the hotel. All you do is go to the front desk or concierge and they call an officer to come get you and take you to security. I might say here that the Hyatt staff is very attentive to your needs. The officer has to fill out a form but it only took me about 20 minutes from the time I came downstairs until the time I went through security. When I got to the first security checker I was escorted by a TSA officer straight to the metal detectors checkpoint area and went right through. There are many good places to shop and eat at Terminal D. The officer did say that if you wanted to come out of the secured area and go back in later you had to go through the whole process again. He told me that it was best to do it before 8 p.m. I didn't sample the restaurant but they do have a 24-hour area that sells pastry and sandwiches and soft drinks which I utilized when I got back to the hotel late Saturday. The only downside is that I did have to pay for airport parking. That added $23 to the bill but considering the rate I got it was still a bargain. I went to DFW to see a play at the Music Hall at Fair Park and to go the final round of the Colonial PGA event in Fort Worth. An airport hotel might not seem to be the best location for this, but really the freeways get you around the Metroplex pretty quick and there's easy access from the airport. But beware that the traffic can look clear one minute and be backed up the next. It took me about a half-hour to get from the airport to the I-30, I-35, I-45 interchange, and it took me an hour from there to get to Fair Park which was probably just another five miles. But that was because there was a Brooks and Dunn concert that night at the Superpages venue, which is also in Fair Park. It was maybe a little over 30 minutes to the Colonial in very light traffic. All in all, I would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt again regardless of what my plans are.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northborough, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Hotel Great location\u201d", "Author": "Miusa", "ReviewID": "UR64311457", "Content": "Stayed here during a brief business trip.

For main we both had Steak which was good as well, although my husband's was not cooked as he wanted Medium / Well it was still a bit red inside, they offered to recook it for him which he declined as I would have finished mine by the time his came back and that would have spoilt the evening more. This was served with straw fries that had way too much salt on them (apparently Texan's like them like that) and a Port Jus. No pudding for me but an apple tart a la mode for my other half. We also had breakfast the next morning and that too was lovely, mine was a toasted Bagel with cream cheese, smoked Salmon and Capers, my husband had fried eggs, sausage, herb breadcrumbed filled tomato and asparagus. All very nice indeed. The customer service from all whom we spoke with / came into contact with was outstanding! Nothing and I mean nothing was too much trouble for anyone.

If you are not flying till the following day you have the ability to go into departures area from the Hyatt, you ask the Concierge and they arrange for a uniformed officer to come escort you after they have completed a few details and called a colleague to run a check on you with details taken from your driving licence. They then escort you to the security screening area which is just at the bottom of the escalators, here they present the paperwork and us to the TSA officer who take us to one side for seperate screening, this does not take long just the normal standard screening you would go through along with a \"pat down\" once this is cmplete you are free to go anywhere in DFW terminals via the Skylink so you can go have a look around the other teminals and eat / drink /shop whilst you are there.

DFW is a massive airport and requires some time to get acclimated as the ground transportation system - along with the airport car rental / parking / airport roadways - is quite extensive and can be confusing. The hotel is nice with big, clean rooms and large bathrooms. The view of the runway is cool. We were on the 6th floor and noise was not an issue. We found that food options were limited though. The hotel restaurant is very expensive. You are permitted to access the restaurants located within Terminal D but getting the security clearance card from the hotel (I think done by Dallas PD) and then working through the airport security lines can be very time consuming. And it causes a bit of a stir at airport security when you are without a boarding pass. We went through some extra scrutiny. As to location - we concluded that it would have been better for us to have stayed in downtown Dallas.

I drive between Texas and Oklahoma and am seeking a mid-way point. I think I've found it. The staff working at this hotel are outstanding. The concierge were very attentive and took care of issues quickly. It was my birthday, and a wonderful concierge sent me a small snack of chocolate covered strawberries. It was so lovely to receive, as I was working on my birthday and was without family. The room is large and clean with a great view of the airport landing strips. The bed had 9 pillows. The bathroom has a separate shower and bath. All amenities are included-- slippers, bathrobe, full-size soaps, nice-smelling shampoo, Starbucks coffee, large TV, etc. I have T-mobile for internet, and the hotel did not charge extra. The pool is fantastic and you have a real treat watching the planes take off and land. The gym has several treadmills and high quality gym equipment. You have a view of the airport as you jog. The spa can get busy, and I could not get an appointment on Saturday short notice. Although you are at the airport, it seems the hotel has made an effort to minimize the noise. If you are very sensitive, you should bring earplugs. I had no problems, but some large 747s can come in at all hours. Terminal D was not very busy, and the concierge can provide you with a pass to pick up dinner, etc. I think the regular price for this hotel is typically <$200 if you book far enough in advance or have a corporate rate. The value and service for the price I paid is excellent. A lot of reviews have probably been written for this hotel, as it is in the airport.

Floor 4 is 1/2 smoking and 1/2 non-smoking, therefore, I recommend non-smokers avoid. Also, watch the rates on the Hyatt website; the rates can fluctuate quite a bit and if you secure a lower rate be sure to request an email confirmation as the hotel does not appear to get the revised rate.
