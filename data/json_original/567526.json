The Prestipino is in an ideal location for visiting Florence, something that only dawned on us after a few days of walking in every direction to find basics such as breakfast and booze! Its 5 minutes from the train station one way and the river the next, the further away you walk from the Gucci and Prada shops, the cheaper the shops are for food and drinks. The room we stayed in was like a mini apatment, much bigger than expected, right next to the main exit and across from two nice sized bathrooms. Unless we bumped into someone in the corridor you would have thought that you had the floor to yourself, that is until the cleaner arrives in the morning and has an insanely loud conversation at 9am (could get annoying). Within 2 minutes walk there is a great restaurant on the corner of the road, an internet cafe, a mini market and a bar/restaurant or two. You do have to go up a few stairs to get to your room, but in Italy that is pretty much the norm. Its not the place for people who want to socialise but it was nice, clean, fabulously air-conditioned and we even had a shower and sink in our room if we were feeling to lazy to walk the 2m to the bathroom.", "Date": "Sep 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR200903061", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "natz14"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d567526-r12814460-Soggiorno_Prestipino-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "567526", "Price": "$96"}}
