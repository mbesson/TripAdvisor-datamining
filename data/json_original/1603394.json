Easy to find, Good access to everything. Unit. Kitchen appliances appeared brand new, furniture was comfortable and in good condition. One BR unit - the BR was small and cramped. King bed took up the whole room but bed was firm and comfortable. LR and kitchen were fine. Insufficient soap and towels. No housekeeping or linen exchanges unless you paid extra for it. We stayed a full week and felt we should have received at least one mid-week cleaning and linen replacement. Grounds. Lovely and well maintained. Two nice outdoor pools, grill/picnic area, sufficient parking. Amenities. Breakfast buffet & entertainment activity cost $9. The breakfast was fine but the \"entertainment\" consisted of tiny snippets from various Branson shows that were trying to get customers. We felt we had been misled into paying for 2 hours of commercials. Had we known this we would not have attended. Ticket sales. We checked around a lot for coupons and discounts, and found that we actually saved more by buying our tickets at the front desk. This was a surprise. Corey did a great job and got us excellent seats at all our shows. Traffic. Bumper to bumper until Monday, Labor Day, when everyone went home.

Location was great because of the easy access to back streets so we didn't have to traverse through the main drag.

It was peaceful and quiet. The rooms were clean, but the master bedroom is rather small. The pool was the perfect size - even in the evening when a lot of people were there, it did not feel too crowded. The only downside is that they do not have internet access in the rooms. They advised that internet is available at the pool and at the check in building. However, it only worked at the pool about 50% of the time. The walk back to the main building is quite an uphill hike, so we had to do without internet for most of our stay there. The location is very convenient to all the nearby attractions and within walking distance to several restaurants. The staff were friendly and the jetted tub was a very nice perk.

I've seen other reviews complaining about lack of privacy. This was not our experience AT ALL! There is a locking door on the bedroom, and two locking doors in the bathroom (one that opens to the bedroom and one to the hallway). I didn't have a chance to visit the pools (2) while I was there, but they looked to have plenty of room. If I were traveling with my husband and two children (13 yr. old girl, 7 yr. old boy), I would want to get a two bedroom unit so they could have separate space.

The location is great. While the office sits on 76, the condos themselves are closer to Green Mountain Rd. There is a lot of Branson that is walkable from here IF you are healthy and fit. Anything you walk to from here involves a climb including to the office. Our family walked to the Titanic, Wax Museum and Butterfly Palace from here. A ton of restaurants can be walked to from here as well. The condo itself was a nice, well furnished 2 bedroom, 2 full bath. It was clean and in working order. The bed was comfortable. The second bedroom was a queen instead of 2 twins for kids but it was workable. The kitchen was well stocked and had modern appliances. The master bedroom was small but functional. Two small closets on each side of the bed were OK for 1 person to use. The master bath was huge with two sinks. One oddity was that the washer and dryer is in the master bath. That by itself was fine but the bathroom is not separated from the master bedroom. So using the washer and dryer or showering or getting ready will disturb your partner if they are trying to sleep later than you. We'd have preferred some pocket or french doors on the bathroom. The master bedroom has an LCD TV mounted on the wall without a DVD player. The living room has an older CRT TV but does have a DVD player. Because of the older televisions here nothing appears to be in high definition. However, the cable TV lineup is decent and it does include a movie channel. The grounds are nice. The two pools are clean and quite large. There is shuffleboard, ping pong and exercise equipment also. There are plenty of options for gas and charcoal grills on the grounds as well as places to eat outside. No concessions are served any where though, as expected. You would prepare it all yourself. There is WIFI available at the pool and at the clubhouse. Unfortunately, there is no Wi-Fi of any sort available in the units themselves which is disappointing.

It is at the end (or beginning) of Highway 76. So kinda nice to be out of the middle of Branson activity. We were in a 2 bedroom/2 bath downstairs unit. It was equipped with everything you need. It had a very large master bath with plenty of linens throughout. Flat screen tv's in both bedrooms and living room, stackable washer and dryer and a large dining table. The landscape is very well maintained, but this is not a gated entrance or exit complex. We were in a unit at the back of the property with quick access/entrance out of the complex. This would be a plus during peak times in Branson since traffic on 76 could be gridlock. We were there in somewhat an off season (early April) so some shows we're still closed. The Titanic exhibit was terrific, well worth the admission. Ninety minutes of very professionally layed out exhibit. Saw the Jim Stafford show, it was terrible with his two children doing 1/2 the show. He has been doing the show for 23 years and has a drone like quality. The Rib Crib was excellent on Tuesday with all you can eat pork ribs, service was great.

When I first saw this misspelling on the phone covers in my room, I thought this lack of attention to detail would forecast a bad and disappointing stay. Thankfully, these typos were not a taste of things to come. The location and staff at French Quarter are excellent. Although the site is away from the hustle and bustle farther down the strip and in downtown, the main highway is at the front door, and an alternative route to avoid traffic is at the back door. It's quiet but close enough to all the shows, restaurants, and entertainment you might want to enjoy. French Quarter has several 4-story condo buildings, yet I did not receive any telemarketing calls during my stay. My 1-bedroom unit included a smallish bedroom with a full-size bed, small bathroom, and a kitchen/dining/living area. The space was more than enough for me to spread out and be comfortable during my visit, and I used the closet washer and dryer more than once. The furnishings were worn but clean and adequate. Because I was on the 4th floor, my unit included a large balcony that overlooked the hillsides of Branson. I especially enjoyed using the jets in the bathtub to relax after a long day of climbing, walking, and sightseeing around Branson. The closet in the bedroom was small, yet I had plenty of room for my items. Although the unit was advertised to sleep 4, two people would have slept in the bedroom and two people would have slept on the pull-out couch. It would have been uncomfortable but doable for four people to share the one small bathroom. The kitchen/dining room/living area would have been very comfortable for four people. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The gentleman who checked me in went out of his way to make me feel welcome, and Corey Engstrom at the ticket counter helped me find my way around. Internet access is not available in the units, but it is available until 10 pm at the main office. Every time I visited the office, the staff were friendly and helpful. Staying in a condo is always a bit tricky. Sometimes I'm uncertain whether I need to bring cooking utensils, sheets and towels, or paper goods. French Quarter provides cooking and eating utensils plus sheets and towels for 4. Paper goods are enough for one person for a little over a week, but you can purchase extra paper towels and toilet paper at the office. Shampoo and soap were included in the bathroom, but I'm glad that I bought along my own things. Dish soap and dishwasher soap were more than adequate, but the unit included only one packet of laundry soap. The primary reasons for my star rating are the lack of Internet availability in each unit; the need for some new furnishings; and the small size of the bedroom and bathroom. Yet these were offset by the great location, great staff, and peaceful atmosphere. When I return to Branson, I'll probably stay here again if the location meets the needs of myself and my travel party.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Dawn27reed", "ReviewID": "UR120786710", "Content": "This was our second time.

The Olive Garden and Cracker Barrell are an easy walk and the Red Route is just up the street. A bit of advice about room location. Our original room was on the first floor in building 6 and there was a very high concrete wall only 10' or 12' from the patio, giving it a very claustrophobic feel. The front desk staff was more than accommodating in moving us to a 3rd floor unit in building 3 where we had a nice balcony. All of the 1st floor units have a patio, although none were as closed in as building 3, and all other units in all of the buildings have a balcony. We've stayed in 3 different time shares in Branson and would definately return to the The French Quarter, but I would make sure we did not have a 1st floor.

If you are flying to Branson as we did, try out the new Branson airport which opened in May 2009. This airport is closer than the Springfield airport. We love to travel and always want to save money. Try out the winery tour, which is free. The Ride the Ducks was only $20 per person, and the Duck picked up a group of guests from the resort. Branson is the live entertainment capital of the world, so you have to see the shows. Many sources would suggest you buy your tickets online before arriving to Branson or at the airport upon arrival. We did neither. We were able to see three free shows and received $100 in cash in return for attending two timeshare presentations. If you don't mind sitting through the presentations, this may be an option for you. Timeshare salespeople approached me at the Apple supermarket and at the outlet mall.
