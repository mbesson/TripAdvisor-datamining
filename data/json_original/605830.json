There was a communal shower in the hallway too though so at least two of us could have a shower at the same time (not together I hasten to add....) My mates on the next floor up though didn't have a shower, only a basin. Location wise it's excellent - 5 minute walk from Amsterdam Central Station, which in turn is only 10 min train ride from the airport. With regards to attractions etc, 5 minute walk to Dam Square, Sex Museum, Red Light District etc - Amsterdam is quite a small city actually and we never walked more than 15 minutes to get anywhere. If you're looking for a cheap room to get a decent sleep, this will do nicely - if you're used to your hotel luxuries, then perhaps not. Only bad thing I will say is about the stairs in this hotel.

The location is also superb- It's about a 15 minute walk (or short tram ride) away from Dam square and Leidlesplein is a wonderful hub of entertainment (particularly in the evening), with some fantastic and comparatively cheap restaurants surrounding it. There's even a bar boasting 30 shots for 27euros, though despite this, we were never disturbed at night. We also had access to the free wifi, which was useful. So, asides from the fact that they still haven't gotten round to fixing the lift (and the card machine not being in working order) which really are very minor complaints, it was a great stay and a great trip.

The room's door opens directly onto reception, from where, throughout the night, you will hear people beeping themselves in, laughing, singing, professing mutual affection and thanking each other for a wonderful, nay unforgettable, evening. I only slept by taking sleeping pills. Strong sleeping pills, like you take when flying long-haul in economy class. With whisky. The room itself has the manner of a room that used to be a luggage room. I've spent decades staying at European hotels and do not have American expectations of spaciousness. But the room simply was not wide enough to make it qualify as a room, even in Amsterdam. Look at the picture! Would you want to stay there? Would you?! I complained to staff about the room. They seemed to be used to receiving complaints about the room, and about the broken Wi-Fi, but still did not seem terribly concerned. (One girl appeared to have developed a Dutch version of the Gallic shrug, which one almost has to respect.) But I was moved to a room on the first floor -- room 101 -- when it became available the next day, and this room wasn't bad at all. Nice little view of the canal, conveniently close to the communal bathroom, entirely spacious enough for one person, and good value for money. For an extremely no-frills hotel room in central Amsterdam, room 101 isn't bad, thanks to the canal view. If you do book with this hotel, make it abundantly and repeatedly clear that you don't want any of the three rooms on the ground floor -- they will all be very very noisy. No-one should stay in room 26. Only book it for someone you hate.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ghent, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cgood for once\u201d", "Author": "justbiekris", "ReviewID": "UR111163308", "Content": "friendly staff, everything clean, and in compare with other locations in amsterdam very cheep breakfast.

The hotel itself is quite easy to find, although its MUCH easier to just get the 197 bus from the airport to Liedseplien (4euros) instead of the route which they specified! The location of the hotel is problably the best thing! 3mins walk from Leidsplien and all the shops, restaurants and coffee shops. About a 15mins walk from the red light district and Dam Square. Close but not TOO close to everything! Our room didnt over look the canal but it was just near by. A few problems initially with checking it, but they were sorted quite switfly. The staff were quite friendly and always on hand whenever I had a problem or needed directions. The room itself was TINY, about the size of my bedroom - and we stayed in an Economy Double room. Its fine if your staying with someone who your used to staying in confined spaces with, for a girly trip thoughid suggest a bigger room! Although it was very clean, I had no complaints in terms of hygiene and I'm pratically OCD when it comes to these things. The bed was comfy, quite large and clean sheets and towels were provided. My one complaint is that the room wasn't cleaned atall for the ENTIRE duration of our stay. We're both smokers and smoked in the room and didn't incur any form of fine so i'm going to say the hotel is SMOKERS FRIENDLY. Just ensure u specify a smoking room before hand!!

The moment you opened the door..the bed is just 2 meters away from the bed and the bathroom is another 3 meters..and that is it. What we l liked about this hotel was... 1)Its location is strategic and you can basically go anywhere from there without much hassle. Pretty easy..as long as you have a map with you. 2)The staffs were pretty helpful with directions... We were moved to another room when we decided to extend one more day as our first room was already booked by somebody else. But anyway, this time, the room faced..(well slightly faced the canal). This room was much larger...and not facing construction site..less noise...but still...the carpet was dirty!! Window still broken... Overall..it is just ok-ok.

We went to the desk to check in we found out about the 5% surcharge of paying with a credit card. After a hard days travel we didn't have the energy to climb the stairs again to find the ATM to get cash for the 2 day stay in the Hotel. Then we had to pay insurance if we wanted a remote for the TV which we did and were handed a remote that we found out later didn't work for our TV in our room and they never found one that did. The TV is mounted up on a wall so since I'm not the tallest person I had to climb up on a chair every time I wanted to change stations or the volume on the TV. I was kind of startled when I entered the room it seemed to be dirty, there were cigarette burns in the carpet and the small desk and there was a big gap torn out of the curtains. Only every other light bulb in the room worked but they replaced that quickly when we asked them to. Due to renovations on the floor we were staying on our room had a heavy smell of paint. And during our stay it was quite noisy due to the renovations but at night the hotel was nicely quiet. The bathroom in our room was quite shabby and the shower wasn't separated from the rest of the room so every time someone takes a shower the whole bathroom gets wet and the floor dangerously slippery. My husband took a shower and didn't notice a puddle of water that had collected at the door then so I went to use the bathroom and stepped int to the puddle and took a tumble on the slippery floor and I was just lucky not to get seriously hurt. With this kind of arrangement they should really have some kind of squeaky to get the water of the floor and down the drain after an shower. We had \"pets\" in our room a pair of some kind of beetles which I did my best to throw out the window when I could catch them but there always seemed to be more of them so finally I gave up. The staff in the reception often seemed rather uninterested in helping and it could take a good while to get service from them even if you were the only one there. The breakfast there was OK nothing fancy and rather pricey for it's quality. The good thing about this hotel is it's location it is right next to the Leidseplein that has a lot of fine restaurants and shops. Its only a short walk to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum.

When we arrived the exterior of the place was covered in scaffolding and shade cloth and we had to duck under a metal pole to be able to climb the steep stairs to the reception. Our main reason for choosing to stay at this place was that it was listed in the Europe on a shoestring Lonely Planet Guide book, and it's seemingly reasonable price compared to other hotels in Amsterdam. But boy do you get what you pay for (in a bad way). We checked in and they wouldn't let me use my Travelex Cash Passport Card to pay, which is meant to be able to be used at any place that accepts Visa Credit cards. I was a bit suss about this since a few reviews on this site had warned about giving this place your credit card details. WARNING: If you are planning to pay by credit card they charge you a 5% surcharge. hmmph great! So when we were given our room key and we went to get in the lift to go upstairs the receptionist stopped us and said that she had forgotten to tell us that our room was actually in the basement of the hotel. We scaled the sticky stained red carpet that went downstairs with our luggage to see a room at the end of the corridor that looked like the janitors closet. When we managed to unjam open our door the stench hit us of extreme mould and g0d knows what else. The stained, sticky carpet stuck to your shoes with every step. Needing to go to the bathroom, my boyfriends stepped into the room, only just big enough to stand in, to find that it was wet on the walls and the floor. The ceiling was dark with mould and it became clear to us where that stench was coming from. There was no actual shower recess so when you showered (if you dared to) the whole bathroom would flood. The toilet made a noise like the world was coming to an end when you flushed it. The bed linen was stained with blood and other body fluids. The only window in the room which we opened to try improve the smell, opened into a courtyard where the hotel's dumpster was and the staff chained up their bicycles, which then opened onto the street. We went out and walked around the city for hours just to avoid having to stay in our room, but when we returned and none of us wanted to lay down on the bed to go to sleep, we decided that it was ridiculous that we were paying to stay a place like that. At 2am, we went up to reception to complain and see about cancelling our next 2 nights stay, and the guy on night duty at reception seemed to understand that room 002 was substandard to stay the least. He came and mopped the bathroom and gave us fresh towels and bed linen, apologising and promising to move us to a better room the next day. The room we were moved to was on the top floor (401), was a bit better, but they still didn't give us soap, towels or really clean the room at all the whole time we were there.

On the whole I think we got what we payed for we were not expecting luxuary because we had'nt payed for luxuary. We got clean basic rooms in an ideal location. We all said we would go back there again.

I meant to write a review about it when i returned - but time flew and here I am booking another IBC stay which reminded me of the horrible stay in 2006 at the Quentin. First treat was that they cut the rooms in half to get more rooms in the hotel. I barely fit in a double with my luggage. Further, my neighbors were late nite prowlers who went at it loudly at all hours of the nite. Wouldn't have been so bad but the walls were so paper thin I could have sworn I was in the room with them (creepy). Second was the film of filth and dirty underpants in the hallway. Love seeing that first thing in the morning. Just plain gross. Third - you want to watch TV to drown out your neighbors? have to pay for the remote - note - it doesn't mean tthat the tv works (it probably doesnt - it didn't in 2 of the 3 rooms we rented). Fourth - what is that discusting smell? Is it sewage? There were so many moments of \"oh my god this is discusting\" that I can't list them. I can only warn people never to stay there. A youth hostel is a better bet. I will leave you with this... my room wasn't nearly as bad as my colleague who was stuck int he basement. They gave him a \"single\" which used to be a closet. They couldn't fit a full twin. The only saving grace was that he was next to the boiler room which took his mind off the fact that he was in a box. Last... they had the gall to charge additional if you paid with a credit card. what a dump.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cPoor Value for money\u201d", "Author": "Caroline31", "ReviewID": "UR6045342", "Content": "Stayed in the Quentin Hotel from 24 to 27 October. STeps to hotel are steep and there is very little leg room on them. Rooms are tiny. The room we stayed in was over luggage room, which was in fact a boiler room so the heat was unbearable. It was like a sweat box. Could not open the window at nite time because it was too noisy. On website it said there was a bar but when i asked they told me no. Towels were not changed in the room while we stayed there. Staff were friendly and helpful. I feel the hotel was poor value for money and the money was taken from my account as soon as I checked in.

Not only did it ooze inefficency it was just plain horrible. For example: No towels in the rooms and when requested for one (yes just the one) it took near on 15 mins to receive it. Room was a suppose to be a double, all I'll say is it was a good job I was staying on my own !! Carpet was grubby, the wardrobe was on it's last legs - and I mean that literaly, as bits were hanging off it! The phone didnt work. The shower took 10 mins for warm water to filter through and then we it finally did it was unregulated - shift from warm to scolding hot in a flash. Radiator didnt work full stop ! Basically I was very disappointed and would not stay at the place again. In addition to the above they made you pay on arrival and swiped your credit card for good measure - just in case you damaged your room !! And their computer system seemed to ran at less than a snails pace. Apologies if you think this is really damning but it is an honest and frank opinion. I only wish I'd booked up earlier at one of the other nearby hotels!!", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset, UK", "Title": "\u201cNot so good . . .\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4952024", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with a work colleague from 5th April 2006 for two nights. We were less than impressed. On arrival, we were made to pay in full for our two night stay and we were then asked for an imprint of our credit cards because \"we've had things broken in the rooms before\". Nice to be branded a vandal the moment you walk in! There was then confusion over the rooms we'd booked even though we had our confirmation slips with us. My colleague ended up in what can only be described (at best) as a broom cupboard. It was tiny plus the wardrobe and other fittings were literally falling apart. No towels in either of our rooms meant we both had to go back to reception to ask for some, only to be met by a large queue of people (also seemingly not happy with proceedings) waiting to check-in. Breakfast in the hotel is extra and, again, they make you pay for it on arrival. Our advice to you is don't. Go out and find something in the nearby square - it'll be better food and better value. Our overall impression of the Quentin hotel is that it's being run on a (very thin) shoestring and for 100 Euro's a night, I expected better. There are other hotels in Amsterdam for similar money on this site, some of which get great reviews, so my advice is to stay in one of them.", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Quentin Amsterdam Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d605830-Reviews-Quentin_Amsterdam_Hotel-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$70 - $204*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Leidsekade 89</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1017 PN</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "605830", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/28/8d/6c/double-room.jpg"}}
