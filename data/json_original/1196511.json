Easy to take public transportation to the old part of the city, or about a 45 minute walk from the hostel (definitely do-able). The staff was really helpful and suggested cheap (but good) places to eat for poor college kids like myself. The place they suggested was so good we actually ate there twice. The owner also upgraded our room to a dorm with less people for no extra charge. The room was clean, no frills but I didn't have high expectations since it was a hostel. Shower was ok, a little below par but it was fine for the couple days we were there.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adana, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cNew Years Eve, Cant beat it!\u201d", "Author": "bgannon1230", "ReviewID": "UR116587997", "Content": "I went with my wife and two other friends from 29 December-02 January.

It was a lifesaver, and was even a better rate than the other. The hostel is right near everything in Beyoglu, with clubs, bars, cafes, and shopping. The owner is funny and helpful, and there are usually interesting and friendly people staying there. Not to mention, it's really clean!

This made us a bit anxious but it never became a problem. Because let's face it. If you want to live in such a lively amazing part of this wonderful city at this time of the year - there HAS to be some (or should I say a lot of) noise and there HAS to be mosquitoes. And we slept all 5 nights with no issues. The people we met at this hostel were amazing and it really didn't matter wether there was no lockers or not. We pretty much trusted each other. But I can see it beeing an issue if you cannot trust your roommates - and sometimes you just can't. Another good thing is the fact that they serve breakfast 'till 10.30! That's a treat! We managed to get out of bed and get down at the cafe 10.25 every day just to get the egg, the bread, the tomato, the cucumber and the olives;) The only thing that did bother us was Ahmed the owner. You must remember always to say hello and pay a lot attention to him and what he is saying. He seemed to have a hard time understanding that we had other things to do in Istanbul than to sit and hang out with him every night...
