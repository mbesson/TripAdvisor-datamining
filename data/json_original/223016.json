He even gave me free bottled water when I asked for change so I could hit up the vending machines. If you ask, they have a printed map of a running trail near the hotel. My mom was going to go but was hesitant about running in the area by herself, so she hit the gym instead. She had a great workout but since treadmills are limited, she had to quit at 3 miles because there were 2 people waiting in line at 7 in the morning. The rooms were clean and quiet. The hotel is definitely within walking distance of Universal if you're used to walking. It took us fifteen minutes of brisk walking to get to the gate (and we're both runners), but beware if you're going to walk a lot at the park - the walk back to the hotel is a lot harder than the walk there, haha. Also, go left down Kirkland and right on Major instead of walking down Vineland - it's faster (we tried both). Breakfast was great. Lots of options.

I hope you find this information very useful. The Fairfield is located in a convenient location near plenty of places to eat that are walking distance. Many local restaurants to choose from are very close, with delivery as an option for most. We had pizza delivered once by Flippers. It was good stuff. Not top shelf, but it will not disappoint. Ale house across the parking lot serves good bar food and has sports on the TV. I think the Ale house is the place to handout on the weekend; parking lot is crowded in the evening. Good starting point if you want to drink, because city walk drinks can be expensive. Free breakfast is included \u00e2\u20ac\u201c need I say more. I will, the regular employee, Nadia was very sweet and helpful. She made the waffles each morning, served breakfast, and clean up after us. I gave her a tip, and she gave my family 4 bottles of water each day, and a bunch of bananas plus special K cereal snacks. If you stay here please tip, since your breakfast is free. Breakfast alone will cost you while staying in Orlando, where a tip is how they make a living. I deducted some points here because of the eating area chairs had sticky arm rests from syrup- those kids and their waffles. :) The rooms were very clean, no bed bugs, or spiders, or dust. Only the cleaning service was slow to make their rounds, and they usually did our room around 4pm, and on one occasion, we interrupted her to do a quick change for the pool. A little CON here - I think they need to get them done earlier in the day incase folks want to clean up and go to another park mid-day. They have a place to come back to and change quickly. But hey, we only spent the week sleeping, where most of the time we were out and about. The front desk folks are great too. Javier and the others were very accommodating. I asked for extra blankets and pillows for the kids because they were on the pull out sleeper. I use one of the extra blankets for adding cushion to the bottom of the thin mattress and allow support for the girls. The kids found it comfortable after adding it and making the additional layer. TIP: This hotel is even close to universal, approximately one mile to bus and taxi drop off point. On one occasion, we crossed the street from the Ale House, and went through the landscape into the Portofino hotel backyard. There we found our way through their hotel and to a water taxi into universal studios. It was sort of criminal, but adventurous for all. If you visit Universal Islands of Adventure wear you bathing suits. You will get wet and you will rash up if you do not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you know what I mean. I see too many people visiting from other countries wearing jeans and shorts only to be paying $5 to get them dried. Speaking of other countries, the last week of August has folks coming from Brazil. They are very rude people. Beware of them. The brits were in town at the same time, and I found them polite and charming. Just my observations. Places to eat: Margaritaville Hard Rock TGI Fridays Ale House Things to do: Do the Disney Typhoon Lagoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The swim with the fish in a real salt water tank was nice. Do the Blizzard beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Great Slides and the kids have great areas to hang out? Ratings for Aquatica and wet and wild were not high. I passed by the wet and wild and it looks cheesy. Do the Island of adventure - Harry Potter Castle ride first, it backs up fast and it is located in the very back.

We were looking at a Marriott property close to Universal and this was the closest we could find.

It was an easy 10-15min walk. The walking entrance is the same as the valet entrance. It is easy to find and has a well laid out walking path. You could drive and park in the garage but it really wouldn't save that much time and you would be walking nearly as far while paying for the garage. There are a few restaruants really close and quite a few for delivery. Citywalk is pretty close too, so it you decided to have a few adult beverages you would be OK to stagger back to the hotel or at least grab a cheap cab ride. Hotel: The hotel was a little taller than your average Fairfield Inn. It is undergoing a restoration at the moment, but I didn't see any sign of it other than the little plastic hardhats and construction signs everywhere. Pool was OK, but pretty small. Breakfast was cereral, waffles, microwave sandwiches, yogurt, and muffins,but nothing fancy. Room: We were upgraded to a King Studio which I was told was recently remodeled. For a new room, there were a few things that didn't look new. Nothing major, but more wear than a new room should have. The bed was comfortable. The ammentities were standard. The room had two flat screen TVs but not high def. Movies on demand were available. The staff was all extremely friendly (Juan especially) and tried to be helpful.

There were 5 of us staying, so I ordered a roll-away, thinking we'd be able to \"make do\" well after one night it became very apparent that we would NOT be able to make do - so I went to see about getting into a suite. No problem, we were immediately moved to a suite - in fact, they even moved our luggage (as long as it was packed) while we were enjoying Universal. There was no additional charge, which leads me to believe it may have been the hotel's mistake - I was charged for two extra nights of the roll-away, but that was removed from the bill when I questioned it. The suite itself wasn't that special - but did have a mini-fridge, microwave and sleeper sofa (which is all we really needed. Set up was a bit wierd, but it worked for us. No hotel restaurant, but several in the adjacent strip mall. Hotel is in a good location. You could walk to Universal - but only if you're in good shape - I would say it's about a mile. I think there was some mention of a shuttle to the park - well, there was one, but only available once a day each way (which I've found is typical of hotels that offer this service, so I didn't get upset about that). Free cookies and lemonade in the afternoon. Breakfast is offered, but nothing special - waffles, cereal, juice, coffee . . .

The reason for our stay was to spend a day at Universal Studios which is right across the street. Because parking at Universal is $14 per car, we thought we would attempt to check in early, leave our car in the free hotel parking lot, and walk to Universal Studios. Since we arrived at the hotel at 12:25 PM, I wasn't optimistic that a room would be ready, but Steffanie happily informed us that there was a room available. It wasn't so much the fact that a room was available that made us feel welcome. It was the way Steffanie greeted us and didn't hesitate to help us that made us feel comfortable and at ease to ask questions. We asked her if it was an easy walk to Universal, and she gave us directions and taxi information in case we chose to ride back by taxi instead of using the shuttle service that only operated at a certain time. After we dropped our luggage off in our room, we opted to walk over to Universal, and it was a nice walk that took us 15 minutes or so. We ended up walking back to the hotel as well. Our room was comfortable and clean. Everything was in working order. In the morning, we went downstairs for the complementary breakfast and we were immediately greeted with the most warm \"Good morning!\" from Nadeza. Remember this is a self-serve buffet breakfast. Nadeza kept checking to see if we needed anything at our table and brought us yogurt to eat later and bottled water. She cleared dirty plates and bowls from our table too. We watched her as she tended to other guests with the same beautiful smile and cheery attitude. She even gave us each a kiss on the cheek as we left the table and made sure we had our fill of coffee. Upon check-out, we asked Steffanie for directions to an outlet mall nearby. She immediately printed out the directions for us. Nadeza was still in the breakfast area cleaning up with her big smile. When we said goodbye to her, she gave us another kiss on the cheek. My husband and I are both crewmembers with an airline. We travel to different destinations in the world. We have never felt so much at home and at ease as we did during our short stay at this hotel. The reasons for this are found in the caring hearts of Steffanie and Nadeza.

I was told the hotel doesn't have them. As a result the person slept without pillows. 2. I was told on the phone the pool was heated. It is not. It's freezing cold 3. The jacuzzi is too hot so it's not possible to go in. Owning a jacuzzi I like it as hot as possible (107, 108). The temperature was so hot, its not fit for a human to go in. As a result I burned myself. The Fairfield International has a heated pool and a jacuzzi at the perfect temp 4. It is NOT within walking distance to Universal. Complete lie. 5.
