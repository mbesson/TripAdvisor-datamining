Unfortunately in the end I was only able to quite like it! I just wasn't able to shake off the feeling that in some areas not enough effort had been made. The details of the minimalist concept and size of rooms in this converted office building has been well rehearsed elsewhere, so I won't repeat. In some areas such as the absence of bottled water in rooms, scuffed walls and grimy under-bed space the Mini Central lets itself down. Balanced against that is an unrivalled location. You really could not ask for a more central location in Central HK, and the reception staff are efficient and friendly. I asked for, and was cheerfully granted, a one-hour extension to checkout. It is a comment that could be aimed at almost any hotel in HK, some much worse than this one but I still have to say it. Accommodation is so expensive in HK that it has to be harming the tourism industry. The expense, relative to almost anywhere else in the East Asia region, causes me (and I am sure many more) to stay in HK for the shortest time possible. If you are going to charge HK prices and you have clearly put such thought into the design, then demonstrating that little extra effort is all the more called for.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood for one night layover\u201d", "Author": "RickRG", "ReviewID": "UR138764284", "Content": "The hotel and rooms were very clean and modern.

I booked it based on the following criteria - convenient location on Hong Kong Island, free wifi, cheap but still had private bathroom. I had some doubts after reading some rather awful reviews but the price was right and I thought I'd give it a go. I'm glad I did! I arrived late at night but check in was polite and pleasant (not like the taxi driver I had from the station!) The room was SMALL but you should know this already from the hotel name. It was fine for me as I was travelling alone and only planning to sleep at the hotel, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than one person. Room: - I thought the room layout really made good use of the available space - bed was nice and spacious for one person - walls could use a new coat of paint but my bathroom was sparkling clean - wifi connection in the room and in the lobby was fast and reliable, so convenient when travelling! - the lack of mirror above the bathroom sink is a bit annoying, I think they could replace one window with a mirror as there was no view from the window anyway - the room definitely has a moisture problem as there were damp patches on the ceiling and the mirrors kept fogging up just from having the aircon on. This probably needs to be looked at. Overall - Service was great, staff were polite and professional at all times and I was able to leave my luggage on the day I checked out with no issues - Location was PERFECT, simply walk down the flight of stairs right next to the hotel and you are minutes away from Central Station, shops, bars etc. - Hong Kong is not a cheap place to stay overall, and I think this hotel was great value for money for a solo traveller. If I am ever back by myself I will definitely consider staying here again.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cMicro rather than mini.\u201d", "Author": "JafaExplorer", "ReviewID": "UR136199586", "Content": "This cute hotel is in a great location on Icehouse St, veru close to both the business area, and a huge number of bars and restaurants.

I'm a pretty skinny guy and could barely move in the shower - a solidly built guest would really struggle.

It is a fair bit of a walk coming from Hongkong Station and it is indeed an uphill climb. It took me 15-20 minutes to get to the hotel. I would classify this hotel as a cross between a boutique hotel and an upgraded inn or hostel. The foyer area is spacious, tastefully decorated in art deco style and relaxing with soothing music. However, the room I got is literally a hole in the wall, very cramped but tastefully decorated and clean. Good thing I was travelling alone but if I had someone with me, we would be crawling over each other. Hotel amenities need improvement. There is no restaurant inside. There are 2 vending machines just outside the hotel but only one is working. No amenities inside the room except for 1 roll of toilet paper, a mini pack of facial tissues and 2 in shampoo dispensed from a container on the wall. I had to bring my own disposable slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste and cotton buds. If your intention is just to sleep, then this hotel serves its purpose. Check-out time is at 11am. In other hotels, it is 12 noon. They also take an incidentals deposit of HKD 500 ( for what I wonder as there is no space for minibar inside the room ) but refundable upon check out. I guess if you stay at a hotel like this, you should expect only the minimum so as not to get disappointed. I guess for me the saving grace of this hotel is the foyer area however, the apple computers for public use have restricted access only to HK yahoo.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for the money that you spend\u201d", "Author": "Dhiraj C", "ReviewID": "UR132375012", "Content": "This service apartment has a big advantage of being very close to Lan Kwai Fong and also central station.

I can not imagine 2 people staying in a room here.On two different occassions the fire alarms went off in the middle of the night. This was very disturbing. I could smell cigarette smoke coming through the vents before the alarms went off. Unfortunatley, this is not the hotels fault, it is the fault of the guest that do not listen to the staff at checkin when they are told it is now a non-smoking hotel. Being a non-smoking hotel was my reason for choosing this hotel. Alarmingly, firemen did not show up on either occassion as they would have in most countries even if it was a false alarm.

Although the rooms are small, really, really small, the location is great. This is fine except for a few issues concerning the staff. 1. When you check in, demand to be placed on a floor that does not accommodate Mainland Chinese tour groups. For some reason, people on these tours love to congregate in the hallway and shout at each other. Don't take no for an answer. 2. If you need to use an iron, get it in advance. I ended up in an argument about an iron. I asked the front desk for one and was told the hotel did not have them for guests to use. I explained that I used one for the past three days and when I asked where that iron disappeared to, he said guests had borrowed it. I suppose trying to talk to someone who doesn't value logic is futile. I had the same conversation with a manager and, eventually, an iron showed up. I'm not sure why the manager didn't try to solve my problem until after I shouted at him. I don't like harping on issues like this, but since the room does not have a closet to hang your clothes, having access to an iron is necessary. 3. Tell the cleaning staff to clean under the bed. Since there is no storage space in the room, you have to keep your suitcase under the bed.
