The bath is big and havea great shower and hair drier. The location is best near Fontana de Trevi and there\u2019s a Metro station 700m and a bus station a few step outside. There\u2019s a lot of Italian Cafe on the neighboorhood and it\u2019s close to famous Via Del Corso. Safe plase to stay and walk at night. The best way to come from the airport is by a shuttle an you stopin front of Ciro Restauranton Largo Chigi and the owner contact the hotel lobby. everything you need if o looking for a place to sleep after a day walking for Rome.", "Date": "February 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms, close to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps\u201d", "Author": "blustar85", "ReviewID": "UR47708695", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay at the Relais Chigi, the rooms were spacious, and it was conveniently located to one of the main bus routes. The Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and 2 metro stations were within walking distance, making the location pretty convenient. The room was quite spacious and had a mini-fridge, desk, television, large bed, and armoire. The Relais Chigi shares the building with some other occupants, so the front door/signage is pretty nondescript, I think I passed by the building the first time when I was looking for it. I would recommend staying at the Relais Chigi, I found it a good value, and conveniently located to the major sights that I wanted to see.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont", "Title": "\u201cNice small hotel, great location.\u201d", "Author": "vermontta", "ReviewID": "UR46307003", "Content": "This is a small boutique hotel with only a handful of rooms, but the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The location is great too. Walking distance to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon. A very nice bar located on the street below the building that houses the hotel. Great place to grab a quick espresso before heading out to see the sites. Only complaint, if there is one, in the heat of the Rome summer, the air conditioning in the rooms just barely kept up, but still comfortable enough. You definitely need to know the address on this hotel, because there's no sign on the outside indicating its location. The elevator is pretty small to get up to the lobby, but it was hardly an inconvenience. Overall we had a great stay.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cVery strange, but good rooms\u201d", "Author": "Prinsessenboontje", "ReviewID": "UR45438217", "Content": "The hotel was very hard to find, and when we found it, and went in, there was no reception at all.

The building is a bit of a non descriptive office building in which two floors have been converted into hotel rooms. The rooms are Ikea type furniture, laminate flooring, very modern style bathrooms. Over all the place is VERY clean and very well maintained. The manager, Ronnie, was amazing and extremely friendly and helped us with whatever we needed. The location cannot be beat (especially for the price we paid). In the heart of the city and close to all the historic sites. You're given vouchers for breakfast at the cafe located next door -- voucher entitles you to a coffee/drink and a pastry. The B&B does not have any other frills -- ie no pool, fitness room, etc. There is a local gym within walking distance that I used, called Linea Fitness (http://www.lineafitnessclub.it) but be warned, it was expensive ($20 Euro per visit). For those obsessed with working out, this is a viable option and can be a justified expense given the savings of staying at the Relais Chigi! :) Back to the room itself, we were lucky to have the only balcony in the building which was great for people watching. The only issues we had were: 1. We ran out of hot water a couple of times but we were told that the tank would reheat within 30 minutes; 2. The A/C was a bit of an old unit and wasn't very powerful -- although it was positioned to blow on the beds so sleeping was comfortable (if not freezing) but during the day the unit wasn't amazing to cool the whole room. In summary, over all, a great location, great hotel, good value (we paid $140 Euro/Night), and clean place to stay while in Rome.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Relais Chigi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1056131-Reviews-Relais_Chigi-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Largo Chigi, 5</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1056131", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/4/3/3/8/278334/278334.jpg"}}
