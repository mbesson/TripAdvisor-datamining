I have to say that I had modest expectations when I started my Paris hotel booking, after reading the many Trip Advisor posts on bad Paris hotel experiences.

Small and charming 2. In an area with a true neighbourhood feel 3. Close to a metro station 4. Relatively central 5. Around $200 a night The Sainte Beuve delivered on all our must-haves - it was absolutely lovely. Our room was simple yet pretty, with a large window that opened up onto a little wrought iron balcony. The common areas on the main floor were charming and comfortable, and the service was always warm and friendly. Breakfast was quite expensive (hotel breakfasts in Paris generally are), so we had our morning meals at the Cafe Vavin, just around the corner. The location was wonderful. The Sainte Beuve is in Montparnasse, a block away from the amazing Jardins Luxembourg, where we spent a lot of time wandering. There were lots of great little shops and bakeries and cafes in the area to enjoy, and plenty of charming little side streets to explore. It felt like a real neighbourhood and wasn't touristy at all. The weather was great, and we saw lots of locals (especially families with small kids) out enjoying the park. We had access to three metro stations nearby, and getting to the \"touristy\" areas closer to the Seine only took a few minutes - though we tended to walk more often than we took the metro because it was more fun. We booked on Expedia, and our room worked out to about $215 Canadian a night, which was within out budget - and it was worth every penny. If you choose to stay here, don't miss eating at Le Timbre, a wonderful, tiny restaurant just a few doors down from the hotel. The person behind the desk at the hotel will make reservations for you.

Starting with the desk and particularly Cecelia who was just so helpful. She provided assistance in many ways for restaurants, sites and just a friendly presence. With a tiny yet manageable elevator our room on the third floor overlooked rue Sainte Beuve. We had glorious weather so when in the room we had the window open. When we closed in the evening the double paned windows kept out all street noise. The hotel itself was very quiet. A good sized room by European standards. It had very comfortable beds, and a modern bathroom of good size. I had read previously that the breakfasts at 15E were expensive and one could do better at the local boulangeries. Well yes and no, if you want a croissant and an expresso. That view is correct. However my wife and I love good coffee in a real full sized cup for breakfast. Stainte Beuve's coffee is spectacular. a deep rich smooth blend and you are given a full three cup pot of coffee. This along with a basket of bread including croissant, freshly squeezed orange juice, a bowl of fresh fruit, a 6 oz. bottle of yogurt from Brittany, fresh Brittany butter and jams for 15E. All this either delivered to your room or served in a lovely salon on the entry level of the hotel. So easy when planning a busy day of touring. You couldn't get a better price at bistros in the area. I checked!!! Actually their kitchen was quite good for light meals and their potage for a light meal is not to be missed.

A small boutique hotel with charming bilingual staff who were always very pleasant and helpful: a taste of France (as opposed to a large impersonal chain hotel). Excellent room service. Combined bath-shower had a strong hot water flow and skylight. We didn't try the hotel dining - there were very good cafes nearby (recommend Cafe Vivan's \"formule\" breakfast to 1130h). Sited very close (2 blocks) to Vavin metro station - the No. 4 metro runs to many key points on the north-south axis in Paris including Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Montmarte and key stops in central Paris and the Left Bank.

This hotel was selected after hours of research and the reading of numerous reviews. Hotel Sainte Beuve did not disappoint, in fact it surpassed our very high expectations. Arrival from CDG was very easy as the hotel is only a short walk from the RER B Port Royal stop. Check-in was efficient and we were soon settled in room #12 on the 3rd floor. Our standard room met our needs perfectly. Since we were out of our room from morning until night, we had no need for a room with a view. The room was decorated beautifully and the linens were lovely. One side of the room has a built-in with space for hanging clothes, shelves for folded clothes, a safe, and mini-bar fridge. The room also has a mounted flat panel TV which has English speaking CNN. The bath is absolutely sparkling with its black/white decor and chrome fixtures. Robes, slippers, and a hair dryer are provided. The heated towel rack is wonderful for drying any hand washables. The room is spotless and is serviced daily. An alcove off of the cozy lobby area provides a computer for guest use. The entire hotel is Wifi. After a busy day of sightseeing, we also looked forward to returning to the hotel and sitting by the fire for a bit. We ate breakfast at the hotel just one morning. The breakfast for 15E was delicious- basket of croissants and bread, jam, yogurt, fresh mixed fruit cup, freshly squeezed OJ, and coffee/tea/hot chocolate. The hotel is perfectly situated with cafes, restaurants, shops, and metro stops within very short walking distances. But adding to the already outstanding features of this boutique hotel is its exceptional staff-the majority speaking excellent English. Every person we interacted with was professional, courteous, and helpful. On our last evening, we noticed a mistake in our next day's travel arrangements. The young gentleman at the reception desk , with much patience and efficiency, booked alternate travel and provided explicit directions for arriving at the train station and purchasing the reserved ticket. During our stay, the reception staff made two dinner recommendations and reservations for us. The recommended restaurants were outstanding. The amenities, comfort, and exceptional staff of this lovely hotel made for a memorable trip. Every detail- from furniture selection and accessories, to linens, to selection of incredible staff -at Sainte Beuve has been thoughtfully chosen. Upon a return to Paris, there is no doubt that our hotel choice will again be Hotel Sainte Beuve.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cA Gem of an Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Advanceddriver", "ReviewID": "UR50646127", "Content": "This is a fabulous hotel.

It is in a great location -- just outside of the major touristy hub-bub of Paris, while still being centrally located in Paris. We didn't have all the late-night street noise or corridor noise that you hear complaints about in hotels located on the \"main drag\" or the \"heart of the action\" or in larger hotels.

The location is very convenient, in a safe area near excellent restaurants and two metro stations. The lobby is very cozy, with a fire on cool days. Best of all was the staff (both at the desk and at breakfast) who went out of their way to see that our visit was truly memorable. I left my cell phone in the room when we checked out; the staff promptly searched for it and mailed it to me; I'm not sure many hotels in Paris (or elsewhere) would have been so accomodating. So a huge \"thank-you\" to everyone at the hotel and the highest recommendation of the Sainte-Beuve.

The St. Beuve exceeded my expectations by far, and made my trip to Paris enjoyable and memorable. This hotel is elegant and classy. The room I stayed in was the mid-level for 170 Euro (I think that's probably an off-season rate though, so it will likely be more in spring, summer and fall). I absolutely loved it. It was spotlessly clean and the decor really added to the experience of being in Paris. I had a wonderful, lengthy terrace with walk-out windows and spent two evenings sitting at the little table out there, watching Paris go by. It's touch and go with many Parisian hotels if you will get a full bath, even if you specifically order it. The bathroom of the St. Beuve puts my bathroom at home to shame. True elegance and an enormous bathtub, which was a pleasure after a long day spent walking the cobble stones. Hot water day and night (also the exception and not the rule for many 3-star Parisian hotels which turn down the water heater after 7 p.m.)The mini -bar was a nice touch, as was the North American style blowdryer (you will find most hotels in Paris, even the 4 stars, provide in-wall blowdryers similar to a vacuum cleaner that blows air out, but it takes about an hour to dry your hair with these). The staff were beyond helpful and all who worked the recpetion desk spoke nearly perfect English. They were very kind when I tried to use by poor French skills and were never condescending - you will not find this at all hotels or shops in Paris, trust me. On Christmas Day I returned to my room (they do turndown service, which was highly unexpected) to find a card and bathrobe waiting for me as a gift. The staff printed maps off and helped me find the right train and Metro. The hotel is located in a quieter, upscale area of Paris and I felt completely safe walking around, even late at night in the dark and walking from the Metro stop even after midnight. The front desk is staffed 24 hours by very friendly staff. Getting to the more touristy, more bustly areas is a 20 minute walk or 6 minute Metro ride. I walked to the Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral and Eiffel Tower with no difficulty from here - takes about 20 minutes. If you don't want to walk, there are 3 Metro stops withing 2 minutes of the hotel. The RER train direct to and from CDG airport stops 10 minutes from this hotel. The television does get 2 English channels, BBC and CNN only, but helpful when trying to stay in touch. You will find that many other 3-star Parisian hotels do have television, but only French channels, which can be a challenge when you need to know what's happening elsewhere. A small internet room is provided WITH a printer, which allows guests to print boarding passes and check flights. No extra charge for this service, unlike other hotels I tried that charged 5 Euro for 10 minutes on the internet. Paris is a wonderful city with fantastic sites, but can be a challenge for the first-time, single female, English-speaking traveller, as many Parisians are not fond of tourists. This hotel made it easy and pleasant and provided me with good memories. It was a pleasure to retreat from the bustle (and by Canadian standards), rude behaviour of many (but not all, of course) Parisians, to an oasis in the heart of the city. I could go on and on...don't hesitate, just book your room.

It was very clean, beautifully decorated and had a very convenient location. The location is ideal, as the hotel itself is on a very quiet street in a safe neighborhood, and centrally located to many of the attractions in Paris. There are literally three different metro stops within a 1-2 block walk, and tons of cafes just a two block walk away! The room was small if you're comparing it to a huge suite in a small town, but compared to other accommodations in big cities, I feel it was rather spacious. The room was very tastefully decorated (and so was the lobby, with a crackling fireplace and comfortable sofas), and there were some elegant \"extras\" such as a towel warmer, robes and slippers to wear, etc. The bathroom was fantastic! I couldn't believe the size of it! (again, for a hotel in a large city), and it seemed to be brand new! The water pressure was better than I've had even at home, it was spotlessly clean and elegantly designed. Wireless internet was free and worked great. Staff were great too. Very helpful at the front desk... they even gave us maps and marked our way for us! We were able to purchase our Museum Passes at the desk, which was very convenient too. The breakfast was delicious, if you are interested in eating a \"full breakfast\" and paying for it (which we were). We didn't order the continental breakfast... we ordered a la carte from the menu and had omelettes. Room service was great too... at all hours of the day and evening. This is a small, boutique-type hotel which has more of a feel of a french country bed and breakfast. If you are looking for a uniformed bellman who runs to the door at 3am, this is not the place for you. But if you enjoy being greeted by friendly staff who actually know who you are, in a warm environment, this place is great! Like coming home at the end of a long day (of sightseeing!) We booked our room directly by calling the hotel because we wanted to be sure to get a room with a balcony. There was no problem communicating (in English), and we received exactly the room we requested. The price was extremely reasonable too! (compared to many other hotels we investigated when we were deciding). The only thing we would have liked, would be an alarm clock in the room. The only clock was a tiny digital readout on the corner of the television set. We found it a little unnerving to have to \"depend\" on a wake up call on the day we were leaving for an early flight. However, we did receive our wake up call on time and I have noticed that many other hotels in Europe don't have alarm clocks in their rooms either.

I am so glad we stayed at the Sainte Beuve. The number one thing we liked about the hotel, though, was the location. Thankfully, not being in a heavily populated \"tourist\" section, there were still plenty of shops, resturants, and boulerangees surrounding the hotel. Even though on the map the Sainte Beuve looks like it is far away from the Seine, Notre Dame and the Louvre we were able to walk to those sights with no problem - lots to see along the way, too. The Eiffel tower and Champs Elysees was too far away for me to walk but there are several Paris metro stations around the hotel that will get you around Paris efficiently. Our best memory of Paris comes from Luxembourg Gardens which is a block and a half away. We took the time to relax and soak up the local flavor by eating chocolate crepes and watching neighborhood men play an intense game of bocce ball. So restful after a full day of sight-seeing. Bottom line - The pictures and good reviews of the hotel are accurate. We personally liked not being overrun with tourists but yet didn't feel like we were in the boonies - i.e. Plenty of things to see and do around the hotel.

Also the staff were very helpful in booking restaurants for us and making recommendations, all of which were good.", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood value hotel\u201d", "Author": "AustinPlatt", "ReviewID": "UR10467029", "Content": "A fine hotel in a good location.

We stayed in a classic room (2) which was excellent. The room was not very big but then none are in Paris in my experience. It was spotlessly clean and my girlfriend was very impressed with the black and white bathroom which was of the highest quality. The only minor down side of the room was that it got a little hot. Service was excellent on the whole although the front desk was not great on the first day when our request for a restaurant recommendation was met with a wave in the general direction of a wrack containing cards of local restaurants. On Saturday the guy at the desk was excellent, finding out info on attractions we wanted to visit and recommending and booking a restaurant for that evening. Breakfast was also good particularly the croissants which were very fresh. As for the restaurants....on Friday we ate at a place in Rue Stanislas (cant remember the name) which we picked from the wrack mentioned above. Food was good but way overpriced for what we got. A meal for two , with wine came to 174 euros and that was without one starter! On Saturday we dined at Le Timbre just 3 doors down from the hotel. This did a three course meal for 30 euros. Portions weren't large but very much in keeping with the French style. Wine was good as was the food. Tables are all butted up together as the place is tiny so if you want romantic then this isn't for you. However, the atmosphere was very good and we spent some time chatting to the Brazilian couple who sat next to us. All in all , a much better experience than Friday.

This is a real 'find' in Paris. The Hotel Sainte Beuve is a well-located, comfortable and welcoming hotel. The hotel is tastefully decorated with a warm, homely feel. Our room was light, beautifully furnished with antique pieces, with an incredibly comfortable bed and nice touches such as plentiful storage, robes and slippers. On a map the hotel may seem to be away from the heart of St-Germain but in fact this is all within walking distance. This is the best way to discover St-Germain; wonderful streets with antique shops, bookshops, cafes, bakeries mixing with familiar designer names. There are two metro stations near to the hotel, Vavin and Notre Dame des Champs. There are plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants just around the corner from Rue Sainte Beuve. We chose not to take breakfast at the hotel. A previous reviewer suggested the nearby Columbus coffee shop for takeout coffee and muffins, perfect for a morning walk through the Jardin de Luxembourg. We also enjoyed galettes and crepes at Le Vieux Journal, and bistro fare at the Cafe Vavin...a lively street-corner caf\u00c3\u00a9 with friendly staff. If you do decide to stay at this hotel, you must eat at 'Le Timbre', just a few doors down. If you like french cuisine but served in a simple, fuss-free manner, you'll enjoy yourself here. It's small (hence the name 'The Stamp') but that's the charm of it. We liked it so much we dined twice during our stay. English is widely spoken here because the clientele is mostly American/English (travel guides often recommend the restaurant)...oh, and the owner/chef is English too! The cuisine is distinctly French...and it was clear that evening that the locals love him too as there was plenty of handshaking and kissing. Another recommendation is a tour of Paris in the iconic Citro\u00c3\u00abn 2CV!! The French nickname these cars '4 roues sur 1 parapluie' (four wheels on a umbrella). This proved to be a real head turner as our driver weaved his way around central Paris! You can take package tours or create your own depending on what you want to see or visit. The drivers can pick you up from your hotel too.

As well there are some great restaurants within a 5 minute walk (you have to go to Le Dome).

We had two adjoining rooms which worked perfectly for us.
