When you look at the hotel from the outside there's absolutely nothing to get excited about. The lobby is average again. The service overall is quite poor. They have a restaurant in the lobby, and sometimes the whole lobby smells when they serve highly aromatic food from the Indian subcontinent. And that's not very nice to walk into. There's an Indian restaurant on the ground floor and due to the poor air ventilation system, its just very over bearing with the smell of Indian food. I mean I'm from India, and trust me when I say that this is not how it is any Indian restaurant back home or any where else that I've been to. So the breakfast is served in this restaurant and its mostly Indian, so those who like an Indian breakfast will be al right I guess, but others who's prefer a continental breakfast like me, aren't going to have too much to choose from. The room that I was in was very large, it was clean like the rest of the hotel. It had a mini bar and refrigerator and no coffee maker though. They didn't have an iron in the room, so I had to call it in and it wasn't of very good quality. The bathroom is clean and reasonably sized with a bath tub, nothing to complain about. The booking was made by company and hence I got a really cheap deal. So at the price I paid, it was good. Otherwise they charge about AED 450 for double occupancy I think. We got nearly 50% off on that price. Overall its not a place that I'd recommend unless you want to stay close to the Mall of Emirates and go cheap. Conclusion: the location is good, room is big and clean, but the service is not very good.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucarest", "Title": "\u201cAlec Romania\u201d", "Author": "mircea a", "ReviewID": "UR121952557", "Content": "We stayed here 7 days and: -location close Mall of Emirates, metro, 15 minutes walk -room big, clean, comfortable; -staff frienly, check-in fast -breakfest monoton, but dinner good I recommend this hotel", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGrandeur is a big word for a poor hotel\u201d", "Author": "TC_On_Tour", "ReviewID": "UR121132811", "Content": "I'll be honest from the beginning; the room was big, clean and comfortable, for some people that's the be all and end all for most hotels, but there were far too many little inconveniences with this 3 star hotel for it to get a positive review. Let's kick off with some of them: - Inconsistent hot water - this has to be a hotel's cardinal sin to break. Particularly annoying because the bathroom was clean, contemporary and rather smart - Either nonexistent or excellent internet - although free (regrettably in years of travelling, free internet is like massive neon sign suggesting a hotel is decidedly average) - Particularly unhelpful but very smiley staff - I rang reception to ask if they had a Nokia charger, something hotels must have by the million. The straight up response of \u201cNo\u201d suggests the bloke answering the phone gave absolutely no care what so ever - Some replacement tea and coffee would have been a nice touch too! The sports bar is a bit dingy with a distinct lack of broadcast sports, but that's not the end of the world because the Ramada hotel next door has an excellent sports bar which made the one in the Grandeur look especially ropey. Overall the Grandeur is a very average hotel that annoyingly could be very good if they focused a little bit more on the smaller things and service. It would be wrong to say the hotel is bad, but given the choice I would rather pay a few extra quid and stay somewhere a bit more established, the Ramada hotel next door for example.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "doha", "Title": "\u201cvalue for money\u201d", "Author": "nishneel", "ReviewID": "UR120603317", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 days and the price was very reasonable, the room was very spacious to fit one infant bed, one couch and a queen size bed.

One can just about walk to Mall of the Emirates, cutting across a couple of construction areas - it takes about 15 minutes.
