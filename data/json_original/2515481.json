We loved the location of the Hotel but the service was awful. Upon arrival (1 hour before check in) we were not allowed to check in early. The front desk was not overly friendly at all. We had to pay over $12 a night for parking and were not allowed to park under our building the first 24 hours. When I called the front desk we were told we could park at any of the other parking structures that were over a block away from our room. My mother had a hard time walking and has to use a cane, this was very inconvenient for us. Therefore we ended up parking on the street (which is free) We parked only one night in the hotel parking lot because we couldn't find a space close enough for my mother any of the other nights we were there (4 in all) We would have had to walk 2 blocks from the other parking structures up hill to our room. After a long day on our feet this wasn't the ideal solution for my elderly mother. The fan in our bathroom was very noisy as well. My parents room when they checked in was missing it's cushions covers and we had to call housekeeping. I also thought I had left behind something in our room after we returned home. I contacted the hotel and was transferred to housekeeping, where I left a message and a number for a return call. It has been 3 days and still haven't recieved a phone call from the hotel. Thankfully I found the item I thought I had misplaced.

It is a nice hotel in it's price range. The rooms are clean and decorated in western style. The staff was helpful and polite. The hotel is built on a hill and there are lots of plants everywhere. It feels like every room has its own courtyard under the sky. There are also lots of chairs and tables in those courtyards. The hotel also has a small pool and a hot tub. The main attractions around the hotel are: state historical park, heritage park, mormon battalion museum and lots of restaurants and shops. The only issue we ran into was that: on our last day we asked the hotel to call us a taxi to the airport. When we went down stairs to the lobby the driver quickly took our luggage out while I was checking out. My family also sat in the taxi. When I finally went out something did not feel right. I sat in the taxi and he started driving but did not start the meter. I asked him to do so. At this point he told me that this not a taxi and we need to pay a fixed rate in CASH. It was a difficult situation as this was 6 am and we were already on our way. I also blame myself because I got into the car, although there was no taxi sign on it. When we got to the airport I paid him what he asked for in cash. By the way this was almost double the amount I paid to taxi for getting to the hotel. We did not get the receipt either. When I got home, I called the hotel and the manager told me that they had called us a car service through a company they have agreement with. The manager I talked to was nice. he apologised and even got the receipt for me. My only concern is that the hotel should not make decisions on customer's behalf. If the customer asks for a cab, they should call a cab and not a car. Also, if there is nothing fishy then why the driver asked for cash. My initial impression was that this was an illegal taxi, but the manger insisted that it was a car service. What ever it was, I suggest guests to be careful and the hotel to remedy this situation by making it clear to the guests what is being offered.

It is within walking distance to historic Old Town. Of course, we throughly enjoyed the walk and the restaurants nearby. This hotel has tons of rooms; however only two have a view of the airport/ocean side. Unfortunately, these two rooms are the top of the hill and let me tell you...........It's a hike! The room itself was average but clean. Furniture was a bit dated. I would say somewhat early 80's. The amenities are nothing to write home about. If you care to know, the TV was not the flat screen type,which in this day and age, it is the standard in hotel rooms. Another odd thing was that we were able to hear some noise from the room above. Not enough to keep us awake at night, but enough to notice the shallow separation between floors. The parking was rather tricky because the hotel offers parking for a fee, but they neglect to let you know that there is public parking accross the street from the lobby and also on the street bordering the east side of the hotel. We opted to park on the street since we had prior knowledge of this fact. However, beaware that parking on the street and in the public lot accross the front of the hotel can be hard to find. This is because Old Town is a tourist attraction and there are many visitiors especially on weekends. This inconvenience happens during the day only. At night, you should have no trouble parking on the street. The staff at the hotel was nice and courteous. There were no issues there. Oh by the way, do try their complimentary ice water with cucumber slices. I thought it was different to garnish water with cucumbers instead of lemons.

I saw it build up a booming tourist, business, convention and government contractor business. They had a lot of repeat guests. I was one of them. But ever so slowly, the property has entered a sliding decline. It is no longer the beautiful, garden-like place it once was. In 2011, they fired the expert groundskeeping manager and his staff and contracted the outside plants and cleaning to a contractor. This appears to have been done to cut salaries and benefits and prop up the bottom line. The hotel's appearance suffers as a result. Housekeeping staff has shrunk as well and on my last two stays I did not see even one of the housekeeping managers I had grown to know. The people who were there were pushed to the limit, sometimes not finishing with rooms until dark. The restaurant is owned by another company which is in bankruptcy with its assets being formally sold off on January 26, 2012. It too has declined. They don't even have cocktail napkins now and food quality makes me yearn for Taco Bell. The hotel attempts to prop up the restaurant financially by giving just about any guest free food. The breakfast buffet was so horrid that it wasn't even an option for free. Scrambled eggs were brown. Sausages were greasy and potatoes were wrinkled and looked days old. This hotel is facing a perfect storm of declining revenues, occupancy and a restaurant which may soon close unless it is purchased and kept open. Travel sites show rooms being sold for as low as $79 per night, so don't pay rack rate. On my last stay, I also found another area where cuts had been made: Security. My car was broken into in the garage. Another guest told me that this had happened three times to his knowledge in the past year and that it is a known problem. The hotel had no surveillance in place, just a security \"guard\" who was found asleep on the job just days after my vehicle was broken into. There was a time when I would see security people actively roaming the hotel all hours of the night. It occurs to me this ended about October of 2011. Senior management fought me off with a line of BS about how great their security is and how they could \"track their guard with GPS\", apparently unaware that GPS won't work three levels deep in a concrete and steel parking garage. The GM even said that \"Those signs are the limit of our liability\" and referred to it as something \"beyond (their) control\". Sorry. When you know you have a problem and do nothing, you are part of the problem. I sent a letter and a bill by courier to the GM who ignored it until, to their credit, the hotel's corporate office got their copy and became involved. They paid for the damages and I was comped one (1) night of my stay and I am grateful for that but not for the lies and attempted glad-handing and just utter made-up stories and admission that they covered up the damage (literally) so as not to alarm other guests. The GM even had another employee contact me to demand my first review here be taken down. I did ask TripAdvisor to do just that. It was a bit harsh. Time has given me a better perspective. The hotel is under pressure to deliver occupancy and revenue figures to the owner and they're cutting staff, services, cleaning and maintenance to prop up the bottom line as they give away rooms on the Internet. Attempting to brush off a 12-year veteran guest personally known to everyone on staff there was just offensive to me.

You can find many restaurants, bars, shops, and the parking was free at the park - if you can find a spare spot. In early morning the environment was extraordinary beautiful and we enjoyed it. However, the hotel room was just okay because it wasn't a well-seen modern hotel, and I think we need dining table and chairs in there. The room was spacious and the beds were relatively comfortable, but we were unable to leave windows open because others may be able to get in without any problem - can we add some locks on the wooden blinds? Parking at hotel wasn't free - $12 per night, but we could always park it at the parking lot of state park. We didn't try out their onsite restaurant since we were able to find many other good food around.

So, this time out to San Diego we decided to give it a try. I wasn't sure about staying \"inland\", as we go out there to be near the ocean, but this place convinced us otherwise. First of all, it's a huge place. There are many separate buildings spread across the hillside above Old Town San Diego. We happened to get a nice room on the 2nd Floor of one building, which looked out over Old Town towards distant Point Loma. We were very pleased. The room was large, with two Queen beds, a refrigerator and small microwave. It was quiet, clean and well-kept. As I said, the location is great and there is so much going on in Old Town, we just spent a whole day bumming around, having some margaritas, etc... As I walked across the \"campus\" towards the swimming pool, I realized that there are rooms that don't look out onto anything (they actually face the hillside), but you would just have to be conscious of that (I'm sure some people wouldn't care anyway). The grounds were well kept, the buildings were clean and we had a great stay...except for really mediocre customer service from the front desk. That was really the only thing that I wasn't too pleased with. It's not that the front desk staff (several of them) were RUDE, per se, they just weren't too focused on customer service. I call these types of people \"overly efficient\"; they do their job but don't put any \"love\" into it, if you know what I mean. They make you feel like you're burdening them by asking for anything. I went down for some extra towels, and the clerk gave an obvious *sigh*, reluctantly opened the cabinet behind her to reveal a pile of towels, none of which were in any sort of order, and no bath towels. So, I had to trudge back up 3 flights of stairs to wait on a maid to deliver them - Which she did, promptly, I might add. No concerns with housekeeping, they did a great job. It just seems that the front desk staff is the major customer service problem, nobody else that I ran across acted like that. The last thing I might mention is that it's not cheap to stay there. For a Best Western, it's pretty pricey, so if you have AAA, AARP or another discount method, use it. The parking is $12 per day (!), but it's in Old Town and parking is at a premium, especially weekends. You can try for the free Old Town parking lot across the street, but it was packed the whole time we were there (Sat-Mon), including into the evenings. Overall, a great stay. If they can improve their customer service at the front desk, it's a winner in San Diego.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "rancho palos verdes, ca", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Decor and in a great location of Old Town, San Diego\u201d", "Author": "lisee43", "ReviewID": "UR115878965", "Content": "We've been to Old Town, San Diego a few times and we had stayed at the Holiday Inn before.

I also really loved the pick up service at the airport. That was so helpful. I was at the hotel for a wedding and had two seperate reservations for two days each with a night in between where I stayed elsewhere. But a few problems to note, 1. Our room was not ready in time for check in. It took a few hours to find us a room. However when we did get the room it was beautiful so there is that. 2. We had to cancel one night of our second reservation. I understand that you have a 48 hour policy but it was not posted anywhere. I notified the hotel within 24 hours and they rebooked the room with another guest but still I was charged the full amount of the stay. I felt that this was slightly unethical since the hotel recouped the money twice. 3. While most of the staff that I dealt with was very friendly even when I was voicing a complaint about the above two issues. When I did check in the second time at night (around 12:30 am) there was a staff member who had a bit of an attitude which was a bit surprising because I was not voicing a complaint, just checking in. She might have just been having a bad day because she was also short with the gentleman who was ahead of us in line. But then when it was our turn next she barked at us asking whether we were guests at the hotel. Then she seemed a bit nicer when we told her we were checking in but then when we asked for a wake up call and cab in the morning this was just too much for her and she was aggrevated again. 4. my bill was incorrect the first time i checked out but it was fixed immediately as soon as I pointed it out. 5. while the breakfast far exceeded my expectations in that it was really delicious, the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. But the service was awful. We must have waited 20 minutes for a waiter to take our order and then almost 40 minutes for it to show up. I had to go to the kitchen myself to get a drink. 6. wifi did not work at all in the hotel room or lobby but the computers in the lobby were great and loved the printer for my boarding pass. 7. I did not appreciate the $5 a day resort fee which was basically for two bottles of water that were not replenished every day.

The hotel is barely a block from Old Town and across the street from Heritage Park. Check-in was a breeze and because the property is so large, a map was provided. We found our room without problem. The lobby is inviting with plenty of places to sit, indoors or out. You can park in the garage ($12 a night) or on the street, or in a public parking lot across the street. The parking garage is narrow and difficult to maneuver if you have a large vehicle so you might want to walk the garage before you commit to paying for parking. Our room (top floor of the 500 bldg.) was neat and clean when we arrived and housekeeping kept it that way the entire time we were there. The room had comfortable beds, lots of top of the line sheets and comforters, and big bath towels. It had a coffee pot, mini-fridge and microwave, too. There\u2019s a courtyard in the middle of the complex with lots of tables and chairs so you can sit outside and relax. The landscaping is well kept and, in keeping with the stucco walls and red tile roof, there were murals on several of the walls. It\u2019s a pristine, elegant, and very comfortable place to stay. The only down-side is that no breakfast is served at the hotel. We got vouchers for breakfast at O\u2019Hungry\u2019s in Old Town but it was such a greasy spoon kind of place that I wouldn\u2019t go back!! Old Town San Diego has a collection of Mexican restaurants. We tried Caf\u00e9 Coyote, Old Town Mexican Caf\u00e9 and Miguel\u2019s. Miguel\u2019s serves the freshest, most authentic food. The wait staff is very attentive, and the prices are very reasonable. I think Miguel\u2019s is the best on the block and it\u2019s just down the steps from the center of the hotel courtyard. Breakfast can be difficult to find in Old Town if you\u2019re not into huevos rancheros or greasy spoon establishments. We discovered a tiny little place on San Diego Ave (Old Town\u2019s main street) called Old Town Gourmet Caf\u00e9. It has amazing coffee (I\u2019m from Seattle and I need my espresso!) and serves freshly baked croissants, lox and bagels, and pastries of all kinds. It also serves soups and sandwiches at lunch time and fresh fruit smoothies any time of the day. This gem of a caf\u00e9 is across the street from Miguel\u2019s, on San Diego Ave between Arista St. and Linwood St. We used public transportation to tour San Diego. The transit station is about two blocks from the hotel. If you buy an all-day pass for the tram, you can use it on the bus, as well. We used the tram to get to Embarcadero, Sea Port Village, Horton Plaza and other downtown attractions. You can take a ferry or a bus to Coronado Island (eat at Lil Piggy\u2019s \u2013 their pulled pork sandwiches are awesome!) The shops at the ferry dock are fun to explore and you can sunbathe on the beach near the ferry dock and swim to your heart\u2019s content. We also took the bus to Balboa Park (allow 4 or more hours to do Balboa Park justice). A free tram within Balboa Park will take you to the zoo (allow 4-6 hours to enjoy the zoo). The Hacienda Hotel is the perfect location if you want to tour Old Town and then hop on a tram or bus to visit nearby attractions.

It hasn't changed a bit and that's a good thing! It's a great location in Old Town - you can look over the entire area from your room (depending on which side you face, of course). The rooms are relatively clean - as clean as any moderately priced hotel I've ever been to in the past. I am a germ nut, so I always carry sanitizing wipes and I clean the phone and remote as soon as I get in the room. I also pack slippers because I never walk on the carpet in bare feet. That being said, the room was never truly cleaned while we were there. It didn't get dirtier, it just stayed the same - it was fine. The staff was friendly to us. I read other reviews and there seemed to be problems for some guests. We didn't experience this. I always have a smile on my face when talking to someone who is helping me...don't know if that is the difference or not. Plus, we checked in around 11pm on Christmas Day. If anyone was going to be a grump, it should have been the staff who helped us, but they were friendly, smiling and helpful. We didn't have to pay $5 a day service fee. We did book through Travelocity, so maybe we paid it in advance - who knows. Parking was $12 a day. The structure was easy to navigate and worth the money. Every morning I did hear the garbage trucks. It's a trade-off I suppose. I had great views, but I also had the noise of the street (it's just the trucks echoing up the hillside). I would hear it and fall right back to sleep because the beds are very comfortable. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel and the food was good. We both had drinks and those were also good. Overall, I can't complain. I visit SD every few years to see family and friends.

I travel a lot for work, and often I stay at Best Western properties. They vary in quality from excellent to awful. This hotel is much closer to excellent. I can't say enough about the location. You walk down the hill from the hotel and you are in the heart of Old Town San Diego, which has tons of restaurants, shopping, bars, and tourist friendly establishments. If you are visiting other parts of San Diego, you'll need a car which you can park in their garage for $12 per day. If you are just staying in Old Town, you won't need a car because everything is within walking distance. Several reviewers have commented about being forced to find parking on the street but this was not the case for me. My company specifically requested that parking and breakfast be included in my charges and there were ample parking spots in the hotel garage. I had never stayed in an establishment quite like this one. It was clearly designed for tourists in mind (consider where it was located). As a business traveller, there are a few things I look for in a hotel--internet service, breakfast, iron & ironing board, etc. The hotel had wife-hotspots in the courtyard, but it seems that almost every room faced the courtyard so I always got a pretty good signal. Breakfast was served at O'Hungry's around the corner. While it would've been nice to have breakfast served in the hotel itself, I'm sure if someone were on vacation this would not be a major imposition. The room was nice and comfortable. The bed was soft and I slept well every night. The only two issues I had were the loud and unruly people staying at the hotel and the tiny little bathroom shower and sink. First of all, I understand that it is primarily a tourist hotel. However, even at a tourist hotel they should be required to keep the noise level to a minimum after midnight. At least two nights while I was there, I had trouble sleeping due to the loud conversations taking place in the courtyard outside my room. Second, it may be a result of asking for a single room but the bathroom sink and shower area were extremely small. I'm not a large man, but I was constantly bumping into the sides of the shower each morning. Overall, I was very impressed.

There was much muttering behind the desk when I showed them my reservation and we were then told that the king suite wasn`t ready and wouldn`t be ready for a while. By now, we were getting tired, so I said we`d take the ordinary room but they`d have to knock something off the price. They agreed to knock 20 dollars per night off the room (yes - I know I should have held out for more, and normally I would, but as I said we were getting tired by now). So we took the offered room which was ok. I`d been worried about noise due to the hotel`s proximity to the Freeway / airport / trainlines etc but heard nothing from these at night. You`re more likely to be disturbed by people talking outside your room due to the hotel`s layout.

It was one of our most favorite places to stay, and even though it was above our budget we always found the money to indulge in the delights of this lovely hotel. We returned to San Diego recently after having not been in the town for more than ten years. We know that ten years is a long time in the life of a hotel, but we made reservations hoping things had not changed for the worse. The good news: The hotel has attempted to keep up with the times by adding small refrigerators and microwaves as well as internet access. Drapes and spreads were fairly up-to-date, and the old Spanish-style furniture still looked good. Our room was fairly large, with a decent-sized bathroom. Service is still a high-priority. A problem in the bathroom was fixed within minutes of our report. The bad news: Internet access is via cable so only one of us could work on a computer, which was a huge inconvenience for us. We were surprised that wireless was not available. In the past our rooms were always located under shady roofs surrounded by luxurious bougainvillea, over-looking interesting little gardens. This year we were placed in a building that overlooked a parking lot which did not even belong to the hotel. No special feelings from this view unless you want to compare it to a motor court of the 1950's. The absolutely fantastic restaurant in the hotel is under different management and a new menu and we will probably never taste lime-roasted chicken again. What a pity! The first quoted price of $159/night would have been totally outrageous for this hotel, even though it does enjoy a good location. Our negotiated price of $120/night was still excessive for what we received. Two random thoughts: It is silly to include a parking charge with a hotel room for which 90% of guests will have reached via automobile. Just add the charge to the room cost. This hotel had the cheapest toilet paper I have ever used, and that includes some not very nice places in third world nations.

I put in a request when I first reserved our room for a certain room that my folks and I used to stay in. I was told there was no guarantees that I'd get that room (which was fine) but they'd be as accommodating as they could to give me a similar room. When my boyfriend and I went to check in the woman staff member that helped us was already unfriendly. She didn't seem like she knew what she was doing. She assigned us a room without looking at the special request I put in and when I mentioned my request she then stated that \"someone, not her accidentally gave that room away that day.\" If she simply said that room wasn't available I'd be fine, but \"accidentally\" gave it away doesn't sound right to me. I then asked if I could get a similar room to what I originally requested and so she booked my boyfriend and me into room 411. Do not stay in that room! It has to be one of the worst rooms on the property. When we got to the room we were very surprised. Walls were paper thin (could hear the neighbors the whole time), extremely small and has absolutely no view. I felt like we got downgraded from what we were originally supposed to have. We were paying 139 a night plus $12 dollars parking so we most certainly were not happy with this tiny room. When my boyfriend and I went back downstairs to request another room the manager came out and assured us that all the rooms were similar in size. The manager and his employees need to actually go through all the rooms on the property to see how very different they all are. Very unprofessional of them to say the rooms are all similar in size. By his definition, similar most definitely sucked. Since I have stayed at this hotel several times I know this not to be true. That is, the rooms are not all similar in size. Of the rooms I know I've stayed in is 403 and 407. Those rooms are both much much bigger than 411 and we paid much less for those rooms! What makes those rooms better is they have high ceilings, two full size beds (I believe they're full size and not queen), one fold out couch and a sitting area/patio right outside the room to enjoy a gorgeous San Diego sunset/sunrise and other views. I know my family has also stayed in the buildings higher up the hill which had similar layouts. Since the manager seemed to be just bs'ing around and it was obvious he wasn't trying hard to find us another room we said \"forget it since its too much of an inconvenience for you\" and had to stay in our miserable room. As if things couldn't get any worse, when we checked out of our room they charged us twice for parking!! So I had to go back in and at get refunded. The refund is the only thing they did right if you can even consider that right since they screwed up already. Gesh! These people must have never gotten any real training before being put at the front desk.

It's very close to the Historical Park, which was neat. The main street through the area was also packed with Mexican restaurants and cafes. We loved the Cafe Coyote across the street and Fred's Mexican Cafe up the street. The area had a small town feel and we felt very safe and comfortable, but it was still a fun, festive feel in the evenings!

The rooms were very, very dark. Not what I would expect in sunny San Diego. I believe my room was especially noisy. I stayed in the 700 building which backs up to the restaurants on the main street. Every morning at 5:30, the garbage truck would back up outside my window and unload the dumpster. Even on Sundays. I also had an adjoining room to a family of four. I could hear every single thing through the door between our rooms, including bathroom noises (not to be too graphic...) We also booked our rooms with the El Presidente package. It entitled us to a free breakfast and free dinner (with two free drinks). The breakfast was decent, especially the days when they had French Toast which was really good. The dinners were okay, with a very limited menu. We chose to eat in town quite a few nights and pass up the free dinners. Strangely, being a part of the El Presidente package also seemed to limit where you were allowed to sit in the restaurant. It would have been nice to eat outside.

No newspaper was delivered to the room (more on newspapers below). The pool is very small (though it does have a nice view). The worst part is all the deceptive advertising which left a bad aftertaste to our stay. First, our room was advertised as a \"suite\", when in fact it was a single room. Second, and most galling, was the added $5 \"resort fee\". I booked directly thru the Best Western website and this fee was never mentioned, but when we checked in we were told it was mandatory for all guests. Surprise! What makes the fee worse is how pathetic the reason for the fee is: to pay for free newspapers and coffee in the lobby and two bottles of water a day. Well, \"free newspapers\" means one copy each of three newspapers in the lobby, mounted on wooden poles like they use in libraries, so you can forget about taking a copy to your room, and you may well have to wait your turn to read it. (On top of that, the papers were all a day old!) The coffee was cheap Farmer Brothers, just terrible. Which leaves the water which, at $2.50/bottle, is surely the most expensive water ever. Note that this hotel is on a steep hillside, and has many, many stairs (127 from the street to our room!). We found it charming, but if you can't handle stairs, this is not the hotel for you.

Some of the things to consider before booking at the Hacianda Old Town. Do you like to walk and climb stairs? The hotel climbs quite steeply from the main street in Old Town and if you have a room in building 5 or 6 you could be in for a climb. Do dark rooms bother you? The hotel is in the motif of old Spanish California and the wood and lighting is rather dark. The rooms are clean and well kept, but hardly could be described as bright. Are you really bothered by traffic and airport noise? The 5 freeway is below the property and the hotel is adjacent to San Diego International Airport. So there is noise here. Do you have trouble parking in tight spaces? If you plan on renting an SUV or large car, parking in one of the tight spaces in the garages will challenge the best of drivers. Rent a small car. Now why my family and I love this hotel: The views from the top rooms are spectacular. We stay in building 6 which overlooks all of Old Town, San Diego Harbor, fireworks at Sea World, and a great view of the Sunset. We love the location, just steps from Old Town shopping and restaurants. The zoo and downtown are less than 5 minutes away as is Sea World. In the evenings you can step outside your room and smell the aromas from the restaurants below. We like the Old Spanish feel of the hotel. This place can be a real bargain considering the location and view. We paid just over $100 a night during Spring Break. This was our 4th stay at this property and we will keep coming back.

Our room was located at the very back of the property in the 500 suite block. There was a side gate that was fairly close and provided easy access to Old Town. The proximity to Old Town was the only good thing about this trip. The room was very dated with stains on the carpet and the bathroom walls. The bathroom door was a sliding door that did not lock and got stuck every time we tried to close it. In order to close the door we had to lift it and then slide it. Our last room had vaulted ceilings that made the room feel large, this last room did not and it felt very much like being in a dungeon. We were surrounded by loud people with very young children who ran around making loud noises in the rooms above us and beside us. Obviously that was not the hotel's fault but it was very unpleasant. The lighting in the room was dim which only added to the feeling of being in a dungeon. If you stay at the Hacienda DO NOT let them book you in the 500 block.

From where my room was located, however, I felt like I was walking through a maze just to get through the pool area. Value: The room rate I paid ($169 per night) during the peak summer season was slightly less or comparable to other hotels in Old Town. Other fees include parking ($12 night) and a \u201cresort fee\u201d ($5 per day). The property itself is located in a quiet neighborhood, but conveniently located about a block from all the sites, shops and restaurants of historic Old Town.

I have always foudn the staff to be very accommodating and the property to be clean and neat. Over the years I have stayed in all of the buildings on the property and have seen constant cleaning, rennovations and improvements taking place to maintain the property. The Hacienda is more like a small village than a big box hotel. A series of buidings terrace up the hill with plazas and courtyards which allow guests in the 199 guest rooms to feel as if they have some air to breathe. All rooms are suites. The 700 building has efficiency kitchens. Decor is pleasant and in a Mexican style which is attractive and practical. Because the hotel is terraced up the hill, people with special needs or who need special access need to make this known when booking a reservation so as to be placed in a room close to street level. Internet service is fair but can grind to a halt on a busy late afternoon when everyone in the hotel is using it at the same time. I was assured by one of the Sales Managers that they were aware of the problem and were working with the broadband provider to upgrade the service. The fact that I was able to talk with a Sales Manager in a hotel these days was a very nice touch, but I always find the staff at the Hacienda to be approachable and omnipresent, ready to assist guests. In all of my stays at the Hacienda, the housekeeping staff have always been excellent. They are honest, efficient and friendly. All of the room sin which I have stayed have been properly cleaned and appointed. All rooms now include a small guest safe for valuables, two bottles of water in the refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, cable TV, Internet service (wired - wireless in the lobby and common areas), use of the hotel airport shuttle, coffee in the lobby each morning and a choice of USA Today or the San DIego Union newspapers stacked at the bell desk in the lobby. As a Best Western Hotel, the Hacienda introduced the Wednesday meet and greet wine and cheese mixer for BW Gold Crown Club members . If a guest is not a member he/she may sign up on the spot and enjoy the refreshments as well as the benefits of the program. As a seasoned traveler, I do not expect any hotel to be \"just like home\". I expect some differences. A busy hotel cannot be all things to all people, but this one tries to accommodate all guest requests with a smile when it is within the power of the staff to do so.

First off, there was a LONG line at the lobby guest counter with about TEN groups of people waiting as THREE different hotel workers slowly gave out keys to rooms and took credit cards. VERY slow service. The parking situation is cumbersome. It is not gated (no guards) and like the person who wrote about their car being broken into, I sensed some suspicious characters who were watching guests as they checked in and hovering around the exterior of the hotel parking structures. The garage that is shared with the Acapulco restaurant is dark and not well lit and there are many \"hidden\" spots that seem unsafe. They should put video cameras down there or possible have guards roaming the parking lots, and install better lighting. As for the room, a \"superior\" queen: it was VERY noisy and the decor was something from 20 years ago (read: maroon and turquoise bed spread circa 1982 which totally clashed with the faux Spanish wood finishing in the room circa 1978). Old noisy wall-mounted air-conditioning unit. Could hear the person upstairs stomping around like Godzilla. Paper-thin walls. San Diego airport airplanes can also be heard landing. Room was near outside pool area, also very noisy. Bed was hard as a rock. Room was so-so on the cleaniless (could be cleaner). Didn't swim in the pool or spa, noting the crowdedness and cloudy water in the jacuzzi. For the amount of money ($200 with tax) you are getting what should be a $54 room at a cheapie roadside motel. For the price, the rooms should be MUCH nicer. It's too bad because the location is very convenient (Old Town is great) and the outside of the hotel and the hotel lobby are gorgeous (boganvilla, fountains, Spanish tiles, etc). Rating: B- or C+ What the room should cost: $50 per night What it does cost: $200 What they should do about it: redecorate/remodel rooms, put in better mattresses and nice bedding, insulate the building better, hire more security (or install video cameras).

First things first, what a great location! I would strongly recommend Old Town as \"the\" place to stay in San Diego. Lot's of atmosphere and things to do on the door step without the need for either car or taxi. It is a totally different experience and I would not hesitate recommending it. The only downside is the availability of hotels in this location. If you prefer top-end 4-5* then Old Town is probably not for you. As far as we could see there were 3 alternatives, Marriott Courtyard, Holiday Inn Express and the Hacienda (Best Western). Following the recommendations upon this site, we opted for the Courtyard which was a disappointment. The rooms were old/jaded, the operation franchised (ie. not Marriott) and it probably had the worst location of the 3 hotels. Although, we experienced no problems, it was dark walking back to the hotel at night and we had to keep looking over our shoulder! Our room also had a beautiful view of the I-5 in all its 8 lane glory with a large Lockheed factory as a backdrop! On our first night, we were walking into the Old Town when we saw the Hacienda on the side of a hill overlooking all the attractions etc. It had been built in a traditional style and looked beautiful with all its decorative lights off-setting the dark night sky. Remembering that we had researched this using Trip Advisor, we decided to take a closer look. We met the manager (Douglas) and explained our situation. He was very courteous and showed us a typical room at The Hacienda. The bottom line is that we decided to cut short our stay at the Courtyard and moved to the Hacienda for the next 3 nights. This was a good decision and we thoroughly enjoyed the remainder of our stay in Old Town. In comparison to The Courtyard, the Hacienda had the following advantages:- - traditional room, themed in the Old Town style. - great sunset views from our balacony across to Mission Bay. - nice Mexican themed restaurant. - great location - right in the thick of things with a short and safe walk home. - quiet location with little noise - US$30 per night saving over the Coutyard best rate for the same night. - free parking in a large garage (another US$15 saving in comparison to the Coutyard). - Our daughter also enjoyed the pool.

He not only blamed Hotels[--] but also insinuated that he wasn't getting paid for the room (and gave the impression that he didn't feel the need to worry about us due to the fact that we booked through this method)He offered a roll away bed-which of course was going to make the room even more cluttered than it would already be with the pull out sofa. As it was the Fourth of July weekend, we had no other choice than to stay here. I was not impressed with his customer service or business behaviour in blamming someone else for the problem. I rang Hotels[--] who were great in supporting my grievance and rebated a portion of the payment for the lower quality room supplied. Due to the time it took for them to \"sort out the situation\", it was too late in the day to travel back out to Legoland, so they not only ruined the adults fun getaway, but ruined the kids experience as well as they were looking forward to hvaing more fun.

The laughable thing was- on the phone a \"message waiting\" light was on-pick it up and you hear a spiel about how customer service and satisfaction are their main objectives-they should maybe spend some time on finding out the definition first!", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cSuper spot in Old Town\u201d", "Author": "tnsc", "ReviewID": "UR5373403", "Content": "The Best Western Hacienda is on a hillside in the center of San Diego's Old Town. Tourist central -- but delightful nonetheless. Rooms are roomy and comfortable, located in eight buildings at different levels on the hillside. While there is a perfectly good Mexican restaurant in the hotel (The Acapulco) with a terrific view towards Old Town and the harbor, there are something like 40 restaurants within walking distance. Most are Mexican, but there's also French, New Orleans/Cajun, Italian, and other cuisines very close by. The hotel is close to the airport, has free broadband wi-fi hotspots -- and free ethernet broadband in Building #8 -- and is a short walk from a trolley stop. Of course everyone in San Diego drives -- but the hotel's proximity to the freeways is just fine. The staff are helpful with good advice on virtually everything. The Hacienda is good for business travelers, as well as families, couples, and singles wanting to enjoy the delights of this beautiful city by the sea.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Simi Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cThe Location and the Room Sizes in this Hotel are Great\u201d", "Author": "cvp3", "ReviewID": "UR5316364", "Content": "Overall I would stay at this hotel again. Here are the main pros and cons... Pros: It was clean. The location! It is so nice to be able to park at the hotel and walk over to the Old Town area. For dinner you can walk over, have a drink (or two) and not worry about driving anywhere. Large rooms! This Best Western calls itself an \"all suite\" hotel, but in reality its more of a Motel with really large rooms. We got a room with two queens and a sofa bed, which worked out perfectly for us...but I wouldn't call it a suite. A tiny sofa/sofa bed separated by a small partition does not qualify as a living area in my book. I like that they had a microwave and fridge. Cons: The layout is confusing and spread out with many steps. Our room was in the \"600\" building which required us to walk a block down one street, turn the corner, and walk two more up a hill, past a restaurant and I think two or three private residences. We don't mind walking so much, so it wasn't too much of an issue, but I am really glad we didn't have to go to the lobby for any reasons. We were on the second floor, and we could hear every move that the guests in the room above us made. It was annoying when they began running around at 6 in the morning. The \"ceilings\" are very noisy. Upon check in the manager told us that the hotel was pretty much sold out, so in our building we might not be able to find a spot in the parking garage and that we might mave to park on the street. I snagged the last (tiny) spot that night, but the next night I had to park on the street. I feel more secure parking in the parking garage. That is what I liked least about the hotel.", "Date": "June 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cFountains, flowers, great location but a terrible mattress.\u201d", "Author": "Linzan", "ReviewID": "UR5025671", "Content": "Hacienda has a beautiful setting with fountains, tiled steps, flowers.

The mattress was deplorable and noise from other guests on the weekends partying in the courtyard and the pool was disturbing but ended around 11:30.
