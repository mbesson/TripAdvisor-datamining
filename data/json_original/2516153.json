It is a typical Marriott - you always know what you are going to get - so no surprises. The staff is friendlier than other Marriotts we have been to. Everyone - front desk, bar staff, housekeepers, bellhops, would always smile and say hi. It was nice to feel that they valued our business. The hotel is about an eight minute or so drive from downtown Napa. There are restaurants and shopping within walking distance of the hotel also. The hotel has a very nice gym that is open 24 hours a day, but it was packed when my husband tried to use it. We watched \u201cMy Week With Marilyn\u201d via On Demand for $11.99, which I didn\u2019t think was too bad. Movie prices vary widely, depending on how recent they are. One thing I didn\u2019t like was the wine prices at the bar, which were quite a bit higher than other places we have been to in Napa. I asked for a generic Pinot Noir and was told that it would be $20 per glass! They of course had cheaper varietals, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect a lower priced Pinot Noir in Napa. As a result, we only went there one night instead of two as we usually would have done. Personally, I prefer the Embassy Suites in Napa, but I\u2019d stay at the Marriott again if the price was right.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swanton, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cSuperior service....

We didn't stay at the hotel. It was a lovely day but overall this is not a 'destination spa.' It would make a great add on to a stay in the Napa Valley, especially if you're already staying at the Marriott, but it's not enough of a total spa to make it comparable to places that are more set up as a spa. For example, the pool is not attached to the spa and you have to walk outside through the parking lot and then through the lobby of the hotel to get there. All of the treatments were fine to good but none was exceptional. The masseuse and the facialist were very nice and professional but the pedicurists complained about management while giving us our pedicures.

We had just moved to California and we had not had time to plan anything for my birthday. I told him all the nice places were booked up and there were not any specials on Jetsetter or SniqueAway. I normally do all the booking for trips and I research a ton. I always know where to look and how to get the best places. But he went onto Priceline and put in too much money for a 4 start. All 4 stars are NOT created equal. He knows to never use Priceline again because it never works out well. He actually OVERPAID for this place from what we could have just paid on their website. Anyway, that aside, it is located right off the highway, a terrible location with no views of anything. It is not in Napa at all, but in sort of a suburb location of Napa. We told the guy at the front desk that it was my birthday and we wanted a nice quiet room. He insisted our room was in a great location. What an idiot he was! We were facing the highway and toward the entrance where everyone walked by. We were also close to the restaurant which is a big problem. They need to install a door to the hallway on the first floor like they have ont the second floor. And they need a door that exits out of the restaurant into the first floor rooms. It is so loud. A lot of the people who also stay at this hotel tend to be partiers, especially Bachelorette and Bachelor parties. It was awful. We had a large group of people who kept running up and down the hallway yelling and laughing. These are adults mind you, who know that people are sleeping at 1:00 a.m. After calling the front desk hours earlier and nothing happening, I finally had to open my door and yell into the hallway. They were so loud they didn't even hear me yelling. I yelled even louder a second time and they finally heard me. We felt like were in Cancun spring break hell! Where was management during all these hours of yelling and frolicking? It is the middle of the night and front desk didn't care. So in the morning we asked to be moved. The lady at the front desk was great and found a quiet room on the second floor, thank god! That second night we finally got to sleep. Rooms: The rooms are nothing but small normal hotel rooms. One sink in the bathroom, very small bathroom. Nothing fabulous at all about these rooms. My husband felt so awful because this was just not up to our standards at all. If we had been driving on some road trip and needed a place on the side of the highway, this place would be fine, but not for an event in Napa where it is supposed to be beautiful and relaxing. A major problem was housekeeping. That first morning, after getting no sleep, we got a knock on our door at 8:30 a.m. saying, \"housekeeping.\". What the he** is housekeeping doing knocking on doors at 8:30 a.m.? That is way too early and the management needs to fix this! This is not some business hotel in San Francisco where people are out of the rooms by 8:00 a.m. This is a vacation destination. Food: We purposely avoided eating at the restaurant because we knew it would be sub-par restaurant food. We were so tired that evening and my husband wanted to watch the March Madness Semi-Final game. They had TV's so we decided to just grab something light and watch the game. That was a mistake, ick. Anybody who says this food is good has no idea what good food tastes like. That is all I am going to say about that. Anyway, we will be returning to the Napa and Sonoma Valleys, but we will not stay here ever again. We will wait for some specials at some nice resorts, or we'll just pay up for the experience we want.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highlands Ranch, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "pfawn", "ReviewID": "UR127783026", "Content": "This is a great FS Marriottt.

First of all, Napa Valley is a beautiful place to visit when you're in California. Secondly, the hotel was a great find at short notice. The pool is a little smaller than expected and to be frank, too plain. There was no lifeguard, but my family and I just spent most of the time tanning by the pool where there were a lot of chairs. The spa was pretty good. Expensive, but what can you expect at a Spa Hotel. The great thing about it is no matter what spa service you pay for, you automatically get a day's access to the spa which includes a steam room, jacuzzi, and a very comfy lounge area. To get access to just the spa with no additional service is already $20-$25, so it's worth the services in my opinion. The gym was small, but pretty good. TVs on all the machines and was kept very clean with individual hand towels to use. The rooms were great. Nothing special about them - typical Marriott style rooms. Lobby was very spacious. There was a Starbucks but very over priced. When you take time to go to Napa Valley, the hotel is not the attraction whatsoever (for obvious reasons!).

I'm a Platinum Elite member with Marriott and stay over 100 nights per year at Marriott hotels throughout the US and internationally. However, I did check the rates on Marriott's website and they were running $300 and up depending on the package for the dates we stayed there. The hotel itself is a low rise (only two floors) and because of this, is spread out over a large area. Depending on where your room is located, it can be a long walk from the lobby to your room. There is not adequate parking when the hotel is full and especially when there is an event going on. The parking lot looks like a mall the day before Christmas and it will take you almost that long to find a parking spot (if you find one at all). The rooms look to be recently remodeled with new beds, flat screen TV''s and remodeled bathrooms although the bathrooms are reminiscent of a hotel built 30 + years ago which means they are small, only one sink and have a tub/shower combination. The fact that the concierge lounge is open seven days a week is a plus. Typically most Marriott lounges close mid-day Friday and re-open late Sunday. It's obvious that Marriott must sell this feature to non-Elite guests because the lounge is packed on the weekends and practically empty on the weekdays. Breakfast is typical Marriott lounge fare with eggs, breads/pastries, fruit, etc. Evening cocktails consist of free wine, soda water, juice although no honor bar (which is also unusual for Marriott lounge). Asst. crackers and cheese and a hot appetizer. Dessert is always cookies and brownies. I don't know if I'd pay a premium for this but Elite members get free access to the lounge so it was nice that the lounge was open over the weekend. Didn't eat in either of the restaurants so I couldn't comment on the quality of food but I was told by a small winery owner that the Marriott chef was a notable BBQ chef. I did notice on the menu that there was a larger than normal selection of BBQ items available. The Marriott bills itself as the Napa Marriott Hotel and Spa. The spa (as well as the work out room) is in a separate building next to the hotel. Don't pay to use the spa unless you're getting a treatment. If you're a Platinum Elite member (or a guest of one), the access fee is waived. I went in to use the facilities which consisted of a small whirlpool and steam room. There is no sauna. While clean, the \"spa\" facilities reminded me more of a high school gym then a nice spa. There is a co-ed relaxation room located outside of the mens/womans spa areas that were nice, but lacked the typical spa amenities (bottled water, juices, fruit, snacks, etc.). If you've ever been to a nice spa in Vegas and expect to have the same experience here, think again. The Marriott is in a central location with easy access to downtown Napa, Sonoma and of course the Napa wine country. This is probably the hotels best attribute.

The room was pretty spacious, we upgraded and had plenty of room for the two us. The resort was very relaxing and quite, although there were tons of things going on each day we never felt rushed or like we were in some busy conference hotel. Each morning we would go down to the concierge lounge for breakfast, where they had an assortment of great breakfast items. The lounge opened up to this amazing beautiful patio that was built to resemble a Napa Winery. There was a wedding happening that weekend and we were able to watch from the lounge and it was truly remarkable. The lounge was open all weekend which is rare but well planned. There was wine tasting each evening and lots of cheese and crackers, so you truly didn't have to leave the resort. The Concierge staff was AMAZING! They were so knowledgeable and helpful with everything we wanted to do. They recommended the best wine tour I've ever been on (Platypus Wine Tours) and they got us reservations at the most happening restaurants in town. They also directed us to great shopping and to their world class spa. We spent an entire day at the spa indulging and relaxing in the ambiance that the spa created. We were treated like Royalty from the moment we step foot in the facility which is attached to the resort. We had the Adam & Eve couples massage, facial, manicures, the works...and then I took a super long steam bath which just capped off such a wonderful day. There is no way you couldn't relax at this place, and we loved every minute of it. If you are looking for a relaxing vacation resort that has every amenity imaginable, plus is centrally located to downtown Napa and all of the wineries...this is your one-stop-shop.

The last trip was for business. This time, my husband took a trip with my parents. My parents picked the hotel. Unfortunately, when we checked in (with our confirmation number), the front desk lady told me they were sold out of King rooms. This is irritating and unacceptable! We had a confirmed reservation. As newlyweds, we weren't very happy paying the same rate to stay in a room with 2 full beds. We ended up sleeping in separate beds - too crowded for 2 adults accustomed to a Queen or King size bed. To make matters worse, that double bed room was on the ground floor near the loading area - we were awakened in the night by what sounded like a fleet of delivery trucks. The garbage truck then acted as our alarm clock first thing in the morning. Obviously we complained. I wanted a refund, but lost that battle. The manager apologized and relocated us to 2nd floor King. The outside fountain helped drown out background noise which was a huge relief. The manager sent us a hand written note, bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. A nice gesture, but no excuse for not having our King room available the first night. It was cheap champagne (not even from California). If my parents had not been staying there too, we would have packed up and gone elsewhere. I decided not to spoil everyone's trip. Relocating hotels would have been a huge hassle for my parents. We also paid for Club Level access. That was a disappointment. The room was overly crowded and the entrance was not secured. It was clear that just about anyone could walk in regardless of whether they paid extra for the Club Level. At one point, I walked by the club room and the door was wide open. They may as well take the key card access joke off the door and hang a sign that says, \"Come on in off the street and help yourself.\" The complimentary dessert was nothing special -- the same cookies every night. After watching a young boy spritz the cookies with a sneeze, then baste them with his germy hand, we decided not to eat anything else at the Club Level. No club cookies for me, thanks. I definitely feel this property is over priced. I frequent Marriott properties and this hotel is closer to the quality expected at a Courtyard. I like Courtyard's just fine -- they are clean and basic. This property may have been a thread count higher than the quality of a Courtyard. That's about it. It's certainly not as nice as other Marriott \"Resort\" properties. As the week went on, my bitterness mellowed. Napa Valley wine helped take the edge off my Marriott whining. I figured I'd save it for Trip Advisor. Hopefully someone at Marriott will read this and make some changes. We didn't spend much time at the hotel anyway. Our time and focus was on touring the wineries. Napa Valley is such a treat! It would have been nice to stay at a nicer property, but that's what future trips are for. I will look elsewhere in the future. I'm rating this hotel Average. Everything in Napa is pricey, so I'm not sure we could have found a better rate during the week we went. I did notice a new Courtyard down the road. Wish we had known about that location. Since this hotel was sold out, perhaps there is opportunity for more competition. I'd like to see a nice Hampton Inn on the Napa Valley scene. Also, the downtown area is still under construction. It sure would be nice to stay downtown next time -- lot's of room for economic boom in Napa.

I booked the gardenview because many Tripadvisors were unhappy with the Concierge level. The Hotel is 2 floors with several wings. The complaint of construction is outside on the street and only the rooms facing that area would be effected. Check with hotel before booking room in order to determine if your room would be facing the street. The gardenview room faced the pool and veranda area. We never heard noise on the second floor. The room is totally renovated. The furniture, carpet, bedding etc was clean. We thought the mini fridge was helpful in keeping fruit and water. The Fiji water is $4.50 and we purchased the Safeway brand which was cheap. The hotel staff are available, friendly and knowledgeable. Although we learn that some were unaware of one area or another. The Wine Train which travels Napa to St. Helena was enjoyable. My husband is a train person and we booked the Vista Dome car which serves a gourmet lunch. Sparking wine is included; however the wine with the different courses is offered at a nomial cost. The person who booked our tour told us to be at the station at 10:20 am. The Train started boarding at 11 am. Prior to boarding there was a wine tasting experience. The breakfast in the morning was fabulous. We ate every morning in the restaurant and were served by the sweetest gracious waitresses. We ate off the menu and not the buffet. We had 4 breakfast meals and not once did we repeat what we had eaten the day before. Perhaps, the complaint about the boring breakfast is buffet related; however the food was hot, flavorful and the portion size was generous. The coffee is rich and dark with no bitter taste. We drink our coffee black; therefore we really enjoyed this cup in the morning. Lunch was available in Characters which is the sports bar. Not a huge menu; therefore for a picky eater it could be a slight problem. Order the ice tea and put in a simple syrup with mint which is on every table. That is good! We relaxed in the lobby a few times. It was busy but not as noisy as we expected. I booked a spa package the last day. The technicians are soft spoken, warm and friendly. The treatment rooms and relaxing room are not soothing and people friendly. The relaxing room had apples and water which was not comfort food for a spa. Also, The relaxing room and lockers were tiny. The overall package is good but this is not a spa resort hotel. This is not a bad place; it is just another day spa that is convenient to the hotel.

The evening appetizer was sesame chicken & it was prepared very well. Also free wine, soft drinks, water. The am breakfast was very good also. big tip- the hotel has the name of a store to buy discounted wine at- about a 5-10 minute drive away. The wine there is the best price in the Napa Valley & they have the best prices we have seen in the area- much cheaper than the wineries. One price I compared to the wineries was $5 per bottle less so if you're buying wine, come here.

We chose it because we wanted somewhere with a pool and spa that was close to the wineries, and it was ideal. It was only warm enough to hang out by the pool in the afternoons, so we just slept in and did spa services in the morning. The pool was pretty and clean and the chairs were comfortable. At the spa, I had a massage, facial, and manicure - all were great. One of my friends also had a pedicure that she liked a lot. One very cool thing about the spa is that they had a women\u2019s \u201cwet room\u201d area with a eucalyptus steam bath, vichy rain shower, and Jacuzzi. Very relaxing. We also hung out in the spa lounge area, which was a peaceful place to sit in front of the fireplace and sip wine after our treatments. Oh yeah, there is also a fitness center, which looked nice, but none of us worked out while we were there. We ate at the hotel a lot because we were told they had a great chef, and the food was ideal because there was a lot of variety. We ate at the regular restaurant (Harvest Caf\u00e9) and the outdoor bar and grill, and both had healthy and \u201cindulgent\u201d options, and none of it was too expensive. I\u2019m a healthy eater but some of my friends aren\u2019t, so it was good that there were both types of food. I actually didn\u2019t even gain weight on this vacation despite all the wine! Anyway, we had breakfast one day in the concierge lounge, and it didn\u2019t have a huge selection, but it was free and good. We didn\u2019t have room service except for dessert one night, which was chocolate cake (yum!) but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s good. Also, we did the complimentary wine tastings in the lobby every night and it was great to drink (free) wine and meet other people in the hotel. So speaking of the wine (our main reason for coming) we spent almost a full day going to different tasting rooms. My favorite was definitely the Castello Di Amorosa. The wine was great there, but the really cool thing is that it\u2019s in an amazing medieval castle. We didn\u2019t do the guided tour or anything, but the parts that we were able to walk around in were incredible. I also really liked Rombauer Vineyards. It was a very friendly place with gorgeous trees and flowers and yummy wine. The winery tastings vary in price, but most of the ones we went to were between $10 and $20. Okay, back to the hotel. We had a suite with a living room and a separate bedroom with two beds. There was also a patio overlooking the garden area, and we had coffee out there every morning. We didn\u2019t hang out in the room a lot, but it was definitely nice and had plenty of room for 4 people. The beds were especially comfortable and had TONS of pillows.

The property was very well maintained and the lobby was warm & inviting with the fireplace. Our room was neat and clean and overlooked the grass & courtyard so there was no street noise. The only thing that disappointed was the comforter cover - it was very loud whenever someone tossed and turned and too short on each side. Aside from that, it was a nice room. The staff was also friendly and attentive. This location was also great b/c it was central to the places we planned to visit. For dining, we had booked 2 places in advance: Hurley's in Yountville was new to us, but we purposely reserved it since it was right in the heart of the Festival. All dishes were great - Crab cakes, Scallops/Gnocchi, Wild Boar, Butternut squash ravioli. The desserts did not appeal to us so we opted for our hotel dessert hour. After breakfast and visiting the Napa valley, we ate a late lunch at Bistro Don Giovanni. This is one of my faves as it is always a wonderful experience.

We took a wine tour with Platypus wine tours and had a great time. I would highly recommend Platypus to anyone who wants to go on a wine tour. After the wine tour, we had dinner at Cole's Chophouse which is another must for anyone who wants a great steak with a nice atmosphere.

We couldn't get into THe Chop House, their sister restaraunt, until 9:30 reservations, and they don't take walk-ins. Fume Bistro was good. We were surprised that the food in Napa wasn't more expensive. It's not cheap, but it's not Santa Fe prices, either. In Napa, Miyamo is a fun boutique, and Betty's Girl Boutique nearby has vintage, and vintage that has been slightly updated. The shop owner was super nice. I would have loved to have stayed in Calistoga. If I had to do it again, I would stay there. The town street has quite a few dining options, and good ones, that I could have walked to from a few hotel options. I loved Indian Springs- we had a mud bath there, and I'm a fan. Wonderful. My skin looked great. Hess Winery has free shipping right now. A wonderful art gallery to look at, too. Del Dotto has wines from different vineyards that they will ship for you. The cave tour is supposed to be fun, again I didn't do, but wish... apparently you do 12 tastings from different wines and types of barrels, and people come out of it pretty toasty. Clos Pegase, St. Clement were lovely to visit-Clos for cool sculpture and St. Clement for the view. I loved the vibe at Miner and Groth. Dutch Henry was a fun smaller vineyard. Grgich, Krug, Frank, also ranked highly. Split your tastings, and you don't get so loaded. Most tastings run about $10 for 4-5 tastes, but they'll often throw in a reserve wine or something to tempt you.

I asked if that would be okay before I scheduled a facial and my husband scheduled a massage. We only did this so we could go in together. So she scheduled the services and we came back at our scheduled time. I went into the spa and got myself ready for my appointment, and my husband disappeared into the mens room. When I was sitting in the waiting room, excited for this, the girl that scheduled me came in and said they wouldn't be able to help me because of my cold. I was upset, but didn't say anything, more almost in tears than anything else. I left, and spent the next hour and a half dwelling while waiting for my husband to come back. He was upset. He asked them when he came out if I was almost done and they explained to him that they couldn't provide services to me. It was upsetting. Overall the exerience wasn't great at the Marriot.

Couldn't tell it by the condition of the room when we finally entered. The carpets were stained, there was hair in the tub and the sheets looked as if they had been slept on already. The bath amentities are the typical vanilla and orange scented variety. -- nothing special. The A/C is the older style and very noisy. A this room was supposed to be a junior suite? I can't imagine what a normal room looked like. The staff was very preoccupied and not overly nice. I would normally give them a break on this complaint if they had shown an effort to help anyone but they all just appeared exhausted. Of course, given the amount of \"bus tours\" that appear to use this hotel as a base, I can understand. There were busses parked everywhere in the parking lot. When we returned from dinner (in Yountville)and parked in front of the hotel there were large groups of young men roaming around. They were pulling on outdoor handles and waiting to enter the Marriott after we opened the door. They clearly were not staying at the hotel but were attempting to gain entry. I hate to imagine that they got in! The concierge level suite is a joke. It is an old conference room were Marriott placed a sofa, four chairs and a few tables plus one television.

On both occasions the Marriott reservation agents made huge errors in my reservations; or perhaps the hotel management didn't do a good job in executing the reservations the way they were made? Who knows... The first time, I specifically requested a garden room (not looking towards the huge parking lot); my girlfriend has allergies and I experienced mild asthma problems then... I asked for a second floor room, to make sure I stay away from any pollution. Also, we asked for a King, or Queen size bed in the worst case... The reservation personnel promised all that in a very servile polite manner. But, upon arrival, we were given a room on 1st floor, looking directly at the parking lot! The room had the heavy overwhelming aroma of old carpet, and the window was not of the open-able type... the only way to get some of the world-famous Napa Valley pure air was to switch the AC / Ventilation System mounted underneath the window. That system was noisy and had a heavy musty smell, just like the carpet. Also, the external vent that picked up air was at the same level as the exhausts of all gas-guzzling SUVs and Monster Trucks that passed by the window with ferocious roar (like Elephant fart) & parked right outside; so generous amounts of fumes entered inside without any problem. In addition, we didn't even get a Queen size... instead, we had to share one of the tiny double bed all night. At least we were into the slightly newer wing of the hotel (for premier Gold members such as myself), the other wing seemed older and more worn out. The second time around, similar thing happened with our reservation. I got a bit mad & had a talk with the hotel manager. As a premier member, they made an \"exception\": they finally put me into a garden room with queen size bed. Good! However, no room was available in the newer Gold Rewards wing, so they gave me a \"nicer\" room in the older wing. Oh MG! Never seen a nastier, stuffier room in my life.. What a disgrace. The room's smell was like a mixture of a male goat, rotten Camembert cheese and 2-years old sneakers. In addition, the room was supposed to be non-smoking, but somehow beneath the musty smell I felt there was also a hint of cigarette, too. I'm allergic to ciggie smells, that is why I can easily detect them... Since we were on 1st floor again, we could not leave the French Window open (afraid that somebody can easily enter during the night and surprise in our PJ's...) so again we were forced to use the ventilation. That only enhanced & enriched the stench, instead of alleviating it. For 2 days of stay, my asthma symptoms worsened and started to really bother me again. I guess we are very strong people, it takes A LOT to make us understand, but we FINALLY got the message! We'll just never visit that property again.

The management insisted that the construction was 'minor' and we shouldn't worry about noise (Tell that to the concrete truck and bulldozer outside our window at 8am...). - We were woken up by both the construction noise outside our window, as well as the construction workers extremely loud foul language. - When we went outside to escape the construction noises and foul language, we were shocked to find our car (that we had parked in a full lot the night before) gone!

To quote many other reviews, this is a pretty \"typical Marriott,\" which can be a good thing for those who want a familiar, clean and reasonably modern place to stay without all the fluff (like us). We got an obscene, and I mean really good, price on our room for 4 nights so we didn't go in with the same expectations as we would have had paying say $300 a night. What's it worth paying? Easily $150 or less, probably up to $200. After that you can find better for the money (if anything is available). There are some pretty good physical descriptions of the hotel in recent reviews, so I'll gloss over that by saying it's very clean with nice size rooms. We had the same problems with the shower not holding a temperature at any time of day. Parking wasn't an issue, always got a spot near a door. Check in and out were a breeze, no surprises. Can't comment on the Spa or pool or stuff like that, we were there only to literally collapse between full days of wine tasting. The big plus to this hotel is it's location. It is right off Hwy 29, the main highway through the Napa Valley and all it's wineries. There are several crossovers to the Silverado Trail off of 29. The hotel is actually on a road called Solano Ave which is like a sevrice road that parallels 29, giving you yet another driving option. Only a couple miles down Solano is Buffalo's Shipping, where you can send as much wine home as you want regardless of State laws. Two reasonably priced gas stations are a block away as is a Taget store and many other shops/restaurants. I didn't see a better place to use as a \"base of operations\" for your wine country stay. That's what this is and what you should expect, a decent place to sleep and regroup. Bottom Line: Don't expect luxury or old world charm here, just a clean and modern place to crash and ultra traveling convenience to the whole Napa Valley.

We got the room on Priceline for $122/night. (For Priceline, check Napa and 3 star hotels - it'll bring up the Marriott and the Embassy Suites). The hotel was a typical Marriott - sort of reminded me of a Courtyard by Marriott instead. But it was a great base location for touring the Napa wineries. All we were interested in was a place to leave our clothes, take showers and sleep. We were not looking for charm. But the hotel was nice. It's located across the street from a shopping center - Target, Ralph's Supermarket, Longs Drug Store, etc. Since we forgot a few things for the trip, it was convenient to have these stores a few minutes away. The hotel offered bottled water in the room for $4.50 so we ran over to Ralph's and picked up a 12 pack of Poland Spring for $4 instead. We had a few breakfasts at the Harvest Cafe. We opted not to take the breakfast buffet for $14.95 since we were able to get a 2 egg breakfast, breakfast meat, hash browns and toast or English muffin for $9.95. The extra $5 would have gotten us cereal and fruit which we wouldn't have eaten anyway. The last few mornings, we ran out to the Jack In The Box and grabbed breakfast sandwiches, coffee and orange juice for $6/person. There are two coffee places across the street as well that seemed to be pretty popular with the locals but I never went to either one. The Characters Sports Bar was a good place to hang out and grab some pub grub and drinks. We hung out there one afternoon while waiting for our laundry. The guest laundry was $1 per load and $1 for 45 minutes of drying. The detergent and dryer sheets were complimentary from the front desk. Since we were heading out for the second leg of our trip and were all wined out, we decided to lay low and wash clothes. I never noticed any noise from other doors in the hallway - it might have been because we had the TV on or we're just not that sensitive to noise. We also used the stairs a lot since the elevator was really slow. By the time the doors opened, closed and started for the second floor, we were already up the stairs and walking towards our room. The one thing I did notice was that the hallways were really long. It sort of reminded us of The Shining where Danny rides his Big Wheel down the halls! But since our room was 2009, we were closer to the stairs and elevator. Because our stay coincided with Labor Day weekend, the hotel was fully booked. Parking was a bear! If we weren't back to the hotel by 7pm, we had to park on the other side of the building and walk back to our entry door. There are several keycard doors around the building that will let you back into the hotel so you never had to walk to through the lobby. On a side note, we decided to get massages over at the Amadeus Spa. I thought the facilities were nice - plenty of towels, nice robes, plenty of water, free steam and hot tub. The massage therapists were great and adjusted their massages to what we wanted. It was a nice way to detox after a few days of serious wine tasting. The only major problem we had was with the shower in the room. After adjusting the water temperature, after about 3 minutes, the water would get scalding hot and then it would get freezing cold. There was no way to control it. I thought it was because we were taking showers at odd hours (3pm, 5pm and 11pm) but it happened in the morning as well. I believe I had one shower where the water actually stayed the same temperature all the way through. It may have been a fluke but it was really annoying. And the only reason we didn't check out and move was because we had already pre-paid with Priceline. I liked the location of the hotel as well as having the shopping center nearby. There's also a post office up the street - very handy since we shipped clothing home to make room in our suitcases for all the wine we bought! Overall, barring the showers, I'd have to say that I'd go back - it was an excellent base for touring Napa.

My room was not ready but I was made to feel comfortable by the front desk who graciously gave me access to the concierge lounge to relax in and they told me to return in an hour. An hour later, I returned to the front desk, was greeted by name and given a room. The room was fine but perhaps not in the prime locations of the hotel. The desk clerk was obviously apologetic without me saying anything and wanted to give a better room but none were available that early. The room was fine with me, I just wanted to be able to check in early. I then proceeded with the spa treatments which were fabulous. The spa is not elaborate, but they provide excellent services with a nice quiet room and patio to relax in. The prices were fair for the services. All the staff at the hotel were so nice. With the concierge room, there is wine and snacks served at 5-7 pm. The wine served was excellent quality and the appetizers were delicious. Then at 7:30 pm desert is served which were warm chocolate chip cookies. For those not in the concierge room, there is complimentary wine tasting in the comfortable and warm lobby. The breakfast in the concierge room was a full breakfast, deliciously prepared. The concierge Matt was very knowledgable about the area and helpful in guiding folks to what they wanted to enjoy. He really seemed to care about the guests enjoying themselves. Everything was done by the Marriott in a first class manner and the service was outstanding and caring.

NEGATIVES: [Neg. Item 1] The bathroom did not have a fan. [Neg. Item 2] Phone rates were a bit much \u2013 i.e. $1 for any outgoing call (800# & local numbers) and 10 cents for each minute over 20 minutes. POSITIVES: One of my favorite Marriott\u2019s I have ever stayed at. This Marriott is a two story independently owned hotel of the Sunstone Hotel chain and very quaint. Very tasteful lobby. We opted for the concierge garden view and it was so worth it. There are 82 concierge rooms. Some first floor concierge rooms have patios. I don\u2019t think any on the second floor had balconies. Many of the non-concierge rooms on both floors have balconies. Something to consider. The hotel underwent renovations approx. 2 years ago. The carpet in the hall was such a rich looking blue similar to that of presidential color blue. Loved it. As for the room\u2026great. The closet revealed two robes. Nice touch. The closet doors were both full length mirrors of good quality. The bathroom was great too. The countertop was a beautiful black granite. And finally, a shower tub and wall that was immaculate and well grouted. Very clean! Aesthetically pleasing comforter, heavenly bed, and pillows that felt as good as they looked. Complimentary refrigerator and in-room safe. And finally...a Marriott with tasteful wallpaper that was a beige color. The concierge lounge was great. Outstanding breakfasts \u2013 hot food as well as breads, fruit, cereals, yogurts. We never made it mid day to see if anything was put out then. After 5:30 \u2013 out comes the free wines. That\u2019s right\u2026free. Hot hors'doeuvres. After 7:30 comes dessert. Although food may not be re-stocked after 10PM, the lounge remains accessible by card all night. Complimentary water, soda, tea, and coffee all night. Both concierges (Emma & Matt) were very helpful. Do take advantage of their abilities to make reservations at the vineyards as well as restaurants. And don\u2019t forget \u2013 request the 2 for 1 tasting certificates they have on-file for select vineyards. Coupons can be found in the magazines in the lounge. For those who have never been to Napa, tastings are not free at most vineyards. Be on the lookout for hot air balloons near the hotel. Really beautiful. The pool area was small but adequate. Nothing fancy but still good. Complimentary access to a gym facility that looked really modern. FINAL COMMENTARY: I chose this hotel as I try to earn Marriott points whenever possible and it did not let me down. Some rooms that are non-garden can face the road and be a downer. While it is true that a Target is nearby, it\u2019s one of the nicest we\u2019ve ever seen and it\u2019s designed to look like a Mediterranean villa.
