Our Room was no. 8, this was overlooking the garden. A nice spacious and quite room, most comfortable and enjoyable. In fact we shared our experience with other hotel guests who had the same opinion as us. They all were enjoying their stay at the Wilhelmina, same as we were.The hotel is nicely located in the cultural part of Amsterdam though still very central. There is a direct tram no. 2 connection to the heart of Amsterdam which is just a 5 minute tram ride away.Excellent breakfast service and very friendly staff. All in all, it was way better than the normal continental breakfast you get at typical European hotels.Thoroughly professional  highly efficient and well informed staff.

The tram line 2 station Valeriusplein is 2 minutes walk away from the hotel, which takes you to the city centre in about 20 minutes. It's also close to the Vondelpark. There are a few interesting local shops, an old blues record shop, a tile shop, a second hand bookshop and a nice supermarket.Our room seemed a little drab, rather old-fashioned decor, but the bed was very comfortable and the shower excellent - but beware the hot water can be scalding hot. The hotel was quiet a night.Breakfast was uninspiring but adequate. The breakfast room is pleasant.Hotel staff were pleasant but not especially welcoming. Payment of the full bill is required on arrival, there is a surcharge unless you pay cash, and the 5% city tax is not included in the booking price. The hotel also charges for storing cases if your departure is after you check out, which seems a little unfair.We would probably stay there again, because the price was quite reasonable, the hotel location is very nice, and the tram stop is so close.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR245846174", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "davidr4u"}, {"Content": "Nice small hotel I have spent 4 night in this hotel, and the first room that I got for two nights was smelly, at 3 floor, and it's not worth the money.

This hotel is really conning its customers. 135 euros a night, then an extra 6% on arrival for paying by visa., which they don't tell you. This hotel is so basic and out of date that you can find better and more comfortable hostels. The details on our confirmation booking form stated  a nice room. Well, we got a room that had black mould around the windows, the room stank of smoke and musky, there are burn holes in the carpet, furniture and bedding. We also found rubbish under one of the beds from the previous guests.The bathrooms are TINY and very dangerous when taking a shower. There is no showewr basin, just the tiled floor. The hairdryer needs two people to operate it ( if it works at all, as ours didn't) The staff are pleasant, but cannot really be bothered to help you or offer you advice. There is no access to tea and coffee, unless you want to pay another 15 euros for the kettle in your room. The hotel is noisy at night, heavy banging doors. There are no staff on duty at night, and although the location is nice it is about 40 mins walk to the centre.The breakfast is basic, but ok food, just a traditional dutch breaky.We will never ever stay here again and wish to lot as many people know what a con this hotel is.", "Date": "May 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR467800339", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "lancashireblond"}, {"Content": "good value for money We stayed at the aadam wilhelmina hotel (20th - 23rd Oct 2006).

When you book this hotel online, they send you an e-mail informing you that they have earmarked a 'nice' room. There was nothing nice about our stay. All the negative comments about this hotel on TripAdvisor are true (would we have seen them before we booked!). It is musty and dirty. Carpets have seen better days. Our bedspread was stained, sockets didn't work, there were bare wires on lights, and taps were loose. Double beds are composed of two singles pushed together. There were no curtains on bathroom windows, no toiletries (not even bars of soap, just liquid soap dispensers), the stairs were treacherously steep, and the breakfast mediocre. All this for 160 Euros a night!The management are extremely arrogant and rude and make no secret of the fact that money is the prime concern. Payment is demanded upfront within minutes of arrival and if you want to use a credit card they whack you for 6 percent surcharge. Despite the high cost of the rooms, they charge 20 Euros per night for a kettle/tea/coffee and also ask 20 Euros as deposit for the plastic keys. When we asked to see the room as a courtesy before we paid, we were told that even if we didn't like it we would still have to pay for the nights reserved as the hotel had our credit card details. We had booked online for 4 nights and stuck it for 2. Early morning on the third day, we were greeted by the sight of a mouse helping himself to the sugar next to the bed. Far from being concerned, the manager said no one had ever complained about vermin before and expressed scepticism of our complaint. After an unpleasant argument, we left and we were refused any kind of refund. We booked via the helpful Tourist Info Office 2 nights at the Hotel Torens in central Amsterdam, which was very expensive (compounded by the lack of refund). But at least the quality of the hotel and the courtesy of the staff helped wash away the memory of the Wilhemina. The first thing we did was have a shower!This hotel is seriously bad news and should, in our view, be removed from travel websites.

Our first impression upon entering was the musty smell. We had asked for a non-smoking room and assumed we would get one as we had not been advised otherwise, however all rooms are smoking and it was too late. The room itself smelled very strongly of smoke and the bedspread had multiple burn marks. The smell of smoke on the blankets is intolerable to a non-smoker. I must admit the sheets were changed every day but sometimes they were so old and threadbare they actually had holes in them. We booked a double room and are aware that you can sometimes get two singles pushed together, which is what we got this time, but we also had two sets of single bed sheets! Not conducive to a good night\u9225\u6a9a sleep!. The room itself (room 6) was dull, small and very much in need of decoration. The bathroom looked clean but for the first couple of days smelled of urine (presumably the floor was washed on the third day). The only extra, the hair dryer (fixed dangerously in a steamy bathroom with no window or ventilation) needed a second person to permanently stand with their finger on the button before it would work, so be sure to take a patient partner if you want to dry your hair! And as petty as it may seem for the price we paid I would at least expect a bath mat or a even hand towel.Breakfast\u9225? The food was fresh and plentiful on four of the five days. However, the breakfast room was also the reception and consequently space was very limited; if you were unlucky enough to get a seat with your back to the aisle then you had people continuously pushing past. The staff were polite to us (but we did hear the receptionist refer to someone as a stupid [--]. We were allowed to leave our bags when we arrived very early and before our room was ready and also for a few hours after checking out until our late flight was due, so that was helpful. The hotel is on the tram route to all the major attractions but is a good 25 minute walk to the outskirts of the centre and perhaps an hour or so to the central station; too far really to walk every day into the centre itself, which we felt necessary because of the lack of bars and restaurants close by. Definitely not a place we would ever return to, perhaps the kind of place you might expect to use as a teenager on a low budget.

We took a three-night stay in a double room at this excellent hotel in late January 2006 and found it to be totally different to the three reviews already posted. It was very good value for money, adjacent to the No. 2 tram route which gets you to and from the centre of Amsterdam briskly, cheaply and safely. In fact, so conveniently was it situated that we never actually took the tram to the city centre in the mornings, but only used it for travelling back at night!Travellers who must have a lift/elevator should perhaps not go there if using a minimal amount of effort is a problem, although we had to climb two sets of stairs to our room and only found the turn at the top of the second flight of stairs a bit of a challenge with narrow steps, but overseas visitors might like to consider that the traditional narrow but tall configuration of Dutch buildings makes this necessary. The able-bodied should NOT find it a challenge.The bed was fine, as was the cleanliness of the room, the bathroom, and the breakfast area.
