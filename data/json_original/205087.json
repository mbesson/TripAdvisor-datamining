This hotel has a hospitable and caring spirit and all the staff we interacted with were incredibly cordial and accommodating, particularly Flavio the bartender, the porters, front desk personnel, and the friendly and efficient ladies who are the collective motor of the breakfast room. The location can't be beat - you are virtually just steps away from the Spanish Steps, the Keats-Shelley House and the Barberini Metro stop, and within very easy walking distance to the Trevi Fountain and numerous other sights. I've read many of the Hotel King's reviews on tripadvisor and I think the hotel's been unfairly slammed in many instances. Look, the King Hotel is definitely a budget accommodation, so don't stay in this obvious budget class hotel expecting a five star experience. If that's what you want, please select one of the numerous five star hotels in the neighborhood. However, if you - like me - prefer to economize on the cost of your hotel and put those saved funds to use enjoying Rome, the King Hotel is a great find and offers a terrific deal in a beautiful, historic and highly desirable neighborhood. There is a very attractive and comfortable bar with a big, comfortable sitting area furnished with roomy chairs and several sofas. Flavio, the bar manager, is a wonderful guy, genial and helpful and his little dog Picola is so sweet she's bound to make you smile. As for the actual hotel rooms, they are indeed simple and small, and some of them are, by American standards, run down and a bit dingy, but none of the 5 rooms I saw were dirty. The bedrooms and bathrooms were cleaned every day, towels were replaced and the bathrooms were actually sparkling. We found the breakfast to be abundant and tasty. Guests have a choice of fresh pastries, breads, cereal and milk, ham, cheese, various jams, juice, and strong, excellent coffee. Tea is also available.

The television was modern, but we never could get it to work! Our room was on the 4th (actually 5th) floor, and overlooked the courtyard so was quiet (except for the church bells, but they didn't ring late at night). The breakfast was your typical European continental breakfast each morning, but the pastry was always good and they had great Italian coffee! The staff was very friendly and helpful to us gave us good directions and arranged a car back to Fiumacino to meet the cruise line at a price significantly less than our travel agent arranged from the airport to the hotel. The desk and housekeeping staff always smiled and greeted us as we came and went. Next door was a nice, inexpensive casual restaurant \"La Botte\".

The bath and linens were clean and that is really what mattered most to us along with the ability to walk anywhere in Rome. Our children enjoyed the breakfast buffet with cereal, pasteries and breads. We also bought fresh fruit from local vendors and it was more than adequate for us. If you want a luxury hotel, you are going to pay for it in Rome. If you want a clean room, helpful staff and convenience, then you won't be disappointed by the King. Be sure to bring your own bottled water back to the hotel with you and don't make the same mistake we did in taking the Metro to the Spanish Stairs. You are too far from the King and it is a difficult walk with luggage. It's really important to have realistic expectations for European hotels and the old buildings in which they are located.

The roof garden and other terraces were pretty. This is a 3 star hotel and not a 5 star it is very central 5 mins to spanish steps, 7 mins to trevi fountain and 15 by bus to the vatican. The continental breakfast is sufficient but should you need anything else there is seperate menu you can purchase from. The showers are powerful and rooms are changed frequently and no problen to have more towels. It is clean and really a place to sleep, have breakfast and chill out on the terrace in the evening, no restaurant apart from breakfast but the choice around the city is phenomenal. I feel the staff were helpful, friendly and polite and I would definetly go back there if going to Rome again. It is not the laps of luxury but sufficent.

When we arrived the lady at the reception desk smiled and said there was a problem. They did not have a room for us eventhough we had confirmed reservations, but sent us to another hotel further out. She said we could come back the next day as we were to stay there a total of four nights. We had no choice but to go to the other place. The next day we came back and they told us that because of their mistake we would only be charged 150 Euros instead of 190 Euros. We quickly realized we had a 150 Euro room (only tub no shower) instead of the superior room. We wanted a shower so the next day they moved us to a room with a shower. The stall was about 24 inches; you could hardly turn around in it. The breakfasts were terrible. They had croisants, but you had to ask for them; they seemed to be rationed. The coffee was weak and warm. They had no cheese or deli, only bread, butter, cake and cereal. We had been in Italy for two weeks and this was the worst breakfast we faced. We had stayed at the King a number of years ago, but never again. I would not recommend this 'hotel' to my worse enemy. I only wish there was some authority in Rome I could report them to.

On arrival we requested an upgrade to a room with balcony. Upon viewing both rooms, this appeared to be a good move as the original room was small, dark and quite dingy. In contrast the room we upgraded to (at no further cost may I add) was bright, spacious, clean and adeqauetely decorated with the added bonus of a morning sun soaked terrace. One point to add is that the room was fairly cold when we arrived and the heater took at least 15 mins to to start working once was switched on. Breakfast was adequate, bread very tough so a tip is to ask for bread to be slightly toasted. Cakes on offer tasted like they had been around for as long at the Colloseoum and the orange juice was nothing special. The Hotel was ideally located 2 mins walk from Barberini Metro Station and 5 mins walk from Piaza De Spagne and the SPanish Steps. For a relaxing drink we would recommend a capuccino sat at an 'al fesco' table at the Amercan Bar on Piazza de barberini. Also try Blue JCE Ice Cream Parlour along from Hotel King on Via Sistina for every flavour of Ice Cream you could possibly imagine.

So, if you wanna get off and on the subway in less than 5 minutes, and be close to via veneto, piazza barberini, and the other sites mentioned above, the hotel king is a good place to stay.

The man at the front desk spoke fairly good English when we checked in. We opened the door to the room and it smelled so awful I almost started crying. I kicked off my shoes and walked across the carpeting only to hear squish, squish, squish. The carpeting was soaked from a window that was left open. The mildewy smell was horrendous. When I phoned the front desk to report the problem, the man acted as if his English was so limited he could not understand. After a lengthy, unpleasant conversation he moved us to a different room.

My wife asked if there were any other rooms available and the only other one was without air-conditioning. We stayed put one night and were moved for our second night to a better room.

Sadly, I think the room we got was their best room (having seen in many others) and it was still a pit. This place sucks. The people are all rude and unhelpful. The breakfast is bad.
