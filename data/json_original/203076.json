This was probably the nicest Holiday Inn I have ever stayed in! They offer a shuttle from the airport for free and since it is a bit of a drive from the city center they offer a shuttle to downtown for only 2.50 Euros one way per person. It was nice to stay there to get away from the busy city. Everything looks new and has a nice swimming pool area and 24 hour business center. The only thing I would mention is their restaurant. I would not recommend it. My family of five ate there for dinner one night and all the meals were not good at all. But their bar was fine. If you are stay in Rome, stay at the Holiday Inn but eat down town!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201c14km from Rome city centre\u201d", "Author": "rowdygirl", "ReviewID": "UR128059283", "Content": "I, my husband and about 45 others stayed here as part of an Italian package tour over Easter 2012. The hotel itself is very nice. It is clean and updated. Our 3-course meals were provided as part of our package deal including a hot continental breakfast each morning. All were well prepared and nicely served. There were 'snacks' provided before dinner with the purchase of a beverage in the bar. The internet connection was expensive so we didn't bother with it. Our only other beef with the place was that it was 14km out of the city centre of Rome. However, it was a very easy, short (30 min) and inexpensive (1 Euro - train and subway combined) ride to get to downtown Rome from the Muratella station - just a short walk from the Holiday Inn. TO GET DOWNTOWN, you can purchase your train ticket at the desk at the hotel for 0.90 Euros. From the parking lot, turn left and walk along the fence past the garbage cans and towards the tracks. Then turn left for the platform. There is very little signage except the 'Muratella' sign at the station. The trains run about every 20 min. Get off at the Ostiense train station (4th stop) and walk to the Piramide Metro station along a series of indoor walkways. At Piramide, take the Rebibbia train to Termini (the central station downtown) using the same ticket. From there you can take a cab or get on a sightseeing bus or just walk to anywhere you want to go. TO GET TO THE HOTEL FROM DOWNTOWN (the Metro Termini station), buy your 1 Euro ticket at a tobacco shop, news stand or machine upstairs at the station. Take the B - Blue Metro line going towards Laurentina and get off at the 4th stop - Piramide. Walk to the Ostiense train station and find the correct track by looking at the schedules in the glass cases, probably Track 12. It will tell you the departure time (every 20 min or so). Make your way to the track and get off at the 4th stop, the Muratella station. Walk to the left (east) along the platform and continue along the chain link fence and past the garbage containers, soon you will see the hotel, the parking lot and the driveway entrance on the right. There is also a hotel shuttle to downtown for a fee. This hotel is very convenient to the Fiumicino (Da Vinci) Rome Airport and only took us about 10 minutes to get there. There is an airport shuttle as well. There is a nice bar area and a patio area with a pool. I would definitely stay here again if I were flying in or out of Rome. However, if I were planning on spending time in the city, I would prefer a hotel within walking distance of downtown.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCharges\u201d", "Author": "Shahid T", "ReviewID": "UR128005928", "Content": "Travellers should be aware that hotel staff charge them twice for the same stay.

On arrival at Muratella it would have been useful to have some signage to direct us to the Holiday Inn (cross the tracks and go left, then take a right down a pathway). The hotel is of 70's vintage I would guess, big and in the middle of a business park. The hotel reception staff checked us in in a businesslike fashion, I can never understand why all of our passport details are required when the border guard at Fiumicino just waved us through without looking at our travel documents. I found the reception staff to be helpful but too involved in their processes to notice when trying to catch their attention. We went up to our room, with two double beds (I had understood from their website that a family room would also include a sofabed - not so). My wife was disappointed to find that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Although the room was big by Italian standards, we had the perennial problem of keeping ourselves cool, it seems that the a/c doesn't become fully operational until later in the season (this was April), we resorted to keeping the window open which wasn't too successful and resulted in interrupted sleep. Outside was fairly quiet apart from the yelping from what I assume is a dog's refuge in the far distance, thankfully not in the middle of the night. We had a drink in the bar each evening where I am pleased to report that the staff were very friendly and pointed out that that on weekdays an \"aperitivo\" is served between 1800 and 2000, a cold finger buffet of snacks which our children enjoyed. The swimming pool looked very inviting but sadly this is not useable until June. The hotel is full of corporate hospitality during the week, many people wearing business suits attending conferences/seminars etc. We decided against using the hotel restaurant for dinner choosing instead to go to the Verde Smeralda situated a two minute walk behind the hotel. This is a very pleasant, informal Italian restaurant specialising, in very tasty pasta, pizza and steaks. The staff there speak good English, and we were looked after royally by Fabio, at a fraction of the cost of the Holiday Inn. I noticed that many of the residents of the hotel, especially families, came over each evening and I am grateful to the Trip Advisor reviewer who pointed this out. We took two shuttles into Rome, the service is very good at 3.50 Euros per person per journey (7 euros return). Buy the tickets from reception before you leave, the bus was never more than a third full and it drops you at via Petroselli, very central for walking around Rome. I had to take the shuttle bus to the airport to collect a rental car, I was a little surprised to learn that this service is free from the airport to hotel, but costs 2.50 Euros to go back to the airport. Breakfast was of a reasonable standard, not as good as British or American Holiday Inns but fine by the standards I have experienced in other Italian hotels, the scrambled eggs were not that appetising. Overall, this was a good choice of hotel, the price was very competitive, the location was fine thanks to the excellent shuttle service to town. The biggest drawback was the warmth of our room so I would return when it is either colder, or warmer and the a/c is operating... and when the pool is open so that the kids can use it, and we can enjoy a cup of tea in our room!", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nagpur", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding\u201d", "Author": "pbaronde", "ReviewID": "UR127287608", "Content": "The rooms were very good and attractive. in the beautiful area, the environment of the room makes it more pleasant.

I would warn you that it is starting to fall apart and cleaning staff is having a hard time keeping up. Say away from rooms that face the pool since they are very hot all day and night (even in the winter). The front staff is also starting to loose its 'charisma' if you make a request make sure that you double check with them because they tend to forget and not pass along the message between day and night front desk managers. Don't expect a well balanced breakfast you will find a limited assortment of oily bacon scrambled eggs and a few pastries. This is a good hotel for working in the outskirts of Rome or if you are traveling to Rome on a budget. Transportation The city bus is not well connected. I never took their shuttle buss but always seems to be a mess. Taxi If you want to save 2-3 Euro don't call for a taxi at the front desk walk outside the front gate turn left and get the taxi (1 min walk). If you call the cab drives 100 feet but seem to turn on the meter a few minutes before to run up the bill then comes in to pick you up. Upside The rooms are big by Italian standards. Therefore a family of 4 can fit into a room without major problems. During the summer the pool is nice for kids but why would you go to Rome to sit at the pool in the outskirts of the city? Also the gym is decent (again by Italian standards) decent cardio equipment poor with weights.

It caters for large groups and conferences - so be warned, it could be very busy. In my case, the location was convenient. My room was spacious but totally devoid of any charm whatsoever. The bed was comfortable, but that's about as far as the positives go. The decor of the room was bland and the furniture basic but functional. The carpet was badly worn, very faded and in dire need of replacement. The bathroom was clean but very old fashioned and the shower was distinctly low-pressure. Overall, the room was thoroughly depressing. There was a mini-bar, but no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The doors, walls and windows offer little to no soundproofing. I especially enjoyed my neighbour singing a lullaby at about 11pm one evening, though it didn't help me drift off to sleep. Less enjoyable was the constant flow of conference-related bus traffic entering/leaving the car park - which seemed to require one or more blasts of their horn, even at night. Also worthy of note is that you can hear every sound from the neighbouring bathroom.

For those lured in by the promise of an airport shuttle, be warned: It runs sporadically or sometimes not at all. If you don't catch the shuttle at the appointed time, which runs less than half a dozen times a day from the airport, you will have to shell out anywhere from 30 to 40 euros for a taxi one way. The hotel will offer NO assistance in the shuttle service, saying it is an contractor. It also says it advertises on the holidayinn Web site that it is a limited service. This is not true, and for folks expecting a certain level of service from a Holiday Inn/ICHG property ... well, check your expectations at the door at this hotel. Also, please note that the bus to and from Rome's city center is oversold and runs on a first come, first serve basis. Even if you have purchased a roundtrip ticket for 5 euro, you can be turned away. Again, the hotel takes no responsibility. The hotel staff was dismissive about issues with the shuttle, and refused to allow us out of our reservation to find a more convient, better located hotel that did not falsely advertise an airport shuttle... telling me that it noted the shuttle service was timed, etc., on its Web site. As you can see from the number of complaints, that's false. It also lacks the basic room amenities that one expects with a Holiday Inn overseas, such as a kettle, etc. I would suggest that you look elsewhere for a hotel if you are planning to use the hotel as a jumping off point to tour Rome.

Brilliant family hotel with the garden and pool area as the kids can run free and burn off some energy. Because it is out of town you are not paying the expensive prices for a hotel. It is in a business area but the gardens around the pool with fences you don't really notice make up for it. The restaurant is basic and the menu items are simple. This is great for families as the meals are not over done or too way out for the kids to enjoy. The breakfast is a very good smorgesboard as per usual in Europe so it is a good start to the day. The staff are very courteous and caring in the restuarant trying hard to assist you in any way possible. A good conference hotels for business as they seem to have the conference rooms, break out rooms and special little places near the poolside for morning tea and lunchs. Generally the rooms are of a good size and are clean. Some aspects may seem a little dated but all seem to be in working order as well as clean.

The prices of the hotel restaurants and internet services are horrendous. The ice machine on our floor was out of order and the rooms were tired as was the carpet. We found a nice little restaurant around the corner that served good food at reasonable rates.

Upon my request, the hotel emailed me a pdf copy of the shuttle bus schedule and told me where to find it. The bus arrived approximately on time and exactly where I was told it would be. The bus is free from the airport to the hotel and is 2.5 Euros on the way back to the airport, or to Rome's city center. My corporate negotiated rate included the breakfast buffet, which was great. Hot dishes like eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes were available along with fruits, sliced meats and cheeses, yogurt, pastries, etc. My room was large (contained 2 double beds, desk, and an additional seating area) and very clean. The bathroom was also nice-sized and spotless. They provided shampoo, shower gel, hand lotion and bar soap. There was a good-sized flat screen TV and a minibar. All the furnishings, carpet, etc. appeared to be pretty new. The hotel has a large, quite nice pool area. It was extremely inviting, with plenty of chairs and umbrellas. There are also outside seating areas, where my colleagues and I enjoyed a cocktail one night. The bar offers free snacks during \"Happy Hour.\" As I was by myself the first night, I ate dinner in the hotel restaurant.

The lobby always had groups coming and going. However, I found the front desk personnel to be very professional, knowledgeable and friendly regardless of how busy they always seemed to be. Beside the hotel restaurant being very expensive, the one downside to the hotel is how far it is from Rome's city center. A cab ride was about 25 Euros and a half hour depending on traffic. You can walk to the train station (about 1 block away at the rear of the industrial park) or catch the shuttle bus as an alternative.

Had I not been staying on Holiday Inn points and had a free stay, I would have probably complained. We used the free shuttle to the airport and arrived downstairs 30 minutes early for the shuttle. Unbenounced to us, the hotel had a large group staying at the hotel and was transporting them to a conference facility near the airport. We came very close to not being able to get on the shuttle ( because we had to deal with getting the luggage stowed under the bus and all the conference goers piled onto the bus). It would have been helpful if the front desk had told us of the estra shuttle riders the night before when we asked for the shuttle schedule. I read other review about a breakfast, we were not offered a breakfast. Like others stated, the hotel is in an office park. There was one restaurant in walking distance which was decent. However, we were a little nervous walking there given the industrial area and dim lighting, we were not sure how safe the area was. When we were waiting for the shuttle the next morning, we noticed a group of Americans on a tour checking in. My husband and I felt so bad for them that they were staying at such a dump that was so far outside of the city.

We paid for the week long WiFi which was 45 EUR.....what a rip, but it worked fine and we never had any connection issues. Housekeeping was great, and we always returned to a clean room. My biggest beef with the hotel (and it might seem petty) was that there were no vending machines anywhere. If you wanted a drink (even bottled water ) you had to order it at the bar or through room service and it was 4.10 EUR per bottle. Also, there is no place within walking distance of the hotel to get any type of drinks or snacks. The hotel's food was mediocre at best and extremely overpriced. There is only one restaurant within walking distance, and it wasn't much better. While it is true that this hotel is NOT near the center of Rome, it is very, very easy (and inexpensive) to take public transportation to pretty much anywhere you want to go. The Magliana train station is an easy 5 minute walk from the hotel where you can take the train into town. Don't bother with a taxi because it can sometimes take longer due to traffic. A taxi will cost about 25-30 EUR from the hotel to Piazza Novona, where a 7 day CIS ticket is 16 EUR and is good on the trains, buses, trams, and metro.

By the time we noticed, our children were asleep and we didn't want to risk waking them, so we had to wait until the next day to do anything about it.

The staff were not very helpful - for example, when we asked about public transport tickets and whether we could use ours, they didn't know the answer. The location is dreadful - it really is miles away from Rome. Worse, though, are the instructions on their website - they tell you to take the Metro line B to a particular station and then catch the bus from there.

There is a different station close to the hotel, but it can be hard to find your way to the station as you have to walk through scrub to get there.

Plus, the shuttles run only at appointed times, so if you are late getting in, you will be forced to take an expensive cab. The hotel is fairly expensive and is in desperate need of updating, deep cleaning, and repair. The rugs are stained and threadbare, the pillows were flat and smelly, and the rooms were just plain depressing. Also, there was not a drop of coffee to be found anywhere in the hotel in the morning. For 150 Euro, even a crummy coffee maker in the room isn't too much to ask.", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad, Not Great\u201d", "Author": "Counterweight", "ReviewID": "UR34210838", "Content": "The best word to describe the Holiday Inn - Eur Parco dei Medici is \"acceptable\".

There is a free shuttle to take you downtown, but it does not run as frequently or as often as several other hotels that are also outside of downtown. If you are looking for a hotel from which you can experience a vacation in Rome, I would recommend looking for a place downtown or closer to downtown. If you are considering this hotel for a business trip, there are other hotels in the area that I would prefer (Sheraton Roma immediately comes to mind), but you could do worse than the Holiday Inn - Medici. If you are traveling with a family and are looking to relax at the hotel, the pool would make this hotel a good option.

Four of us including two kids who are 8 and 10 years old stayed in a family room. The room is quite big and clean. The room was cleaned everyday and towels were changed daily. There was one problem with the room, this was a interconnected room before and now it has been made as separate room by closing the door between rooms. They haven't done a good job of it. So, you can clearly hear the guests talking in the next room. Luckily, other room was empty most of the time during our stay. The food in the hotel is very expensive and the choice is limited. The hotel says kids eat free from the kids' menu if adults eat at the hotel. This is not true, an adult has to eat a three course meal (costs about \u20ac 50) to get a kid's meal (costs about \u20ac 7) free. If you are a single parent and you have two kids then you have to eat two three course meals to kids to eat free. I did not know this when I was booking the hotel. Be careful when you are booking. One day we ordered burgers for kids and me (wife is a vegetarian). They brought exacly the same size three burgers for us and charged \u20ac 14 for mine and \u20ac 7 each for kids. The hotel is no where near the town hence no shops or restaurents near it. There is a Pizza restaurent near by but unfortunately the pizzaman was on holiday during that week. In Italy, under 10 years old kids travels free on buses, trains and Metro. But one of the girls who woring in the hotel gift shop didn't know this and asked us to buy tickets for kids as well. By the way, the hotel gift shop is the only place in the area that you can buy travel passes. One thing I noticed that the people work in this shop are not freindly. If you want to visit Rome, then buy a one day Metro bus pass (just like one day travel card but you don't have to wait until 9.30 am). It costs \u20ac 4 and you can travel around Rome all day until midnight. The kids loved the swimming pool and there was a life guard all the time. Also, you get free towels at the swimming pool. Also, there is one table tennis table in the hotel (near the swimming pool) and we all enjoyed playing table tennis. The breakfast provided by the hotel is execellent, even you can have full English breakfast.

There was an outdoor pool that was closed in March and a Gym which had a few running machines and a multi gym. I have seen much worse hotel gyms and much better, but it was ok . I booked on the hotels own website and bought breakfast in advance which works out much cheaper than buying breakfast at the hotel. I found a good enough range of food at breakfast, only the really picky eaters would find any fault there. On the reception in the evenings was an english receptionist which was helpful, but the other local staff knew good english. The hotel has free transport to and from the local airport ( 4 trips each way each day), we landed at a bad time and had to get a train. That was painless and the hotel was quite close by ( we walked it in 10 minutes slowly). There was also about 6 or 7 trips each way into the center of Rome each day. The last bus leaves Rome at 8PM, the trip is about 30 minutes so I would not liked to have seen the cost of a taxi had I missed it. Some evenings I was wondering if everyone was going to get on the last bus ( first come first served) and there were only 35 seats and no standing allowed. My advice is get there early for the bus. One other thing about Rome if you are going to get a hop on hop off bus MAKE SURE you get the 110 bus, It seemed to come every 10 or 15 minutes. The one we got had 2 routes, one route was one bus an hour and the other was one bus every 2 hours. We made a big mistake. If I went to Rome again I would stay in the town near the main train station, it was the sort of area that you would not go out after midnight, but it had loads of hussle and bussle and loads of good cheap places to eat. This hotel is great but we were board at night with nothing happening outside, no TV to watch and sky high internet prices.

I shouldn't have to hear the guests on both sides of us going to the bathroom, and every detail of their conversations. There was no ice machine anywhere that I could find in the hotel. As typical with most European hotels there were no refreshment machines (soda, snacks, candy or in-room coffee/tea), and no refreshments we could buy in the gift shop. The beds were hard as concrete. We might as well have slept outside on the sidewalk, it would have been softer. They offer a choice of softer pillows, but don't expect to actually get them from the staff...we never did despite repeated requests. There is only one restaurant and the food and drinks were always room temperature (didn't seem very safe to eat). The one hamburger I tried tasted like salmon (cooked on the same grill as the fish, perhaps?). As typical in Italy, the heating/air conditioning system is controlled by the hotel. If it's mid-season, you don't get a choice of warm or cool air...the hotel decides for you. There is no fan in the room to circulate the air or drown out the noise from the neighbors.

We arrived with a HERTZ rented car, which we were supposed to return at the terminal in Rome, the next morning. When we checked in, the hotel staff kindly suggested us to take the complimentary hotel shuttle to the terminal the next morning, while they would call HERTZ-airport office to collect the car the same day, with only a minimal extra charge. The granted us that this was a common service that they often offered to customers. Being on a tight schedule, we happily accepted it. We left the HERTZ car in their parking lot, leaving them the keys and a copy of the rental contract. Two days after, we were already in the US, and received a phone call from a worried HERTZ staff in Italy, telling us that the car we rented was lost and that they were going to charge us the cost of the whole car! I immediately called the Holiday Inn in Rome and they confirmed that they had forgotten to call HERZ to collect the car and the car was still in their parking lot!?! However, the hotel manager, had personally called HERTZ that morning to ask them to collect the car. 3 days had passed! The extra days would be charged on my credit card, but the hotel staff insisted that everything was ok and kept feeding me lies. When I asked to talk to the hotel manager - who had handled the procedure - they told me that he had just left for an overseas vacation and that he would be out of reach for a month!?! So I had to call back HERTZ in Italy (again long distance from the US, to Italy using my cell phone!) to inform them that the car was still at the hotel, but some HERTZ staff in Rome was going to collect it. The next day, (4th day!), I called HERTZ again to double check that the car had been returned. However, it was not over, since the hotel staff had not called HERTZ airport office - as they were supposed to- but a downtown Rome office instead!?! Therefore, for a while the car had been lost again, since HERTZ did not know where it was. In the end, the HERTZ staff had to call the Holiday Inn again to find out which HERTZ agency in Rome had the car! At the end of the day, I ended up paying about EUR 400,00, instead of EUR 100,00 that I was expected to pay for one day rental!

We have 3 young children who also enjoyed the hotel and they were made to feel most welcome. The room was spacious and very comfortable which for a family of 5 is some achievement. I am confused and perplexed at several other reviews that say the hotel food and drinks are expensive. These comments are most unfair and I cannot understand where they coming from but I suspect being visitors from the United States they may not have visited many other European hotels in major European cities before and so are unaware of the prices in similar hotels. For sure the prices in this hotel are more expensive than one would expect to pay outside but to claim they are very expensive is just not true when one compares this hotel with others in other big European cities, that is fact! The reality is, having stayed at many other similar quality hotels in other European cities, that this hotel compares very favourably with others and the prices are actually cheaper than I would have expected and certainly cheaper than most other hotels of the same class in London and Paris for example. I notoice people have also made comments that the hotel is not close to the centre of Rome. Well why was that a surprise to them? The hotel clearly states its location as 16 km out of Rome centre and it has never suggested it was close to the centre, We arrived fully aware of this so again I do not understand why others are moaning about this as its location is clearly stated. The benefits of this location are that after a day in Rome it is great, especially for famiilies with young children, to return to this hotel out of the city centre and enjoy its fabulous swimming pool that is open until 8pm. The kids loved it. It also close to Fiumicino airport. There is also a daily free shuttle bus to and from the centre of Rome which we took advantage off . It leaves at several times during the day and works excellently. The only slight negative point about this is that it can only accomodate 32 people so its first come first served. Maybe the hotel should invest in a larger coach to handle more people to reduce the risk of guests having to make their own way back to to the hotel if they were not able to get a seat. The restaurant is very good with some of the most polite, friendly and welcoming service my family and I have ever received! Again from my experience I do not see what there is to moan about this restaurant. Yes the prices could be a bit cheaper but again they compare very favourably with other similar quality hotels in other European cities. Yes the menu could be a bit more extensive but the food is good and the service fantastic, the staff are all, based on our experience, very friendly, warm, attentive and welcoming. There is a pizzeria close by, Verde Smeralda which disappointingly is closed Sunday's. You go out the main gate of the hotel onto tha main road, turn right then immediately right abd ts 100 yards on your left. About a 4 minute walk in total. I never tried it but was told it is reasonable with slightly cheaper prices than the hotel Some have said its tough to locate but I found it a relatively easy hotel to find. After all the directions given by the hotel are accurate! We drove up from the Southern Italy and followed the directions given on the Hotel's web site. It was not too difficult to find, just of junction 30 of Romes G. R. A. (ring road motorway). Thats what the directions said and that surprisingly is where it was! If you want a city centre hotel then book one in the city centre. If you want a hotel to retire to away from the city centre close to the airport after a long day site seeing then this hotel is great as you can relax by the large pool and avail yourself of all its other services. Being 10 minutes away from Fiumicino airport it was ideal for our return flight home to London.

My daughter was in the bathroom and my sons were on the bed. I was in the area by the door changing my clothes when a knock came at the door delivering the pillow and iron. However, the housekeeping did not just knock, they used their own key and promply opened my hotel room door with me standing there mostly nude.

While we were waiting for our shuttle to depart, My younger son started screaming that someone was taken one of our bags and was walking away with it. We had a distintive large purple bow tied to our bags and he was pointing to a man who was walking quickly to a car that had just pulled up. He threw our bag into the car and they drove away. I jumped off the bus and the shuttle driver was coming out of the hotel assisting another passenger with his bags. He was now placing bags in the underside of the shuttle. I asked him to open the back compartment where we had placed our bags. With the language barrior he told me it was full. I said,\" I just want to check to see if all our bags are still there\", He complied and sure enough, only two of our three bags were there. Apparently, since we were the last to fill the back compartment, our bags were on top. When the driver walked away, there were lots of business people around. The thief just opened the trunk grabbed the first bag on top and took off. When my son was yelling, several people on the bus got a good look at the thief but no license plate number. He had his own driver so they were gone quickly. Our bag contained all my sons' clothes, a portable DVD player, Movies, power cords for movie camera, unreplaceable video footage.

It is a professionally-run affiliate of the Holiday Inn franchise and looks no different from any other Holiday Inn you've ever stayed at in the U.S. (U.S. citizens, if you're travel-weary, this can an advantage.) It is located in an upscale office-park complex that rolls up the sidewalks after 6 p.m., so there are no restaurants, shops or nightlife nearby. When you get in from your busy day, expect to just eat in the hotel restaurant (which is good), watch cable TV and go to bed. The staff is competent, friendly and they all speak English. The hotel has a shuttle bus, but inquire about its schedule as it is not a 24-hour service. Three blocks from the hotel is a train station (Muratella). Though short, don't try this walk loaded down with large bags as there are stairs. This train is mainly good if you want to tour Rome on foot for a few days before or after your flight. This train line is NOT the main airport train, which is called the Leonardo da Vinci line and runs from the central Termini station to the airport, but rather a parallel local line that runs from the Ostiense station in central Rome to Da Vinci airport. At Ostiense station, you walk a few blocks more to pick up the Metro subway system. You would not want to use the Muratella station after dark, as it is small and empty at night and frequented by the local gypsy population, who use it to commute to their begging jobs in central Rome. Generally speaking, we found this hotel comfortable and convenient.", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London UK", "Title": "\u201cIn the middle of nowhere\u201d", "Author": "melancton", "ReviewID": "UR5627254", "Content": "Spent three weeks here on business trip. The sole positive I can think of about the hotel is that it had a modern gym area and sauna, and arguably it offers an infrequent, but free bus into town. Negatives: 1. Its in the middle of a business park, with only a small pizzeria in walking distance. 2. It's food is overpriced, as is the mini bar, and uninspiring - the breakfast is identical every day. 3. The area it is in resembles slough/ bracknell on a good day, and so there are no views worth talking about. 4. Your also on the main railway line between Rome and the airport - making you a target for sneak thieves especially in the Travatore/ pyramid part. 5. Rooms are large, but are essentially out of date in terms of decor. 6. In terms of entertainment, the sat tv is limited, the pay tv is expensive so you'll have to go into Rome - which if you want to stay to a reaonable hour, means a train/ underground back.", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis", "Title": "\u201cNo problems\u201d", "Author": "SMcBaker", "ReviewID": "UR5597489", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights. No issues. Our rate came with 2 breakfasts, otherwise hotel breakfast, which was only buffet because the restaurant was closed for maintenance, would have been a little pricey. It was good, though. The room was nice, very clean and modern. And it was thoroughly air conditioned, something not always found in Italy!! Nice pool. It was far from the tourist areas of the city, but I knew this at the onset....but the low cost (comparatively) is why I chose this hotel. There is a pizzeria nearby, they serve pasta and other dishes as well. Decent food and fair prices. The bus to and from the city was great....avoiding the hassle of driving and parking made the ride (about 30 mins) worth it!! Do get there early if you want to take the first bus of the morning...it did fill up. And on the return, they WILL leave early if the bus is full...the driver did warn us about that. It is a brand new, air conditioned bus that accomodates about 32 or so people. Not a lot of local flavor here but very clean and good value.", "Date": "August 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cCaution. This hotel is not recommended\u201d", "Author": "stay124", "ReviewID": "UR5500300", "Content": "I've been travelling internationally 20+ days per month for the past 4 years, so I'm no stranger to staying in hotels, including but not limited to Intercontinental hotels around the world. :-) My stay at this Holiday Inn ranks definitely in the top 3 worst hotel stays ever!! The property itself is fine and clean. The pool is very pretty. However, everything else about the hotel is deplorable...staff and service included. Concurring with what many reviewers have already said, here are a few key things to be aware of if you're considering this hotel. 1. It is located in a business park in the middle of NOWHERE, in anytown, anycity. There is NOTHING (except one pizzeria) within walking distance of the hotel. ie. no cafe, no deli, no convenience store...na dah! The closest store is 2 train stations away. Bottles of water cost just under 4 euros at the hotel. 2. The hotel's free shuttle bus does indeed have a published schedule that goes back and forth to centro Rome every four hours or so. Be careful though. The bus may depart before its scheduled time...as I learned the hard way! And if you run into trouble, don't expect the front desk staff or management to be at all sympathetic. Guests are like annoying mosquitoes to them. Staff seem to be more concerned about adhering to stringent hotel rules and internal policies than they are about satisfying their guests. 3. Since you'll be stranded at the hotel it would be nice if the food was tasty. No such luck! Food at the hotel is bland, luke warm and very expensive. Food service is no better. I ate dinner at the hotel one night (because there is nowhere else to eat nearby). There were approx. 7 wait staff serving about 4 tables. After having to ask for a menu and then waiting 20 minutes, I ended up walking over to the huddled wait staff to ask them to please take my order. Coffee is thick and cold. A plain chef's salad with stale bread costs about 12.5 euros. If you're hungry between 15:00 and 19:30, don't expect to be able to order food from the hotel. The kitchen is closed during those hours...even room service. 4. One final note about room service. A charge of 7,8 euros per person will be added to the bill. Bottom line: In my opinion this is a hotel for business guests who are in Rome to work 12+ hours per day and need a clean place to sleep and drink cold coffee. This is not a tourist hotel and should not be advertised as such.
