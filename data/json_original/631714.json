I made the reservation online without really understanding where this hotel was located...but as it turns out, it could not have been better situated for us. It is a half-block from a major metro station (Berri-UQAM) that offers 2 routes/ lines, so you are really accessible to most of the city from that spot. Additionally, the area is very walkable, even at night. Yes, there are many clubs and so forth that operate late at night but the crowd seems pretty harmless. We are in our 40s so the club scene is over for my husband and I but the noise didn't really bother us too much. (We stayed on a Saturday night.) I was able to sleep very well, despite having a room overlooking the main street. The room (3rd floor) was smartly decorated...very urban feel, very clean and had all the necessary amenities including free wi-fi and a cappuccino machine. There was a computer and printer outside my room which made it easy to check in for our flight. We were pleasantly surprised by the free breakfast offered on Sunday morning at the restaurant downstairs. More than ample and very good. My somewhat particular husband raved about how skillfully his potatoes were cooked. They also served fresh-squeezed orange juice (imagine, fresh-squeezed in winter in Montreal.) The gentleman working the desk was extremely helpful...he gave us a map and plotted all the places we told him we wanted to visit. He also arranged for a cab for us the next afternoon. Really, this was a gem of a place to stay and we will definitely make this our \"go to\" hotel in Montreal.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa", "Title": "\u201cLives up to reviews\u201d", "Author": "kaece", "ReviewID": "UR125280392", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights based solely on the reviews here at Tripadvisor. Really not much else to add that hasn't been covered! We took the metro from the train station and were very happy with how close it was to the stop- 1/2 a block. The neighbourhood is very lively- not \"touristy\"- and we were greeted by some panhandlers as soon as we emerged from the station. They were harmless but definitely a fixture of that corner. We wanted a quick getaway where we could be in the middle of things, and people watch- this is definitely a great neighbourhood for that! Even mid-week in February, many students and locals about. We were greeted by a young man that followed us up to the lobby- we were early but he held our bags for us and was very welcoming. He promptly gave us a map and showed us several sites of interest and assured us we could walk to different destinations. Very helpful. When we returned he brought our luggage upstairs for us. The room is probably the cleanest we have ever stayed in- and the cleaning ladies obviously take pride and treat the room and guests like it is their home. Nice little touches. We stayed in a room at the back- SO quiet! We were amazed that despite its location and small size it is completely quiet. Unlike other hotels where you hear doors opening and closing, other guest traffic, etc... completely peaceful. After days and nights of walking around it was very nice to escape to a quiet little corner of the world! Amazing pillows- all 6 of them! Everything is within walking distance- Old Montreal, food, shopping, Ste Catherine street. We did meet Albert and he really is genuine and charming- eager to welcome you and answer any question. We had breakfast at the Brioche downstairs- after reading the reviews we were excited for it the first day. The waitress gave us menus but then quickly told us that the hot breakfasts were not available during the week- only weekends. We were quite disappointed, but enjoyed the pastry and bread. The next day we were going to find another breakfast spot where we could have a big breakfast- but decided at the last minute to go downstairs for coffee and the newspaper first. A different waitress gave us the menu and assured us that the eggs and omelettes were available- and were included with our complimentary breakfast! Also nice to grab a dessert in the evening. The girls were happy to package it up for us to take up to the hotel. All in all a wonderful little gem in a vibrant neighbourhood- and with the deal found on tripadvisor a STEAL.

In addition my husband's room key never worked and 4 times we went to the front desk to have it fixed and 4 times there was NO ONE at the desk - if you need any recommendations or help you won't find anyone there. We booked the hotel because it was number 2 in Trip Advisor - we were severely let down.

We just spend the weekend in this lovely hotel and enjoyed every minute. In the end of our stay I actually felt sorry, we didn\u00c2\u00b4t had more time to spend not only in amazing Montr\u00c3\u00a9al but also here at the hotel. Le Relais Lyonnais is located in an old 4-storey building in one of the nicest blocks of Rue St. Denis in Latin Quarter. The block is packed with French style caf\u00c3\u00a9s, couple of bars, a mirco-brewery and variety of restaurants (Vietnamese, Indian, tapas, sushi, lunch, fast food, 24/7 McD...anything!). Two cinemas (Cineplex & Cinerobotheque) and Theatre St. Denis are opposite the hotel and bus station and a huge library just around the corner. The area is very grounded especially in weekend evenings. We arrived by car, but unfortunately couldn\u00c2\u00b4t get to the parking area the hotel offers for it\u00c2\u00b4s guests, cause most of the roads were closed because of the annual, big biking event. So we parked in a parking hall next to bus station (entrance on Rue St. Hubert), just behind the hotel. The weekend rate was amazingly affordable, 9CAD / 24h. If you arrive here by metro or use the public transportation during your stay, Station Berri-UQAM is almost next to the hotel. On the ground floor of the hotel building, there\u00c2\u00b4s this fabulous caf\u00c3\u00a9 La Brioche Lyonnais where you get the breakfast vouchers. From the street next to the caf\u00c3\u00a9 you climb small stairs to the second floor of the building to the reception. During our visit we met three staff members, and they were all very polite and friendly, one particularly talkative, I think he was the owner. Reception is open 9am-midnight, so keep this in mind if you arrive late in the evening. Rooms are located in all three floors, lower ones next to the reception. There\u00c2\u00b4s no lift, of course cause the building is really old and there\u00c2\u00b4s not that much extra space. We were lucky to get upgraded to a suite in third floor and the room was absolutely beautiful. Totally renovated, wooden floors, decorated with very good taste and at least the suite was spacious. There was a sitting area with sofa, terrace with chairs, big fridge, safe, coffee machine, flatscreen tv...Everything for great stay and even more. I agree with the other reviews that the rooms on street side might be a bit noisy, cause there\u00c2\u00b4s so much people on the street especially on weekend evenings. But I think you can\u00c2\u00b4t blame the hotel for that, the neighbourhood is just so lively and the hotel has this great location in the middle of all that! We had the room from the back side, and it was totally quiet. No noise from outside or from other rooms either. So if you hesitate the noise, ask room from behind. A word about the breakfast also. With the breakfast voucher for the caf\u00c3\u00a9 downstairs you\u00c2\u00b4ll get a plate with an omelette of your choice, pile of fried potatoes and some slices of fruits, toasted baguette, orange juice and coffee or tea. You can\u00c2\u00b4t compare it with a huge breakfast buffee, but don\u00c2\u00b4t let that bother. It\u00c2\u00b4s a fantastic French style caf\u00c3\u00a9 breakfast and I loved it. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 is open till late in the evening and they have also huge variaty of all kind of delicious delicacies on the menu worth to taste. Only tiny downsides during our stay was that when we came to our room on friday night there was some local teens sitting in our terrace (it is possible to get there from the street behind the hotel) and on the next morning at 8am the fire alarm went on by itself in our room. But this all was nothing compared to all the great things this hotel can offer! I highly recommend this hotel to everyone who prefers small boutique hotels and enjoy lively, bohemian neighbourhoods!", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, good location, great breakfast\u201d", "Author": "bps_traveler", "ReviewID": "UR108958709", "Content": "We stayed at the Lyonnais in early April.

It is in the Latin Quarter in the middle of Old Montreal, Downtown, Plateau and Mile End so if the weather is good and you don't mind walking you can get to all these places with ease, there is a metro station right outside the hotel for trains if you don't want to walk. The place itself is a smaller boutique style hotel with only 7 or so rooms. Albert who is the owner is a friendly accommodating man who is always smiling which is great, and he upgraded us to a suite on the top floor. The rooms are very spacious with all the mod cons one needs when traveling, including a nespresso machine and pods replenished daily. Unfortunately after the 1st night of a 3 night stay, after our room had been cleaned we noticed that our ipod was missing. We travel a lot and normally keep everything in the safe but we managed to leave the ipod on a table at the base of the bed before leaving the room to explore Montreal. We went straight downstairs to let reception know of the theft and the man told us he would let Albert know and he would get back to us. The following morning when we went downstairs for breakfast, Albert told me he heard what had happened, but no one in the hotel would have stolen the ipod and this has never happened before. He told us that his staff had been there for years and wouldn't know what to do with an ipod. I didn't know what to say... My wife and i started to doubt ourselves and later that day went and unpacked all our belongings and re-packed, we turned the room inside out but came up with nothing.... we found it extremely odd that a brand new $350 ipod could just go \"pff\" and be vanished for good. Upon check out i didn't want to make any accusations and wanted to see if Albert said anything to us, he did not mention it at all. I then went back to our car which was in a car park down the road and rifled through it hoping that maybe it was there and i had forgotten, but no. We then drove to Quebec City minus our music in the car and upon checking in to our new hotel i emailed Albert explaining that we were still without the ipod and that maybe we could claim it on our insurance, but Albert has not replied and it has been awhile now since i wrote the email. We are quite disappointed with the way in which this incident was handled by Albert, even though his staff have worked at the hotel for years and he has had no problem's, a fellow guest might have stuck their head in the door whilst the room was being cleaned and taken the ipod. All we know is that it was in the room when we left and gone when we returned - quite simple really. I own my own successful business (also in hospitality) in Australia, and i would have treated this situation a lot differently to the way Le Relais Lyonnais treated us with this incident. Very bad form for a hotel that we picked using Tripadvisor for it's wonderful reviews.

From the moment I arrived for the weekend, I sensed the owners were clearly at the helm here. The staff was polite and eager to anticipate my needs. They were knowledgeable (and very patient )when I consulted them for tips and suggestions on Montreal. Unfortunately, there was a glitch in my reservation(my fault), and they were unable to accommodate me the entire stay. But they eagerly took it upon themselves to book me at a comparable property at the same rate I was paying at the Relais(which was somewhat lower). At checkout time, Mr. Cohen insisted they would gladly give me a ride over there. BLEW MY MIND!! more than true professionals . Also noteworthy, the cafe they own downstairs , where complimentary breakfast is served- boasts the very BEST croissants, coffee and baked goods in general outside of FRANCE. Bravo to the owners!

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary with a week in Montreal, and chose Le Relais after reading about it on TripAdvisor.com - I always choose our hotels this way. We would certainly stay at Le Relais again; we had a great stay and were very happy. We had one of the third floor suites and it was very nicely decorated and absolutely spotless. Bathroom was wonderful - large shower, all new ultra-modern fixtures including hair dryer and electric wall heater, a ceiling fan that actually worked, and wonderful soft towels. Bath sheets and robes provided. There was a safe in the room (always a great place for passports and cash), as well as a small refrigerator which was stocked daily with 2 bottles of water (no charge) and cream/milk for the coffee. The coffee/espresso maker worked well. The bed was quite comfortable (queen size), and the temperature control unit (fan/air conditioner) is remote control. There was a small balcony with two chairs and a small table, which would have been great if the weather had been better. The sitting room had very modern furniture, new and not worn out like most hotels. Floors were beautiful hardwood, with area rugs in both rooms. All very clean. The entire suite was very well maintained and cared for. I am extremely fussy, and I was impressed! We had breakfast provided daiily during our stay - there is a little restaurant under the hotel, owned by the hotel - and it is wonderful. Breakfast is anything you want on the breakfast menu - omelettes, crepes, eggs, wonderful pastries, juice, coffee, etc. It was superb - both food and service. Delicious, efficient, and plentiful. It is reason enough to choose Le Relais! Breakfast with the room is not mentioned on the web-site - make sure you ask when you reserve! The location was great for us. We had chosen to use public transportation instead of renting a vehicle - a first for us when on vacation. We have no regrets. There is a Metro station less than a block away, and it is a major hub - it was exceedingly easy to use the Metro and buses. St. Denis is a very busy city street - literally dozens of shops and restaurants, clubs, coffee shops, etc. People everywhere all hours! Our suite was on the front of the building - if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs or request a suite on the back of the building. The noise was not a problem for us. I think the hotel has limited parking, so check when you book. Otherwise, street parking is very limited and busy. Tons of shopping within walking distance. No hotel is perfect - so here are a couple of things worthy of note: 1. Le Relais advertises free wi-fi in all rooms. The internet service was \"spotty\" at best. At times, it was okay - but more often than not, we could not even connect (we have two brand new laptops, with good wireless cards). I did call the front desk, and spoke to Albert - but there were no suggestions. They also have a \"Business Center\" on the third floor - it is a desk with computer with internet access, complete with printer and paper supplied - however this computer has extremely limited internet access as well. So - if internet access is imperative, this is not the place to stay. There is a coffee shop a couple of doors down with free wi-fi, and the service there is excellent -as is the coffee! 2. There is rarely anyone at the front desk - in fact, over the course of a 7 day stay, we saw Albert once! This is not a problem, however there are times when it would be helpful to ask questions or seek advice regarding directions, etc. I found this frustrating at times. 3. If you are on the second or third floor, it is important to note that the stairs are relatively steep and long. Good handrails, but it is a beautiful old character building. If you have issues with stairs, you might want to request a room on the first floor. It is a LONG hike to the third floor suites! These three items are simply things that should be considered when choosing accommodation, as everyone's needs are different.

We did not know it was the Just for Laughs festival and, when our taxi cab pulled up, we were surprised to find out the street in front of the hotel was blocked off and a lively street party was just getting started. We were initially nervous because it was so loud down on the street and we were assigned a suite on the third floor which was facing the street. We are fairly quiet people who tend to go to bed on the early side but we thought \"we'll find out soon enough\" and got settled in our room. The room was super clean and welcoming. The decor was appealing and it had plenty of space with a sitting room, large bathroom, very comfortable bed and shutters on the windows/door. The shower was to die for with great water pressure and duel shower heads. There was an espresso machine and refrigerator in the room. I thought the A/C was very easy to use and we were able to set the temperature to exactly what made us comfortable. We had a small balcony where we could watch the parade from the comfort of our prime viewing spot. You could tell the hotel put a lot of thought into their sound proofing of the room. It was extremely loud while you were on the street or even sitting on the balcony but once the doors were closed the noise was quite muffled. Also, we were amazed that the street cleared out and was unbelievably quiet no later than midnight. It seemed so civilized for such bedlam up until the silence! What we particular liked was the privacy. Albert was very helpful and available if you needed him but no one intruded on us and it felt like at times we had the hotel to ourselves (even though I do believe the hotel was full on the weekend we stayed). It was very quiet in the hotel itself and we did not hear our neighbors. We also liked the free and substantial breakfast served downstairs each morning. Finally, there was a computer and printer in the common area on the third floor which made printing out our airline tickets a snap. The only con would be for individuals with mobility issues. The hotel has three floors with a narrow staircase and no elevator.

As far as service goes - the innkeeper, Albert and his assistants are always cheerfully at your beck & call. Public amenities include a business center and one of the best French cafes outside of France. Private in room amenities include Nespresso machines with as many cups as you can drink, private fridge stocked with water, satellite flat panel tv, rain showerhead, and down pillows and duvet.

Dark hardwood floors with beautiful shutters, comfortable linens, and lots of extra towels. It was really like staying at someone's house but having total privacy. You can purchase coupons for breakfast in La Brioche at a bargain compared to the menu prices. The food is amazing - very fresh, no buffet food, ample portions, outdoor seating. We ended up eating dinner there as well as it was so good. The location was great - right on the lower end of St Denis, 2 blocks from UQAM metro stop. There's a very posh IGA and Pharmaprix around the corner for snacks and blister bandages. The hotel is right over the restaurant and on a busy street but the windows are super glazed or something.

The host was welcoming and charming, The hotel is set right on the street in the middle of an extremely busy area surrounded by Jazz clubs and restaurants and theatre. If you are in a room rather than a suite, accommodation is at the front of the establishment and the noise continues until 2 or 3 in the morning. If this does not worry you then go for it. But if you need some sleep it may not suit. Suites at the rear may be better but we were not able to try one. So my negative recommendation is based on the fact that for three nights I got about 8 house sleep total over three nights. Not the best way to appreciate a city.

I have to thank TripAdvisor for this great find (I certainly would not have found it on my own). There is a reason this place is consistently rated as one of the top (if not the top hotel) in Montreal. That reason is simply Albert. My husband and I like planning weekend getaways. Within driving distance of our home, we have a large selection of modern, luxurious hotels but the differentiating factor really comes down to service. Albert runs the hotel and greets you with the warmest welcome. It felt like we were visiting a relative that was happy to see us. Albert really goes out of his way to make your stay special. He really understands how to be friendly and helpful without being obtrusive. Le Relais Lyonnais only has seven rooms but the size is part of the charm. We had a quiet and peaceful stay. Our room was modern without feeling cold. The shining hardwood floors, the luxurious bedding, the flat screen TV, California shutters and fantastic shower were all within the comfortable yet contemporary tone of this boutique hotel. We loved La Brioche Lyonnaise downstairs. We enjoyed two superb breakfasts and late night pastries on the patios of this charming restaurant. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 au lait was fantastic. The hotel is located in the Quartier Latin. Conservative suburbanites will definitely experience a different vibe while staying in this lively and colourful urban neighbourhood.

The room overlooks St. Denis directly in front of a movie theater. It is beautifully decorated with contemporary appointments, including but not limited to modern fixtures, a flat screen LCD, a very hip espresso maker, and a shower the likes of which you'll seldom see elsewhere. There is a balcony, but it's inaccessible without serious effort and perhaps not intended for use. We booked our stay to include breakfast - take note that this was no ordinary breakfast in the \"continental\" mode but one served in the restaurant just below the hotel. It happens to also bear the similarities of the hotel's name, and owned/operated by the same proprietors. The restaurant is excellent for any meal, and breakfast is no exception. Wonderful eggs and crepes, amazing juices, fresh fruit and yes, amazing pastries. The portions are fair and the service excellent. This added benefit proved a truly a fantastic place to start your day. Contributing mainly to the appeal of this hotel is Albert, the owner. He is an incredible bilingual help in terms of recommendations, general advice and overall assistance. He *made* our trip to Montreal. My wife had a minor medical issue for which he helped facilitate a doctor's house call. He is charming morning and night, and treats his guests like family members staying at his own home. No reasonable request will be denied, and he is won't nickel and dime you for incidental benefits, like complimentary bottled water, Internet access, etc. The evening attendant is also a very nice man (Stephan) and helpful in English or French. As for my personal view on how to make your potential stay more enjoyable: 1) Don't hesitate to engage Albert for any of your traveling needs. He is a lovely person and won't steer you wrong for restaurants, site seeing, or passing time. If possible, refrain from dealing with Albert's partner Jose - he isn't exactly polished in quite the way Albert is - they clearly did not attend the same client-relation classes. My belief is that Jose is more on the restaurant-business side of things, better suited and accustomed to dealing with croissant inventory than he is for example procuring a foam mattress for bed-sensitive-sleepers. 2) If you are the least bit distracted by downtown street noise, stay away from any of the rooms that face St. Denis. Keep in mind, there is a price to pay for staying on such a vibrant street which includes homeless beggars that can annoy you bilingually! 3) Arrive earlier than say, night fall. This will ensure that a) you have Albert receive you, and b) you actually find the hotel. The hotel door is alway locked. When you buzz-in, you're actually buzzing the restaurant downstairs for someone to come up. This may seem strange at first, but it's no big deal and good for security. Once you check-in, your room key will also serve as the hotel door key. This is a small hotel - it is a building that was converted, so it is small. The lobby won't 'shock and awe' you so don't feel weird when you arrive - your room will more than make-up for it! In conclusion, the best aspects of the hotel: The room, the shower - did I mention that already? I did. I'll mention it again!... Albert and the breakfasts! The only \"gotchas\" I would warn about are a) street noise, but then again, you wanna stay in the middle of things, then you already know that; and b) the couch in the over-sized rooms that convert into beds are of the bare-minimum variety in terms of comfort. If there are 3 of you to a room, make sure the 3rd wheel sleeps easy. On a side note, my mother was the 3rd wheel in our case and had a terrible night's sleep on the very thin couch mattress - Albert stepped in immediately and gave her a complimentary room of her own because of a booking opening for one of the nights. Just another example of Albert's action-oriented customer service philosophy.", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "RAVK", "ReviewID": "UR16431368", "Content": "I discovered this hotel through the raves on Tripadvisor.com and can attest it deserves the stellar rating.

The room itself was very stylish with a very comfortable queen bed, fridge, very ample closet space, a decent sized flat screen TV and a bathroom my wife would like to duplicate in our next home. Both of us enjoyed the large shower with its rainforest showerhead and the scented towels. We also enjoyed looking out the large bay window to see the activity on the street. The only negative I can think of is that the room was a bit on the small side. Nevertheless, it was a fine room and we would go back to the Relais on our next visit to Montreal.", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sandrie", "ReviewID": "UR8656655", "Content": "We had quickly decided to just pick up and go to Montreal for a few days and were recommended to stay at the Le Relais Lyonnais. A friend of ours had stayed there in July and had nothing but excellent things to say about it. And he was right! Albert, the owner, is so gracious, humble and hospitable. He made our stay even more enjoyable. The hotel is so quaint and beautiful...just what we wanted - something small and intimate but in the middle of everything. The location was great - we were able to walk everywhere - beautiful Old Montreal is only a 10 minute walk away. And the Metro subway station is just around the corner from the hotel. The suite we stayed in was beautifully decorated - very simple, clean, modern lines. It also had a terrace which overlooked St. Denis (the Latin Quarter). I also couldn't get over just how clean the room was - I don't think I've ever been in such a clean hotel room (including the 5 star hotels we've stayed in). Every time we visit Montreal now, I will definitely stay at the Le Relais Lyonnais.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Vermont05", "ReviewID": "UR8255057", "Content": "We just returned from a wonderful stay at the Hotel Le Relais Lyonnais in Montreal. It's hard to even know where to start... The location couldn't be better- surrounded by fantastic restaurants, including the one in the hotel, and a 10 minute walk to beautiful Old Montreal. We went to Montreal for a one night getaway from our home in Vermont to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. We couldn't have imagined a more perfect stay- a huge bargain for the price! The owners were incredibly kind and attended to every detail. 10 minutes after we'd arrived, they knocked on our door with a plate of amazing homemade truffles. The room itself was incredible too. We stayed in a suite on the top floor. We were on the back of the building and didn't hear any sound from the street at all. The room was beautiful- very clean and modern, and extremely comfortable. We especially enjoyed the private deck. We wholeheartedly recommend the Hotel Le Relais Lyonnais- and we will certainly be back!!", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatineau, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEuropean charm in the heart of Montreal\u201d", "Author": "Lastnightislept", "ReviewID": "UR8093066", "Content": "This tiny nook of a hotel is a little hard to find if you aren't familarily with the streets of Montreal, but it is definitely worth the effort. Located in the trendy latin quarter of Montreal, the hotel does not have a large walk-up like you would find in larger hotels, and you may have difficulty finding parking in front of the hotel... but this is the price you pay for being in the centre of everything. The hotel is up the street from the University of Quebec (at Montreal) and is close to a metro station. There is a wide variety of restaurants literally steps away from the hotel (not taking into account that there is a very nice restaurant attached to the Relais Lyonnais). You are about 15 minutes walking distance from the old port of Montreal and about 20 minutes away from all of the shops of Ste Catherine Street. This hotel is a labour of love. The rooms are very tastefully decorated and the pictures on the website offer a tantalizing peek at what to expect. The bed are memory foam style mattresses and the duvets are thick and comfortable, not like the starchy polyester-like duvets that you are accustomed to in most hotels. The flatscreen television has access to Bell Expressvu, but given that you are in the heart of the latin quarter, you probably won't watch it much. We stayed in a suite, and the couch in the other room is actually a pull-out bed. Combined with the sliding doors, this is a viable second room. The bathroom was beautifully decorated, but there could have been a little more counter space. Although this was an issue for my girlfriend, the shower more than made up for this inconvenience. The hotel staff (namely Albert and Jos\u00c3\u00a9) are very friendly and made our stay very pleasant. I've seen some comments that they are not always at the desk, but you will be able to find someone in the restaurant downstairs to help you. All-in-all, it is a minor inconvenience, and the service they provide is excellent. The only point that I would raise is that St. Denis is a very popular street and there is a lot of street noise if you are staying in a suite. Having said this, the noise is no different than what you would expect from a hotel in the middle of a vibrant city and the location makes up for any inconvenience. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fun place to stay in Montreal.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Le Relais Lyonnais", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d631714-Reviews-Le_Relais_Lyonnais-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$196 - $294*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1595 rue St Denis</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H2X 2K3 </span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "631714", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/49/f8/49f839e9f82ab9d42f5c746c3e1949681large.jpg"}}
