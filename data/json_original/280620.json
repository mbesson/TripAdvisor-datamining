Zeil is a large shopping street which is referred to as the shopping mile. Hotel Zeil is on the opposite end of the street, away from the central square. Although it took us a while to find the place, it was in a quiet enough location, close enough to where everything was happening.The staff were friendly and efficient. I would not recommend venturing too far away from the shopping district, as the area appeaprs questionable.Breakfast was good and restaurant area was decorated nicely.The hotel is clean and sufficient for what we needed it for. If we were staying for longer than a couple of days I might go somewhere else. As stated in the title, it was a no-frills experience and did exactly what it said on the tin - a clean, nice, friendly place for a short stay.An Irish bar two doors down, provided great entertainment.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR421642753", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ZidaneZidane"}, {"Content": "good location and clean hotel it is very close to the shopping center and has a parking place at the back of the hotel . cleand rooms and good breakfast. good price. if your are looking a center hotel with good price i would recoment this place.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR948434956", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ariogul"}, {"Content": "excellent, recommended I stay there in a confort room and was so huge, comfortable and clean. Its perfectly located in the centre of the city (1 minute walking from the zeil shopping street) and you can go walking everywhere. The Konstablerwache U-Bahn station is 2 mins walking. If u came from the airport you have to take the S-8 or S-9 trains and stop at Konstablerwache station (17 mins).Finally i say that if i go again to frankfurt i'll go to this hotel, RECOMMENDED.", "Date": "Feb 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR719392012", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "javii"}, {"Content": "Cental and sufficient I stayed at the Hotel Zeil for one night. The room was clean and confortable and the breakfast was simple (bread, cheese, salami's, yoghurt and coffee) but quite OK. My only critisism was that the room did not have an AC. It was therefore quite hot in the room and the fan wasnt really all that helpful. Otherwise I was quite pleased.", "Date": "Jul 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR699880871", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "buzby22"}, {"Content": "Good 3 star Hotel in Good Location stayed in a first floor room immediately left of the elevator. The room itself was a very good sized single room, big enough for a baby cot against one wall with the single bed against the other. There was also a small wardrobe, coat hooks and a place for your suitcase. The room also has a desk and a mini-fridge which was a nice surprise. The hotel is in a good location at the very end of the Zeil, about 3 minutes from CA across the one of the main squares. There are a few parking spots (8 euros per night) behind the hotel.Breakfast was pretty good--eggs, fruit, sausage, 2 types of sliced meat and cheeses, bread, yoghurt, the usual. The restaurant is very nice and just updated but isn\u9e93t yet open for lunch or dinner. I was told it will be in about a month. All the hotel staff I talked to were Russian so maybe it\u9e93s run by a family. They were all very nice and helpful. About the only real downside was the definite road noise even though my room faced the back and not the main street. There weren\u9e93t many people in the hotel when I was but I suspect there may be some noise between rooms also as I could easily hear people coming down the hall.", "Date": "May 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR403173217", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Nice, clean budget hotel in good location We stayed in Hotel Zeil while the Musikmesse was on and so most hotels were fully booked and pretty expensive. I think we paid more than the hotel's usual rates because of the trade fair. My single room had a single bed, so be warned! Saying that, it was comfortable. The hotel has a little brasserie attached which doubles up as the breakfast room in the morning. Breakfast was great and included in our price. I would recommend this hotel as a good clean hotel for those on a budget.
