Waited 5 minutes. Good start. Room ok, clean and functional albeit don't expect a view from the window, come to think of it no matter what room you have in this building, all you will see is a mass of concrete buildings very close on all 4 sides. There is no air conditioning and if you do open windows for some air, then you will suffer from rather busy through trafic, especially commercial vehicles. Depending on which way you go on leaving the hotel you will either end up very close to Liverpool Street which is very convenient for onwards travel to West End and just down the road from Spitefields Market with great selection of shops, antique stalls and bars and restaurant's. However if you go the other way, you will end up very close to a rather less pleasing run down area where I found myself feeling very uncomfortable walking in the daylight let alone what it would be like after dark. Facilities in the hotel are basic, small bar area and cafe, don't expect quality cuisine. but in fairness it's not that type of hotel. I felt it was more geared to back packers and it reminded me of my days spent in youth hostels abroad. Sorry to also say that the staff were rather distant, and found it difficult to understand them at times even when asking for basic information. At \u00c2\u00a3120 per night accommodation only, puts this hotel in same bracket as more pleasing hotels with far better service, comfort and setting.

The bar / cafe is very small for such a large hotel and breakfast was a bit of a battle ground to find seating and a game of musical chairs, breakfast consisted of any cereal you would like tea coffee fruit juice and sausage/bacon/scrambled egg and beans each morning.

On arrival, the receptionist was a bit narky with me as he couldn't find my booking even though I gave my name three times, each time spelling it for him but, instead of listening to me, he just ignored it and got more annoyed. Eventually he found it and I got room 315.

The only grippe was that the shower sprayed everywhere! Even with the shower curtain in the cubicle, it still got on the floor but not a major issue. The other problem was that there are some bars close by which got very busy. This was a friday night so it may be different on other nights of the week.

But booking late, at the rate my company would pay and clashing with an event in London, this was all I was left with. Very close to Liverpool St but when reading the directions on their website replace Virgin store with Tesco Express. Pleasant staff on reception. One of the refurbished Travelodges (done in the blue decor like the TV advert). Check in and check out very quick and none of that nonsense about taking a card swipe for extras. Vending machine with sweets, pop & water at reception. Found the room clean, fittings all clean and in good working order, bathroom (only shower) clean apart from shower curtain that trailled in slow draining shower tray which showed the classic signs of not being able to dry out properly. Good shower and plenty of hot water. With it being in the financial district very quiet after dark so got a good night's sleep. The only gripe I have is that the mattresses in Travelodge don't have a protector on them - best not to dwell on that! Room could have been on the warm side if outside was one of those hot sticky nights as no visible sign of fan etc but window did open (with safety restraints) so probably not too much of a problem. Corridors might give wrong impression of a place in decline but this is what Travelodges are about - no frills. Plenty scuff marks but with the probably high turnover only to be expected. Breakfast hit the mark for me although I don't partake of the cooked stuff - yoghurt, grapefruit, toast, cereals and they have Earl Grey tea! Help yourself so can't grumble. Plenty of pubs and eating places in short walk distance - we went up to Spitalfields Market which offered loads of choice (mostly chain type) but other independents on offer on streets surrounding location - depends on your price target.

It is central to the tube/train stations and a number of eateries and bars. The member of staff on reception during check in was friendly..He provided us with a map of London and recommended some places to eat. We got checked in quickly and up to our room. The room, as with all Travelodges, is basic, but clean and tidy. The room was cleaned everyday for our 3 nights stay. The room was extremely warm at night and we did need to leave the windows open, which did result in some noise from outside. However I know the Travelodge cannot be held accountable for what happens outside the hotel. The room was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and other than the temperature, I could not fault it. We were in the hotel bar just once, again this was basic, but clean and tidy. The staff manning the bar were friendly and cheerful, however did not have much knowledge about prices of drinks, they did have to go and find another member of staff. The carpet was also slightly sticky. Bar service is maybe something to be improved on but we didnt spend much time there, so cant really say a lot. We didnt eat at the hotel either, so cant comment on that. Overall, we had a relaxing and enjoyable break in London.

I had to get dressed and traipse down to reception without having washed which was very embarrassing when encountering fellow residents. I explained the situation to the receptionist and asked for some cold water to drink and wash with. I was first told I had to buy bottled water from the vending machine and would also have to move rooms onto a different floor until finally she suggested I could visit the restaurant to obtain a glass of water. She finally found an unoccupied room on the same floor which whilst it had a bed with a broken foot I could use the washing facilities. I then has to transfer all my luggage to this room in order to shower and shave, despite the fact that the room was not made up with scum marks all round the sink. I would have thought that the provision of running cold water was a basic service at any hotel and whilst I understand that sometimes things do not always work I was surprised this was not reported by the staff when the room was last made up. I was also dismayed that Travelodge don't provide a phone to reception and/or complimentary bottles of water to accompany the coffee and tea making equipment unlike comparable establishments.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure this information about early check-ins is available on the Travelodge website, but the room was booked by my boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company (tight gits), so we only knew the booking reference and the address. Plus, the next day, I saw a much friendlier receptionist take in bags for other guests. After 45 minutes in a pub nearby, we tried to check in for a second time.

As other reviewers have said, the lift was out of order (and we were on the 5th floor); My husband and I had to share a towel the first night as there had been a problem with the delivery - new towels didn't arrive until the next day; Room very hot - so we had to leave the window open - which meant that we were woken at 5am both mornings by lorries outside the window and the sound of trolleys being loaded/unloaded. I don't think this was from the building works - but maybe it was the towels being delivered! We paid extra for breakfast and evening meal. Whilst there was a good selection (and quantity) of food for breakfast, the 'hot' food was left standing under heat lamps and was lukewarm at best. However, the main problem was with the evening meal. The first evening there was no one around to take our order. My husband went down to reception and eventually someone came up to take the order. We couldn't have what we wanted because the fryer was broken - so we opted for Steak & Ale Pie. Fine - except there were no peas and no alternative veg - so we just had pie & mash. I ordered Banoffee pie for pudding. When it arrived it was frozen solid. I took it back to the kitchen and complained (nicely|) that it had not been defrosted. I was told it was meant to be like that and that was how they were trained to serve it.. and they offered me a knife to cut it with!! The second night the menu was reduced even further to either pizza or curry! I wouldn't have bothered booking the meals had I known - they definitely were not value for money. The final straw was cold water on the last morning of our stay because the boiler had broken. Whilst you could say that the hotel staff can't help it if things break down -and if it was only one thing at a time it would be bearable - it didn't appear that a great deal of effort was going into resolving the issues.

The actual hotel itself was a disgrace though. We arrived at 2 am to no one on the reception desk (there never was anyone there unless you pressed the bell, and on one occasion the reception girl was very annoyed that we uncovered the bell, which she'd hid with a sign!) Anyway, we were told that we were on the 5th floor and that the lift was out of order, we asked for another room on a lower floor because I have asthma and was told no. After climbing the stairway, which was smelly and damp with cracked windows, all we wanted to do was sleep. Which we couldn't do because the building had no air conditioning at all and it was boiling. At 7:45 am we were awaken to the sound of the building works right outside our window, which no one had mentioned. This went on for the four days we were there. I tried to close the window for some peace and quiet to get my head together, but there was no handle on the window. When we woke up properly and had a good look around I was horrified. There were stains on the carpet (do not walk in bare feet!) spilt coffee or whatever on the walls, cigarette butts in the window frame, our quilt cover was torn, the lamps on either side of the bed were stained and thick with dust, one of the coffee cups was cracked, the bathroom tap was loose and dirty and every time the toilet was flushed upstairs there was a fowl smell coming from our toilet. There is no hair dryer or iron in any of the rooms, but if you ask for them at reception you will get one IF they are available and you have to give it back straight away due to the small amount they have. So to have a shower and dry my hair I had to run down five flights of stairs and back, get ready then run down five flights of stairs again. I complained about the lift and asked when the engineer would be out to fix it, I was told \"it doesn't look likely it'll be any time soon\". On our third day there we came back to our room and no one had been in to empty the bins or give us fresh towels, although we had passed the cleaners earlier that day, who had left piles of dirty laundry lying on the corridor floor. I wasn't running down the stairs to complain, I just wanted to sleep. Not that the reception staff would have helped, they were the most unfriendly people I have ever met. When we were checking out the man on the desk was dealing with someone else and asked if we were checking out, I said yes to which he replied \"just leave your key there then\" and continued with his conversation. No goodbye or thank you. I know Travelodge is a budget hotel and you pay for what you get, but all I was expecting was a clean and working room and to be treated well. It doesn't cost much for cleanliness and to teach their staff about customer service. I have since emailed Travelodge to complain and explained everything that happened.

The price was also pretty competitive (I believe we averaged around 100 GBP a night). That being said . . I have some major qualms with staying at this hotel. First of all, I realize you don't go to Central London and expect to pay a small price and get a ton of amenities . . I get that. . however, I think certain things should be expected. For example, they only had one pillow in our room when we got in - and they did not have any more at the front desk, so we had to make due until the second day when more came available. How can a room only have one pillow? I have no idea. . Other things that were problematic and annoying . . no phones in the rooms, no fan or air conditioning, a window that opened to the street that people were using / arguing / partying on all night so it was difficult to sleep, they only cleaned our room one out of the four days we stayed, no soap for the shower, the hallways reeked of mildew and there were some really gross stains on the floor of the room. . . A few minor positives of the hotel worth mentioning: the breakfast was a fairly good deal (7,5 GBP for an all-you-can eat buffet of relatively good quality), the elevators did work (despite their web site stating that they did not) and there are a fair amount of pubs in the area of ranging nationalities, so there are places to eat and drink pretty close. . but expect to need a suit jacket to go to any of these, as this is the financial district of London and tourist clothes really make you stick out! Overall. .I wouldn't stay in this hotel again, but would probably consider staying in this area again. We were a very short tube ride from all of the touristy stuff, the neighborhood felt pretty safe, and the price was right. . but yeah, the hotel was very dirty and seems to have had all of its better years behind it. .
