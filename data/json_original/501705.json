I agree that if you could only go to Bali once and stay at only one hotel, it shouldn't be the Waka Gangga. It is out of the way and too much driving would be involved to see everything else Bali has to offer. We went on a one-day excursion to Mt. Batukaru, the hillside rice paddies and a couple of temples which was worthwhile but a long day in the car. That said, it is a great place for someone looking to relax in a secluded location for a short trip (assuming you can get back to Bali again) or as part of a longer trip. We stayed there to kick-back after a long flight and to get out of work mode at the start of a long trip - for that, it worked perfectly. We didn't have any issue with the staff. Its not an Aman or 4 Seasons resort, but the service was very good when we were there and better than expected given the past reviews. The food was decent not great, but again better than expected. The dining bungalow has a great setting overlooking the beach/ocean.Our bungalow (#1) was charming and kept very clean. It had fantastic 180 degree views overlooking the rice paddies and the ocean. Yep, there are bugs, often swarms of them outside the bungalow, given that the bungalow is in the middle of the rice paddies. However, we didn't find the bugs to be a problem by the pool (pretty little pool with a view down to the nice black sand beach), by the beach, in the dining area or inside our bungalow. Overall, a pleasant stay and I would recommend it keeping the above in mind.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR728225894", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "airmokeski"}, {"Content": "Never Again!

Very remote from any kind of activity and with nothing to distract from the beautiful scenery, which is just what we wanted.The stay was very enjoyable and the staff genuinely friendly. However, the hotel is obviously suffering from somewhat apathetic management, which is sad because it would otherwise be just perfect and almost on par with substantially more expensive venues (e.g. Aman Resorts). Rooms were nicely decorated, but fabrics - couch pillows, bed throws, curtains - were heavily stained and in desperate need of a wash. Lots of cobwebs in the room and dusty closet interior. Messy storage rooms with fluorescent lighting in plain view behind the reception area day and night. Also, while the restaurant food was okay, choices were too limited and preparation too bland for a longer stay with no alternative food options in the neighborhood.Overall, maintenance and cuisine was below standard of what the hotel tried to be - and could be under more stringent management -, but beautiful scenery in remote location made up for much of the shortcomings.", "Date": "May 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR407684683", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "10179k79"}, {"Content": "Remote!       glassed-in bath", "Date": "Feb 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR945026649", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "custardpudding"}, {"Content": "Loved the serenity and landscape I came here on my honeymoon back in august 2004. We loved the place. Each villa is surrounded by sloping rice terraces which fringe a sparkling black sand beach on the edge of the Indian Ocean. The place is what My Husband said The perfect place to find serenity. It's just amazing to see the rice terrace standing side by side with the indian ocean. We took a walk in the black sandy beach looking at the ocean, in the morning. You could also ride a horse there, they have a stable.The restaurant is perched on the edge where you can look straight to the ocean. The bungalow itself is nice - nice outdoor bathroom with sunken bath and proper shower. Complete aminities. Nice, complete breakfast.

Waka Gangga is a real gem. I have nothing to add to the positive reviews of others. It was just perfect to dive into vacation mode after a long flight. The hotel is not for small children and also not for adventure people but perfect for couples who like to dive into a quite world in the real Bali. For visitors going there before the end of this summer: The hotel is building two more villas and there is a private man building a house just next to the hotel. Both cause some noise (not really disturbing) and you can see it as well i.e. view is not perfectly undisturbed. The best: - The outdoor bathroom and the nice wood floors in the villa.- the friendly staff  The worst:- Dirty beach (but nice waves!) - Food that could be more special and improve (but was still good) Bottom line:The perfect getaway.

This was absolutely true, we were in the middle of the ricefields, overlooking the rough waves of the ocean.The hotel is aboslutely amazing, location is perfect for a relaxing hide-away. The restaurant is good, beautiful pool which is nearly on the beach, you have a great view of the sunset from everywhere, villas are really nice designed and we loved the garden shower and the huge bath tub. They could have been a bit more clean: holes in the sheets, stains on the curtains probably from the live-in gecko who planted his droppings in the romo during the night. We could not leave stuff on the nightstand behind the bed because he lived right above that, apparently.We brought our 8 month baby boy with us and they were most helpful in getting all the stuff to our room that we needed. His babycot was also waiting for him, nice bali wooden cot. Unfortunately it is only suitable for a baby who does not move yet because the side is very low. So we really had to keep an eye on him and get him out immediately when he woke up so he could not fall out of bed.But I must say that they are a bit weird about the packages and prices. We had to book via an agency as well to get a better deal. When we wanted to book some small trips prices varied: when the staff informed us about the possible trips they were 10USD per person, when we actually tried to book it, they were 20USD per person. As if 10USD is not enough for a small trip to Tanah Lot or the rice fields. You feel a bit like a money tree and the local staff will try to get everything they can. They sometimes try to charge you crazy prices in USD.I booked a foot spa as well and the lady doing it was definitenly not trained in doing pedicures.And when it started to rain she moved me into another open room which meant we were not entirely in a dry place.But overall, a very good experience!! It's definitely worth a visit.", "Date": "Feb 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR409707594", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MM1908"}, {"Content": "Escape by the Indian Ocean Ten individual bungalows surrounded by small rice paddies and water gardens, a small swimming pool and a spectacular restaurant on a raised structure overlooking the sea. The rooms are well furnished with spacious walled in open air bathrooms. The staff were extremely helpful and unlike a previous reviewer we had no problems getting the horse ride on the beach and the massage included in our package.The Tanah Lot temple is nearby, the hotel car will take you there. Best time to visit is in the morning and when the tide is out. In the evening it gets crowded there as tourists gather to watch the spectacular sunsets. Better to go back to the resort and watch the same sunset from there in peace and with a cold drink in your hand.The beach is good for surfers but not swimmers. It is black volcanic sand and there is a certain amount of litter above the water line which spoils it. Overall a good place to unwind, stroll around the rice paddies and the local village. A really quiet place with the constant sound of the crashing surf in the background.", "Date": "Nov 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR283793561", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Charles_Orleans"}, {"Content": "Beware the packages! My husband and I stayed at Waka Gangga in Nov 2006 for our second honeymoon, and were very disappointed.The place has an ideal setting, and the rooms were designed with taste, but the staff and service were what made the experience disagreeable for us.I went to Waka Gangga's website directly, but was directed to a travel agent called ABL to book the special honeymoon package that was being advertised. Beware of ABL, and only book such a package if you have a great deal of fortitude! The package includes a massage, horesback ride, dinner, etc and looks like a good deal, but we had to fight tooth and nail to get each item on the list. (Also, the package is marketed slyly, so that 1 hour massage actually means 30 minutes each.)The room was supposed to be specially prepared for our arrival, but the hotel staff didn't seem to know about the honeymoon package. We had to talk them through it one step at a time, and they kept trying to tell us that we got one item _or_ another, instead of getting everything on the list. In the end I got so tired of arguing with them that the time was not enjoyable.If you do opt for a package, take the list of promised items with you and be ready to show it to the staff over and over again. You'll have to be pushy, so if you really are on your first honeymoon and just want to enjoy the time, I don't recommend booking with Waka Gangga.The property has a lot of potential, but my husband and I were diappointed because the staff couldn't pull it together and we were the _only_ guests in the place for 2 out of the 3 nights we stayed.", "Date": "Nov 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR195338332", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Mel'sReviews"}, {"Content": "A remarkable bungalow experience, in the heart of the \"real\" Bali.
