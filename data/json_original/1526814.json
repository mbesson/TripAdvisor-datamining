Berlin is quite a big city and the hotel is quite far from the S-bahn and U-bahn. It is a decent place for wellness, but I am not sure it cuts it for a four-star hotel. The room was exquisite, so was the wellness area and the breakfast buffet. I can recommend Angela Schultz as a spa therapist if you would like a facial or a pedicure. The minus: thin walls between the rooms; I could hear the guy in the neighbouring room snoring. There were also a multitude of minor things, a lack of attention to detail. The spa massage therapists did not show up on time; the receptionist in the spa did not ask for enough detail to pick the right treatment, i.e. quick pedicure or a spa pedicure; the wireless network was slow and the codes we first got did not work.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cHotel inside a fitness club\u201d", "Author": "AleksanderD", "ReviewID": "UR127355491", "Content": "It is not by accident the word \"hotel\" is last in the name of \"Aspria Spa + Sporting Club + Hotel\", it is as if they as an afterthought have fitted a few hotel rooms inside a fitness club. Wonderful if you are into fitness and wellness. I found the gym well-equiped, with a 25m swimming pool and multiple rooms for cardio and resitance training. The spa was nice. We had a couple of good massages, and V-- had an excellent facial and pedicure. The saunas are not for the shy though, German rules meaning nudity apply. The hotel rooms were excellent, spacious and modernly designed. The breakfast buffet was good as well. The only bad thing about the place, is that it is not very centrally located, being near the far end of the Ku'damm and quite a distance from the S-bahn.

Hotel is in a quiet location just a few steps from Ku-damm and only a short walk to the next S-Bahn Station. Some good restaurants can be found within 10 to 15 mins walk, the nearest one is just around the corner. The hotel itself has a restaurant with a nice atmosphere and moderate prices. The staff was highly professional, helpful and very friendly; we arrived before noon, and they arranged our room to be ready much before the regular check-in time! great! The room was quite spacious and clean, with a modern and functional design, safe, Wi-fi internet (free of charge), large writing desk, really comfortable beds, a very large bathroom (bathrobes and plenty of towels included) and a lot of space for everything. We had a room on the rear court, which was very quiet: no noise at all, neither from outside nor from neighbouring rooms. Breakfast was served in a beautiful \"winter garden\", and it was excellent. Of course we visited the \"club\" (entry is included in the room price!) with gym, swimming-pool and spa. The spa on the fifth floor is great, with several saunas, jacuzzi, steam-bath, silent relaxing zones with comfortable beds, and a beautiful open-air terrace with chaises-longues and a small pond. We also enjoyed the \"Aufguss\" ceremony, which takes place every hour. A fabulous treat! It is also possible to have a light snack and a drink at the spa Bistrot. We can highly recommend this hotel, and would stay there again when in Berlin. Prices are moderate, and it's also possible to find good deals through the on-line reservations, especially in case of early bookings.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cGreat accomodation in a quiet part of town\u201d", "Author": "Bertrand X", "ReviewID": "UR125693561", "Content": "It's a club rather than a hotel: To go to your room you cross either the spa or the gym.

First, I have never been moved to write a review before. Second, I must admit that I booked the Aspria because it was in the right neighbourhood and I got a really good deal! (By that I don't mean it was dirt cheap - so don't get your hopes up - but that it should have been a lot more; I knew what I wanted in terms of basic facilites and was expecting to pay quite a bit more.) It's a rather uninspiring facade as you see it for the first time and the area is very big-city-urban but, once you get inside the door, that all changes. From the first greeting uttered by the receptionist - and, by the way, my German is OK and my partner is German, but every single member of staff we encountered spoke excellent English - to the farewell from her colleague, through the housekeeping staff and (a special mention to) the spa staff, the service and professionalism was outstanding. The rooms (based on the one I had) are spacious and modern. Some of the quirks - like the open plan ensuite area (the toilet and shower are closed off by translucent glass though) - might not be to all tastes but the decor was clean and well-conceived. And as for the carpet...you'll have to go there, but you must walk around barefoot and scrunch your toes ;o) The bed was incredibly comfortable, although I, personally, would have preferred a double mattress, rather than two singles in a double frame. That, however, is a very minor quibble. Oh, and the shower was one of the best I have ever encountered in a hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel, so I won't comment on that, but we did use the spa and sauna. The sauna area is surprisingly large and well equipped for a hotel (although, as is the norm in Germany, it is expected that you don't wear more than a towel, if that - you have been warned) and, well, I will simply say that my girlfriend (who is a verteran enjoyer of massages) had \"the best massage of [my] entire life\". Ask for Talia! To round off, I will simply say this: I travel a lot for work, as a touring musician. Good quality sleep and relaxation are paramount in surviving that lifestyle. I have stayed in over 100 hotels in the last 18 months. This was the best. No doubt.

Rooms are modern and big, there is sauna, swimming pool, massages, spa, etc... everything you can imagine, and just some steps from your room.

The hotel is not in the center of Berlin, but just 5 bus stops from the shopping street Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, which is great. I Summer you can even walk this distance.

I've stayed closer to the tourist attractions before and enjoyed being in the heart of all the action, but this time I wanted to be closer to where all of my meetings were - and the Hotel Aspria popped up on the map as only two stops on the S-bahn from the ICC centre - perfect! The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the bed in the room spacious and comfortable, the shower and bathroom areas spacious and the Kores toiletries fabulous. The Spa itself was absolute heaven! From the Sol inhalation room (a flowing wall of saltwater, surrounded by comfy lounge chairs) to the wave and light room to the Saunas and the hot stones you could rest on, this hotel was exactly what I hoped for and more. My days were long and stressful and being able to come back to a comfortable room, a welcoming reception from the staff, and then spend at least an hour if not two hours in the spa facilities before collapsing into bed - it was absolute heaven. Not only will I book in to this hotel next time I have business in Berlin, but I'm trying to convince some friends of ours to go for a long weekend next time we are close to Germany. It would be well worth it. *Warning to the Americans though, if you've never been in a European spa, make sure you know about the nudity so that you aren't too shocked. I'd been to spas in Europe before, but my colleague who was American and hadn't been was a bit shocked on the first day.
