The location is great, the staff reasonably friendly, the price not bad ($179 a night) but that's about it. My room on the 10th floor was old and needed renovation. The plug sockets in the walls were loose, so every time you unplugged an iron or phone you felt the socket might come away in your hand. The air conditioning system was noisy and oddly designed -- when I turned it off there was more noise than when it was on. The bottom sheets were six inches too short so my feet (I am 6 feet 2-1/2) began getting caught by the end of the bed. What really bugged me was the staff's total indifference to the chaos around them. My stay coincided with a student music festival and there were teenagers wandering around the corridors pretty much 24 hours a day. A colleague had to call the front desk at 2 am to complain about people playing the ukulele loudly on his floor. I mentioned this to the check out staff and they said \"Sorry about that\" but didn't seem too bothered.

To summarize, I had an excellent stay at the hotel. It was clean, comfortable, friendly, and it served my needs while I attended the conference. The rooms are very spacious and have a good desk with plenty of light in case you need to work. My room had a flat screen TV with all the standard cable channels. The room was very quiet and I could not hear anything going on in the rooms on either side of me. You will be able to hear sirens from the street below but they did not occur enough to disturb me and it is not the fault of any hotel. I would recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay there again. Some of my highlights include: Staff \u2013 The staff is a major strength of the Sheraton LA Downtown. The staff was friendly and helped me several times throughout my stay find food or my way around the subway and metro line. I got to LA at 8:30 AM way ahead of check-in time so I thought I would have to sit and wait for a while but to my pleasant surprise the hotel was able to check me in right away. Cleanliness - The housekeeping staff works hard to keep the hotel common areas and rooms clean. Lobby \u2013 the Hotel\u2019s lobby is beautiful and has a bar and tables chairs along with an internet center. Restaurant - The Hotel Restaurant is the Brasserie. I ate a few breakfasts there as well as a lunch, which were buffets. The front desk gave me coupons that knocked about $7 off the price of the buffet and included drinks and tip. The breakfast buffet was really good with quite a bit of selection. I would recommend better coordination between the front desk and the restaurant, however, because the restaurant staff was initially confused about the coupons. Internet- In room internet is available for $12.99 per day. I had it complimentary with the conference. It served my needs and was fast enough unless I wanted to use youtube. It was a bit slower for some of these applications. But it served me needs. Comfort \u2013 I have a hard time sleeping in a new bed even in the most luxurious of hotels but it was not an issue at Sheraton LA Downtown. I slept really well and the beds were some of the most comfortable I have encountered in any of my extended hotel stays. I was very relieved to get a good night\u2019s sleep every night I was there. Location \u2013 The hotel is situated in south downtown within walking distance of the convention center/Staples Center/LA Live Entertainment District. And if you do not want to make the short walk, the Metro subway station is across the street and easy to use. There are also plenty of buses outside the hotel that can take you anywhere in the greater LA area. The staff proved to be very knowledgeable of the transit system and told me which lines and numbers I needed to take to get to different locations. The hotel also works with a private transportation company in which you can arrange rides not served by transit and is comparable to taxi services. I needed a ride to a LA Galaxy game in Carson and the hotel arranged to have me dropped off and picked up. Amenities \u2013 The hotel has a gift/coffee shop that has souvenirs, toiletries, and Starbucks coffee. They also sell yogurt, fruit, and pastries there too. Your bathroom will always be stocked with soap, shampoo, and conditioner. There are large bottles of water in the room, which are complimentary if you become a Starwood member, which I would recommend. Starwood is the Sheraton\u2019s parent company reward program. I was suprised because the hotel did not have a pool or if it did, I did not see it or had no information about it. Workout/Gym \u2013 If you are or become a Starwood member, you get complimentary access a LA Fitness guy located in the attached mall and across from the lobby. The gym is used by a lot of people working in the area so it is typically crowded but it is large with quite a bit of equipment. Shopping/Food \u2013 The hotel is attached to Macy Plaza shopping center which is a small mall anchored by a Macy\u2019s but also has several other stores like a Radio Shack and Ladies Footlocker. There are several fast food outlets in the Mall itself. In addition, there are several good sit down restaurants in the area within easy walking distance. If you forgot something not sold in the hotel gift shop there is a Walgreens and Rite Aid across the street. I know some of the reviews have made reference to the hotel being dated. And sure there were some areas where a new coat of paint might be needed but the comfort of the hotel and friendliness of its staff more than made up for these minor details.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNice staff but hotel is tired\u201d", "Author": "paripatetic", "ReviewID": "UR128670504", "Content": "Stayed at the Sheraton Downtown LA for a convention in April.

It is about a 2-block walk to the Los Angeles visitors center, and the location is serviced by almost every city bus line going in every direction (took the bus several times, to Santa Monica, Burbank (Warner Bros studios), and the Citidel outlet shopping mall); the main attraction is the fact that the Red Line subway entrance is RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET, so for those of us who flew to LA and don't have access to a car to get around, this hotel is absolutely at the top of my list for a business traveler who wants to explore the city while they are there.

They tell me I won't get a room key until their machine is replaced (eta 4 days) and the bellman will have to let me into my room. So I was very concerned about security. I had to find another hotel (one i knew and trusted) so I checked out, grabbed all my stuff, and took a cab to the Sheraton. The moment I arrived I was greated with a friendly/helpful staff. I new the odds of securing a room for my entire stay was grim because of a major Trade Show in town but I had to leave the other place. I have 13 hrs invested in my day so I'm very tired, hungry, and aggravated. Ann was unbelievable! She welcomed me and listened to my story.

I was traveling for work and needed a place that accepting the Government rate close to the location I would be working in Downtown Los Angeles. I knew when I booked this hotel was attached to the mall, I had no idea it was \u201cin\u201d the mall. I was traveling solo and upon arriving to the hotel, there were three huge tour buses parked out front blocking the check in entrance. I was also aware that I would be parking in the mall parking structure after arrival as that is the parking lot the hotel uses. I didn\u2019t bank on the fact I wouldn\u2019t be able to enter into the check-in entrance. I tried driving around the block and call the hotel to see what options I had since their entrance was blocked (mind you, downtown LA, you cannot park or pull over to the side of the road at any time as there are signs everywhere stating such. Not sure why three huge buses were the exception) the phone rang, with no exaggeration for at least three minutes before someone answers. Mind you I am driving, can\u2019t pull over anywhere, holding my phone and trying to maneuver through streets that don\u2019t allow right and/or left hand turns at certain times of the day, not to mention several one way streets. When someone finally answers the phone they ask immediately if I can please hold, of course my response was no I can\u2019t. I asked where I could go to check in since the entrance was still blocked. She told me to park in the parking garage next to the hotel and I could enter that way and it would be easy from the elevator. I do as suggested and pull into the parking garage, park near the elevators and think this isn\u2019t so bad the elevator will take me right there. When I get to the elevator with my luggage, purse and other items from my car, I realize there are no signs as to what floor to get off on. When I get in the elevator there is a button for the bottom floor that says Sheraton. Okay great, this works. As the elevator stops on other floors, there are shoppers, people dressed in gym clothes and I realize that we are stopping in the middle of Macys department store. Did I get on the wrong elevator? Nope, when I get to the bottom floor I get out in the middle of the mall. I get to drag my suitcase through the shopping mall, and as I continue to walk there is a sign as if I am going to a department store that says \u201cSheraton\u201d at one of the entrances. Needless to say I am not happy by this point. I check in hiking to myself, just relax it will get better from here. I go to my room and its okay, nothing spectacular, but not too bad. You can definitely tell they tried their best to update the appearance while being in an \u201cold\u201d hotel. It was clean and doable, but definitely been in better. I had picked this location, thinking it was next to the mall it would be safe for me to find places to eat, etc. I am so frustrated I go talk to the manager and nicely explain had it been one thing I could live with my check in issues, but I had real issues with not being able to pull in to check-in and not being able to give the bellman my luggage, having to pull my luggage through a parking garage, through the mall and lastly having them take so long to answer the phone to be told to hold. She graciously offered me dinner, which I was happy with and not expecting. I just wanted her to know tour buses should not be blocking the entrance AND they need to pick up the phone. Anyhow, I used it for dinner in the restaurant, which turned out to be just as horrible as check in. My $30 steak was overcooked, chewy and dry. The bread they served was as hard as a rock. I have had better steaks from Chilis Grill. Anyhow, when I checked out early in the morning a few days later, I had to take my suitcase and walk through the quiet and eerie mall and into the parking garage which just as eerie for that early in the morning. I didn\u2019t like that at all. There are too many other choices to have to stay here again, in fact next time I will pay some out of my pocket and stay at the Omni which is top notch in downtown Los Angeles.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cClean but dated Decor\u201d", "Author": "GottaTravel13", "ReviewID": "UR123999168", "Content": "We picked this hotel for its proximity to LA Live.

The first room we had was dirty and smelt of smoke (despite a leaflet saying you'll be fined for smoking in the room so they can professionally clean/febreeze it properly), this was a preferred guest room, so we went back to reception and got upgraded to a club room. The problem with this hotel is the rooms are dated and in need of a make-over. I can imagine that in the 70's this was a very nice hotel to stay in. When you walk into the room you are greeted by dirty ceiling tiles and a loud, dusty, overworked air-con. The bathroom is basic and what i'd expect from a motel, and though not dirty it didn't feel clean as it was old and shabby. Paint was chipped and wallpaper peeling from the walls. I didn't like to walk around on the carpet as it felt grubby. I didn't even un-pack in the hotel as I didn't feel comfortable or like I could relax. The club room was ok, but i've been in better, again it is in need of modernising. I can't really fault the staff as they were OK, I think they know how bad the rooms are as they didn't argue with me. My only complaint about them is that i've read other reviews about rooms that have been renovated. I didn't know this at the time of asking but I did specifically ask for a renovated room after the first one as there is nothing else really wrong with this hotel apart from the age of the rooms. If they invested some money in the rooms then I think my stay would have been very enjoyable, but as it stands I hated every second of my stay there and I think the fact I left early speaks volumes.

I was not being picky at all, and took the room on the 17th floor, but what really surprised me was how Jason said to me \u201cif you would like, tomorrow when I come into work I can move your rooms to a higher floor with a corner room?\u201d I said to him \u201coh no, I wouldn\u2019t want to put you through that trouble\u201d, but he was so kind and charming to say \u201cNot at all, this will be my first priority to my shift tomorrow evening\u201d. Yes and he kept his word, the next day I was moved to a higher floor with a beautiful corner room view. The beds in the room are so lovely, I honestly am in the process of purchasing a mattress like the ones they have. Throughout my stay I encountered Jason standing at the door directing his staff and being very accommodating with others in the lobby, very fine management here! Another gentleman I would like to point out is Larry at the bellman desk. He always had a smile on him and made me feel good with approaching him on questions about the area. Larry loved to chuckle, walk around and interact with others. Now about the amenities of the hotel. Parking is really, really expensive but there is a small lot across the street that charges you like $5 or $6 each time you leave, so I would recommend parking across the street and just taking the train to attractions in the area since it\u2019s so close. If your looking to stay somewhere for fun and be near attractions, I recommend this hotel and the two staff members above. The hotel is near the Staples center and there are a lot of restaurants in the area, walking distance. If your looking to go to Hollywood, the train is right across the street and will save you gas money, traffic time and is cheaper.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA very comfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "wanderluststruck", "ReviewID": "UR116501513", "Content": "Our room was on the 22nd floor.

Self park is also $28 per day. Valet is also offered for $32. So, while that is a down side, especially with kids, the upside is all of the amenities the mall offers without having to go outdoors. There is a small supermarket where we bought fresh fruit. Another vendor sold smoothies for breakfast. There is a Carl's Jr. if you feel like a burger. So in this sense the Sheraton has more to offer than most other hotels if you count what is in the mall as hotel amenities. Room decor is Westin-esque with dark wood, white bedding, the usual heavenly stuff. Wireless and wired Internet worked well, offered through AT&T for a fee. We had an infant with us and requested a crib, and the hotel obliged. Housekeeping even made up the crib each day, which was a nice touch.

Top marks go the staff who were superbly friendly both on the front desk and around the hotel, exceptionally so in fact - it was them that made me decide to write this review. One negative is that the hotel does not have it's own gym - instead you sign into the Bally gym in the shopping arcade. The distance is not a problem but the gym is fairly horrible, a fairly old 1980s style place. So if you do like a nice private hotel gym, you'll miss that here.

And that's what happens, and how you resolve a problem, when a hotel decides to outsource a basic service. I must say, some of the employees are very good. And some are very bad and in need of training. For example, one night my key card was demagnetized and I asked the front desk to reprogram it. The fellow put it in the machine, claimed to re-program it, and then I returned to my room ... where it didn't open the door.

Second room toilet was fine, mildew was way way worse (smelly too) and still no A/C also was an adjoining room (always potential for annoying noise!). third room they were \"nice\" enough to me give me a corner room on a \"preferred floor\" the nice room was at least 90 degrees because apparently the A/C in the entire hotel doesn't work (admitted by two front desk clerks!) and this is february, hate to see this place in August! the room is still dark, dingy and dirty like most starwood properties and yes had an adjoining door even after my request to avoid that. when I told the desk staff before leaving for dinner that there was still no A/C and the room largely sucked but I had given up on trying to get something decent I was told that the front desk manager, who swore she would call me after 10 minutes to make sure the room was OK (30 minutes ago) was on a conference call and couldn't talk to me! Anyway, come back from dinner to find a box fan sitting outside my door.

We arrived at the hotel at about 1:30 pm, hoping for an early check-in, but more importantly hoping to arrange a late check-out the next day, as we were among the last corral of race participants and likely would not make it back before the 12 noon check-out. The first person we encountered at the front desk was quite nice, very professional and tried to help get us a 1pm checkout; however because our room was not ready yet, she could not make the change on the computer and suggested we come back at 3 and try again. The next person we encountered was, in a word, horrid. She explained, rather rudely, that \"all hotels have a standard 3pm check in and 12 pm check out.\" Um, really? In addition to being patronizing and condescending, she had the nerve to tell us \"Well, your room isn't ready anyway, so you'll have to come back in about a half-hour.\" So it's OK for us to have our check-in delayed, but we couldn't check out an hour late? Go figure. Furious but determined to make the best of our weekend, my friend and I headed out to find a late lunch. Upon returning to the desk, we encountered yet another staff member - Gustave - and explained our situation yet again. At first he was concerned that there were no double rooms available - a pity because our accommodation arrangements had been made months in advance. At that point we were about to completely loose it, but Gustave saved the day. He made sure that we had the best accommodations available and granted our late checkout request, allowing us to completely enjoy our race day getaway. Our room was comfortable and clean, the beds slept well, and though our visit was relatively short, we had a good overnight stay. I'd honestly have to say that while the hotel website boasts of a recent remodel, the room wasn't as nice as other hotels I've visited.

They also threw in complimentary continental breakfasts too, which was very nice. The rest of our stay was really nice too. The cocktails and appetizers at the bar downstairs are excellent. Be forewarned that a continental breakfast does not include the hot items at the buffet -- we made that mistake the first day and had to pay extra. Another feature of this hotel is that it's pretty easy to get to USC. We decided not to rent a car for this trip and it paid off. There is easy bus transportation to USC from about 2 blocks away on bus 81. And a cab between USC and the hotel is only about $15, including tip. So it's much cheaper than renting a car.

We didn't choose to stay here and if it were up to me I probably wouldn't choose to stay here. It definitely caters to the businessperson and I wouldn't recommend it for a family. The location is ok- Near a number of good restaurants and close to the LA convention center, LA Live, etc. Any touristy type activities required a car or a taxi. There is a Metro stop across the street, but I wasn't comfortable using it. I regularly use the subways in NYC without reservation, but for some reason the Metro here made me unsettled. So unless you have access to a car or feel like trying the Metro, plan on spending at least $20 each way to get to any tourist attractions. The \"mall\" that is connected to the hotel consists of a few stores such as Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret and Macy's-pretty slim pickings if you want to do some shopping. The closest shopping center is The Grove which is a $30 cab ride away. There isn't even a bookstore near by. Our first night here we had to call the front desk because of our neighbors. The wall are paper thin! There was a family staying next door and while I sympathize with having to deal with cranky and rambunctious children I don't want to spend the night listening to them. The front desk offered to move us. Staff was very friendly and even sympathetic when I looked myself out of our room. Although pricey, the food was pretty good for a hotel. I did have to call three times for WiFi connectivity issues. The provider stated that they were having some issues and I could go downstairs and use the computers in the lobby. Kind of annoying that in order to get online I had to go downstairs. Overall an ok hotel for business, but I wouldn't recommend for the casual traveler or for someone who wants to enjoy all that LA has to offer.

Figure oh well good thing its not summer, but better get to bed. Call down to the front desk to get a wake up call and let the phone ring over 40 times with no answer so I call the main reservation line from my cell phone and ask them to connect me. They point out they are not part of the hotel and can't connect me, I ask to speak to the manager and he tries calling the front desk and no answer for him, he says \"hum this isn't any good but I'm sorry I can't get in touch with them either.\" After that he says enjoy your stay and good night, no solution! Next day my internet doesn't work after I paid $25 so I call and yay someone answers but their answer is the internet only goes until 3pm the next day. I explain that I purchased the internet at midnight and it is now 6am so the 3pm deadline has not been hit yet and she keeps explaining that it won't work since its after 3pm. I ask to speak to her manager and he points out that the wireless internet is slow b/c it is from another company and not through the hotel but I can pay again and plug into the internet.

I call the front desk just to confirm the check out time since they do not provide anything in the hotel to discuss amenities or hours or anything and I wait 37 minutes when they finally answer!

Quick housekeeping response when we requested extra towels--arrived within minutes. Very good wireless in room and as AT&T customers it was free instead of $12.95 per day.

I mean what am I paying for if I can't have curbside or front door service every time? Stayed in room 800. LOUD street noise for the 8th floor. No hot water in bathroom. Sometimes we had to let the water run about 10 minutes before it would warm up--no exaggeration! Another weird thing--There was HVAC ductwork over the bed with two giant air filters directly overhead as an intake for the HVAC duct system. You know the type of dust filter you have to change on your furnace every couple of months? Imagine having two huge ones directly over your pillow at night. I'm not a germaphobe, but it's gross.

That's a nice amenity except for the fact that like the mall, this gym had a very run-down feeling to it. While my wife worked out on an eliptical trainer, I tried 4 machines before I could find one that worked right. Another 6 cardio machines had Out of Order signs. After some cardio work, went to the free weight area, which had a very good assortment of equipment. Unfortunately again, in various degrees of disrepair. So great to have a major gym versus the usual one little room most hotels have, but such a poor quality gym--I would never buy a membership if I lived here!

The hotel lobby area was beautifully and tastefully done. All the necessary ammenities were there; gym, gift shop, restaurants, lobby bar, room service, concierge, etc. The service was excellent and up to par for what you would expect from a four-star stay. The rooms were wonderfully appointed with starbucks coffee, fantastic soap, lotion, shampoo & conditioner, etc. The prices were high in the lobby bar; however, on Friday night they had a jazz combo and 1/2 off drinks and appetizers which was a nice surprise.

We dined at No.28 Engine Co, a great American restaurant within a block of the hotel but it took us a 20 min walk to find it originally. There is also a Bar Grill within 5 mins walk which was also a good meal. The metro is literally at the end of the road and therefore access to Hollywood easy. Overall a nice hotel, excellent location if you want to be slightly out of the madness of Hollywood but with easy access when you want it. Staff very helpful and bar staff especially polite and attentive!!", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Tahoe, CA", "Title": "\u201cOverall good experience\u201d", "Author": "Violeta5", "ReviewID": "UR8122177", "Content": "We read mixed reviews on this hotel and did not know what to expect. We were going to a couple shows at The Orpheum which is why we chose to stay here. The hotel is connected to a small mall area with a Macy's, food court, salon, juice bar, Express, etc...I had actually forgotten some items, so it was convenient. There is a Rite Aid right across the street if you need anything too. The lobby area was nice and new looking-We checked in early and the lady at the front desk was extremely helpful, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, you do have to pay for wireless, water, etc... but in general, the hotel exceeded our expectations. No swimming pool or hot tub or anything like that. The restaurant that you can get breakfast at is in a weird location in the mall, but the food was good. Did not see many transients or sketchy people, the security at the hotel was good. We never had a problem catching a cab or anything. We did walk home from the theatre a couple nights and did not encounter anything unusual or dangerous. It looked like a better option than a lot of other places that we passed in the downtown area.", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cLacking amenities, horrible service\u201d", "Author": "onlyone129", "ReviewID": "UR8018248", "Content": "I am a Sheraton Vacation Owner, Gold status and I was very disappointed by the treatment I received at this hotel. Check-in and Check-out were extremely slow. I think it was because visitors found issues with reservations and staff were trying to fix the errors. Received room on 11th floor (not club floor as promised with Gold Membership). Room was very small and I felt trapped! Asked for another room on lower floor. Moved to 3rd floor, which only slightly bigger, but still not the club floor. The beds were hard. Definitely not the Heavenly Beds of the Westin! There was only a small tiny shower with no bathtub. Beware, there is no pool or jacuzzi at this hotel. The is a old spa, which is covered outside of the gym on the 3rd floor. But it looked as though no one had been in it for quite sometime. The rails were broken and laying next to the spa. I only stayed one night and I needed a late check out (which is has always been granted with Gold Membership. Requested the later check out and the rude staff told me they could only allow a 1pm check as they were booked 100%. I asked to speak to manager. I had received no other benefits of Gold Membership, so I thought this one request should at least be honored!! Management did grant my request. There is a mall right outside the hotel lobby which is convenient. We went on Sunday night to try and find something to eat. Most places were closed. We finally found a California Pizza Kitchen that was open until 10pm. Would definitely not stay at this hotel again!!

The minuses: no air conditioning in our room (it didn't bother us too much since we're from the Bay Area and never use air conditioning); limited food choices at night in the area (unless you want to spend a lot of money or eat cheap diner food at IHOP, the Pantry or Denny's); and few amenities in the room (VERY basic cable, VERY expensive movies).

We decided to take a road trip to LaLa Land and check out the sights. The hotel was very easy to find (or we just had really good Google directions). Valet was no problem, as it was included in our reservation that was found at hotels.com (we also got tickets to Universal Studios with this package). Our room was a spacious corner room found on the 24th floor. We had floor to ceiling windows on 2 walls, with a view of a bunch of buildings. Nothing spectacular, but still a nice view. There were 5 of us, so the room had 2 double beds and a rollaway bed. The rollaway had a feather bed on it, so sleeping was enjoyable for all. One downside to the room was there were not enough outlets, and the ones they had were very difficult to find. With 5 women, 5 cell phones that need charging, digital camera batteries that need charging, and general ironing, we occupied every pull we could find, and actually had to unplug some lamps in order to use the plug. The hotel amenities are few - the hotel bar is nice. We did not go to the hotel shop, and I am sure things were overpriced. There is a fitness room that we did not go to, and a business center that charges for use. One positive is that the hotel is connected to a mall, so if you wanna do some shopping, there is a Macy's (a nice one), Express, Bath and Body Works, and some other little shops. A downside to staying here was that everything shuts down at 7pm. I did not expect downtown LA to close so early, but it does. The mall closed at 7pm, Rite Aid across the street closed at 8pm, and even the IHOP on the next block shut down at 10pm. We found this out at 9:30pm and then proceed to do a mad dash sprint down the street to get there before they closed - turns out we were the last customers allowed in!!! Nothing like IHOP breakfast in the middle of the night! There were homeless people, but anyone who has ever been anywhere should not be surprised. If we go again, I would definitely stay in Hollywood or at the Beach - where there are more activities after the sun goes down!", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sheraton Los Angeles Downtown Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d77798-Reviews-Sheraton_Los_Angeles_Downtown_Hotel-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$166 - $346*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">711 South Hope Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90017</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516078", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fa/7c/fa7c3dc8d80d5cf77c5b159fce0aa3d96large.jpg"}}
