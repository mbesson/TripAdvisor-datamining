{"Reviews": [{"Content": "It was terrific We stayed at the Hotel San Antonio for three nights. The view was nice (we were upstairs) and we could park our vehicle in secured parking which was a stress reliever! There was a guard who walked the grounds (and inspected the vehicle lot) to make sure no funny business was going on. The hotel managers were great. I can't remember his name...but he was very friendly and helped let us know who wasn't good company. Ha Ha! The motel was more expensive than I expected for a border town in Mexico...but it is a tourist town after all ! The room was airconditioned which is a major plus for Mexico in June! And the best part! WE could safely walk to all of the shops, Ma Crosbys, and Corona Club! It is within walking distance from pretty much anything you want to do! Will definitely return!!!", "Date": "Dec 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR256942815", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "stayingsecret"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d153471-r6522380-Hotel_San_Antonio-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "153471", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
