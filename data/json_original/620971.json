All main sights can be reached on foot with apartment located very close to Gran Via. Notwithstanding central location the apartment is located on a very quite street. The environment appeared safe both during the day and at night. Juan was very welcoming and despite language barrier managed to see to all our requests. The kitchen is well equipped and included a washing machine which we did not use. The sofa bed is somewhat small but was adequate for our teenage boys. Apartment is fully air-conditioned. A grocery shop is located up the road which was very convenient.

We booked through Booking.com and being Finnish we get their website texts in Finnish. Thus I have no idea whether the descriptions are similar or different in other languages. Anyway we booked their 80 sq.m penthouse apartment for 8 days in June. According to the Booking.com description in Finnish this penthouse apartment has a balcony, large windows and plenty of natural light and free toiletries. At the time of our booking in May it also stated that there was a patio. Well, there is no balcony in the penthouse apartment. The windows are small and on the sloping roof section of the rooms, which means that there is not much natural light (and the view you get form the windows is of the sky). Free toiletries means hand wash soap in a bottle. (And there is no patio.) So, no surprise, when we got there and observed this discrepancy between what we were \u2013 based on the Booking.com website description \u2013 supposed to be getting and what the reality was we were dismayed. After a prolonged conference with Juan and Ana \u2013 and a local Booking.com rep on the phone \u2013 we accepted another apartment one floor down. This reasonably fitted the description that we had based our booking on, but at 70 sq.m was smaller. We suggested that the difference in acreage should be compensated; Juan and Ana would have none of it. This smaller apartment was nice enough. The washing machine door however was broken from the beginning. We only noticed it when we tried to open the door with our laundry in the machine. I called Juan and he said they\u2019d come and open the door within an hour. After a day or two the fridge door too broke. During the 8 days of our visit there was no effort to fix either of these. And to go on with the theme of doors; we were three persons and we only got one key. To enter the building you first enter a gate and then a door into the staircase. There is a speaker/buzzer for both, but the staircase electric lock didn\u2019t work at least from our apartment, which meant that if one of us came back earlier, he/she would then need to go down the stairs to admit the others. After the trip we complained to Booking.com that the apartment we had booked didn\u2019t correspond with its (Finnish language) description on their website and that we should be compensated for this. After a prolonged correspondence Booking.com admitted that the website was wrong in claiming a patio; they didn\u2019t acknowledge that it was wrong in claiming a balcony, large windows and plenty of natural light for the penthouse apartment \u2013 and indeed those claims are still there (the mention of the patio has been removed). Booking.com eventually agreed to compensate 10 % of the cost and pointed out that as soon as you make a reservation through Booking.com you enter into a relationship with the accommodation provider. Juan and Ana have been highly complimented in several reviews. When everything is fine, no doubt they give a pleasant impression of themselves. We found the uncompromising and arrogant when dealing with our problem and the fact that they only speak Spanish didn\u2019t help either.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cGood apartments at red lights area\u201d", "Author": "Sergey I", "ReviewID": "UR127166026", "Content": "The appartment's building is located near the city center, about two minutes walk to the nearest metro station. I want to note very friendly apartment's owner Juan, and although he spoke English very little, he left a very good impression. The apartments do not have the reception desk, you have the room and external doors keys.On the ground floor there is a computer, where you can go online and print the necessary documents (on your own paper). Room is equipped with modern kitchen appliances and have a separate little room for storage, clothing and luggage. Large windows overlook the tiny balcony and narrow street.The bed is big enough for a tall person. But there were also negative aspects. At the next major street Calle de la Montenera prostitutes are round the clock having their business. At night, it gives a special concern because they and their clients walking under the windows, laughing and talking loudly. If you do not open the windows it's almost unheard, but if you have a light sleep it might be a problem. The room has a faulty microwave oven (constant overheated and turned off). It was also not very convenient to the lack of small cooking cookware - were only huge pots and pans. Also, we were not able to adjust the air conditioner until the end - it is either cooled too much and roaring, or almost never worked and it was hot. A small inconvenience was that for 10 days was issued just two garbage bags.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cJuan is fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Beverley S", "ReviewID": "UR124542202", "Content": "Very nice, centrally located, well-equipped apartment.

We were looking for a location that would be central, and easy to reach after dropping off our rental car at the airport. We weren't looking for much, since by the end of a vacation you are often just thinking about getting home, and hoping that the house is still standing when you return. This hotel turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. We were met by the owner, who gave us an exuberant greeting. He spoke a little English, and my wife speaks a little Spanish, so between the two they managed to communicate that the room wasn't quite ready when we arrived. No problem, we left our bags and found a patio around the corner to have some Sangria. When we returned, our bags had been moved to the 3rd floor room, and the owner showed us around. It was a large apartment, with a bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette (fridge, stove, oven, dishwasher, clothes washer), sitting area, and a small balcony overlooking the street. Utensils and towels were also included. We had been talking about wine we first arrived, and when we returned the owner presented us with a nice bottle of wine from a vineyard near Cuenca. We explained that we had to leave early on our departure day to catch our flight, so the owner phoned and booked a taxi for us. Overall, the apartment was very convenient, far enough from Gran Via to be quiet, but close enough to the main streets to make it easy to find, and to find the main attractions. We ran into the owner several times during our stay, and he was always very friendly, asking how things were going, and offering assistance. He also provided a great restaurant recommendation; La Gloria De Montera, located just down the street from the apartment, which had very good food and even better prices.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place, great apartment!\u201d", "Author": "ulatarantula", "ReviewID": "UR116121091", "Content": "Me and my partner stayed in this apartment for 5 nights.
