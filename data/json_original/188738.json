The hotel is in an enviable location, with a quaint courtyard and beautiful public rooms. The best part of our stay was the delicious breakfast (included in our room rate--through SLH). The service in the dining area was attentive, not intrusive. I booked the room 10 months in advance and knew traveling in June, that I didn't want to chance the possibility that we might not get an upgrade. So I booked a Junior Suite for four nights. We stayed in Room 90, an attic-like room, with gables intruding into half the room. The junior suite (though typically larger) felt crowded in....I understand now, in ways I never had before what life in an attic might be like. There were three narrow windows, the only light into the room. It was so dark that I had to ask for two floor lamps to be brought up to the room. The bed was firm, perhaps too hard for a hotel of this stature. I agree that a Westin bed or a Four Seasons bed would have been more comfortable. The couch was under part of the gable alcove, so that only half of it was usable. I tried to get another room assignment, but was told that all the rooms were taken. Tell me why, after booking 10 months in advance for 4 nights, (@550euros/night) that they couldn't book us into a better room? Its not like I squeezed into their hotel at the 11th hour. Needless to say, we were not happy. The bathroom, had a mirror angled down so that I couldn't stand up straight to see my face or blow out my hair. I'm 5'7\" and on my way to find a chiropractor...because my back hurts from contorting to see myself. Our second visit to this hotel was a BIG disappointment. From my side of the bed, I had to bend down, to pass the gable and not knock into it cold in a drowsy/half-asleep moment. The air circulation was either suffocating or freezing. In fairness, the General Manager Tim Goddard apologized after I initiated contact with him. He indicated that he had been alerted (from the front desk reservations person) that we weren't happy...but interestingly did not seek me out. Instead, I had to make contact with him to request some accommodation for our discomfort. He was generous enough to discount the room each night of our stay. Even though he did all the right things....I have to say that I would not choose to stay at the Pavillon on a future stay. The hotel rooms need a face-lift, new paint and carpet; It also need more attention to detail--more lighting, better mattresses, cleaner furnishings....and not overpriced rooms that are small and ill-suited for their clients. While I prefer the charm of authentic hotels....they cannot compete with larger brand hotels with better beds and greater consistency. I am a sophisticated traveler willing to spend a fair amount of money for a luxury hotel; however I do not want to arrive at a luxury hotel and have to negotiate for a new room and a better price for the room they have assigned to me. I want to arrive at the hotel, that I've thought about with excitement for 10 months...and be swept off my feet into a luxury experience. I don't expect a BIG room for a low price.....but I don't expect to be given a small room and asked to pay a lot for it. That's when I say NO. I won't stay at your hotel, if that is the kind of room you offer me after 10 months of planning and a LONG overseas flight.

The decor of the lobby was gorgeous - moody yet sophisticated - and since we arrived before check in, we were pleased to find that one of our two rooms - the suite - was availabe so that we could have a chance to freshen up before we went out. We were also pleased to find a complimentary plate of macarons and bottle of champagne waiting in the room, along with a lovely note. The suite was spacious, with two TV's, a large bathroom, and seperate living and bedrooms. Towels and bath products were ample. We showered, had some delicious coffee in the lobby, and headed out. When we returned, the other room was ready, and I moved in there. It was a standard room - a bit cramped and without much closet space - but still with a spacious bathroom and heavenly king bed. My one complaint about this quiet, charming hotel would be the internet. Suffice to say it was a problem, and the management of the hotel essentially blamed it on my computer, even though I tried my parents' computers and neither of them worked. When it was finally resolved, the internet was far from high-speed. Also, on our first day I asked the concierge for a quiet, non-touristy restaurant in Saint Germain, where we were headed, and he recommended the Cafe Lipp, which was exactly the opposite of my reques: it was loud and filled with tourists.

My only gripe is that the A/C in one of the bedrooms was not working properly. It was August and hot...so this mattered. The hotel did not have alternative suite for us to stay in. They did offer alternative unconnected rooms, but with young kids, this was not suitable. A/C units can break, it happens all the time, but then they get fixed. What troubles me is that it was clear from the situation that the hotel knew the A/C was not working in advance and did not (or could not) fix it.

When we got to the hotel, we were greeted with a very warm welcome from the congenial front-desk staffers, who were more gracious hosts than service-industry functionaries. They handled our early-afternoon arrival with aplomb, suggesting that we relax in the comfortable lobby for a few minutes while housekeeping finished cleaning after the previous occupants of our room, which turned out to be an upgraded accommodation, from the entry-level \"superior\" category to a duplex suite. Others on this website have suggested that these rooms are strangely cramped despite the double-height configuration, and I must say that I agree. Though the room is all high style and refined taste, the actual footprint of the suite is quite small, with room enough on the first level for a tiny low-ceilinged entryway, an average-sized bathroom, and a \"cozy\" sitting area of two side chairs and minuscule table, a desk area, and an armoire that houses the minibar, television, and compact stereo. Narrow stairs lead to the loft sleeping quarters. What makes up for the relatively tight spaces, however, is the glorious window that soars to nearly the full height of the entire room, which looks out onto the lovely front courtyard of the establishment. Major pluses include the small but perfectly adequate fitness facility in the hotel's new spa; the impeccable service from every member of the large staff; the smartly decorated public areas; the astonishing hush of every space despite the hotel's location in a bustling part of Paris; the amazing setting on the formally pretty Place des Vosges; miraculously inviting lounge areas on the lobby level that served a bountiful white-tablecloth breakfast in the morning and clubby honor-bar drinks at night; a limited but fairly priced room-service menu available 24 hours a day, despite the fact that the hotel has no restaurant; a gorgeously comfortable bed and ample closets in the loft bedroom; air conditioning that really works; and nice little room amenities such as ample stationery, a nice selection of music CDs, good Molton Brown bath products, decent chocolate with turndown service, and extremely comfortable furniture. A few minor niggles include a stray washcloth from a previous stay (ick) that was nearly hidden on an upper shelf in the bedroom (double ick); the darkness of the bedroom, even during the day; a vaguely latrine-like odor in the spa-level steam room that, thankfully, dissipated over time; also in the spa, a lukewarm jacuzzi; artificial flowers -- yes, artificial flowers! -- that were attached to live plants in the front garden. Despite the little flaws, this has to be my favorite hotel in Paris, for it has a can't-be-beat location for those who favor the Marais/Bastille area, as well as a magical combination of boutique establishment, B&B, and palace hotel.

I have stayed here several times in the past three years, and I have always been enchanted. But while I think it is the perfect hotel for me, I can see why it might not meet the needs or expectations of everyone. Location: It is in the Marais district (in Place des Vosges, in fact). That means Old Paris. Narrow cobblestone streets, tiny boutiques, cafes and patisseries. Lately this area has become quite hip (and expensive!), but it is so in the decidedly French fashion and not in the glitzy pan-European fashion. If you want a glitzier, more international scene, then stick with the hotels (Georges V or Hotel Bristol) up by the Champs Elysees. Rooms: The building is a renovated 18th century mansion, and the rooms are among the most beautiful of any hotel I've ever seen. The interior decor is elegant and luxurious. (Check out their website. The rooms look exactly like that.) But everything is a bit smaller and a bit tighter than in a modern hotel. If you want giant staircases and chandeliers, wide hallways or banks of elevators, then this hotel is not for you. In fact, if you are unable to climb stairs, you may need to rethink staying here. There is one small (albeit nice) elevator and usually there is no wait. But occasionally I have needed to use the stairs. Also on at least one of the floors, some of the rooms must still be reached by a short flight of stairs. I find this charming. In fact, I adore it. But it would be a problem if I were recovering from hip surgery. Service: The staff are caring, attentive, and well-informed. That said, they work in a small hotel, so when you arrive very early in the morning jet-lagged from your overseas flight and your room is not available (because the people in it haven't checked out yet), they probably won't be able to give you another one. This is not because they are unaccommodating, but because there won't be any empty rooms available yet. If you absolutely need a room when you arrive first thing in the morning (if you are traveling with an infant, for example), you should either book a room for the previous night so it is waiting for you or take your chances at a bigger hotel that is likelier to have empty rooms. Food: The room service menu is basic and nicely done but it is nothing extraordinary. That is because there are several good restaurants (and one extraordinary one) only a few hundred feet out the door. There are also patisseries and cafes galore. The area is great for food. The hotel breakfast is basic (in the lovely French sort of way) and the breakfast rooms are elegant and charming. I like eating breakfast here.

I have to say that whilst Pavilion De La Reine is not the most spacious of hotels it is certainly one of the best hotels I've visited and will always return. Firstly the location is absolutely fantastic. Smack bang in the places des vosges in le marais - beautiful! You're within seconds of lovely streets, fantastic restaurants and beautiful cafes not to mention the charming places des vosges itself. The hotel is quite simply beautiful. You enter in a secluded courtyard and the foyer is like walking into a gorgeous library with intimate seating, stunning chairs and sofas and flowers. The rooms aren't huge but are well designed and extremely comfortable. On the two occasions I've visited I've slept like an absolute baby, wonderful! The bathrooms are dark but cosy and I quite like this which makes a change from stark white tiles and glass. They supply Molton Brown toilettries, gowns, and other bits and pieces. Pavilion De La Reine is incredibly romantic and it's charm seems to really weave it's magic. I've felt so relaxed and happy on both visits. The staff are fantastic, helpful and smart. One of my favourite things to do is enjoy the lovely breakfast the next day (We've only ever stayed one night). The breakfast is perfect - fresh bread and pastries followed by bacon and eggs if you want as well as hot coffee or tea. I can't remember Sundays being so good. I don't agree with the review below that the rooms are too small - they are not massive but after staying in the duplex and then in a smaller room I actually preferred the smaller room which was stunning and opened out onto a little japanese garden. Pavilion De La Reine comes very close to perfection to be honest. I have absolutely loved both my times there and can't wait to return, it's a gorgeous place to stay. Sure it's not cheap but worth ever penny to be honest. The only thing they could do perhaps is provide in room dvd players and have a dvd library - the rooms are so nice that i'd love to come back after a long day out and curl up and watch a film.

The bellman acted as if he was \"doing us a favor\" by taking our bags to the room - and the room was nothing like we expected. Living in NYC you understand that space is at a premium in the big cities but the rooms here are tiny and cramped and smelled like it was 1849. We actually booked a deluxe room which is a joke. The bathroom at our Riad in Morocco was more spacious than the entire room here. We asked for a different room and they were none too pleased to accomodate us. After an unpleasant exchange with the front desk we were taken to another \"deluxe room\" which seemed as small or even smaller than the 1st room. You must climb a tiny and narrow staircase that leads you to the bedroom \"loft area\" with hardly enough space to move around let alone relax. The bathroom was also small and inconvenient. I know this is a boutique small hotel and did not expect a palatial suite but this does not even remotely live up to my modest expectations. The few positive things are the breakfast choices and the serve-yourself drink bar -- which you had better use often enough to pass out before you return to the room or see your final bill for staying there. The other positive is the location which is right off a lovely park and art gallery area -- but staying on one of the park benches would have been more comfortable than this hotel.

I stayed in a Standard room (top floor, gable roof) for 3 nights, before changing to the Suite de la Reine (one of the 2 top suites) for 3 nights. The Standard was tiny but newly decorated in a chic decor (gray fabric walls, nice furnishings) & very well thought out, with a nice bathtub, separate WC, flat panel TV & hidden minibar. Those who like a lot of space & light (normally me) may find this room a bit claustrophobic, but I found it cozy; note that there is not much room for luggage though. The Suite had enormously high ceilings & 3 full-length French windows overlooking a quiet side street; again, it's not huge, but the ceilings & windows give it a big airy feeling with lots of light, & it is luxuriously decorated, with a separate lounge, 3 bathroom areas & a walk-in closet. The lobby bar is a lovely place to gather for drinks, with cozy chairs & a well stocked honesty bar. The hotel was adding a gym & spa downstairs when we were there. The front courtyard is beautiful - walls covered with ivy - & makes the hotel feel like a quiet haven, just off the Place des Vosges (a very special corner of Paris, in my opinion; it's a lovely place to sit under the trees).

Each agent is genuinely friendly and eager to make your stay not only in the hotel but in Paris as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. The Concierges are excellent and their knowledge of the city is most helpful when choosing where to eat and where to go. The hotel also has a lovely room just beyond the entrance with a fireplace and an honor bar.

Place des Vosges is one of the most beautiful places in Paris and the location in the Marais could not be better. You enter from the street into a small but picturesque garden.

No, it is not a design hotel, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old mansion and the furniture follows the style; light and very stylish. The rooms are small but elegant and cosy. They got stereo and flat screen TV. Bathroom is not large but perfectly fine. I think the rooms are starting to be a little run down, so some renovation would be appropriate soon. However, it is so quiet you hardly believe you are in the centre of Paris. There is no restaurant, only a breakfast room. But they have 24 hours room service and a nice menu to select from. And very tasty I can add. The service is top notch and very friendly. And quick! Next to the lobby there is living room with a bar from which you serve yourself something cold to drink. You only have to make a note on a piece of paper what you have drunk and it will, of course, be charge to your bill. Yes, everything has its backside, and honestly, even if this must be one of my favourite hotels in Paris, it is VERY expensive and nothing in the hotel is for free.

If they give you directions to somewhere, you will arrive without problems. Try Gaspard de la Nuit for a wonderful dinner, it's only 2 blocks from the hotel. We tried the tasting menu (with wine) the first night and it was all that I hoped a French meal would be, without being hoity-toity or stuffy. Our waitress, Julie, was very helpful and personable.
