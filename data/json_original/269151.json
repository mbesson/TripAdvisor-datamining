Location: Fantastic, across Atocha Renfe Station (building is visible from the station itself) so perfect to lug a trolley luggage straight from the airport express bus which alights there. Atocha Metro is like 50 meters away. Behind it there is the Reina Sofia Museum & Plaza with American outlets (for all Americanophilies) like Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Macs, Burger King next to or around the block. Plenty of Spanish tapas bars & eateries along the stretch as well. Walking distance to Retiro Park & Prado Museum. Amazing. Hotel & Room: Housed in a classic Spanish Style building with exterior and interior deco and old-school european lifts. Pretty large room for in European terms with comfy beds, spacious bathroom and amenities like flat-screen TV, mini-bar, hairdryer etc. Minimal noise from the corridors or streets (room was facing the main road). Air-conditioning was functional and was able to be switched on at full blast. Do not bother to try the breakfast when there are plenty of culinary options abound nearby the hotel!! My gripe: Signal of Wi-fi in the room was not as consistent as hoped - no problem, hop on over to Macs nearby for patatas (fries or wedges) and voila! Wi Fi gratis! (strong signal and free!!) Staff: Friendly and helpful enough (as mentioned, the African gentlemen was the most helpful) and most staff could speak English or rather able to understand any form of rusty Spanish like mine.

My only complaints were with the bathroom - the shower was extremely odd, with the showerhead located smack-dab in the center of the shower, so it sprayed out into the bathroom and pretty much flooded it. The hairdryer was also pretty useless, as it barely emitted any heat! The continental breakfast also could have been a bit better- it consisted of a croissant and a large roll (carb overload)- but I'm not too picky as long as I get my coffee. :) Again, the location was great...there was a Starbucks and several little sandwich shops right next door, and world-famous nightclub Kapital was also a short stroll which we all enjoyed!

The room had a nice closet and a TV, though the TV could only be seen from the beds on one side. The staff of the hotel were great, they helped me with all of my requests with no problem, no complaints there. My only concern with this hotel is the need to return your room key to the front desk each time you leave and then to get it back simply say your room number to a staff member. This is fine, but its very simple for someone just to give a room number to them and get the key. The hotel's location is prime. Very close to everything most would like to see in Madrid, and should you need to go a bit further than a 25min walk, the metro station, train and taxis are all nearby.

They obviously deal with groups all the time, but they treat us like second class citizens. Many of our rooms weren't ready and we really didn't have any choice but wait. When we finally got into our rooms, we were glad there is an elevator. The rooms had AC which was great. The view from my room was spectacular. We could see major landmarks as well as sunset.

The shower has a small half wall of glass but a lot of the tub/shower is open to the bathroom. I accidentally shot water from the shower out and got the floor wet. My towels were used to mop up my mess. I called and asked for additional towels because of the mistake and I was told \"You are with a group, so no more towels for you!\".

The 2nd morning we were having breakfast, the kitchen worker came out and yelled at my whole group in Spanish. She told us we couldn't read and were stupid. She was very angry and belligerent. She was upset because we sat at the wrong tables; little did we know they had changed where they wanted us to sit from the previous day. There was no need for her anger. Our room was pretty quiet because we faced out to the main huge street (sounds backward right?), but the rooms that faced toward the back and side of the hotel found the noise levels very high at night. The back of the hotel faced an area where people congregate at night and make a lot of noise. The safe in my room didn't work so I called down and someone was sent to my room right away who replaced the batteries.

We had requested a quiet room away from the kids explicitly in our reservation, and they accommodated this request, so I recommend you do the same. Night staff was very friendly, but the man at the day desk was the exact opposite - the rudest behavior I've had as a quest. Not cultural - everyone else was extremely friendly in Spain even tho we did not speak any Spanish. Not a charming hotel, but clean and neat. All about location - right next to the Rena Sofia museum and just down the street from the Prado. There was a hop-on hop-off bus (highly recommended) stop right across the street, and we used this to get around as we were only in Madrid the day.

The staff were very kind to us and let me and my family move to a higher floor because most of the students were on the 1st or 2nd or higher floors - it was alot more quiet on the third floor. If you are staying at hotel Mediodia stay on a high floor! In Madrid, the teenagers never go asleep they're still shouting in the streets at 6:00am so I wouldn't say it was the best location to put a hotel! The hotel got quieter each night because we were on a high floor and the beds were quiet comfortable for me, but my dad found them small as his feet used to stick out the end! Breakfast closes at 11:00am so i would advise you to get down there to have some delicious crossiants! There is also nesquick hot chocolate!

I can only justify the price I paid (USED $140/night) because I wanted to be across the train station.

The one positive was that my room had a large window facing over the large square behind the hotel. The complimentary breakfast consisted of some rolls, juice and water. The reception staff was cold, distant and unhelpful. I dealt with the same man for both my check in and check out. His tag designated him a manager. In all my dealings with him (luckily they were very few -- only check in/out), he would not look me in the eyes. when I checked in, I was the only patron. Two problems immediately arose. First he couldn't find my hotel confirmation. Fortunately, I had a printout of my confirmation. Second, he said there was no room yet available and that it would be another 10-15 mins. before I could get one. I told him I would wait in the empty lobby at the lounge area 10 feet away from the reception desk. I reasonably assumed that he would alert me when the room was ready -- I was the only patron, sitting in an empty lobby -- but I was wrong. After waiting 40 minutes, I finally went over to ask him for a status on the room. He silently handed me the key, with no explanation, nothing.

Anyway, we got a room for 79 Euros without a reservation, which was good. the lobby was full of relatively wild teenaged tourists, of which the hotel seemed to have an abundance. The room was small. It was clean, but the furnishings, from the sheets to the tv, climate control, to the bath fixtures were dated, but worked. One might say that the building has character though. On the plus there was a stone balcany off of the room that overlooked an interesting plaza on the back of the hotel. That plaza was occupied by groups of young folks until late in the night. I would think for young folks traveling on a budget, this would be an OK hotel to stay at. More seasoned travelers, and those used to more comforts may be annoyed with the furnishings, the noise, and the rickety elevator. It works if you find yourself missing the last train out for the evening though, and it is reasonable for Madrid in price.

You could feel the springs in the chair, and the marble top of a radiator cracked in half when I set my popcorn chicken and Fanta Limon from KFC on it. There were also some major safety issues in this lounge. One of the 3 elevators has an outdoor shaft. This shaft is very accesible form a large window that swings open. A friend of mine (who is a little nutty) was able to climb on top of the elevator (while not moving)!!! The elevators were also a little frightening to ride. One of them rumbles loudly and vibrates excessivly on the upper floors. The room was nice. It was fairly bright and clean, and the hardwood floors were nice. I had a balcony overlooking the fountain/roundabout and Atocha station. While a tad loud, it is in the center of a major city afterall. The surrounding are is also nice. The Prado is within walking distance. There is also a park close by, but they charge admission!! It did get sketchy at night, however. I was frequently out past midnight, and a group of friends witnessed an armed mugging in front of the hotel. They were questioned by Madrid police and nothing furhter occured. THere was also a mass riot in front of the hotel that resulted in at least one overturend car. I also found myself wandering the back alleys because riots had filled Plaza Mayor and Sol, therby cutting of Metro service, so my friends and I had to get off at the next staion and find our way to Plaza Mayor on our own. This may all seem very scary, but overall it is a safe place. Keep in mind that this violence occured on the day the US declared war on Iraq and I did not have problems during the day. Prehaps the worst part of the hotel was the staff. The day staff seemed OK. The desk clerks were averge, could be friendlyer (however, the maid who did my laudry for me was one of the nicest people I met in Spain). But the night staf....oh boy. They were RUDE!!!! In spain, it is customary to keep ur room key at the desk when you go out. Upon arriving back to the hotel, the clerks seemed as though you were bothering them when you asked for your key. One night (at about 10PM, not horribly late) a girl from my school group asked me to help her make a phone call to the states. I had trouble, so I dialed 9 (in Spain, dial 9 for operator and 0 for an outside line) for the desk and asked how to go about contacting an international operator. The receptionist's reply was hard to understand, so I simply said I don't understand what ur saying. she finally began to scream at me, saying \"YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING! YOU CALL FROM GIRL\"S ROOM! YOU A VERY BAD PERSON. I WILL TELL YOUR TEACHER! GO TO YOUR ROOM.\" she then hung up. My group leader communicated my displeasure to the staff, but I never recieved even so much as an apology. Some of the guests are a little rough too. A group of rather loud Italian students were causing disruption. A few mintes later the same rude receptionist came to MY room and pounded on the door. I opened it, and she COMMANDED me to shut up and go to sleep (again, this is at aobut 10 o'clock at night, not late for Madird). The Italians next door continued to be loud, and a British man in nuthing but his underwear came out in the hallway and yelled at me to tell the Italians to \"SHUT THE *&%^ UP!.\"....sigh.
