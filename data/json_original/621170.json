The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood but not smack-dab central; less than 10 minutes walk in either direction to the metro, bus line (including the night buses if you're out late) stops pretty much across the street from the hotel, so you can get anywhere you want pretty easily. It's near the Rue Mouffetard. The people working there were friendly, but I did not call on them for any services so I can't speak to how helpful they are. Clerk at check in spoke excellent English; she lived in NYC for a while; I spoke mostly French with the others so I can't say about their English. I did not take any meals at the hotel (they offer a breakfast), so I can't judge that. Our room was the \"scintillating Romance\" or some similar name. It was, as with other Parisien hotels, very small. But the surfaces and decorations were stylish and attractive; top quality bathroom fixtures and well thought-out lighting made the room very attractive. We were located in the back on the 4th floor; very quiet with good daylight. The overall effect was polished and a little glamorous. Storage space was pretty limited (pick up any modern design magazine, look at pictures of beautiful, zen-like rooms, and realize that the cost of all that clean minimalist design is that there's no place to put your stuff. An extra shelf in the batthroom, maybe a drawer or two under the writing desk, would be nice. They do take the romance thing a little bit far: fragrance in the room, cloth rose petals strewn on the bed, etc. Either you'll love that or you'll find it over the top.

Now a variety of great options exist, some cheap some more extravagant! The Five Hotel was a surprise for me (as arranged by my Wife) and I was not expecting much as I had no clue. Cutting the chase: Initiation: No seriously we were introduced to the concept of the room we had ( the suit). Tanya made it clear that the room was specifically designed to re-live or re-enact your relationship. The interior of the hotel (lobby etc) is a bit \"dark-ishly\" designed. We had great weather outside but the hotel entree of the hotel was curtained off from natural light. The Room: the room we had (the suit) was great and with all amenities one would expect to have a great night in: a kitchenette with nespresso machine, ipod/music console, tv, sat, ambiance enhancing lighting etc. Even...a camera for in-room (read bedroom) adventure...for those who seek more than just a hand-in-hand stroll on the bridges and want to indulge further sensory pleasures. It even had a small backyard where we had a candlelit chat+drinks. Our suit was outside the main building on the street level. Sometimes commotion (not much) may alert you (cars driving by, people walking etc.). But in general it was all rather quiet and cozy. The food: we had only breakfast and it was great. good cheese, nice bread, butter, coffee and tea. I like the quality of the items used. Our breakfast was room-served but you can have it by the lobby. Although it is greatly and purposefully designed, I found it too gloomy after a long night. The location: It is in the Quartier Latin, with a variety of options to hang out in the area. you can find sweet little reastaurants, groceries and small shops and a number of cafes which are great to puff a cigarette with a coffe of tea. we even came across a stall market where we bought fresh fruit. It takes approx. 10 mins to walk to the Port-Royal RER station (where you can take the train to CDG airport. It took us about 40 mins to walk to coolly to St.Germain The staff: They were all great and very helpful. They were all there when we needed something. Always positive and smiling.

The first issue we had was finding the place, the taxi driver had never heard of the street and this was the case for the rest of the weekend - even to the extent of being dumped about a mile from the hotel on Saturday night with the taxi driver saying that he had got us to the hotel!!!! Check in was 4pm which we felt was quite late, but we were able to freshen up in the toilets, not ideal but OK. Got some good advice from the reception in terms of how to get around town etc - where was the nearest metro. When we finally got to the room, I was surprised by the size of the room. Not much space other than the bed, girls there is no dressing table to do your make up on as my wife discovered and the bathroom was small but clean. The room was decorated in a nice way but the size just put us off slightly. The bad bit about the service was when I asked for an iron and ironing board ont he first night, they bought an iron but said they did not know where the ironing board was. I had to make do using a towel on a table - which I do not mind, but when I am paying what this hotel costs I expect to get at least that. They said that they would get me an ironing board for the next night, but when I rung down they just bought up another iron and my request for the board was met with a shrug of shoulders. Annoyed me a lot really. There was also some work being done in the reception area during our stay - not really disruptive but again when paying the money I just expected a bit better. The general location is quite good near the Pantheon, but hardly what I would call in the heart of the latin quarter. To sum up I would say that yes it is small but knowing Paris I reckon that is par for the course.

As neither of us had been to the city before she looked around Trip Advisor reviews and asked her friends for recommendations and The Five Hotel came out very favourably. The hotel isn\u2019t particularly centrally located, with it being in the 13th Arrondissement, but it is very close to the 5th, however, Paris isn\u2019t *that* big of a city, so being bang central isn\u2019t much of a problem. Check \u2013in is at 4pm, which to me does seem a little late. We arrived at 12:30pm so we were able to ditch our bags and go out and do the \u2018tourist\u2019 things. When we did finally get back and were able to get into our room, I was a little disappointed. Firstly the rooms are *very* small, BUT having looked at other hotel reviews, this is a common complaint about Parisian hotels especially by our American cousins; it was fine. More perturbing to me was the lack of a mini-bar; not that I am a user of such things (over-priced EVERYWHERE you go, however they are ideal to put your own store bought drinks/food in there), but with The Five only being a three star it wasn\u2019t expected. Thankfully, as the room had a large windowsill we were able to put our wine/beer/water out there to chill. At the end of the first day (up at 5am, Eurostar, Effiel Tower and P\u00e8re Lachaise) we were knackered and asked the lovely receptionist Paulina (Polina?) for a recommendation for somewhere to eat. She made us a reservation at Tor Bellon (see separate review) and we were most impressed! We didn\u2019t have breakfast so can\u2019t rate that, but overall this is a quite good little hotel. There are only 25 rooms (I think) and they are all small, but as I ALWAYS say you don\u2019t go on holiday to spend time in a hotel room. That said, I do think they could have a couple of English speaking channels on their TVs (CNN or BBC please, none of this Sky nonsense!)

The room concepts are cool and different and when you walk into the hotel you just get a smile on your face because its not like anything you have seen before.

I needed a room that was close to the BNF but also easy to get to from the Gare du Nord. My usual hotel was fully booked for July so this was the first time that I stayed at The Five which is just around the corner. The hotel is easy to get to from the Gare du Nord - a quick trip on RER B to Port Royal and then a five minute walk and you're at the hotel. Buses from the door take you one way to the BNF and the other way direct to St Michel or the Louvre. The welcome at the hotel was efficient, friendly and they didn't mind letting me practice my terrible French. The room was small but since I was travelling alone it wasn't a problem, I wasn't intending to play basketball in there. A decent TV at the end of the bed, a compact bathroom (if you're hugely overweight it might be a problem, for most people it would be fine), a comfortable bed, air-conditioning and (best of all) free wi-fi meant that the room was ideal for me. Let's be clear, it wouldn't be ideal if you were on honeymoon and intended to spend a lot of time in bed, or if you were travelling with your kids. This hotel (or what I saw of it) is mainly set up for short breaks by singles or couples and it achieves its aim admirably. Cleanliness was excellent - the room was tidied each day in the afternoon. The only time I'd have breakfast in a hotel in Paris nowadays would be if I was having breakfast in bed with my wife. Otherwise it's pointless. There is ALWAYS a caf\u00e9 nearby that will give you as good a service at a cheaper cost. In a city like London or Paris space is money and hotels will not put their breakfast rooms in the most pleasant part of the building unless you're paying extra for that through your room rate. Checking out was simple, the bill was reasonable and overall I had a thoroughly positive experience. It's more than likely that I'll stay there again when next I go to Paris. I notice that they are opening a new hotel around the corner (The Seven?), which looks a little bigger. A couple of recommendations if you're staying at The Five... 1) The cinema across the road (L'Escurial) is a wonderful room to spend an hour or two in if you want to escape the weather or you're at a loose end in the evening. A genuinely mixed client\u00e8le with an old-fashioned vibe. 2) Le Caf\u00e9 D'Avant on the corner of Rue Bernard is ideal for eating from breakfast till late.

The area around the hotel is quiet and it is located on a small quiet street near residences.

There was barely enough room for my husband and I to move around the room without bumping into each other. The bathroom was the tiniest bathroom ever with the tiniest sink and shower. We knew that hotel rooms would not be the same size in big European cities but this room seemed extremely small. We did move to another hotel after a few days in another area of Paris (which had a higher rate as well) and the room at that hotel was almost twice the size of the hotel room we had at the Five Hotel. The bed was comfortable and the room was pitch dark at night. Also, it was extremely quiet - there was no audible noise from outside traffic, etc. Free wi-fi was available as well which was offered when we checked in for all of our devices.

The linens on the bed were sumptuous and there were four nice pillows on the bed, not just two. The bed was much too firm for my preference, but my husband slept just fine. There was not anything the staff could do about the firmness of the mattress, so there was no need to complain about it. There are no vending machines in the hotel - it is a small, boutique hotel - but the staff always provided soft drinks or water at no charge when we asked for something to drink. We were there a week and the only thing \"extra\" that we were charged for was when they graciously sent our laundry out for us at our request.

As my title indicates I have very mixed feelings. First, the good: unlike several other reviewers, I was thrilled with the location of the hotel (although my girlfriend was not). It's in a quiet neighborhood, with a few tourists wandering around with suitcases but for the most part it seems to be almost exclusively residential. It's a 5 minute walk to Les Gobelins, and from there only 5 or 6 stops to the more central areas where tourists will want to spend their time. For me that was ideal; I rather enjoy staying a little bit away from the action. I also liked a couple eateries in the area, particularly Brasserie aux Marsouins (sp?) right across the street. They're friendly, have great coffee, a good beer selection, and decent food. We had breakfast there most mornings, and I finished my day with a beer of glass of wine there most evenings. Just down the street towards the metro station there is a great ramen shop called Yo Yo, and right next door to the hotel is a pricey but outstanding niche bakery called Patisserie Aoki. If you do stay at The Five definitely try something from Aoki. Now on the the negatives. Small, very very small. Smaller than you can imagine, smaller than everyone says. Believe the reviews, then shrink your mental image by 1/3. We had a mid-sized room with a queen bed, and it was tiny tiny tiny. They do provide a small wardrobe but it's SO small that there is barely room enough to hang two coats, let alone a few shirts or dresses in addition. I could live with the small room, but the bathroom, and particularly the shower, was nearly unusable. I'm not a big guy (5'9\", 165 lbs) but even I couldn't properly shower because the stall is so small. I didn't measure but I'm sure it's LESS than 3' x 3' square. There is literally barely enough room to turn around. The pillows are also absolutely horrible, for ANY hotel, let alone a hotel charging these rates. They were old beaten up foam pillows the insides of which were nothing but tiny foam balls. It felt like sleeping on a bean bag chair. (The bed however was quite nice!) Also the amenities in the bathroom are less than what I would expect at a youth hostel. Plastic cups? And paper-thin ratty towels? Are you kidding? And, of course, no mini-bar as others have mentioned. For a hotel that seems to be so keen on cashing in (by using plastic cups and sh*tty pillows and towels), you'd think the proprietors would figure out they could make even MORE money buy installing minibars in the rooms. Overall, thumbs down for The Five. It's a nice idea, the design is also quite nice, but function should be be at a certain base level before you splurge on form. The Five seems to have sacrificed function so they can cash in on form. Not a winning formula for me, especially at such a price premium.

So here is my take - all in all I wouldn't return, but I should start with the positive - most of the staff is really nice and helpful! Much attention was given to detail, all in good taste and charm!!! This is what I looked for - and the hotel stood up to its promise. the problem? room size: ok - so I took a \"standard\" and one should be responsible for one's choices. but I didn't realize how small \"small\" can be. True - the price was good, but it is depressing. If you open the window curtains - people from the opposite apartments can look at you - so the room is kept shut dark most of the time. So if you think the hotel offers a good deal for its unique design, and you are looking at a standard room price - then in my wholly subjective view - it was not worth it. If they would pull together two \"standard rooms\" - you would get a rather adequate (although still on the small side) room. But splitting a decent size room into two is a bit of a ... location: a matter of personal preference. it's paris, everything is walking distance or metro. But still - it's not the place to go out of your hotel at night time and just be in the middle of it all (and there are so many venues in Paris that do qualify for that). finally on the cons - all the \"5 senses\" thing: too exaggerated and too much of a marketing issue. The design is very nice!! don't need to make it into something it is not... It is the kind of hotel for which i feel bad providing a mediocre review. They did everything right , the staff was wonderful, it is the kind of small hotels I like. But an expanded broom closet is not a room.

We knew ahead of time from Trip Advisor that the \"standard room\" would be small, but chose it because of the great price and because a standard room has one bed rather than two. (At least some superior rooms have two twin beds pushed together rather than one large bed and we did not want the two single bed arrangement.) If you care about having one bed, find out whether you would wind up getting two single beds pushed together if you book the roomier superior room. It may be that the only true large one bed is in the Deluxe room with the \"deluxe\" price. The standard room is comically small. The double bed is against the wall, and there is only two or three feet between the edge of the bed and the wall with the bath. The bathroom is triangular, with a tiny free standing sink about 9 inches round right next to the toilet. The shower is so small it isn't easy to get in and out using the folding door. It is the smallest room and bathroom I have seen in any hotel in 40 plus years of traveling. On a positive note, it did give me the idea of turning our tiny hall closet at home into a bathroom and gave us lots of laughs. It was hysterical trying to pass each other around the bed or in and out of the bathroom and we were constantly saying to each other, \"beep beep.\" Oh, I should mention that we were sad to loose our tiny one foot area at the end of the bed because it was the only spot to put down our suitcases. It truly is a \"cozy\" room for one person only. When we arrived, there was no bar of soap in the room, and the person at the desk said, without an apology, \"we ran out\" before finally finding a bar to give to us. We went back to our room the following evening to find that the room had no toilet paper at all although the room had been made up, and we needed to get a roll from the desk. So, although the staff was friendly and nice and happy to make dinner recommendations, \"service\" can't be given high marks with the absence of a bar of soap one day and a lack of toilet paper the next. Meanwhile, the place shimmers and sparkles with artsy lights and whimsical decor. Guests can get a choice of \"scent\" for the room. Unfortunately, I was allergic to the smell in the room. We heard another guest sneezing, saying she was allergic also, and she offered me an antihistamine. The staff kindly eliminated the aroma immediately when we said it was a problem. The Hotel is officially in the 5th Arr., but it is on the last street, rue Port Royal, before the 5th ends and the 13th begins. Being far from the Left Bank action was not a problem in that a metro is nearby and the hotel is next to a wonderful old cobblestone street filled with great restaurants and cafes, with character and full of life. The location next to this street was the hotel's number one good feature and almost reason enough to think of going back. It was a joy to wander down that street towards the Seine and then have dinner outdoors in any one of the many good restaurants before returning to the room at night. We never tried the breakfast as it cost extra and was double the price of breakfast in any one of a number of cafes nearby. Also, the breakfast room is in the basement with no natural light. Although the decor is New Age and interesting, the room smelled of cleaning solution and eating in the basement is not nearly as nice as outdoors at a cafe. We asked if we could change to a bigger room, and the hotel was fully booked and so change was impossible for all but one night. The room that became available was so expensive (although a bed swinging from the ceiling sounded interesting and we sure could have used any inch of extra space) that we decided to stick with the small room for one more night. Perhaps if we had a larger room we would recommend the hotel to a friend, but we wouldn't recommend the hotel as we experienced it.

Hotel very small and, though also new, but uncomfortable. Our room Suite was on a ground floor, windows in a court yard. A room very small and only one small window.

Is not present either sofas, or armchairs - to watch TV, it was necessary to sit on these beds which stood perpendicularly to a wall with the TV. Very inconveniently. The personnel makes impression very nonprofessional. There was a confusion and with settlement, and departure (the reception women could not make the invoice in any way, was mistaken). Breakfast in a cellar, in a close premise without windows. Very unfriendly and very slovenly woman at breakfast serves. A breakfast absolutely tasteless, we ate only in the first day. Shock for us was, when one of working women of hotel in for a breakfast collected on a tray a breakfast for someone from visitors - it was BAREFOOT, naked not too well-groomed legs to a floor! Appetite at us at once was gone. Somehow time in the afternoon (about 16 hours) we have come into our room. All in a room has been turned - beds are disassembled, the bed-clothes is removed from them (even it was impossible to enter). In a room there was a parlourmaid, it watches on the TV a soap opera. On our questions - that occurs - it did not answer. The woman from reception has come and has told, what will soon repair beds (why it could not be made when there have left the previous visitors? Us did not occupy in room till five o'clock), therefore the disorder. We have asked the cleaning woman to leave, as we needed to change clothes. She did not leave. We have asked once again, through the woman from reception. Cleaning woman all the same did not leave, and watched TV! Absolutely foolish situation - we are changing clothes, and she is siting on a bed and watching TV!

Second, perfect service and really nice people. Tanya and her team at the reception are perfect.

The last night we stayed in One by The Five, a luxury suite. Not only a luxury suite, but also a love suite: designed in a kind of modern baroque style, with two bathrooms, a budoir, a dancefloor (!), not to mention the up- to-date home entertainmet center, a little garden, and a bedroom that really makes you fly.

The bathroom was a great size and the lights and fixtures were beautiful. It was nice to have a separate little seating area with a great flat screen, also very pretty.

The door to the room is right in the lobby, a little awkward but convenient to walk the dogs . The best part was the staff!!

The rooms are indeed quite cute, but we spent more time marvelling at the resourceful use of the limited space in the bedroom and bathroom. The beds are comfortable and we did sleep very well. Three days is probably as long as I would wish to stay here, as the limited space means you are constantly having to move things. However the overall design is very nice and cheerful. The hotel recommended two restaurants Chez Marty (10 minutes walk away) and Le Bofinger which were excellent for service and food. At Le Bofinger we had the seafood platter for two and it was heavenly. Beware! We asked the hotel to order a taxi to take us to Le Bofinger, and when it arrived we was surprised to see 10 Euros already on the meter. Apparently the meter starts when the taxi firm receives the call from the hotel. I think this is very bad and really the hotel should have warned us about this when we asked them to book the cab. On another night we ate at a local restaurant called Le Petit Marguery but this one failed to live up to expectations. Although the restaurant was not recommended by the hotel, they do display their card. The food was fine but very expensive for what we got. Also the guy who 'waited' on us showed us almost no interest - prefering instead to chat and preen with the locals. He failed to keep our wine glasses topped up the whole night, and eventually when our glasses were empty I had to resort to wrapping my napkin around the bottle in the ice bucket and pour the wine myself. To cap it all he tried to charge us for two bottles of water when we only had one (at 7Euros a bottle + tax a total rip-off!).

On one occasion, during a heavy rain shower, I was offered an umbrella by the guy in reception when I needed to nip out to the shop around the corner. It's these little things that make a huge difference. TIP: There's a door outside each set of rooms. Close it over at night for additional soundproofing from the stairs. (I think perhaps the hotel management should consider keeping these intervening doors closed rather than propped open?) TIP: The Five Hotel is located on a quiet side street (Rue Flatters) that's not shown on most maps. You'll find it between Rue Berthollet and Rue Broca off Boulevard de Port-Royal. TIP: The hotel have a website for people who have stayed at the hotel: www.thefivespace.com It's got a lot of restaurant reviews and suggestions about what to do around the area. We only discovered this site after we checked out. TIP: There's a plethora of Asian restaurants within walking distance on Avenue de Choisy, however for genuine Thai food, you should visit Chieng Mai Thai restaurant, 12 Rue Frederice Sautin (Maubert-Mutualite Metro station). We booked our room directly through the hotel's website www.thefivehotel.com because they offer a discount (at the time of writing) if you stay three nights or more. I recommend this designer hotel for being arty, funky and the top-rated gay-friendly hotel in the Latin Quarter.

Location: 5-10 minutes from Les Gobelins metro - Gare du Nord is realistically a 30 minute transfer by Metro. Other reviewers have commented that this is the 'edge' of the Latin Quarter: it is, but the bottom of the Rue Mouffetard is five minutes away, with a strong range of eating options. The more adventurous can try the student area of Butte aux Cailles, 25 minutes walk into the 13th. The area immediately around the hotel is safe, quiet if a little dull - however contains one exceptional bistrot on Rue Broca - 'L'Ourcine' offers top-drawer French cuisine in an unpretentious setting and for little more than the pricer tourist fare. Estimated walking times: Louvre 45 minutes; Orsay 50 minutes. Metro times: Louvre, 15 minutes; Orsay 20 minutes; Eiffel Tower & Montmartre 30 minutes Room: Small, very stylish, well appointed. Five's rooms are individually and boldly decorated, with 'signature' art work in each room. The bed was well above average for the class of hotel, although very much a standard double in size terms. Clever fiberoptic lighting created a restful atmosphere at night. Bathroom again small, but powerful shower, L'Occitane toiletries. Best choice of TV channels I've ever seen in a continental room. Room was very quiet to sleep in, with the shutter blocking all external light if desired. Only downside was that the room was difficult to cool down overnight. Food: Didn't have breakfast. Would say it looks a little overpriced at 15e, couple of nice patisseries nearby which will do the same a lot cheaper. Note there was no fridge in our room, although reasonably priced drinks are available 24 hours from reception. Staff: Very friendly, very mutlilingual, unobtrusive and competent. Room was immaculately made up at all times. Overall: Some travellers like enormous, blandly decorated hotel rooms, locations on top of a transport link and/or right in the middle of the action. You can get this in Paris, and pay through the nose - but not here.

We did a fair bit of trawling around the internet and decided that this hotel sounded interesting, funky and something a little different. The hotel is tucked away in the Latin quarter of the city which is great for boutique shops and some good night life. It's still a treck into town though with pont neuf a good 40 minutes on foot. There is no subway particually close either so it's taxi or brave the interesting bus system paris has. We arrived early for check in and where greeted by friendly staff who kindly let us check in then. The first thing that strikes you is the reception/lounge, pokey but nicely decked out. This was a theme that was to continue... We where directed to our rooms, both on level one, 102 and 104, I was amazed when i opened the door to the room, unfortunatly it was not for the style or decor we where so looking forward to but the shoe box we where going to be staying in. Put it this way it was uncomfortable for two people to stand or try and do anything in the room at the same time, and i'm not particually the biggest fan of pies if you know what I mean. I immediatley thought that we must have been allocated the wrong room type as we had not gone for standard but had opted for superior, surely you should be able to swing a cat in a superior room? I asked the girl at reception what room types 102 and 104 where. Superior Glimmering was the reply. Shocked I returned to my room wondering how small a standard was! Dissapointingly also not mentioned on the website is the lack of a bar, so meeting point was reception. Despite the size issue there are a few funky light fittings and a lamp that smells, fabric on the walls. I could see the idea but just didnt have enough room to walk around the bed to check everything out. It would seem from some of the other good reviews that there are some good rooms but they are not 102 or 104. My advise to the hotel here would be to knock through the walls of 101 into 102 and 103 into 104 and make some decent sized rooms. I wouldn't go back and couldn't reccomend it personally, but if you are going to stay I would make sure you have a minimum of a luxurious room type, but then if you are going to spend E300 you may as well stay in L'Hotel and be blown away with 5* luxury! Sorry Hotel Five nice idea but poorly executed.

I am french, and my family lives in Paris, therefore I am used to Parisian Hotels. Location: Not so well-located in a boring street of Paris, the hotel looks trendy but in fact is a bit cheap (furniture, reception - not even a seat to complete their client form). Welcome: When we arrived (at +/- 13h00) the receptionnist informed us that the room would not be ready before 16h00... Then she pretended that this was written in all their confirmations. When I presented the said confirmation to her and she noticed that nothing was written regarding the check in hour, she said \"ce n'est pas bien grave\" (it's not that a big deal), which I found a bit rude (I am the one who decide when it is a big deal or not, I am paying the room, let me decide if I find it ok or not..). She pretended that they had to check a lot of things in the room and that it took time. Then I have heard her telling someone that you could choose the scent in your room (they use Dyptique scents-famous french candles and scents). She never proposed it to us but the scent was nice so I did not say anything. The room: it is cosy and comfortable, although it is really really small. The bathroom is almost inexistent and just next to the bed, therefore when one goes to the bathroom, it's like you in here with him / her. It's very very clean though, they offer L'Occitane samples in the bathroom which is nice. I was a bit shocked by a note on the table mentioning that you would be charged \u20ac 100 if something in the room was stolen or damaged... Not really smart to indicate it that way. I mean, it is logical that if you burn the carpet or if you steal something, you will be charge... General: The elevator is really noisy, and when someone in another room takes a shower, it's like it's raining outside. Apart from that the room is quiet at night and the bed is really comfy. But for some reason the alarm clock (by phone) rang at 7h30... I was a bit surprised that after the so called check of the room, they forgot that... The wi-fi does not work properly but when we complained about it the receptionnist (a guy) proposed us to use the hotel computer if needed, which I found really nice of him. Breakfast: it's a rip-off! \u20ac15 per person for an average breakfast. Everywhere in the hotel they pretend that the breakfast is marvellous and wonderful and delicious etc. They show off with Mariage Fr\u00e8res teas, but you can't even choose your tea (I had my tea served without any question; by chance it was my favourite-Earl Grey French Blue) although there are at least 10 different boxes of tea presented. The viennoiseries are really average and so are the jellys and other stuffs. The breakfast room is dark, small, and as cheap as the rest of the hotel. And during breakfast we''ve heard the receptionnist (the same as when we arrived) talking to the (charming) waitress, asking her very loud to clean the \"[--]\" (merde) at the reception... So classy... My general opinion is that to pretend to be a so-called trendy place, you really have to work on the quality and the welcome. However for Paris the price (\u20ac220 for the cheapest room) + quality is ok. The other receptionnist (a charming asian girl) advised me to call instead of using internet booking, because they often offer prices. PS: I will download my pictures later. I have to admit it was a bit difficult in such a small room to take good pictures...", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cCool, stylish design, friendly staff and near spot-on location\u201d", "Author": "Herit", "ReviewID": "UR8611155", "Content": "The Five hotel is small!

But who's complaining? The rooms are cool design pieces, most of them slightly different. There is a small plexiglass desk, plexiglass writing chair, a decent sized bed and cupboards and closets to last you the better part of a week. The bathrooms have internally lighted shower stalls, designer porcelain and are as clean as you would hope for. Again, the colours are bold, and the space is tiny, but everything is more than sufficient unless you are hosting. And why would you want to do that? Less than five minutes (really!) you have Rue Mouffetard, one of the most charming old streets of Paris, where you can absorb the ambience of what to us looked as authentic Parisian life, away from the Eiffel crowd.
