We complained that one of the bar tenders was stealing money from us by short changing us which was pointed out by another hotel guest. He then insinuated that we were drunk and to cover up what he had done, which was not the case as at least two of the party did not drink. Because the barman had been rumbled, the bar would let us in then say we were drunk after being in there a matter of minutes and we would be asked to leave regardless of what time of day or night it was, once even allowing us to order a meal in there and then when the food was bought out asking us to leave. The bar staff seemed to be very young. I liked the hotel and would have stayed again but they seem to victimise us after the bar episode so on this basis I would not stay there again and would not recommend it.

The Lenox staff handed out cold bottled water and snacks as some of us had not eaten dinner at that point and it was about a mile walk to find a restaurant that was not affected. The staff kept us updated as they received information. The Lenox restored power via generators before many of the other hotels in the area. They offered a fantastic complementary breakfast the following morning to ensure the guests' comfort.

However, the reason to stay here is a staff that has embraced service to a level that I had associated only with the very finest hotels and at a much higher price point. In fact, their version of service may be better because it was delivered in a very friendly and casual New England way.

Anyways, after enjoying dinner at City Table, we wanted to take advantage of the fireplace, so called the \"fire man\" to come up and light a genuine wood fire. I don't know what those logs are made of, but he was able to light a blazing fire with only a couple of pieces of newspaper. It was very nice. We were told to keep the glass doors closed for 15 minutes, but then we opened them. (There were still screen doors closed in front of the fire.) All was well. But WHOA! At a very inopportune time, a flaming log came tumbling out of the fireplace onto the carpet! (The hearth is very small.) Hubby had to jump up and grab it on the sides with bare hands and throw it back into the fire. That was a close one! We closed the glass doors again, but the room had quite a bit of smoke in it. Good thing the windows to the outside open! I love the idea of the wood burning fireplace, but they really need to leave people with a log gripper in order to rearrange the logs when needed or catch one that has fallen out. We had no tools at all. I had to carefully shift the logs with my hands at one point to keep them going. (No, I was NOT going to call the fire man up to do it.) Once I did that, the fire continued to blaze until midnight. The other issue we had with the room was that there was a ventilation fan that hummed away loudly 24/7. It was in the ceiling, and there was no way to shut it off. It sounded a little like someone running a shower in the next room all night. So that interfered with a perfect night's sleep.

Everyone was just over the top nice 24/7 and there were friendly faces all over there place. We had one small issue with the mini fridge in our room, but it was our fault for not calling down to let them know it needed to be fixed. The little door to the freezer part wouldn't close, so everything in the fridge was either frozen solid or in the form of a slushy.

I believe that if I am going to pay a premium for a room I should receive a higher level of service along with the room being above average. Service for us was spotty, a delay in having a room ready allowed the front desk to shine by buying us lunch. A further delay though understandable was not communicated us us and that off set the good feeling from the front desk experience. We finally asked for alternate rooms and after some conversation they were provided. It may have been the change of rooms because although we received the same room it had a number of flaws which for a premium property should be unacceptable. The smoke detector was missing, I called and I told the bellman. It was never taken care of during the four days we were guests. Holes in the wall where something had been removed - not for what bills it self as a boutique hotel. Having to repeatedly call for our bags - I was comfortable with them not arriving shortly after we moved into our room even though we were told they were on the way up. I was comfortable calling and asking when they might arrive. I was told the bellman was on the way up. I was aggravated when the bags still had not arrived and I started to get questioned by my wife and daughter. I was expecting and hoping for a premium experience and that was not the case. I called about what I thought was a noisy ventilation system - I don't believe anyone ever looked at it. We loved the location, restaurant service was very uneven, the doorman was great - the hotel just disappointed. To add insult to injury I receive an automatic e-mail from the general manager thanking me for my stay and asking me to rate the hotel. I was honest with my responses and even handed just as I believe I am here. I thought a quality hotel like this would at least respond to a critical response from a guest. It didn't happen. I like the hotel, I believe it could fix the issues so I called and asked to speak to the GM. There was no response so I followed up - at this point you have a right to say I'm the moron here. the GM's assistant finally called, set up a time for me to talk with the GM which I scheduled and then he never called. Several days later I had a voice asking to me to set up a new time. Enough said - I was terribly disappointed on a number of levels. It did not ruin the trip - it was one of those things where because I walked in with premium expectation and on a number of levels they were not met.

We booked a double room with a hefty discount on hotels.com. The room was on the small side, but had lots of period charm. The bathroom was beautiful and remodeled; we especially appreciated the soft towels and bathrobes. The Lenox has a superb location in Back Bay and is in walking distance to lots of shopping, restaurants, and the T. You get excellent service for a price much lower than comparable hotels in the area. We parked in the Prudential garage (~$25 for overnight parking) and walked over so we didn't pay for the Lenox's parking. I definitely recommend the Lenox for business travelers and couples.

I agree with other reviewers that the location is supurb for experiencing the best shopping that Boston has to offer, and as long as the winter weather is cooperative, puts you within walking distance of many charming and interesting attractions. Indeed, in warm weather, I've even walked to Fenway Park from this location. With a AAA room rate and mid-December hotel slump, the price was right. Extremely accomodating staff and classic (meaning not modern) decor, was just right for us. The attached City Table Restaurant is a plus, particularly on a cold and blustery evening. The noise level is a bit high, but the food is of excellent quality and the prices put it into the $$$ range. The upscale Copley Place Mall is just a few blocks away, and the shops, galleries and restaurants of Newbury Street are one block north. If you like to browse libraries, as I sometimes do, cross Exeter Street to the Boston Public Library. Just one night and two days like this can really do wonders for one's spirits. There was mention on another review of the $43.00 valet parking fee. That can be avoided by clicking onto www.boston.centralparking.com and printing out a certificate for the Prudential parking garage, which is just a bit further down Exeter Street from The Lenox.

On arrival in our room we were greeted with flowers, a teddy and a card from the staff congratulating us on our marraige. Within 10 minutes of settling down in our room champagne was bought to us. We couldn't beleive our luck, this was customer service on a level neither of us had ever received. The room was stunning, extremely clean and the decor was fantastic. The bed was huge and all of the facitlies you'd expect were available. On unpacking I'd discovered that I failed to pack my cufflinks. On the off chance that the hotel may have some I contacted reception and within 10 minutes a pair of cufflinks were delivered straight to my door. The hotel itself is amazing, classic decor and beautifully maintained. Both nights of our stay, before leaving for our evening meal we headed straight for the bar within the hotel, which is a more of a modern style compared to the rest of the hotel but very cosy and the service was great. We didn't eat at the hotel itself so can't really comment on that. Overall we had a fantastic stay at The Lenox, the staff were amazing and the hotel absolutely wonderful. Boston is a great city and we definately want to go back for a longer stay. After our experience at The Lenox I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else.

The room wasn't too extravagant, but we only spent the nights in, spending the days shopping and eating in some of the finest stores and restaurants in Boston, all along the Back Bay. The only thing I would caution about - and I think it's only because I am a bit hyper-sensitive to sound - is that the HVAC made a constant low whirr. This may not be an issue on other floors; We were on the 5th. Regardless, it is a minor issue but one worth mentioning. Also, while they inexplicably do not provide a water boiler or coffee maker for tea/coffee in the rooms, they are happy to deliver tea, coffee, or boiling water to your room at any time of day or night! Solas, the Irish pub on the ground floor of the Lenox was cozy, but not particularly impressive as far as Irish-style pubs go - if you want real Irish ambience in Boston, I heartily suggest getting on the subway to Haymarket and make the walk through Quincy Market to The Black Rose. City Table on the other hand had absolutely delicious food and very nice lighting and atmosphere. But the thing that really, truly shines about The Lenox is its staff. Every single person we encountered greeted us with a friendly smile with no sign of pretense. We felt truly welcome at every moment.

It is stately and charming, with a feel of Old World charm. I love this about hotels when on romantic trips with my husband, but the more formal nature of them give me reason to pause when traveling with kids. I can honestly say that after staying at The Lenox, I will no longer hold prejudice thinking that the nicer the hotel, the harder to bring children. I was wrong. We were greeted by three different personnel, all in uniform, ready to park our car, grab our bags and lead us in. This ALWAYS freaks me out as I have kids to unload, bags to dig out, and a backseat of who knows what to clean up. The staff were relaxed and calming, easily taking bags out of my hands and caring for us without rushing us or being aggressive (have had this happen numerous times at other locations). We all walked into the hotel composed and ready, not scattered as you can be left feeling when hotel staff pushes you through the door. After having scored a really nice room rate, and desperately wanting a quick getaway from home, our little family visited The Lenox Hotel in Boston, with no expectations going in. We showed up early and our girls were greeted with a complimentary stuffed animal, including an extra one for our niece (whom we decided to bring at the last minute). Are you kidding me?!? Our bags were tended to, and we were invited to walk about the city as the room was quickly prepared. They called us (about 15 min. later) to tell us they were ready. I recommend The Lenox Hotel to anyone - couple or family - looking for the easiest of Boston getaways. We were steps to The Prudential Center and shopping, walking distance to Newbury St. and the Gardens. We had no agenda, so walking around and seeing new things was an easy enough experience. The Hotel breakfast was delicious and our girls loved getting treated to fancy dining-in room service. But the best part was that all of us - even our young girls (ages 7, 5 and 4) were treated like royalty. The staff went out of their way to chat with our little ladies, making them feel just as important as the grown-ups. As a parent that has experienced enough hotels that treat children as less than human, even before they open their mouths, it was not only refreshing but a blessing to be at The Lenox Hotel. There were some discrepancies when it came to promised times as opposed to actual delivery ... but these things happen everywhere, and the staff at The Lenox more than made up for it in their attention to service on bigger ticket items.

Our room was clean and immaculate and I thought turndown service was a nice touch with yummy chocolates. The bathroom is a bit tired looking - something you would expect to see in a Hampton Inn (which I love but not at this price!). We had some drywall patching in our bathroom which was not painted and a weird toilet flushing mechanism where you had to close the toilet lid each time to press this huge round paddle. The toilet roll holder was so ill positioned someone might hurt their shoulder using it. It is not a soaker tub so you won't feel like taking any luxurious baths in it. Cheap shower curtain. Wifi is complimentary. After 3 days of no newspaper I called down to see what was happening and was told that it had to be requested. No coffeemaker in the room but they do have coffee and tea in the lobby from 6 or 6:30 and during the day they have bananas, apples and doughnuts. On the website they mentioned they had complimentary car service. This turned out not to be the case and they were quite evasive both when we called from our room and when we spoke to the concierge. The person who answered the phone thought we wanted to order a taxi and the concierge was very vague and was like well it might be available but you will have to come down and see at that time - we only asked once and after that response did not feel like asking again. Somehow the car became available when we were heading to the airport - we insisted on a taxi - the bellperson said well taxis are quite small and it will cost you the same (there were 3 of us) - the price for the Lenox's car to airport was $30 and our ride came out to $22 to Logan (it was Sunday though). Having previously stayed at the nearby Mandarin Oriental all you have to do there for car service is just say where and when you would like to go and they book it in an appointment book. The lobby was very very perfumed and fragrant which made me want to spend as little time in their as possible.

Lastly, the small fridge in the room would cycle on and off as well and was loud...absolutely impossible to sleep. When I asked about this the next morning at the front desk I was told that they would have somone take a look and see what they could do. The gal I spoke with I think was named Ashley or something and she (along with door/bag guy Peter) was very nice...definite bright spot of our stay. Returned to hotel later in afternoon and checked with front desk about our room as instructed, unfortunately, it was the gal from the previous day who wouldn't upgrade my room. She told me that the hotel was old and all the vents rattle so there is nothing they can do about it...but she did move us to another room for that night. This room was just as bad and had the same problems as the first; I got maybe 4 hours sleep in two nights stay at this hotel. I could not wait to check out and leave; I will never stay at the Lenox again and I advise anyone else who wants a good night's sleep to avoid it as well. Incredibly disappointed since I purposely chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews; my stay at the W the previous couple of nights was much better.

House keeping was excellent , replenishing eveything twice a day, although I found a 5pm turndown a little early and instrusive at a time when most people are resting or freshening up for the evening.

There was no info in the room as it was all on the tv hotel info which froze regularly and was difficult to navigate. The next thing was the room: now I don't mind spending a bit extra but in this hotel, I could only afford the classic room. Just don't. The room wasn't particularly big and far more suitable for one person than two particularly, as my husband succinctly pointed out, you couldn't go to the loo standing or sitting without being at an angle due to the wall being 6 inches in front of the pan-literally! The last matter was the noise-initially, I thought I could put up with the traffic noise. Then we found that we were on the side by what appeared to be a service entrance so each morning, there was incessant beeping from one or more trucks, followed between 7am and 8.30am by the slamming of doors in the corridor (we joked it began to sound like the 1812 overture every morning) from inconsiderate guests and as the fire station was along Boylston Street, each night was accompanied at least once by fire sirens. If I could recommend anything at this hotel, grade as much as you can afford!", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "traveljunkie36", "ReviewID": "UR118272757", "Content": "We recently completed a 5 night stay at the Lenox and had a great stay.

Out of five nights there we had three relatively undisturbed nights sleep and one room change. We had an executive king with a fireplace. The fireplace was not being used but the extraction system or ventilation method meant that there was a very strong vacuum whistling through an ill fitting cover. A phone call to reception advised that there was maintenance going on two floors above and this would be finished at 11 pm. Not the case. The next day we were advised there had been a photo shoot and as they had lit a fire in the fireplace two floors above that was the noise and maintenance would fix it. Not the case. A room move one floor down with no fireplace. Three nights reasonable sleep. However fifth night discovered that there is some form of distribution warehouse at the rear of the hotel, bangs reversing beeps engine revving. Originally thought it was construction going on, but it had been dormant due to Labour day weekend. I would say that the receptionists at front desk were pleasant and on every occasion offered us a free breakfast at the slightest hint of trouble. An offer we did not take up as it falls flat at 11.30 at night or 3am when all you are trying to do is get a good nights sleep. So our advice. Get a room at the front. Check it out for fireplace noise. The staff are obviously really used to complaints and there are platitudes aplenty which will no doubt surface in any reply by the hotel. We did make our views known. For a free breakfast, make a complaint, it's the standard offer.

So this was out first choice for lodging on a return holiday. The hotel itself was perfectly pleasant, albeit a bit dated in decor. You certainly can't beat the location or the lovely views from the upper floors. The main reason for the low rating, however, was the surprisingly rude service. We are not picky or entitled people, but three specific events upset us enough to complain directly to the hotel: 1. On check in, the hotel insisted that the bell hop bring up our luggage, although we offered to do it ourselves since it contained items the children needed fairly quickly, ie: diapers(!). It took 30 minutes, despite an additional phone call, to receive the bags. To make matters worse, as he was leaving the room, the bell hop actually paused at the open door and counted the tip before exiting. Somehow this seemed astonishingly indiscreet. 2. We typically saw at least 3-4 uniformed staff around the doors, but they never seemed to be actually working. We did, however, overhear several discussion about dates, cars, and levels of drunkennous - all harmless but not necessarily appropriate on a Saturday morning in front of small kids. And to be specific, none of the uniformed \"doormen\" ever actually opened the door for us. 3. As we were checking out, we pulled the rental car up to the front, where the valet offered to hold the car while we went up to the room -and wait for the mandatory bell hop to retrieve the bags. The process took roughly 20 minutes. Imagine our surprise when we went back to the car to load the bags, and were told by the valet that \"since we left the car with him for more than 10 minutes, he was now authorized to charge us $18 for the daily parking fee.\" We protested the unfairness, and he \"changed his mind\" but it left us wondering just what the intended purpose of the entire exchange was. Overall, the events left us feeling like the Lenox employees were more interested in tips and money than providing excellent service.

For the most part I relied on Tripadvisor to make my decision and, as usual, I am glad I did. After staying at the Lenox I now know why the reviews are so high and why it was selected as one of the top hotels in the world by Travel and Leisure magazine. This place is incredible and the neighborhood only adds to it. You are one block from Newbury street for shopping and restaurants. We walked everywhere except for Little Italy and Harvard. The service is outstanding in every way. We normally like more modern hotels so my first choice was Copley Square hotel, however, the reviews talked about the small rooms and average service and the price was hundreds more than the Lenox. Even though you don't spend all your time in the hotel I prefer a larger room. For all intents and purposes the Lenox and Copley Square hotel are right next to each other, so is the Courtyard by Marriot Copley Square so if you want to stay in this neighborhood ( Back Bay) then any hotel will do, and I highly recommend this neighborhood. Restaurants, shopping, walking distance to everywhere, safe, etc, this is the neighborhood to stay in. Anyway, the pics of the Lenox looked outdated so I almost disregarded the reviews and chose elsewhere. I am glad I didn't. This is not a modern hotel but it doesn't matter. It is well kept and very classic in every way. We were upgraded to a suite, which was enormous. The room was very clean. We will stay at this hotel again. The staff are very attentive to every need and request. One example, there was a very popular restaurant that my wife and I could not get reservations at so we called the concierge and he got us reservations at the time we wanted.

There is also a Lindt chocolate store right next store (too tempting!) The hotel itself is lovely and it has two restaurants on site (very convenient) - City Table and Solas. We went to both more than once. Solas is very reasonable and has a nice selection of entrees. City Table was awesome for breakfast. We ate there more than once, and enjoyed a full breakfast and very good service. For those who wish a light breakfast, the hotel has fresh bananas and tea/coffee available each morning in the lobby. In the afternoon, it's iced tea and cookies. This was a welcome, refreshing treat after walking in the hot sun sight seeing. We used room service twice and we were impressed with the service, the quality of the food, and the pricing (comparable to the prices in the restaurants). However, what really distinguishes the Lenox is the service. Every single staff member said hello and greeted us, at all times. We were always welcomed back to the hotel when we pulled up in a cab at the end of the day. If we had a question, every effort was made to answer it, even if it meant asking someone else. The concierge was very helpful and accommodating. The front desk staff were always pleasant, and they willingly changed my $20 and $50 dollar bills into smaller denominations on many occasions. They loaned us an umbrella on a rainy day (one of the many items they offer for travellers to borrow, and in some cases, keep). Everyone went out of the way to make sure we were happy and well taken care of. We did not have any complaints, but I am convinced that if we had, they would have been dealt with and rectified. The staff at the hotel want you to leave happy, and they direct all their efforts at making sure that the hotel meets all of your expectations.

My wife, 10 month old daughter and myself made up our party. The service at the hotel is very good indeed, even before we arrived, as I exchanged emails with the concierge team with regards to a late check-out on the Monday and arranging a car with a car seat for our journey to the airport. They were extremely helpful and very responsive, and helped in every way they could. We had a hire car to drop off at Park Plaza, so we dropped off our luggage at the hotel before doing so, and again the staff were ever so helpful and friendly. Our check-in was slightly delayed by a late checking out guest, and the hotel staff were ever so apologetic and arranged for our room to be upgraded. During this short wait, Jimmy the bellman (you can see a newspaper article on him in the lifts area in reception) had a chat with us, entertained my daughter and provided her with a cuddly kangaroo toy which still takes pride of place in her bedroom. Everyone was genuinely friendly, and not in any \"corporate, employer-required\" way either. Our room was very comfortable indeed, with a closet area for our bags and a large bathroom, and a very comfortable king-size bed. The travel cot provided had more toys for my daughter, this time for the bath and which she still uses now. Unlike many hotels, the Lenox is acutely aware that children of any age are also guests and clearly work very hard to treat them respectfully as such, and make sure their needs are met as well as their parents. As any parents knows, a happy child will often mean happy parents as well, so it's an approach many hotels could opt to follow. It's worth noting too that the Lenox works very hard indeed to be as green and environmentally friendly as possible, in all that it does in servicing guests, even down to the bins in the rooms being divided up into different types of waste and different types of recycling, which is only to be applauded. The hotel has an excellent location, from which you can easily explore Boston and stroll round the city, using the Lenox almost as the epicentre for doing this. The concierge recommended a restaurant (Stephanie's on Newbury) which was only a short stroll away, and we had an excellent meal there (the Ahi Tuna Tartare has to be eaten to be believed).

Free bottled water, while undoubtedly an environmental disaster for a hotel marketing itself as 'green', is extremely welcome when it's 85+ in downtown Boston. Likewise, free bananas and cookies are a boon upon returning from a day out. Staff are helpful and professional and the location is A+. Where it doesn't score well is in the 'noise' category: doors don't fit fully into their frames (the historic nature of the building, I guess) and you can therefore hear everything going on in the corridor, including idiots singing at 2am on Sunday night... Noise between rooms, on the other hand, is very well insulated. We were on the 9th floor and you can also hear shouting from down on the street throughout the evening. The air conditioning is effective but sounds like a 747 coming in to land. Likewise, older plumbing means that you are bombarded with a cacophony of toilet-related gushing every time somebody goes to the bathroom. Further, The Lenox evidently thinks it is wonderfully 'cool' and this can attract a very strange crowd: women on roller skates wearing neon gloves and a mini skirt exiting the lift with a suitably odd gaggle of friends at 11pm anyone? The bar is unbelievably dark: if you can't pick up there you're in trouble.... The restaurant looked great but we didn't eat there so can't comment on the food itself. Overall, a mixed stay. Too much of a clash between authentic and hip for us, resulting in an odd compound of elegance and oddity.

Excellent space for moving about with couch, comfy chairs, big flatscreen telly, fireplace, two windows and a bigger toilet. This hotel was excellent with very friendly and helpful staff, great location and good quality finishings throughout.

From the grand lobby to the nicely appointed rooms (and bathrooms), their fitness center and restaurant, the Lenox offers you practically any comfort and service you might want (ok, not sure if they have a swimming pool), without being obtrusive. I'm not qualified to properly label their interior design, but think chandeliers and armchairs while leaving out grandma. If you don't know Boston - this is one of the best locations you'll find. Just a few steps from Newbury St with countless shopping and dining options (many of them surprisingly affordable) it is also in walking distance from Boston Commons and even Chinatown or the harbour (the former would be a 10mins, the latter a 30mins leisurely stroll away).

The location is great because you're really close to the Prudential Center and Newbury Street. A lot of the cheaper hotels are much further out of town which is a shame because downtown Boston is so walkable and the location of the Lenox means you can pop back during the day to drop stuff off or have a nap before more shopping and sightseeing! It's not the cheapest hotel but the service is excellent, it's spotlessly clean and because it's an old building there are actually proper lights in the middle of each room! A real novelty after staying in modern hotels where there is NEVER enough light. I highly recommend the Lenox - it's probably not the most high tech or modern hotel in Boston, but it has real character and the staff are great.

I really hate to say anything negative about this hotel because it really is fantastic, however it is let down by some of the staff in the 'Solas' bar. They are ignorant, surly and the most unfriendly staff I have ever encountered. We had drinks and dinner there on our first night and the bartender was surly and rude. Not a very good first impression! The food wasn't bad so we decided to try it again after a long day shopping in Wrentham 2days later. We were met with the same rudeness from a different barman and the waitress was positively agressive! We were waiting to be seated by one of the staff, the only nice one we encountered, when my daughter spotted a vacant stool to sit on. She stepped over to get it and as she did so this most aggressive waitress roared at her to get out of her way, she had two empty glasses in her hand and was approaching the bar with them. My daughter was very taken aback. We continued to wait for our table, 30mins at this stage, then just when we were told we were next and a table became free, the aggressive waitress embarrassed the boy seating us, by sweeping in with 3men who had just entered the bar, and sat them down at the table. We had enough at this point and just left. It was disgraceful behaviour. I made a complaint though to the concierge and he went and got the restaurant manager for me. He was appalled when I told him what had happened as it is definitely not the way they treat their guests in this hotel. He invited us into the City table restaurant and treated us like royalty. He was most apologetic and more than made up for all the messing about we had. A big thank you to Micheal for making our night special and for showing us once again how truly wonderful the hotel staff are. I have to say there is a huge difference in attitude and standards once you enter the Solas bar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame as this hotel is otherwise faultless.

So I'm very familiar with the pros and cons of this establishment. Overall, this is my favorite hotel and preferred choice in Boston. Here's why: The hotel is independently owned by the Saunders, a family who obviously care greatly about sustaining the quality of the hotel and ensuring a consistent customer experience. This telegraphs through in many ways, especially in the dedicated attitude of the hotel staff and their desire to provide great service. Many of the staff members have been Lenox employees for years and you can sense their loyalty to their employer. There are other reasons to love this hotel, from the perfect location in Back Bay and the hotel amenities, to the commitment to environmental stewardship. City Bar is one of three dining options in the hotel and depending on the evening, it can be a quiet, intimate spot to grab drinks and a bite, or a hopping destination for 25-35 yr olds to meet up with friends. At both City Bar and City Table, an upscale, full-service restaurant also located on the premises, the food is good and not overly priced. In my opinion, there is only one drawback. I find the small fitness room a disappointment. The two treadmills are old, clunky \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dreadmills\" and there's not enough equipment to meet the morning demand of the hotel guests. I have to get up extra early just to dash down there and claim an elliptical machine, but sometimes that doesn't even help. I'd love to see the Lenox dedicate more space to the fitness room, replace the cardio machines and add even more of them, as well as expand the weight room options. Despite this, you can't go wrong by staying at the Lenox. It's a perfect destination for visitors to Boston who want to be in the heart of things with easy access to site seeing, shopping and restaurants, and then return to relax in a warm and charming hotel environment.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSmelly lobby\u201d", "Author": "Sharon1025", "ReviewID": "UR100805992", "Content": "The lobby of the hotel smelled from \"essential oils\" air freshener.

When we walked in last weekend, we were greeted, by name, by Meghan Murphy, a front desk associate.

Our suite had a large sitting area, dining area, a granite wet bar, glass doored cabinets with an array of wine and cocktail glasses, a complete entertainment system, built in mini refrigerators, luxurious furnishing throughout, a master bedroom with a fireplace, and a marble bathroom with a sunken whirlpool tub, separate shower, and lighted sink; the fixtures were in the shape of beautiful swans.

Getting out of the subway I was right on Copley Square, one of the most beautiful squares in all of Boston, --Trinity Church, Boston Public Library, Old South Church are all right there. If you walk alongside the library for a block or so down Bolyston St. you can walk into the Lenox and immediately relax in front of a fireplace with a warm cup of cocoa drawn from huge silver urns. You're at once comfortable and starting to feel pampered. Your eyes start to feast on the elegance of the place and you're hoping for early check-in because you can't wait to see the room. Yes, the room was ready three hours early. Amazing--I know how that happens once I saw that the maids were working late at night to make sure the rooms are ready and to attend to the special details of turning down the bed and adding a few chocolate truffles for sweet dreams. I loved the non-instrusive service and friendly staff. The room was a standard queen, --seemed smaller than a room I had stayed in at the Lenox a few years ago. Although small and the bathroom without a tub, it was more than perfect for me--nothing like a hot shower with the freebie lotions and potions, and wrapping up in the heavy terrycloth robe from the closet. I thought for sure there would be a coffee maker but there is only free morning coffee in the lobby. The room comes with a list of all the pantry items that guests can choose from in case they forgot something or even if they want a snack. Yes, mostly free with a few things that could also be borrowed or rented. The only negatives were that the room vents somehow carried the voices from guests in the rooms on both sides directly into my room, which wasn't great when both had invited friends over and were playing music. Someone did a flamenco for a minute and the rat-a-tat almost blew out my ear drums so I put in ear plugs I take on trips just-in-case (<travel tip). But the guests left and all returned to peace and quiet by 10:30 PM. However, next morning I also could hear a guest giving her credit card information over the phone...so beware. I ate at the restaurant for dinner one night--surprisingly good and the wine was superb. The next morning breakfast also was good--even the coffee was delicious. The restaurant decor is not like the opulence of the rest of the hotel--instead it is gorgeous in its own right,-- eco-friendly, simple lines and dark tones. The vases were imitations mini trees with peeling bark full of silver branches,--most original and exquisite. The Lenox for all the luxurious atmosphere is eco-friendly --in fact, in one of the desk drawers is a book about how to be a socially responsible corporation. I assume the hotel practices what it preaches--at least I noticed there was a wood repository for recyclables in the room, and the hotel claims to have lead the way in pushing guests to ask for clean sheets and towels only as needed.

I am perhaps one of the most laid back and easy going travelers you are going to come across. Give me a nice location, a comfortable room, and a decent hotel restaurant (if its too cold to go exploring) and I am a happy camper. We were flying in for a morning meeting and opted to come in the afternoon prior to rest up and be close and well rested for the meeting the next day. The check in at the Lenox was very quick and very straightforward. They were able to check us in quickly, make some suggestions about what to see in the area as well as were to eat if we were looking for something interesting. The hallways on the floors that have rooms are very interesting and very wide, it was nicely done with nice accent lighting which truly offered that \"boutique\" feeling, however the rooms themselves are small. It doesn't really bother me, as long as you can fit a King sized bed, a TV, and room for my suitcase I am fine, however I couldn't have stayed there for more then a few days without feeling like I was in a cage. The most disappointing thing was the bathroom, I kept looking around for hooks to confirm my fear that they simply converted a closet into a bathroom. I am not a massive man by any stretch but the space around the toilet did not make for comfortable sitting, and I kid you not I almost stepped into the toilet as I came out of the shower. The bed itself; solid. No complaints, I slept well, the alarm worked. However and perhaps this just me, I was a little thrown off that there was no phone on either bed side table. That is annoying for me but perhaps would be a non factor for many travelers who simply do not use the hotel phone anyway. The following morning however was when it all came apart. We had shipped a package to the hotel, which had arrived the day prior to our check in. We asked the front desk if they had received it, and we were told they did not. They insisted that hotel policy required any packages to be delivered immediately to the guest or handed over at check in to the guest. We were told several times that any packages for guests were left at the front desk and if it was not in their hands they had not received it. Originally we assumed it was a FedEx issue; We went to our meeting and apologized that the material had not arrived with the hope that the package would have arrived by mid morning, we called the hotel twice in the morning to see if it had arrived and they very adamant that it had not. We were finally able to reach our logistics department to get a tracking number, and it had been delivered and signed for by the front desk the day prior. Once we called back and explained it had been delivered they found the package within five minutes, I guess they actually took the time to look this time. Aside from embarrassment this caused at our presentation, the main reason why this was so frustrating was because no one took the time to look for the package. Three different employees insisted that hotel policy was to inform the guest immediately on receipt or during check in. They relied so heavily on this policy that no one bothered to even look for the package, which as explained took all of five minutes for them to hunt down once we explained it had been delivered the day prior to the front desk. This is an aesthetically stunning hotel; the curb appeal and the lobby appeal are wonderful. Its in a great neighborhood in the heart of Boston and very convenient if you are seeing the sites. In short; as a tourist this is not a terrible place to stay. However its very clear that the tourist is their niche, and there is nothing wrong with that. From a business travelers stance, this hotel simply lacks the mindset or the interest. We stayed at the Back Bay Hotel during our next stay and they seemed to be far better suited for the basic needs of a business traveler, so its pretty clear a Boutique hotel can be the best of both worlds; just not in the case of the Lenox.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent place to stay to see all of Boston on foot\u201d", "Author": "Dvbdmd", "ReviewID": "UR98838018", "Content": "Great hotel in the middle of bustling back bay neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants to walk to.

Such is now the case with the Lenox Hotel. This was the first hotel I booked via TripAdvisor's SniqueAway membership, getting an absolute steal for only $99 a night right in the heart of Boston. I've been to Beantown before and stayed at the Harborside Inn in the financial district, and since the Lenox was rated #1 I was expecting an even better experience. Well, not quite. The lobby was lavishly decorated but nothing I haven't seen before. I've gotten quite a few hotel stays under my belt now, and I've no longer become impressed by lobby decor as I used to be. The elevators here are absurd. Two/three elevators that move at the speed of a government employee who is just about to retire. I was on the 5th floor and was so aggravated by the wait that I just zipped down the stairs while others continued to wait it out. To my surprise, it was only three flights before I hit the lobby, and the people on the 5th floor were STILL waiting. Only a few days earlier I was staying at a hotel in Portland, Maine, and despite being on the 12th floor, those elevators were rocket fast in comparison. No excuse, Lenox. When I arrived at my room, I was surprised by just how small it was, and noticed there was a board left on the bathroom floor that was supposed to cover up the plumbing underneath the sink. How did the cleaning service miss this? The wifi also was pretty underwhelming. I used Speedtest and clocked it at only 250Kbps. Wow. Plus, the view from my window was also... indescribable. I can only surmise that what was outside was THE most enormous air duct I have EVER seen. Ugly and vile in appearance, you could almost hear the slow and subtle WHOOOOOOOOOSH as the fan rotated maybe once every 3 minutes, it was that huge. The bellhop/valet parking attendants were as friendly as you could hope for, while the front desk was also equally pleasant and accommodating. I asked for a different room to get better wifi and was given another room down the hall, this time with a better view of nearby Bolyston Street, and slightly better wifi (750kbps). Still worse than my cell's data speed, but this was the same speed I clocked down in the lobby so I wasn't expecting better. Hulu worked fine at these speeds, so I left it alone. As for the amenities, the huge LCD TV was a crowd pleaser, and this was the first hotel I found that boasted a Bose sound dock for my iPhone. Nice. The bathroom stall was old and not much of an improvement over a shower stall inside a men's locker room. Room service was also disappointing. $14 for a small bowl of macaroni and cheese? They will want to pick up the tray about an hour later, so if you don't want to be bothered again, just leave it on the floor outside the door. Or just forgo room service altogether unless you're desperate. There is a supermarket next door and a ton of places to eat along Bolyston Street, so you'll be fine. Overall these are very old rooms that I suspect are only being treated with minimal maintenance, with the finances being invested more towards the frills of the hotels, including the ground floor bar and restaurant. It does have historical appeal, but I've been in hotels before with a lengthy history to them and in my opinion the Lenox can do a far better job of maintaining the rooms while still preserving its heritage. Comparing my experience with the Harborside Inn, I eminently prefer that hotel (which did not even have room service) to this one. Mainly because the rooms were spacious, modern and spectacularly kept. I only stayed at the Lenox because they were $40 cheaper a night, and really, any quality hotel that's available for less than $100 is going to be a steal in Boston, even if it's not my first choice. As for parking, nearby Copley Place garage offers paring for $35 a night, but with no in/out privileges. You are better off paying a few dollars more for the valet, at least in this case. Bottomline, only stay here if you get an excellent deal like I did.

The reviews on here are warranted, it is a great hotel and a welcome break from the big chains that lack individuality. Room: we stayed in a junior suite. Good size, lovely comfortable bed to die for! But the room itself was a little dated and really felt as though it needed a facelift. No mini bar, just a fridge in the walk in closet. Bathroom again was dated, as was the plumbing...whenever you used the shower or flushed the toilet, there was an almighty bang of pipework...terrified me the first time! Food: we ate I'm the restaurant on the first night. It was ok, not wonderful. Service was very good however. Breakfast was excellent, particularly the fruit plate and pancakes... Front desk: Wonderful staff who make you feel incredibly welcome. Reception felt like a country house with a lovely fire. Concierge very helpful. Bars: There are two bars in the hotel. We tried to get into the city bar a couple of times but it was busy and given it's limited size and seating,we gave up and went elsewhere.

The first person to greet us was smiling and offered to help with our bags, and that wasn't even the front desk. I had arranged a week prior with the concierge to have a six pack of beer chilling in our room for my husband - sort of a welcome to vacation, lets not be grumpy after a day of travel treat - upon learning that this trip was for our 10th anniversary they gifted the six pack to us. Such a nice little thing to do. But it gets better! We went out for dinner after checking in and when we got back the front desk had sent up a bottle of bubbles and dessert for our anniversary as well. Such a treat, and so thoughtful! People and places just don't do things like that anymore. The building itself is lovely. We love staying in older places full of character and The Lenox did not disappoint. If you're looking for a great room in a nice area try The Lenox. Their staff is amazing, it's a close walk to multiple T Line stops, there are lots of stores and restaurants around.

First off, the rates were extremely reasonable considering the location and comparison of rates at nearby hotels. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly bellman who brought our bags into the hotel and took care of our car with valet as we checked in. Like everywhere else in Boston, parking is not free at this hotel. If you have never been to Boston and are driving or renting a car, be prepared to pay for parking anywhere you go and expected to pay top dollar. The Lenox offers valet parking with in and out privileges for $43 overnight. Yes, its expensive, but if you park your car in a public parking garage, the closest one to the hotel is in Copley Place and it will cost you $39 overnight without in and out. For the most part, I wouldn't recommend driving anywhere once you get to your hotel because you are going to pay at least $30 to park your car anywhere else in the city, especially later in the week and on the weekends. Unless you get lucky and find a spot at a meter on the street, but you pretty much have a better chance at winning the lottery. My advice is to either take the subway (T), or a taxi. There is a T stop right around the corner at Copley Square. I was greeted with a smile at the reservation desk and to our surprise, were given a complimentary upgrade to a Jr.Suite. The bellman then brought our bags up to our room, placed them in the huge walk in closet and informed us about the FREE bottled water in the fridge. That's right, FREE bottled water, and as much as you want too. The room also includes FREE wireless access. The room was great. A nice King size poster bed with very soft sheets and a down comforter. We also had a nice flat screen HDLCD TV, a large coffee table, small sofa, desk, with a very comfortable Herman Miller chair.These are like $500 office chairs and are awesome if you are there to do work which I did for several hours.The bathroom was nothing special, but it served it purpose. The bottom line, the room was clean and smelled nice. The hotel also offers a restaurant, lounge bar, and Irish Pub. I actually used all three during my stay. City Bar: Beautiful, Hip, intimate, great people watching, amazing cocktails, and you can also order food offered in the restaurants. City Bar can get quite busy on the weekends. I also had drinks and apps at City Table, which offers the same yummy cocktails as City Bar. The bar is pretty nice, and the food was not bad. I also visited the Irish Pub located in the front of the hotel to watch the MNF game which the Patriots were playing. The bar had a good crowd and the Guinness was properly poured. The hotel also has a nice fitness room which I used twice during my stay. For a hotel gym, it was one of the nicest ones I have used. Tons of FREE bottled water, headphones for the TV connected to the treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. The other thing I liked where the nice hoist dumbbells, and bench. CLEAN. The best thing about this hotel, is by far, the service. Our car was retrieved in a very timely manner, and the bellman always remembered us and asked us how we were enjoying our stay. Every time we walked through the lobby, every single employee would say hello and welcomed us back to the hotel. Yes, they were aware when we would leave and then come back. The other great thing is the location. If you like to shop, well, you are one block away from Newbury St, one block from the Prudential Center Shops which are connected to Copley Place. You are a brisk 10 min walk from Boston Commons. Its easy to find taxis, the T stop is a block away. There are tons of AMAZING restaurants nearby. You are a five minute drive to the South End which has tons of great restaurants! If you want to go to the North End, take the T. DO NOT drive there.

Everybody greets you. The rooms are very comfortable and make you feel right at home. The place just oozes history: from the wide hallways to the staircases, there is wood and marble everywhere. I did not try any of the restaurants but there are a lot of options available. The location can't be beat: about 1 block to the Copley T station and a short walk to Prudential Center. There is a Shaw's market a block away where you can get any food item you need. My *only* gripe with the room is that the bathtub did not drain water fast enough (may have been partially clogged) and that the toilet was the type that we used to have in school (you operate the flush by kicking the lever). The bathroom amenities were great, as was the free wifi and flat panel TV. There was also a Bose radio which I did not use.

We were starving and the concierge was busy with another guest. No problem, one of the doormen was happy to step in with suggestions for dinner in the neighborhood. Less than 12 hours after our arrival the doormen and all the valets knew my dad and were greeting him personally each time he entered and exited the hotel. We had questions about tours and logistics and the concierge was so able and informative, tours were booked and reservations made with no hesitation (none of that \"well we'll see if they can fit a party of your size\" or \"hmm, perhaps you should have booked ahead\") The fellows at the door hustled to get us cabs in the Boston rain; during rush hour! Eternal optimism. They made it happen! But the absolute clincher was the help they provided AFTER we left the hotel. We no sooner arrived in Cape Cod (a 2 hour drive), for the destination wedding we were attending, when my dad realized he left his suit in the closet at the hotel. A few phone calls later and the front desk staff (shout out to Christina) drove his suit across town to Cambridge to drop off his suit so a guest at the wedding could bring it with them. We had hoped they would put it in a taxi and charge it to us, but no they were concerned the suit might not reach the meeting spot so it was personally delivered to the meeting place by the Lenox staff. We are \"nobodies\" (polite nobodies who express our gratitude appropriately) but were treated as though we were VIPs.

The hotel itself is absolutely lovely - old Boston architecture and lots of character within the lobby and hotel spaces in general. The rooms were spacious, especially for a hotel within a city, and everything was very clean (even to my picky standards). By far the best part of the stay was the service - we have stayed in some excellent hotels around the world - but none come close to the service we experienced at the Lenox. When we checked in, the hotel was unable to secure us connecting rooms (we were a party of 8) - which, by the way, we were never guaranteed - Krista at the front desk was so kind and offered a free upgrade to the Judy Garland suite for 2 nights until another room could be found next to the rest of our party. The suite was fantastic - definitely a touch of old Hollywood feeling in the decor and extra touches (including full sized fridge,2 tvs, living area and a walk-in closet). In addition to the upgrade, the kids were given a large stuffed lobster toy each and then were surprised with a decadent box of cupcakes that were sent up to the room. The staff went out of their way to make the kids feel welcome (even providing a stroller when our 5 year-old complained about all the walking!) -and it was much appreciated! Even the small touches - like free bottled water in the room, and lindt chocolates on the pillow added to the feeling that this hotel makes great service a priority.

Our room had 2 double beds and was furnished to a very high standard, with a good en suite including shower. For 4 people including two teenage, appearance conscious girls, it was...well, cosy. We did not eat at the Lenox, tempting though it was. At around $20 per person or more for breakfast, we would soon have been bankrupt, but very close by the Prudential Center Mall has an excellent Food Court, offering a wide choice of meals at very reasonable prices. We ate there most days either for breakfast or supper, and most times the 4 of us could fill ourselves for around $50 including drinks. If your budget will stand it, do try the restaurant and bar grill at the Lenox..The menus look great, they are just pricey when you are in a family group.

I arranged this quick Boston trip with the promise that we would get an early check-in upon arrival. I e-mailed and called and was told they would do everything posible to accomodate us. That being said we arrived at 11:00 am and didn't get a room until around 2:00. I understand we still got in early, but was told that people had not checked out and that the room was a mess. After complaining they offered to give us an upgrade, which I accepted although we had already booked a jr suite. They also offered to pick up our breakfast the next morning, and I agreed. During our conversation about when my room would be ready, in all the misinformation, I asked how they could be #1 on tripadvisor and that I just didn't see it. I believe this is why we were offered the free breakfast and believe it or not, they picked up our dinner appetizer at the restaurant the concierge had booked for me before we arrived. So why am I complaining, I guess I just wonder if they would have been that over the top had I not mentioned that I knew they were the #1 ranked hotel on tripadvisor, and were they trying to get a great review. Also, when I went to take a shower that first night, the maid never left us shampoo and had to use bar soap to wash my hair, as I haven't brought shampoo to a hotel in 15 years, and I was already in the shower !!!

One thing to note is that it cost around $43 a night to valet your car and there's no chance of you finding a parking spot on your own so you are forced to pay it. I only wish we knew this ahead of time as we would've been better prepared. They were nice but wouldn't let us carry our own bags in and said it was because they were union and got a little rude. To us, it seemed like they had this policy to ensure they get a tip. We are not wealthy and work hard for our money so we are used to doing things like carrying our own bags instead of having to pay someone to do it. Also, there were SO many employees standing around at the front door and in the lobby it was very intimidating. The front desk were very pleasant as were the bell hops.

We'd made the reservation months in advance, and had reserved two junior corner suites on the same floor, with we were told was not a problem. When we checked in however, boy, was it a problem! The front desk person was quite nice and apologetic in telling us that we couldn't have what they'd promised, but the front desk assistant manager was pretty nasty...assuring me that they would never have promised such a thing, wanting to know who I had spoken to, and so on. It left a very bad taste in our mouths and was not a good beginning. Our rooms weren't ready so we went out and walked, came back at the appointed time, and only one room was ready. We went up to the room and waited and waited for the other room. After checking twice over the next couple of hours, and being told the room still wasn't ready, I asked to speak to the manager. He returned my call promptly, was extremely apologetic, and tried to move heaven and earth to accomodate us. When that wasn't possible, he sent champagne, candy and offered to buy us dinner. We declined the dinner offer, but did go to the restaurant he recommended in their Lexus courtesy car! As we were finishing dinner, he appeared at our table and told us he had taken care of the check! I've had a few bad hotel experiences in my life, but I have never had one that started so badly and was completely turned around by a single individual. The manager's efforts to make right their mistake ( and owning to the mistake) were really appreciated. He is a credit to his organization, and the tone that he sets is obvious by the way the vast majority of the staff handles its guests. The hotel itself is charming..on the historic register but nicely upgraded. Great location for walking and access to the T and shopping.

I walked through the door and down a tiny entrance way, which opened up to the decently-sized bedroom and average bathroom. In addition to the standard business desk, this so-called suite showcased just a small round table with two chairs. I would scarcely call this a \"suite\" by most hotels' standards. The bulk of the room was actually unused space. Other details also made my room far from perfect. The decor was outdated, without much character to rectify the situation. The bed sheets had burn marks from an iron, as well as several hairs. The towels were hard and covered with lint. Plus, the television was not facing the bed, making it hard and uncomfortable to view. Lastly, the room service quality was atrocious (see separate review). The hotel was not all bad, though. The valet was extremely fast and accommodating. The modern gym was equipped with several cardio and weight machines, as well as bottled water, headphones, and televisions. Each hotel room was gifted with Aveda beauty products and complimentary Lindt truffles during turn down service. Lastly, the location was perfectly in the heart of the Back Bay action, with easy access to anywhere in the city via T or on foot. Essentially, the Lenox Hotel has all the makings of a classic, historic hotel. However, they need to upgrade their furnishings and perfect the little details that set other hotels far ahead.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in Central Boston\u201d", "Author": "HotelBlogs", "ReviewID": "UR65993966", "Content": "I was dying to experience the 1st hotel listed on TripAdvisor in Boston and understand the reasons of past travelers. At checking, reception was very warm and welcoming. The lobby is also very much welcoming. My room was a standard one. Not the biggest room I have experienced in a 4 * hotel but still decent size. I had a flat TV screen with HD channels, a small bathroom with only shower. I also had a fridge in the room which I turned off during my sleep as it was making too much noise. Every day in the evening, you can find some fresh cookies and lemonade by the elevator which is a delicate attention. In the morning, in the same place, you can help yourself with coffee and tea. On my last in the hotel, I have asked if I could do a late checkin at 2pm in order to work in my room. The hotel said that was not a problem and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge for this. I ordered a burger as room service. The burger was served very quickly and was delicious with thin French fries.

Our room was spacious (apart from the bathroom which was not)...the bed was very comfortable...and when things were not quite as they might be, the staff always seemed genuinely concerned to put things right....even to the extent of the Bell Captain taking us over the road to buy a phone card to help us contact the UK after our own mobile stopped working (a problem we had in Boston and Washington...but not New York strangely enough!) The only irritation (a common one in US hotels in our experience!) concerned internet access which was important to us (for domestic reasons). Basically it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work in the rooms. Eventually we discovered the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own Business Centre and were able to communicate erratically with our son via webmail.

Apart from the main hotel restaurant, they are also linked with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIrish Pub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 next door which served simpler food, even if it could get rather noisy!

While the hotel has a great location the hotel itself doesn't match what I think of when I think of top hotels. For me a top hotel isn't just the location or the value its about simply being over the top amazing, great service, amazing design and comfort. So the Lenox has a very old charm to it, some people might feel that is really amazing and really enjoy it here. But for me when the furniture is old, miss matched and just not very functional its not for me a typical modern/high-end business traveler. Reason I gave them a average for cleanliness is NOT that they are at all dirty but in that the furniture is old/worn. So yes thats part of the style but it gives a sense of dirtiness even if there is no dirt on the items. Some people will absolutely love this style but just wasn't for me. This is also why I gave them an average on the rooms, but the rooms are good in they are big and top floor rooms have a good view. So the only area where I have them a poor rating and which they sadly deserved is in their service. During my stay I had a couple problems, they where: 1) I had made a request to have a clean toothbrush sent to my room everyday. Now that might seem odd, but I was having a major gum infection and don't like to re-use germ invested toothbrushes. This request wasn't remembered, had to reminded them several times and in the end I just gave up asking. 2) Room service really needs to figure a better way of dealing with things. As when they bring you the food they'll either come back in 1 hour and knock on the door asking for the tray back or call you doing the same. I just found this a little frustrating as I'm trying to relax in bed and unwind and have to get a robe on answer the door just to give a try back. I'd sure hope with the room rate I and others are paying they could buy a couple extra trays and not have to bother guests. 3) Now a case of I wonder what they will do in this situation happened. During my stay I had bought something from a local store. It came in a box, i took it out of the box, saw it wasn't what I wanted and put it and the box together with my bags as I planned to return this to the store. A few days pasted and went to my bags to get this item to return to the store, while the item was still there the box wasn't. I was confused and called down to front desk. It turned out that housekeeping had thrown the box out thinking it was garbage. But this puzzled me as to housekeepings logic as this box was with my bags and was new and nowhere near any garbage bin. So the wonder what they'll do part started. I didn't demand or direct the lady, I simply asked what should I do as I needed to return this item to the store. Her response was I should take the hotels business card and if the store didn't like that i was returning an item without any packaging that they could call and verify the story with the hotel. Now I rate this as a poor response to this situation, for me to have to go back to the store, give a story and may or may not get my money back just seemed a little put all the work on the customer. Had it been in my opinion handled better they would have apologized, taken my receipt and the item, given me the refund themselves and either themselves attempt to return the product or simply absorb the costs if the store refused to return the item. But sadly thats not what they did and in the end I myself just went to the store, said nothing and was lucky that the store unlike the lenox handled the problem professionally. So yes those 3 things might not be the worst things in the world, but they are not something I'd expect from a top rated hotel. Which is why I gave them a poor rating as to just ensure that these items are hopefully noted and addressed. I'd still recommend people to stay at this hotel if you don't drive, as if you drive the cost of the hotel really isn't a value point. But if you are in the train or taxi around, the hotel has a good location and the rates are lower then some of the others in the same area.

The Boston Common is about a 10 to 15 minute walk from the hotel. I wouldn't however recommend taking the subway if you have lots of suitcases for the trains can get crowded. I booked my room rather last minute, and was able to find a deal at the hotel's website for a junior suite with two beds. When I arrived, I inquired about the availability of a room with one bed, and was given a room that was dark and with a horrible view of the a/c units of the hotel. I returned back to the front desk and requested that I could be moved back to my original assigned room, and was then given a higher floor corner room with plenty of light and a decent view of the neighborhood. There were two beds and a non-working fireplace. The bed was comfortable enough (but on the softer side), and the Aveda bath products was a nice touch. They handed out Lindt truffles during turn down service (the Lindt store actually is one of their lobby stores). There is a Irish pub, and a bistro/bar located at the hotel. I dined at the bistro/bar one evening, and found the atmosphere on the darker side and rather noisy. Folks sitting next to me on either side had to speak rather loudly so that their dining companions could hear them across the tables. Service at the restaurant was hit or miss at times. During my 5 day stay there were many parties and groups arriving and checking out of the hotel, making it rather chaotic. It can also get rather noisy, but staying on the upper floors I didn't hear any of the commotion going on in the lobby or in one of the hotel's conference/banquet rooms. The hotel staff was efficient, friendly, and greeted me every time I step off out of the elevator and when I return in the afternoons. Plenty of bottled water available in the room fridge, and umbrellas at the valet desk during the rainy days. I spent most of the daylight hours at a meeting a block away or wandering around town.

I telephoned reception for each problem and, on both occasions, a handyman arrived at my room within a couple of minutes to quickly solve both problems. The hotel is located in the Back Bay area of Boston and, as the city centre is so easy to get around on foot, it is ideally situated. There were plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, and the Lindt chocolate shop underneath the hotel was very convenient! Because I was sightseeing for most of the time during my stay, I only ate twice in the hotel: once for breakfast in the restaurant; and once for an early evening meal in the Irish pub, S\u00c3\u00b3l\u00c3\u00a1s.

Maid service every day, and they make up the beds and straighten up even if you elect not to have the sheets changed. Room has small refrigerator with complementary bottles of water (2), which they refresh every day.

Room has an air purifier, a Bose speaker thing you can plug your iPod into, and a cd/clock radio you can also plug your iPod into. Aveda amenities in the bathroom. Hallways are wide, carpeted, and furnished enough to absorb sound. Our room was very quiet. Location can't be beat. For shoppers, you're next to Lord & Taylor and a nice indoor shopping mall. Filenes and Marshalls are an easy walk up Boyleston. Boston Commons is within walking distance, as are the local theatres (including Loews) and the T, from which you can get everywhere. We walked over to where the Freedom trail starts and saw all the historic places. Also took the T over to little Italy where there are a ton of Italian restaurants. Avoid Ricardos--the food there was one step below a Stauffer's frozen dinner. The hotel has a nice (but dark) restaurant with interesting food. The Parish Cafe on Boyleston is good, as is Legal Seafood (in the mall but we later found a location down on the wharf which would have been better atmosphere). Cons: The ventilation system is relentless and a bit loud. We couldn't figure out how to turn the fan down or off. I'm sure if we had asked for help we would have gotten it. The flat-screen TV picture isn't the best. It's one of those wide ones and it seems to stretch people out and make them look fat. But you aren't traveling to Boston to watch TV, so that's a nit. The makeup mirror in the bathroom is one of those on a little post that swivels marginally. You pretty much have to be sitting in the sink for it to be useful.

We booked an excellent rate through Travelzoo - $129/room on Sunday night and $139 on weeknights. The location was extremely convenient for our meetings, some of which were in the nearby Prudential Tower. Overall, I was satisfied with my choice of hotel. Service was good overall, though I had just come from a brief stay at the Back Bay Hotel nearby, where I felt that the service was superior - more genuinely and consistently welcoming and helpful. Some of the staff at the Lenox were marvelous, others (esp. the housekeeping staff) seemed to be going through the motions. One evening when I was in my room working, the housekeeping staff knocked on the door and asked if I wanted turn-down service. I said yes, so they came in and went about their work while I was seated at my desk working on my laptop. They gossiped to each other quite loudly the entire time they were in my room. It wasn't a big deal, but it just seemed a bit intrusive and unprofessional. Also, that one night, they left chocolates on my bed at turn-down, but on other nights, they didn't. One day they didn't replenish toiletries as needed, so I had to call to get those delivered. When I first checked into my room, my TV didn't work - it turned out that some cable hadn't been properly plugged in in the back. I ordered room-service breakfast every morning, and one morning, there was no milk for the coffee; on another morning, the OJ I'd ordered was forgotten. To give the hotel credit, all these problems were rectified quickly once I reported them. My room was spacious and very clean, but it had very little desk or table space. There was one very small nightstand, which was already crowded with a lamp, a phone and a large clock radio, so there was almost no room to put my own things there. The bathroom, while also very clean, had very little counter space. I spent some time doing work in my bedroom, and had to spread my work files out on the spare bed. The room lacked electrical outlets in convenient locations, so I had to ask the engineer who came to fix the TV to lend me a polarized extension cord so I could keep my laptop plugged in while working on it at the desk. Again, none of these things was a big deal, but just minor hassles. All the same, I was a little surprised at the hotel's No. 1 ranking on TripAdvisor. My south-facing room had a rather hideous view of the roof of an adjacent building, but it was very quiet at night - no traffic noise. Some of my colleagues had rooms with much nicer views, but they mentioned street noise being more of an issue, so overall, I was probably better off with my unattractive view. To balance the service lapses, I should mention that I also experienced gracious service from the Lenox staff as well. When sitting in the lobby waiting for a colleague, I was often approached by staff asking whether I'd like a cup of coffee or some water. Also, the doormen and bell staff were really helpful and efficient in summoning cabs, giving directions and helping with luggage.

The room was extremely quiet at night and I could not hear any noises from any of the other guests or any street sounds from outside . The large flat screen tv was terrific. While waiting to go out or before falling asleep, it was great watching the Olympics in HD. We dined at City Table in the hotel and my wife and I agreed that dinner was delicious and service was rock solid and professional. The Manager even took my son on a tour of the kitchen, which my son still talks about. The next day, we visited the Aquarium, \"Old Ironsides\" and the Science Museum. That night, we had dinner at the Summer Shack which was alot of fun on a cold February evening. After dinner our wonderful friend Danielle watched our children while my wife and I had a few cocktails at City Bar in the hotel. City Bar was stylish and my wife and I had a relaxing time enjoying our drinks sans kids. It was a pleasure staying at the Lenox Hotel. The Boylston Street location is fabulous.

What a pleasant experience! For various reasons, we have always stayed at the Marriott Copley Place , the Sheraton Boston or other Boston \"chain\" hotels but wanted something different this time. We live less than an hour west of Boston and enjoy going to Boston for a quick & easy weekend away. The Lenox was #1 on Tripadvisor so we decided to stay there. It did not disappoint! Upon entering the lobby, you will notice a subtle scent which actually was quite pleasant. Barely noticable and relaxing. The lobby is not large but it contains a seating area w/fireplace, entrance to City Table restaurant and City Bar along with the check in desk and concierge desk. We were in & out of the hotel the whole weekend and although busy, the lobby never felt crowded. Everyone, from our arrival to our departure, was polite & professional. There is complimentary coffee and tea service in the morning along with newspapers. The restrooms have L'Occitance soap and lotion- my all time favorite! Although the Lenox is not a \"new\" hotel it has been kept more than adequately updated and renovated throughout the years. Actually, the age of the Lenox is one of the things that attracted us to it. We LOVE Boston and the history of Boston and felt like we were staying in a bit of Boston history. That is fun for Bostonians such as us! We stayed in a Superior King room. It was a standard size hotel room, as we expected. We did not hear any noise from either outside on the street or from the hallway and heat is not noisy either. The king bed was very comfortable. The room had a nice sized walk in closet, refrigerator with complimentary bottles of water, umbrella, iron & ironing board, flat screen tv, Bose radio/IPod dock, clock radio/ CD player and the usual. The marble bathroom was rather small but efficient. The toiletries were by Aveda. In our opinion, the room was spotless. There is a nightly bed turndown with chocolates (Valentine heart shaped Lindt truffles!). The only thing that I can find fault with for our ENTIRE stay was the one arm chair in the room was not so comfortable for reading and could have used an ottoman, and it was a bit hard to finely control the temperature in the room. But, really, these were just minor inconveniences over the scheme of things. We ate dinner in the restaurant, City Table and it was very nice. Our server, Karla, was very friendly and efficient. We had drinks and a snack at the bar, City Bar and enjoyed that very much. We did check out the Irish restaurant, Solas, but it was already crowded with no open seats, so we left. The locaton of the Lenox is great. It is in a great location for tourists to experience & move about Boston. It is convenient to shopping, restaurants, and public transporatation. It is on the corner of Exeter St. & Boylston Street and next door to Lord & Taylor & the Boston Library. Lord & Taylor connects inside to the Prudential Shops & Copley Place. In fact, via Lord & Taylor, you can even connect to the T & Commuter Rail at Back Bay Station without ever going outside. Boston is known for it's over-the-top parking fees and the Lenox is no exception. Valet parking is right next door at the Prudential Parking Garage and costs $41 per night. That is the usual & customary rate for Boston parking. You can self part for a little bit (and I mean a very lttle bit) less but we felt that valet parking was worth the $2 or $3 more to us. You don't really need a car in Boston and I suggest that visiters do NOT rent a car while staying in the city if they can avoid it. Boston can be a difficult city to drive in and there is good public transportation. Walking is a nice alternative too. In the past, we have sometimes taken the commuter rail into Boston and left our car at home, but this time we chose to drive in. We never used the car while we were there. We walked or took the T everywhere. So , as I said, we LOVE Boston and now we LOVE the Lenox Hotel too! No, it is not brand new like the Mandarin Boston. But it is NOT old as in \"run down\". It is OLD as in \"historic\"- one of the grand dames of Boston! Boston is an old, historic city and we felt that the Lenox fits in perfectly with the ambiance of Boston and New England.

I decided to find a good hotel that was not part of the conference recommendations but near enough to the others. After reading reviews on several Boston hotels, I decided on the Lenox. The fact that it is a historic hotel and was listed as having fabulous service made the decision easy. My husband accompanied me to do some sightseeing, and we were not disappointed. They were attentive from the very start. They responded to e-mail questions prior to our visit quickly and clearly. We will be celebrating our anniversary this month, and wanted to make this trip a bit more special than a conference trip. To help us with the celebration, the hotel gave us a free upgrade to a corner suite with a working fireplace. The room was large and very comfortable - the bed was great - with a European style comforter to keep us warm throughout the night. The chocolates and turn down service are also a very nice touch. We were greeted quickly and efficiently at the door and were soon settled in our room. We stayed in a Chicago hotel in June. As a contrast, the Chicago hotel charged for everything -- wifi, bottled water ($12 a bottle!, etc.) all these were included in the room charge at the Lenox. We were very pleasantly surprised to see the room mini-refrigerator stocked with complimentary water. Our first night, we called to have the bellman come up to start a fire for us. He was friendly and happy to build a nice warm fire to make us more comfortable. In other words, our room was pretty much perfect. The staff at the Lenox is wonderful - from the desk, the bellman, the concierge doormen -- all friendly and very helpful. The concierge helped us plan out our places to see and gave us a VIP comp card for the Old Town Trolley.

President Obama was staying just around the corner from us in the Westin at the same time. Unfortunately we didnt catch a glimpse. I booked the Lenox on www.hotels.ie because they had a good deal on and after reading the reviews on trip advisor which were great. Firstly I got a better rate on www.hotels.ie than on the Lenox Hotel's own website so I contacted the hotel by email because their website states \"Best Online Rates Guranteed\" and it clearly has \"You won't find a lower rate online and available to the general public for the room of your choice. If you find a rate that is viewable and bookable on another website for the same room type, dates and length of stay, please contact us. If the claim can be verified, we will match it!\". However, I received an email from them stating that \"We are able to only match the rates seen on the US version of hotels.com, we are unable to match rates seen on the international websites. The international websites do often have specials that are available only to their sites and are not bookable elsewhere due to their volume of business.\" This was very disappointing and clearly a contradiction to their website guarantee. So I booked with hotels.com. When we arrived at the hotel I wasnt disappointed. The location was perfect and the staff were so helpful and friendly. They really went out of their way to ensure our trip was perfect especially the concierge who was always on hand to give us some tips and advice. The room had been set out for 2 people instead of three (even though we booked for 3) but the hotel corrected this immediately. The added touched like chocolates etc was brilliant. The only and I do mean only downside - was not having tea/coffee making facilities in our room. The hotel do provide complimentary coffee in the morning but it is luke warm. There is a dunkin donuts across the road for tea & coffee though and they open from early til late. The location is a two minute walk from Copley MBTA station and about 5 mins from Hynes station.

Our room was spacious and comfortable and the workout room was small but well-equipped for its size. Now the negatives. The room's heating system was extremely noisy and the bathroom compared to your average Holiday Inn, way below what one should look like at a hotel of this category. Plus, the toilet lid refused to stay up. In addition, I think a hotel that professes understated luxury should at the very least provide guests with a morning paper and a better coffee service than the one station they place by the elevator bay. When I booked I also requested a room with a view but ended up on the third floor looking over an ugly roof and a sliver of street.

First the good: 1. Great Location 2. Friendly staff 3. Good sized rooms for a downtown hotel in a city like Boston 4. Good environmental program Problems/ Issues that we had: 1. First problem we had was with the Vanity mirror in the bathroom. I touched it and it almost fell down. I managed to save it but it looked like it was just barely hanging on for dear life and all it required was a gentle nudge for it to fall down. We called the front desk and they sent someone from maintenance to look at it immediately. 2. After just one use of the flush, the flush got stuck and the water would not stop. My husband used his best handy man expertise and opened the flush tank and managed to fix the problem on his own without another visit by the maintenance guy. 3. Next day morning, the shower tub kept filling with water and the drain did not work. Another call to the front desk, who by the way were always very courteous and another visit by the maintenance guy and this was fixed. 4. The night light had a burnt out bulb which we had ignored the first night but told the maintenance guy of the problem when he was there to fix the shower tub issue and by the time we came back to the room after our dinner, it was taken care of. 5. Second morning, while getting into the shower, I opened the small complimentary packet which said - Shower cap and it was empty. I took a shower without the cap as I was in no mood to yet again place a call to Maintenance/ Front desk. All the above look like trivial issues but are an example of just not enough attention to detail. In my opinion a 4-5 star hotel would take care of these small issues so that their guests have an extremely smooth, trouble free stay with them. I also know that sometimes these issues can crop up in the best of the hotels, but when more than a couple of such issues come up, your experience is impacted negatively. We found the people who work at the hotel to be very helpful and courteous but found these small nagging issues quite troublesome. Hopefully, the hotel will be able to better take care of these in the future.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic hotel with friendly service!\u201d", "Author": "Krissy80", "ReviewID": "UR51711518", "Content": "I just came back today from a 3 day trip to Boston to attend a concert at the House of Blues and this hotel is fantastic!

I asked the reservationist if we should rent a car to drive to the concert or take the train. She said she would have the concierge call me to discuss options. Sure enough, Keith called and let me know that there is no train going to Gillette and recommended we rent a car. Had he not called, we would have relied upon a train that was not available. We asked Peter, the doorman, how to coordinate picking up heavy tailgate essentials (beer, cooler, sandwiches, chips, dip and ice) from Shaw's grocery store down the block, and getting it back to our car at the Lenox. No worries, says Peter! He coordinated Sam, the other doorman, to drive us in our car to Shaw's and waited on the curb while we shopped. We were in and out of there in no time, and on the road to the concert and the tailgate party. How amazing is that? I'd informed the reservationist that it was our anniversary trip and we were upgraded to an Executive King room with a great view of Boylston Street. Awesome! Bed was extremely comfortable, the room was spotless and they turned down the bed, which is a very nice touch. The nicest part was a bottle of champagne and a personalized note was left in our room upon our return from the concert. Classy! Tom, the concierge, was wonderful and organized our fantastic duck tour, which is a short walk from the Lenox at the Prudential building. Highly recommend, especially our tour guide, Hardly Davidson!

I'm more likely to be spurred to file a trip advisor report when I've been annoyed about something than with praise. However the Lenox hotel is one of those rare occurrences in life when you truly experience perfection. The location is ideal, walking distance to just about any part of town. I even walked (ok ran) to the Bunker Hill Monument from there and walked back from the north end in less than 30 minutes at a leisurely pace. And you don't even have to leave the hotel as you can dine and enjoy some very hip cocktails in a very popular lobby lounge where as a guest you'll be treated very well by the professional doorman minding the rope line. To their credit, at max capacity, the lobby lounge, called City Bar, is still refreshingly easy to navigate, and you should dress to impress. The last time I had stayed at the Lenox was when I was a very young child in the 1970's, when the hotel was in dire need of an upgrade. Well, I'm happy to report they did it, and it couldn't have been done better. Large, spacious rooms, extremely comfortable rooms, huge flat screen TV, Bose sound dock for your ipod, I had a walk in closet, a refrigerator with two complimentary bottles of water a day and a very well appointed set of bath supplies. The service made me check to make sure I was still in Boston (I can say this as a Boston native who moved away 20 years ago). Although you take your life in your own hands on the roads of Boston to get to the hotel, once you enter the the protective embrace of the hotel you'll be well taken care of. Starting with the very polite and efficient valet service ($41 a day) you'll be handed off to Jimmy Fisher, a doorman who's been working at the hotel since 1949 (yes, 60 years) who will make you feel like a long lost and adored relative. If you have the time, Jimmy will entertain you for hours with his stories of the movie stars and the mobsters that have passed through the doors of the hotel during his tenure and make sure he shows you the Jimmy Fisher Suite, which they named in his honor for such long service. I could go on and on about the service, room, overall experience, but instead I'll sum it up by saying I easily spend more than 120 nights a year away from home on business and during play and have done so for most of the last two decades. This hotel stands out as one of my top ten hotel experiences and shares a place in my personal hotel hall of fame that includes the Four Seasons Bangkok, the Pi Pi Princess Resort in Kho Pi pi Thailand, and Starpass Resort in Tuscon.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cStay Here!!\u201d", "Author": "thejollyfarmers", "ReviewID": "UR42309641", "Content": "All the staff were great - we were upgraded which may cause bias.

It was a block from the Hynes Convention Center and also from the Copley Station (The \"T\", Boston\u00c2\u00b4s major public transportation system). Also an easy walk to great shops, restaurants and 15 minutes from the Charles River, where we enjoyed the 4th of July fireworks. Newbury Street is charming and is 2 blocks away, with abundance of unique shops and great restaurants. But back to The Lenox: Outstanding service. I cannot say enough and will always be grateful for the staff\u00c2\u00b4s endless efforts to accommodate us. Upon arrival, we learned that with my friend\u00c2\u00b4s luggage had arrived with all of her clothes almost damaged due to another passenger\u00c2\u00b4s syrup that seeped from their luggage to hers during the flight (actually, we think it was cherry liquor!). We became aware of this at almost 10 pm upon checking into our beautiful room. We had arrived a few days ahead of our convention, and almost all of her clothes were practically ruined! This major cause of distress, after not sleeping for over 24 hours to take the flight from Venezuela, was easily relieved by Mr. Thomas, the concierge, who was kind enough to help us with the hotel laundry to solve our problem. She had clean clothes at 8 am the next morning, and we were also treated that night to two wonderful complimentary drinks that night. This wonderful, hospitable service is something I have not experienced even in 5-star hotels I\u00c2\u00b4ve been in. The staff is very helpful and accommodated our need every time we needed it. Team effort is something you sense in this fine hotel once you walk in the front entrance and everyone is polite and exceptionally friendly. Beds are very comfortable and they leave delicious Lindt chocolates every afternoon! Mattresses and pillows are divine! The taxi service booked from the hotel concierge was a van taxi, and my two friend and I paid $30 ($10 each) plus tip, which I think was a pretty good deal. If you have patience and want to save a few $$, you can take the \"T\" from the airport to Copley Station (you\u00c2\u00b4ll have to make a transfer to the Green Line), which is a block from the Lenox ($2 ticket). We took the \"T\" and it was fast and reliable and anyone will give you information at the airport if you need it. Nevertheless we had done a lot of shopping and had 2 luggages each, so a taxi was far more comfortable to go back to Logan International Airport.

We chose the Lenox Hotel after finding a great deal on travelzoo.com. We got a Classic room for $129 a night, which was a good price. Although the classic room is very basic, it was good enough for us to stay for a couple of nights - we weren't in the room very much anyway. Our room was small but nice and clean, with a Queen sized bed. The bathroom was also very small, with only a shower stall (no tub). But, my friends who were staying in the hotel had a bigger room, so that just depends on the style room you end up with. Also in the room, there was a fridge you could use to put drinks in, which included a complimentary bottle of water (BTW, if you stay here, there is also complimentary bottled water in the fitness center for guests). There was an in-room safe available, which is always nice when you're traveling. One downside to parking your car at the hotel is that it cost $41 a day for the valet. We knew that beforehand, but used it anyway for the convenience, but if you really want to save money, I'm sure you can find a parking garage that is cheaper per 24 hours - or consider parking a little outside the city and taking the train or subway in to the hotel. As far as location goes, that depends what you plan on doing in Boston. The Lenox is in the Back Bay section of the city. But, if you are familiar with using the subway system (\"the T\"), you will be able to get wherever you want to go. The hotel is very close to the Copley T stop on the green line. From the Lenox, the Prudential Center is just a couple of blocks away, as well as lots of places to shop (we didn't do any shopping this trip), and there are a bunch of bars and restaurants too. We walked to Fenway park from the hotel, in about 15-20 minutes (as another point of reference). The service at the hotel is wonderful! I can't say enough about it. From the minute we pulled our car up at the door, the valets and bellmen were so friendly. They welcomed us immediately, and the service and friendly staff did not stop the whole weekend. Any time we stepped in the door, off the elevator, or anywhere else in the hotel, there was someone there to give a friendly hello, help us with directions, or give other help. For any weaknesses you may find with this hotel, the service of the friendly staff will more than make up for it.

I had originally intended to stay at The Boston Harbour Hotel but when I telephoned they were a bit snotty in attitude and the price quoted went up between quote and confirmation, so I cancelled and I am pleased I did ! The Lenox is far superior in so many ways. The Lenox is a very nice hotel in a great location, especially if you are going to Boston for the first time. It is walking distance to all the main attractions, Newbury Street, Boston Common, Beacon Hill, Trinity Church, Copley Place and very close to the T stop for the underground at Boston Public Library. My room, a \"Double Double Deluxe\" was on the 7th floor, on a corner overlooking Boylston Street and Exeter Street. The room was spacious and clean, but a little dated in decor and just a little lacking in maintenance, but not in cleanliness. Don't let this description put you off staying here as it has an old hotel honesty and feel to it and super modern decor wouldn't suit this hotel. The welcome and service from the staff was extremely good, particularly the door staff. There was complementary tea and coffee in the lobby each morning, but not in the bedroom. Breakfast was care of Dunkin Donuts accross the street as the hotel breakfast menu was overpriced, as is regularly the case. Why more hotels dont offer a simple buffet breakfast at a fair price is beyond me. The other niggle I had was the bar in the hotel. It is totally inadequate in size to service the hotel. The thought of a quiet drink at the bar on an evening soon falls away when you can't get a seat as there are twice as many guests as there are tables and chairs. There is another bar downstairs, an Irish bar, but this suffers from the same fault. There are plenty of other bars to choose from locally so again, don't let this put you off.

Boylston Street in Boston is the heart of the city. My wonderful, romantic, precious boyfriend booked this hotel for a romantic New Years/30th birthday surprise for me. We attended a wonderfully festive and delicious 7 course dinner gala at the Top of The Hub for NYE, and spent two days enjoying the Lenox's amenities; we also took in a Blue Man Group show on NYD. We came across a few problems, however during our stay. First, beware of booking a Junior Suite: They boast having wood burning fireplaces, yet very few of them actually do. It was my 30th birthday, New Years Eve, (they were well aware of both!) and we booked several months in advance, yet we could not be accomodated with a fireplaced room. Strike one. The room was unneccesarily gigantic, therefore not allowing for proper climate control. The massive walk-in closet and bathroom were sub-arctic when the room itself was a smoldering 70*. Strike two. We ordered room service for breakfast two days in a row, bacon eggs toast and coffee for 2 people: $184 later, and one hour after eating (my fault) cold, runny eggs, I became very ill. I have been sick, with a so far undertermined foodborne illness (so far called a GI bug until my test results come back), still 6 days later. I contacted the hotel manager who referred me to the person in charge of the food and beverage department who never called me back. Stike three. The bathroom was clean and the sheets were clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was well-appointed. Thr free WiFi access and bottled water were pluses. The list of freebies for guests was impressive including bath salts and cufflinks to borrow in case their guests have forgotten theirs. The only reason I would not recommend this hotel is because of their ridiculously overpriced toxic food. I am not sure who they have working down in the kitchen, but they need to be fired immediately; I understand that food is a catch-22 at most hotels and restaurants, but this is their business!

On arriving at Logan Airport cabs were easy to come by and we paid $30.00 to get to the hotel which took about 20 minutes. The hotel had just been dec'd out for the holiday season and it was very classy -- we got a very friendly and proffessional welcome and our room was very impressive in terms of comfort. Not the biggest room in USA terms but had a big walk in wardrobe (which became handy!) and a 42\" flat screen HD TV at the end of a huge King size bed. The bathroom was adequate. The Lenox staff are superb and nothing is too much for them - they get 10 out 10 for this. The location is top notch being just off of Newbry Street and around 15 to 30 minute walk (dependant on route) to the furthest shopping area of Quincy / Faniuel Market. The Prudential Centre and other shops are right on the doorstep. There's also plenty of sightseeing within 5 minutes walk and the Duck and Trolley Site Seeing tours can be picked up just around the corner. Also loads of eating establishments to suit every taste are on your doorstep and an Irish pub which does good food and lovely Baileys coffee is attached to the hotel. The hotel lobby offers \"The City Bar\" which is quite a trendy spot by all accounts (locals queuing to get in on the Saturday night) but is far from being rowdy at all. The hotel resteraunt served up two very nice breakfasts (not that cheap but worth it) and the menu seemed nice for lunch / evenings but we didn't sample. Again the service was impecable. The hotel is also a pick up point for the bus going to Wrentham Village which is a must if you are visiting Boston for some shopping --- that large wardrobe DID come in handy! The bus costs about $35.00 each and Wrentham will take you a solid day to do (we caught 8.00pm bus back). There's a coule of grills etc there so no problem for eating. I'd recommend doing the Old Town Trolley Tour (tickets sold at Lenox) which takes about 2 hours and one of those hop on hop off jobs. This shows you what a nice city Boston is and gives you some good history information. We touched lucky with the weather -- it was COLD but lovely and sunny and most importantly dry. As a final bonus we got the use of the hotel car to get us and our overflowing bags back to the airport. this cost slightly more than a cab at $35.00 but door to door service in an A/C four wheeler with leather seats and complimentary drinks was worth it. We'll be going back to Boston once the credit cards recover and will DEFINETELY be looking to stay at Th Lenox again when we go.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Service\u201d", "Author": "hdmcc", "ReviewID": "UR21917762", "Content": "All I can really say is this place has the best service and most attentive staff compared to anywhere else I have ever stayed.

The Lenox is a beautiful combination of unique and well appointed rooms with classic decour that transport you back to how Boston was years ago and all the modern ammenities you look for in a hotel today. My wife and I stayed in three different rooms on three different occasions and are looking forward to staying in another room as soon as we can get back to Boston. The heart of hotel is the staff and the Lenox staff is the perfect balance between attention to detail and allowing for your personal space. When you need something they provide it promptly without hastle and are respectful of your privacy. The soul of a hotel room is the bed and all three of our rooms had large incredibly comfortable beds, with amazingly soft sheets, mountains of pillows and the coziest down comforters. The duvet fit the style of the room with obvious attention to the overall asthetic. Stylish and smart it is nothing like the cookie cutter hotel rooms of a major chain. The bathrooms were no less impressive, marble counter tops and wonderful showers with both overhead and detachable showerheads. My wife and I truly felt refreshed after a stay at this hotel. Again their attention to detail was refreshing with Aveeda bath products and luxurious terry cloth robes. had breakfast in the Azure restaurant and were blown away by the deliciousness and freshness of our meals. We had fresh squeezed orange juice, toast, coffee and the best vegetarian omelette I ever had, my wife equally enjoyed her eggs benedict and bacon. We had the same waiter all three times we stayed and he was a delight first thing in the morning, again attentive but keeping a respectful distance a combination hard to come by in hotel employees and wait staff. Our car was handled with equal care and respect by the valet staff who parked our car in the attached garage. In addition to all this you get wireless internet, flat screen tv, some rooms have fireplaces and the swankierrooms have personal home theatre and remote control blinds. When I go to Boston to see the sights and spend the night I want to feel like I have privacy, like I have everything I need in the room and that I am well attended to by the staff. I get all this and more at Lenox and do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for more from a stay in Boston than four walls and a TV. Lastly I will mention that the manager at the Lenox Ms. White went above and beyond durring a stay for my and my wife's anniversary when she offered us a free upgrade to a beautiful suite that was available in honor of our anniversary. I have stayed at the Lenox since and felt equally welcome and immensly enjoyed our stay there. Do yourself a favor and stay at a hotel with character and charm that is right in the heart of Boston close to all the shopping and events you won't regret it.

The room was very clean and classy. The bathroom was a bit small but hey, this is an old city! I spoke at length with three different concierge about sites, restaurants and transportation. All three were very generous with their time and suggestions. The stuffed Lenox Lions given to children at checkin are a really sweet touch! As I mentioned, we were sadly only in Boston for one night but were able to spend two days. The bellstaff stored our luggage after we checked out until we came back at 6:00pm to pick it up, saving the hassle of taking the car out of valet to load it up and put it back (and tip for the in and out!). Hotel location is excellent, in a very tony area with excellent restaurants and shopping just one street away (Newbury St.). Local sites such as Boston Public Garden, Boston Common, and Boston Public Library are all within walking distance. This hotel definately exceeded my expectations and I am very anxious to return to Boston and show my husband around! I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else!

Another very useful thing is that there is a Dunkin Doughnut right across the road from the hotel so my husband popped over every morning for our coffee which was a fraction of the hotel prices.

There you can stroll along the wonderfully wide sidewalks and experience Boston life, its people and shops. The Bostonians are so smart and they all seem to have beautifully groomed dogs. A 20 min walk will take you to the public gardens and on the other side of the park is the famous Cheers Pub. A must see with good food as well.

At the reception when we arrived at the Hotel (in the early morning!) they gave us an upgraded room at the same price. What a lovely and big room, with a fireplace! After the surprise of the nice room we experienced a fantastic extra. After a few minutes we entered the room a waiter knocked the door with a delicious cheeseboard, some delicious biscuits and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon on the tray. We loved it and, before tasting everything, we read the wonderful hand-written message that the assistant of the front office manager have sent us. We have carried this beautiful envelope back in Italy to have a good memory of that nice hotel. We used the wireless internet connection that is a complementary service (that is free of charge) to contact, with my laptop and webcam, our relatives in Italy using internet. The Hotel offers also many other free services that you could see directly at its internet site. The Hotel is placed in a perfect place. You can reach Copley place in 2 minutes, or see the magnificent London-like buildings (with lovely shops at their ground floor) in all streets near the Lenox. The metro is at 50 m. from the Hotel.

Everything felt luxurious and the thought that went into the furnishings was incredible. The Azure restaurant served an elegant breakfast at a reasonable price; the Solas Irish pub did a very hearty plate of simple but good food (bring your appetite). The City Bar was lively but elegant, the staff were very thorough on checking ID to ensure no under age drinking. The hotel was central for walking into Boston, or if you did not want to walk, the dooman would wave a cab for you, however the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was only one block away with $2 per trip. To use a Bostonian quote, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA place were everybody knows your name\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, unlike larger chain hotels were you are just a number. We did not want to come home & we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go again. A word of warning which was not any fault of the Lenox was a rogue taxi driver when we were on a trip, claimed to be our transport back and then tried to claim extra money and was very demanding.. We called the police and the Concierge dealt with all of it for us, ensuring that we got inside in the warmth and even arranging coffee for ourselves and three people who were not even guests.

There was lots of comings and goings through the lobby -- many people not guests but going to the bars. That's not why we were in town and, despite the hubhub, enjoyed our stay. Still...the old-fashioned presence of the Lenox -- very lovely, really -- belies the notion of it as one of Boston's favorite watering holes. Our room was one of the larger doubles featuring two windows and well over 400 sq ft. Not especially well appointed -- certainly could use some updating, and the bathroom was small. Strangely, the toilet seat could only stay up by being velcro-ed to the wall behind it (velcro provided). Good beds and very dark curtains. Didn't pick up much street noise and we slept so well one night we overslept a meeting the next morning. We booked our room on hotel.com and got a very favorable rate, much less than the advertised rate. For what we paid, and for Boston (notoriously expensive), the Lenox was great. Not so sure I'd say that, though, if I'd paid more. One of the Lenox's finest features is the location in the heart of Back Bay -- it's one reason why we picked it . The other reason is because we had stayed there for a night on our honeymoon more than 30 years ago. No real memory of it, but I'm quite sure it didn't have the lively night life then that it does now.

The King room was very roomy, wireless internet, large walk in closet with refrigerator, large bathroom with elegant fixtures, and large HDTV. Room was clean and the staff was very accomodating. I was called 5 minutes after check in just to see if I needed anything and if the room met my expectations - great service. The conference at the other hotel was overbooked and one of my colleagues needed to find another hotel. I asked the Lenox if I could move to a room with two beds and they were very accomodating - even offering to move my luggage. They never hesitated in their efforts to make my stay enjoyable. The double room was just as nice as the King room - it even had a fireplace.

She left additional supplies each day thereafter which was very thoughtful. The bed (and more especially the pillows) were soooo comfy and it was great to snuggle down and look at the snow falling outside! Everything was spotless and clean. The concierge, reception and portering staff - not to mention the waiting staff at breakfast were all very friendly, courteous and helpful. We didn't try out the fitness room (we were on holidays after all...!). However we did use the business centre to check emails etc during the course of our stay. The City Bar is a great place to wind-down after a hectic day and seemed to attract a hip happening local crowd - which added to the ambience. I loved it (and especially the cocktail menu..!). We had lunch in Solas, the Irish bar twice during our stay - which was great. The only fault I would have is the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. I find it hard to adjust initially when I go to the States and have an irratic sleep pattern. I certainly would have welcomed the option of making a coffee at 3.30am some of the nights.

The Lenox was in the perfect location for us as it was easy to get around most of the local shopping areas, and if we did want a taxi there were always plenty outside Lord & Taylor next door to the hotel.

The beds were comfy, the robes provided were great - as was the wonderful aveda bathroom stuff.

Also it is next to the public library and I advise that everyone goes in the library for their breakfast, it is the most wonderful setting I have ever been in, its like a roman paradise abd you would never know it exisied from the outside, please go in and have your bagels in the tranquil setting of the fountain and roman pillars on the bisto tables its truly fantastic. Also go up the Skywalk in the Prudential Tower again fabulous and not many people know about it take some ID with you though. We used the Grey Line tours daily to different states, like Maine, New Hampshire and these trips are worth every penny if you do not want to drive, well organised and plenty to see and do. We went to \\maine and went in a white horse and cart around the streets that no tour bus could get around what a fabulous tour really recommended. Again the coach will pick you up from you hotel and drop you off so there are no worries!!! Then hop on the tube \" T\" to Harvard University and watch all the students reading in the square, and look around the dorms what a fasinating place have lunch on one of the pavement cafes and listen to the students playing whatever instruments at the time are being played. From the Hotel you can walk a few hundred metrers to Boston Common and the Public Gardens beautiful on a lovely warm wintery day. We walked to downtown along Tremont Street tpicked up the Freedom Trail which is indicated by a red brick line and followed it all the way down to Quincy Market and the harbour side boats. It only takes about twenty minutes and it is a very safe walk. Have your lunch on the cafe at the bayside they give you a bleeper if busy so you can walk around until your table is ready very good food indeed. Quincy Market has all the street entertainers, lots of shops but I bought some gifts from the small carts which I later found half the price in the downtown shops so beware of that. I think the Back Bay area is the best place to stay as you are near the back bay river and you can still walk to the harbour downtown area to take the harbour cruises. You also have the boston common for walks etc. Finally I would like to add I was unsure as to if Boston was a safe city as you hear so many stories, it was absolutely 100% safe infact the safest place in America I was ever in and would definately be returning again for the next fall and i will be staying in the Lenox hotel again.", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cexcellent - can't fault it.\u201d", "Author": "foxbeliskey", "ReviewID": "UR10030733", "Content": "Had a great stay at the Lenox after researching on TripAdvisor.

We did all that and we did get a spacious room with 2 double beds at the 100 year old Lenox. Only downside was that they would not let us stay on a second night when we requested. The hotel itself is grand,service is impeccable and location is very god - near the prudential center,newbury street etc. Parking for our rented car was a high $42 per day.

While the Lenox certainly doesn't dwell on this fact, the location of this hotel puts you in the heart of Boston. For a city that wasn't built on a grid system as later U.S. cities used, being able to access all of the 'T' subway lines within one to two stops should be taken into consideration. Instead of reiterating all of the information that is printed in every tourist packet in Boston, I would also like to stress that Boston is a walking city and having the Lenox's location is invaluable. Being a professional chef I don't get many days off and I can't stand it when a restaurant or hotel charges too much for the view or location and doesn't deliver with the quality. I don't understand this at all. It is a given that people are going to come for the view, therefore reinvest some of that money into making all aspects of experience memorable. For example, having a great view of the Connecticut River and a flavorless overcooked $25 steak tends to negate the former tranquility of the CT River. The Lenox thankfully, DOES NOT fall into this category I just described. Being a pessimist I was continually won over by the little things, which in my business is what keeps people coming back. From the maid helping me with the door to the 'Navy shoe shine' I received from a very knowledgeable Bell Man. I bought my girlfriend some flowers and had placed them in a champagne bucket next to the desk in the room. When we returned from touring Boston, not only were the flowers kept in the champagne bucket (you could imagine a better use for a silver champagne bucket) but the flowers were placed above the television making them the first thing you see when you walked into the room.

The location of the hotel was also great as it was within walking distance of most attractions and if you were too tired to walk then the subway was good and only a short walk from the hotel.

Negatives: It seems that all a hotel needs to be rated 4 stars, is some Aveda hair care products. When we arrived, the hotel had overbooked the king sized bed that we reserved and gave us a room with 2 double beds ( We were able to switch to a room with a king bed the second night). The room itself was dark and faded. The mattresses in the first room we stayed in, were horrible and sunk in the middle. Pillows were uncomfortable, unless you like those pillows you buy at the price club that have absolutely no support for your head. Requests for extra pillows to be brought to our room were not met. No one answered the phone at the reception desk 2/3 mornings when we attempted to pick up our car, so we had to go downstairs and wait for our car. There was also no coffe maker in the room.

Great little Whole Foods type market in the neighborhood as well. Wasn't able to get a corner room but the front desk manager offered a wonderful room on the 11th floor with a fabulous view (finish line for the marathon was just below). Room was large with 2 double beds. Burned out light over the vaniety was fixed almost immediately upon request. Concierge kept up with the Spurs game for us! Was always greeted when I entered the lobby and asked if I needed assistance. Kate was wonderful and was lucky enough to catch her on last day at the hotel. Too bad for the Lenox to loose her! Even the house keeping attendants and room service staff greeted us in the hallways and wished us a nice day. Easy access to ATMs, the metro, and cabs - though the cab drivers were rude if you weren't spending $10 a fare with them. They hate driving you to the convention center. Didn't eat at the hotel restaurants or visit the bar - though Lenox is apparently THE PLACE to go for prom night dance.

I phoned down to advise of the mistake, only to be told there were no more rooms and they would move us the next day - no apology. I asked them to bring up some air freshener as the room stank - response was \"you could open a window\" That room, and the room we got moved to, still without any apology, had a strange layout - the door to the bathroom was right opposite the bed, meaning you couldn't fail to wake up your partner when trying to put on the bathroom light, as the switch was outside the room. there was supposed to be some sort of night light, but it didn't work in either room. The rest of the room was quite ordinary and unimpressive - not what I expected of such a hotel. The place felt faceless, soulless and miserable. One bar was so up-market, it felt freaky, the other was a plastic Irish bar with the character of a paper bag. The restaurant did a decent, but incredibly over-priced breakfast.

We were out a few nights until around 1:00 in the morning and when we came back the hotel was still bustling with party goers in the attaching Irish Pub.

The hotel was very unhelpful with providing a box for me to transport them home in. They said that if we wanted a box we shouldn't have had them delivered in a vase.
