The bed is as hard as a board and has the added bonus of the tops of the springs poking out. The shower head isn't adjustable and was pointed towards the wall.

Why can't they just put the TV on a wall or where it can be seen? 2 - the free WiFi wasn't working at all. This is pretty essential when on a business trip so I was pretty hacked off. This wasn't mentioned when I checked in as I may have considered not staying. It was the same last time too, so don't be fooled by the \"free WiFi\" stated on their website. This wasn't even available in the public areas. 3 - there is no heating in the bathrooms, nothing, zilch..... accordingly the bathrooms are freezing. I had to leave the door open all night to allow some warmth from the room to go into the bathroom. This doubled the noise from the traffic outside. 4 - is the noise which I appreciate isn't the fault of the hotel.

On arrival the Hotel is completely covered in scaffolding which i am sure is only a temporary measure, however we were not informed that work would be taking place during our stay. I attempted a check in at 13.15 and was informed in no uncertain terms that check in was 14.00 and after, No exceptions! The reception area and bar do have the feel of a Hostel (as previous reviewers have stated) and do not give the welcoming feel a reception area should. Once we had checked in (after 14.00) we were pointed to our room on the 3rd floor, the lift is a serious health and safety issue, all the flooring has peeled off and causes serious tripping hazards (especially to the elderly), the corridor to our room was dark and needed a little TLC, the room was just big enough for a \u00c2\u00be bed and nothing else, heavily stained fixings and a cracked sink were the most off putting issues, however the rest of the room was acceptable. The breakfast was a complete joke, a tray with rolled ham and processed cheese was the most appetising thing available, a bowl of what appeared to fruit was also on show, but as we had prepaid we decided to make the best of the food available, come 11.00 i wished i hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bothered, a upset stomach and the next hour spent in the WC kind of put a dampener on the day. Surprisingly the Hotel is quite peaceful at night, and the bed was comfortable enough to gain a decent night sleep, but we were awoken at 09.00 when we thought someone was trying to break the wall down from the room next door, after the bed started to shake i had to go next door and see what was going on, what i found was most annoying, the hotel cleaner was carrying out her duties in the noisiest fashion available, no point asking her to be quiet as she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak English, however a demonstration to her of Noise and how annoying it was seemed to get though (well for the next hour). Overall the hotel would be worth booking for a single night stay if you are intending to eat every meal out and only go in the Hotel to sleep, the majority of the staff were good and very pleasant.

I would also ask for rooms away from the lift as its one of those that tells you when it is going up/down and arriving at which floor etc. The rooms opposite the lift entrance must be able to hear every word. The bathroom's are also tiny (the width of a toilet) and have to have a sliding door as there is definitely no room to open a door inwards or outwards.

Decorated about three years ago the rooms are soiled, tired and basic compared to its peers. The walls are paper thin and as a result all televisions are set at a maximum volume that prevents even the most able bodied in hearing them. As for their perpendicular posture which means you have to lay cross ways on the bed to see them is a mystery to me? Must be their minimalist design philosophy! The shades in the room cut out about 50% of the light, and the noise of the busy arterial London road or drunken groups outside will guarantee to keep you awake so you will need to bring ear plugs (highly recommended) and / or blindfold if you like your beauty sleep. Cost cutting extends further to the AC which was installed throughout the hotel over the past couple of years. You will be excited to find AC in the room only to have your hopes dashed by the automatic cut out which seems to kick in every 20minutes or so switching the machine off (think about all those polar bears you are saving or better still the pounds you will lose in the sauna of a room that results!)

A buffet of cereals, fruit, toast, pastries, hot and cold drinks. It really filled us up for the day. The restaurant at night was also good; very quite, and the food was good quality when you couldn't be bothered to find somewhere else to eat. Location was excellent; Euston Square station underneath the hotel, and a couple of others within 5 minutes walking distance away. Located about 5-10 minute walk from shops and restaurant and about 30 minute walk to Trafalgar Square. The disappointing part about the stay there was that the staff weren't very friendly, but in the grand scheme of it all, not a huge big deal. We managed to get a good deal, paid \u00c2\u00a380 a night. Expensive (as London is) but it had all the facilities we needed and close to everything we wanted to do.

No table or area to set your bags, purse, water bottles etc. Note: never but never stay in room 103. After 3 days we finally got a little smarter and requested a room on the other side of the hotel (room 119) that the windows faced a small street that ran alongside the hotel. Still noisy but not as bad. At least we got some sleep the last few nights we were there. Our room had air conditioning but we knew that not all rooms have air available.

The Euston/Kings Cross area of Central London is of course a hotbed for hotels of all shapes in sizes because of the proximity of three major railway stations and two Underground interchanges. So named because it is right next door to Euston Square tube station (on the Circle and Metropolitan lines), this hotel is still classified by the AA as a bed and breakfast so it has a 3-diamond rating (equivalent to a 2-star hotel roughly). It is about 4-5 minutes walk from either Euston or Warren Street stations on the Northern/Victoria lines. First impressions of this hotel are positive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the whole place has had a wholesale refurbishment and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not meaning a lick of paint \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every room has been gutted out and renewed, with high quality bathroom finishes, new furniture, with all rooms having a safe, a hairdryer, television with internet access (chargeable), and an air conditioner controlled by a small console on the wall. They seem to have made a real effort to bring the place up to a modern, contemporary standard. The desk staff all seemed courteous, well presented and eager to help - I needed a pair of scissors to cut the cable ties off on my luggage for example, and the handyman was sent up within a few minutes with the requisite tool!! Although I must say a couple of the staff I encountered didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem all that friendly I suspect (as is often the case with London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reliance on immigrant labour) it is more their lack of proficiency in English than anything else. Best bit of the lot was the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201clike the rooms they have been kitted out with really high quality fixtures and could almost be described as a wet room. The shower was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c delivering hot water at high pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I could have stayed in it all day! I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think much of the cheap and nasty complimentary toiletries however. There is a bar/restaurant in the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which I only used once and it again has been refurbished and in terms of the fixtures and fittings it was comparable with anything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in a big-name 3-star establishment. The prices were quite reasonable too - \u00c2\u00a33.10 for a pint of lager is pretty good for a London hotel! What didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I like? Like most other reviewers of this establishment the size of the rooms is a big issue. All are about big enough for a double bed, enough space down each side to get in/out and a wardrobe. Hardly any room for the doors to open freely never mind basic things one would expect in a 3-star hotel such as a desk or a chair. The welcome pack was on the window sill and tea/coffee making has to be done on the floor next to the only vacant wall socket. Noise can be a problem. The hotel looks out onto the busy Euston Road, so bad news if you are on any of the south facing windows, but they had an audible pigeon scarer (the noise of seagulls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 distress calls) which went off every once in a while, also depending on which part of the hotel you are in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the noise of the elevator machinery bumbles through the fabric of the building almost constantly. But my main gripe was that I paid \u00c2\u00a3180 for two nights for two people in a double room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a390 a night which on the face of it is pretty darn good. But this was a promotional rate that I got via British Airways AirMiles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the full rate (according to the notice at reception) is a whopping \u00c2\u00a3130 a night for single occupancy, \u00c2\u00a3200 for double occupancy. Putting this in perspective there is an iBiS, two Premier Inns and a Travelodge within walking distance down the Euston Road \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are all big-name 3-star hotels and they are all in the \u00c2\u00a380-\u00c2\u00a3100 per room price range, and all have far bigger bedrooms and better facilities overall. In short \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what we have is a former 2-star hotel that has had a no expense spared refurbishment to bring it up to a 3-star standard, but the full rates are bordering 4-star territory and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have difficulty in justifying that kind of outlay. So overall then, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to say that for a small independent hotel this is a very sound choice and I would definitely come back again and as long as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t value lots of space I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth it as long as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay over the odds.", "Date": "September 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Notts", "Title": "\u201csmall but perfectly formed\u201d", "Author": "DanRNotts", "ReviewID": "UR20144404", "Content": "very adequate, not overpriced comfortable, conveniently located unpretentious hotel.

We went to our room which was very warm but turning the radiator off and switching on the integrated air con soon solved that issue. There was also a free standing floor fan for extra cooling. The room was exceptionally clean and about 5x4 metres in size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfectly adequate as far as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m concerned. The shower room was small but perfectly functional and immaculately decorated in contemporary fittings, it did have a very strong odour of faeces though but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing that this was down to the previous occupant and not a general problem because leaving the shower room window open for a few hours evacuated the stink and we had no further problems with that. The shower was powerful and hot if required and showed no signs of mould, leaks or inadequate cleaning. We took our laptop and were very pleasantly surprised to see a room safe that was big enough to store it as well as all our other valuables (see picture), how many times have you stayed in a hotel with a room safe that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even put your digital camera in? The room had a small LCD TV on the desk, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on this though as we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the room long enough to use it although we did use the free internet access which was great as it helped us with London fact-finding and map searching using Google. The windows didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open much but then again which hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s windows do? There was a great deal of traffic noise with the windows open but we were a mile or two from the West End, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly the fault of the hotel is it? Anyway, when we shut the windows the traffic noise all but stopped except for loud emergency sirens. We had a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep both nights in a very comfortable bed which was also clinically clean as inspected by my wife who is also a hotel manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no bed bugs here or worrying stains on the mattress! Breakfast was included on a continental basis which sometimes means tea or coffee and a croissant with ham and cheese or butter and jam\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not here matey, we were offered all we could eat from a buffet style breakfast which included 3 or 4 different cereals, fresh fruit salad, brown and white bread self toasted in a perfectly functioning toasting machine. There were chocolate, fruit or Danish pastries, tea, coffee (both hot) and cold orange juice. There may have been more that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice. GREAT BREAKFAST! There was no iron in the room so on returning from a day out we asked at reception for an iron and ironing board, only seconds after getting to our room a member of staff had delivered both to us. Finally, another nice touch was that we needed somewhere to leave our bags on the day we checked out because we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leaving London until 8pm so I asked if there was somewhere we could leave them, I was led to a walk-in safe past reception and we left them there in return for a cloakroom ticket and went to enjoy our day. We returned later in the afternoon, had a relaxing drink on their street-side terrace and collected our bags safely before leaving for our journey home. More importantly, this service was also free of charge. Perhaps since 2004 ownership has changed and vast improvements may have been made but we did not encounter ANY of the problems highlighted in previous reviews and I would not hesitate in staying here again should I return for another trip to theatre-land particularly as it set me back just \u00c2\u00a3164 for two nights (even the Wandsworth Travelodge was \u00c2\u00a3210!) One other benefit of this hotel is that it is immediately adjacent to Euston Square subway, 400m from Euston, 30 minute walk along the same road from Marylebone Station and a 30 minute walk from Leicester Square.

Because of that, although I did check out the reviews (not 100% favourable), we decided to stay anyway. I rang to enquire about the prices, then phoned to see if train tickets were available before I booked the hotel. I then called back to be given a totally different price. That sorted, with me booking at the original quoted price rather than the higher second price, off we go. To get into the hotel we had to enter via a wine bar round the corner due to refurbishments (not mentioned at booking). The wine bar looked fairly modern and clean, and was totally empty so no problem there. So through the wine bar we go to find reception - and as you go through the door you smell the smell that reminds you of the early eighties and the smell from the dirty waiting rooms in bus stations, if you ever had to experience that, it was far far from pleasant. The smell didn't go away. We get to reception to pay for our booking, to be told (Once we could understand the receptionist who had trouble with speaking english) we can't book in as no photo ID, and we needed either a passport or drivers license, of which we had neither as we weren't going to be needing them. No mention of this at booking. So now I was a little irritated - made the reception aware of this, to be passed the forms and asked for a credit card, they had obviously decided that the hotel policy of wanting photo ID was no longer relevant. We are given a room card, told first floor and pointed towards the lift. (Couldnt go up the stairs as there was a painter painting in the doorway) We found the room easily enough, well if you can call it a room. There was approx 40cm on each side of the double bed to walk and about 50cm at the end of the bed, between the wardrobe and tv table, with a stool underneath that you couldnt pull out and sit on as there wasn't enough room. The room was sweltering, even though it wasn't particularly warm outside, and it was then we realised there was no AC. However, we were going stright out to meet our friend, so we left the window open to air the room. We later returned to the wine bar and decided we would eat there, as it was convenient to the room, and the food was excellent. The drinks however, were overpriced even for London, but we expected that. We didnt expect that the person on reception when we booked in would try to say we hadn't paid for a round of drinks he had served us with while working in the wine bar that evening. However, I had receipts for every drink we purchased luckily, but it took half an hour of arguing to sort it out, with the *manager* telling me had had checked the till and the money wasn't there. He had checked the till at 11pm, we bought the drinks at 11-41pm) At this point we decided to go to bed, as the atmosphere of the evening was chilled to say the least.) The room was still hot despite the window being left open, but we closed the window to block out the noise of the traffic which was still heavy, and the noises from either roadworks or construction which was happening somewhere nearby. This we soon found, didnt help at all. Although the windows looked to be double glazed, they certainly made no difference to noise outside, and so was one of the worst nights sleep due to noise and heat, I've ever had. You can imagine that the next morning, we went to breakfast in the wine bar, which was crowded and hectic, had a quick coffee and checked out, as the heat seemed to have magnified here too. My advice - don't stay here unless you have to, the receptionists were all ignorant (4 of them) and spoke very little english, the rooms are poky (you should have seen the single room, you could mistake it for a coffin its that small) and hot. The fact that they are clean doesn't outweigh the other stuff for me, and you can easily find better and cheaper, so next time, I'll take more heed of the reviews before I book, even it means we have to walk 10 mins.

I can honestly say this is the worst hotel I have possibly ever stayed in, certainly in London. My colleague had to change rooms three times as the swipe pass system that they had on each door was not working and so they were issuing everyone with a door key. The first two rooms my colleague was given the locks were not working properly and she could not get in the rooms and the third room she was given (which we were told, several times by the staff, was the biggest room in the hotel) she then had the embarrassing situation of another guest (male) being issued with the same key and walking in the room when she was in a state of undress. Also, we could not use the stairs as you needed a swipe card to access the stairs and the swipe system was not working. If that was not bad enough when we returned to the hotel at 9.30pm after having a meal we found that there were road works going on opposite the hotel which we were not told about when we first arrived. The road works were being done at night to minimise traffic congestion so we had a pneumatic drill being used until half past midnight and then more road works going on until 2.30am. The hotel did not have double glazing and so what with that and the sirens going by every half an hour we got about 3 hours sleep before a very important work meeting. I can appreciate that the workmen have to do their job but we were not informed of this by the hotel when we booked the rooms. Also, I would consider that the least they could do would be to issue people with earplugs considering the situation but when I asked for ear plugs I was told the hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any. The staff were rude, unhelpful and really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem bothered. Rooms were clean but very small even by London standards. The hotel was central being ten minutes walk from Regent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Park and the breakfast was ok but I really would not want anyone to stay here. Our company have paid for the rooms and we are in the process of trying to get a refund for my colleague\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room but I would not want a member of the public to pay money to stay here.

Both the room and shower room was very clean with shower gel, shampoo and body lotion available, sky TV on a flat screen, tea and coffee, safety deposit box and hair dryer.

When we complained, we were told that there are no plugs in any sink due to health and saftety reasons, and non of bedrooms had mirrors.

There was no minibar, and no room service. The decor of the room was very pleasant and appeared that it had been decorated recently. The bathroom was really only a shower room, and also incredibly small, but pleasantly decorated. My biggest problem with the hotel was the fact that it was marketed as being suitable for the business traveller, when there were none of the facilties necessary. No wireless internet, no room service, no minibar, no laundry service. In fact the only thing that was aimed at the business traveller was the price! In short, the hotel room was pleasant, but the remainder of the hotel looked tired and dated. The accomodation was overpriced, and unsuitable for the business traveller.

More worryingly, there were no fire escape notices in the room. I'm surprised this isn't a legal requirement! Breakfast is served in the FAB bar area (dodgy name for a bar but still....). The food was nice if a bit limited in choice; cereal, ham, cheese, fruit salad, coffee and juice. The best feature of this hotel is its location. It is above Euston Square underground station, about 2 minutes walk from Euston main line station and on a main road....this also has its downside as it can get quite noisy, be prepared to hear station announcements etc late on at night and early in the morning!

To the hotel itself; it describes itself online as being recently refurbished in a very chic and modern design and the picture suggested a decent sized room with trendy decor. This, to me, was gross misrepresentation! Reception was decently decorated, though the rather cheap, shabby look of the entrance let it down. Despite giving credit card details to secure the booking and being informed that payment would be taken at the END of the stay, they made us pay on arrival. This is not the system I expect at British hotels and implies an atmosphere of mistrust (despite the fact that they have your card details already, so you couldn't \"do a runner\"). I suspect they want to take payment before you see your room! One of the first things you notice in all the common hallways and in the rooms is the same, light coloured and very badly stained carpet throughout. When reburbishing, surely this should've been one of the first things to address.... at least a dark carpet wouldn't have shown up the dirt! The room was tiny. One bedside cabinet, with a wardrobe on the other side of the bed. Cheap-looking melamine furniture throughout the room. No bedside lights, Windows that only opened 1-2cm at the top, which made it very stuffy and hot (and not on a particularly hot July weekend). The window blinds were so bad they were comical, when pulled, the cord and holder came off the window and nearly hit us in the face. Closer inspection showed that it should be held on with a sticky pad and operated the blinds with magnets... of course in such a high-use environment these pads had failed... so you had to stand on the furniture and hold it in place to adjust the blinds (what our position would've been if we'd fallen off and injured ourelves while doing this, I'm not sure). The TV only had 3 terrestrial channels and 1 or 2 freeview ones tuned in, and no indication anywhere of what , if any, charges were for other channels or internet. The TV screen bracket could not be adjusted horizontally, and was loose so the vertical position was fixed at a downward angle, so the screen faced towards the floor to the side of the bed. The complimentary drinks tray was finally located in the cupboard under the TV because there was no surface space for it. There was no plug socket anywhere near a surface, so the kettle had to be boiled on the floor by the bed. The tea tray only provided 2 standard coffee sachets (but as a lactose intolerant who doesn't like black coffee, I couldn't drink this as there was only UHT milk). My partner is diabetic, and no sweeteners were provided, which might've been a nice extra touch given the numbers of diabetics and dieters there are. The bathroom was very cramped and the sliding door left a gap when closed, to a maximum of 2 inches at the bottom... which is a little offputting, even with just a partner in the room... the layout meant that, through this gap, you could see a reflection of someone on the loo! so a certain amount of discretion was in order! The shower was extremely cramped, and the hotel boasted extensive complimentary items included. With the shower being too small to avoid getting hair wet, a shower cap might've seemed a reasonable addition, but again, they were overselling what was actually a very basic service. What was included were: Shower Gel, watered down shampoo, hand soap and face & body lotion. I can only assume that the addition of the latter is what makes them feel they can market themselves as offering more than the minimum, but the lotion smelled old and slightly off. Also, all of these were provided in bottles attached to the wall, presumably this is because it costs a little more to provide the single-use bottles you expect to find in hotels, and to prevent people pocketing anything they didn't use, as you could do with small bottles/packets..... the whole thing left you feeling that anything they provided was done so grudgingly and they were determined not to provide you with anything more than the absolute minimum. Though we didn't have any street noise from our side of the building as others have experienced, we did find that the soundproofing was awful, and you could hear footsteps, voices and doors slamming all the time. Breakfast was OK, for what it was... Continental: croissants (plain or chocolate), cereals, fresh fruit salad (quite nice) fresh juice and toast you had to make yourself with jams, honey, marmalade, cheese & ham. Coffee was fresh brewed in thermos jugs but not piping hot. To be honest, I don't really like continental breakfasts, as a non-milk drinker I'm very restricted anyway. In a UK hotel, I want a full english breakfast. On our 2nd morning we forgot my partner's sweeteners so I asked if they had any and we were given some... it was great that they had them, but not impressed that they weren't put out. One other personal issue which did not endear the place to me was that it chose to be a completely no-smoking hotel. Legally, hotel bedrooms can permit smoking. If the hotel had been as nice as marketed, I might've accepted this as a rule to maintain the pleasant decor and furnishings, but as it was very hostel-like and the carpets in such an appalling state, I struggled to understand their decision not to have a few smoking rooms (I'm fully appreciative that many guests might not want to follow a smoker into a room, and so I am quite happy to accept that a place may have just a few reserved for smokers and the rest smoke-free). To add insult to injury, I dutifully observed the smoking ban, and then we got a call after coming out of the shower to tell us our smoke alarm had been triggered (no sign of this in our room, we can only assume that it was set off by the steam in the very cramped space)... I got the distinct impression there was a suspicion, and veiled accusation, that we had been smoking in there!", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms.
