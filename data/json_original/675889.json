It is a fair distance from the nearest Metro (around a 20 odd minute walk). If you want to fully experience Madrid a first time, I'd advise skipping this place. HOWEVER... If you've seen enough and want to escape the city at the end of every day, this is a nice place to stay. Quiet, clean and nice service. We stayed in the 5th building, 5th floor and though the view wasn't choice, the room was fantastic; with double bed, seperate setating and kitching area it was more than enough space. For families, it is idea as there are more than enough facilities in or around the site. If your a young traveller or want the lifestyle, this is not the right place.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDump\u201d", "Author": "LeeMelbourn", "ReviewID": "UR117585300", "Content": "This complex is basically miles from anywhere and on an industrial estate. It\u2019s quite hard to find in the dark and wasn\u2019t listed on my GPS. The site is pretty much a dump and not maintained well at all. Only one of the swimming pools was open, the other had green water and rubbish in and the third one outside reception completely empty. The pool which is not heated and freezing only opens at midday. The lift was faulty and kept slamming the door on you or not opening at all. There were windows hanging off, light sockets hanging off and cobwebs everywhere. The actual apartment was fairly modern and a good standard apart from the bathroom which was cracked, old and dysfunctional. The bar closes at 11pm and doesn\u2019t even open Sunday afternoon. There is no atmosphere or entertainment. The food is very expensive and basic. I went to reception to ask for leaflets on what to do in Madrid and they said they do not have any! They charge you 6 Euro a day to park but some people just park outside the hotel on the road as it\u2019s free. Security was not an issue and was good. There are no utensils or even plates in the apartment you have to rent them! You have to pay an additional cost if you want your apartment cleaned. It\u2019s not all tourists and many residents live here but have dogs so every night dogs would bark for hours. These apartments are cheap but really I would not recommend them. Spend a bit more and stay closer to the action. It\u2019s not terrible by any means but just not great.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaga, Spain", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here!\u201d", "Author": "Kym W", "ReviewID": "UR117274951", "Content": "This was one of the worst places I have stayed in.

Value for money, no doubt. Metro is like 15-20 minutes walk away. From the hotel to Madrid Centre it takes like 40 minutes.

When you rent kitchenware you don't get knifes, spoon e.g. Also the staff is not speaking that good english.

So we went prepared. The apartaments are very nice, big, good kitchen, good bed. The bathroom is great. You have to \"rent\" the kitchen equipments, but it's refundable. There's a great supermarket nearby and a place to get fresh fruits too. Overall it's a good place to stay, the only problem I had was with the location. It's quite far from the subway station, you have to walk a good 15-20 minutes. On the first days it's ok, but we had already gone to Rome and we were a bit tired. Another problem was the internet. Very expensive and there's no place nearby to access. I had to use payphone to call Brazil.

The only reason I chose to stay here was that they offered really good room rates when I checked - 40 euros a night for 2 people (20 euros per person - that's even cheaper than a hostel!). The pros of staying here: good value for money, very spacious and reasonably clean rooms, well-equipped with a flat screen TV, fridge, a sofa set, a kitchenette, a comfortable double bed, 1 WC, 1 three-piece bathroom, fresh towels and linen, complimentary shampoo - just like any other average hotels. There is also a supermarket closeby. Staff were not particularly friendly but good enough. The cons: it is very far from the city centre which i suppose is fair enough considering the room rates, but it is not as close to the metro stop as mentioned, probably have to walk more than 15 minutes. It is located in a rather dodgy area - definitely don't recommend coming back late at night unless travelling in a group. The swimming pools were disgusting. I know they were not open for use when we went but they definitely were not great sights.

This is not a hotel, at best self catering apartments, but in reality it is a housing block with people living there and a few rooms available for hire. Breakfast was included, but you really wouldn't want to eat most of it, and as for the swimming pool, well it had three! All closed, filthy and seemingly in the carpark! (See photo). Room was clean and well appointed (for a self catering apartment) with a kitchen, good bathroom etc, but did smell strongly of cabbage! The staff refused to allow us to move room, so it was windows wide open (which are totally un-child friendly as they open as wide as you like and we were on the 4th floor!) Does have a \"concierge\" though, well a man in a grubby port-a-cabin by the entrance, still don't really know what he did! Location - dire! Middle of an industrial estate long way from the metro, and not somewhere you would want to walk through in the evening! (Photo again) That said it was cheap, but we only managed one night (out of three) checked out, and moved to a 4* in the centre of town, worth every penny and made the holiday! Simply - Don't!
