Due to the construction on 10th avenue, the driver had to park a couple blocks away but a short walk to the hotel was a breeze. Checking in and out was quick and painless. Jose was very welcoming, informative and sets an excellent standard for the hotel. I ended up extended my stay. The ladies at the front desk were great as well. The room was fairly large and modern. The endless supply of extremely hot water was a plus. The sun deck on the roof top was an excellent place to get some sun and absorb the panoramic view of the beach. The hotel offers complimentary continental breakfast and beach towels. Also, free wifi at the breakfast area and pool. Although I did not get a chance to try the breakfast, I saw the same faces enjoying their meals in passing.

My wife and I stayed some days in Cancun but we also wanted to enjoy Playa del Carmen and made the reservation with little time in advance and we only found this place at a reasonable price (95 usd/night). We arrived at night and it was difficult to find access to the hotel due to streets repairs. I was angry for this and later I was not supposed to be able to live the rented car at the hotel because they have not that service.

Well, I take that back, there were one or two nights where the AC would have been welcomed. It was freaking hot there this year. It's quiet there and guests are expected to be quiet, too. No pool, but you can sit or lie out in the courtyard for some sun, reading, whatever. You're in the middle of everything. It completely rocks.
