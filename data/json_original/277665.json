With a sofa, table and desk, there really was space to spread out and relax, so it's a pity that I was away for much of my stay. The breakfast pack was reasonable value at $10, and there are charge-back options from some local cafes. On the downside, there is an annoying low step into the bathroom, which I'd guess has bruised a few toes over time. It also took some time for the shower to warm up. However, it makes a good base for the Darling Harbour area, and is within easy walking distance of much of central Sydney.

It was a walk from Darling Harbour itself but it was right in the heart of China Town and we loved it. It was just like being in Singapore, everyone was really friendly and the food courts offered plenty for our fussy 3 year old and happy 20 month old to eat at a reasonable price. We enjoyed the Chinese gardens which are a must with children as you can feed the carp with food from the tea house shop for $1. The hotel was nothing majorly special but it was clean, quite modern, easy to get to and the rooms were big enough to hide the cots in the corner so we could still read without the children being disturbed by the light on.

The small kitchenette was handy and the amenities were adequate (flat screen tv, stereo, dvd player, small fridge). The balcony overlooked Chinatown with a small view the harbour which was nice, however there was an overwhelming aroma of asian cuisine. If you don't mind it too much, it was quite relaxing sitting out there with a few drinks and nibbles. Darling harbour is just a few mins walk from the building, and if you like cheap and cheerful, Chinatown is a good place for a quick bite. The entrance to the car park of the building was a little difficult to find, and you do need to obtain a key from reception in order to get access to parking ($40 per night).

The bathroom was very clean with a good power shower and toiletries provided. We had a balcony with table and chairs which was an added bonus.

With Sydney being a relatively small city we could easily walk to almost anywhere, within the city, in 20 minutes. The main shopping centre was about a 10 minute walk. We found the reception staff to be exceedingly friendly and very helpful, although we had no real need for much contact.

First off, it's not a hotel. It's a \"serviced apartment\" and the differences are quite apparent. Even the hotel pictures on the Internet are misleading; they've been doctored up a lot. Only the hotel structure itself is real, the rest is digitally added. It's located on a tiny one way street, basically an alley, next to boarded up retail shops, posters on the walls and dirty sidewalks. The location itself is not near any attractions or sights other than Darling Harbour and taxis are very expensive to get around the city. The rooms are _very_ minimally furnished. The \"office desk\" barely fits a laptop after they put a TV, mini-stereo, phone and desk light on it. The bathroom has NO countertops. Just a toilet, a small wall-mounted sink and a shower. They even taped a tissue box to the towel rack for lack of a flat surface above the floor. The doors are paper thin and everything can be heard outside the odd smelling hallway. Voices and doors opening/closing are very loud and woke me up on several occasions through the night. There is no in-room safe. There is no deadbolt or catch on the door. The \"4 star hotel style lobby\" is a small desk with only one person on duty between 7am-11pm. There is no after-hours check-in, and if you lose your key you can't get into the building until they open at 7am. The only thing going for Quest on Dixon is that it's inexpensive to stay for a long period of time. The direct-dial phone line doesn't incur any additional charges, there's a self-serve laudromat to save on outrageous hotel laundry services and a kitchenette to avoid eating out for every meal of the day. I would not recommend staying here for a short vacation or business trip. In fact I left Quest on Dixon 3 days early to check into a real hotel. It's very apparent that these serviced apartments are designed to be sold (of which they are, starting at AU$440,000!) as a city residence and to be furnished as such.
