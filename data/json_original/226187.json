First impressions of the hotel were a bit unsure as we arrived round the back of the building after being dropped at the wrong location by a taxi driver. My partner went round to the front to see if we could get help with our luggage and a few mins later a concierge came round with a luggage trolley to assist us. The front lobby is lovely, very big leather sofas and a great feeling of space and cleanliness. We were then taken to our rooms after a very easy check in. The rooms themselves were also lovely, very clean, spacious and had everything you would need for a comfortable stay including dressing gowns and room service if required. As it was Valentines Day when we arrived I had pre-booked a table for two for myself and my partner as a surprise. The meal was fab although a bit pricey but it was a special occassion. We were on the 15th floor and the views were stunning, on the 8th floor where the restaraunt and swimming pool are there were fantastic views over the bay. Coconut Grove is a very desirable area and comes alive at night with all the outside cafe bars and eateries. In all I would recommend this hotel to anyone as either a base for exploring Miami or just a short stay as we did. If we go back to Miami we wouldn't hesitate to stay at Sonesta Bayfront Hotel again.

We stayed in a 2BR suite with bay view. The layout was great for our family and the view fantastic. Two kingsize beds, and a comfortable sleeper sofa in the living room. 2 full baths and a powder room. Having a full kitchen is great, especially because the refrigerator has an icemaker. There is a CVS close by that has a nice selection of snacks and beverages to stock the kitchen. We got room service every morning for breakfast, and a couple of times for dinner. The menu and service are from the hotel's Panorama Restaurant one of the best restaurants in the Grove, and will not disappoint. We had sashimi, steak, etc. Everything was great. For breakfast, pancakes, eggs benedict, etc. All delicious and served piping hot. My only issue with room service was that frequently they didn't bring the right number of \"set ups\" so we were short silverware and napkins, but thankfully there is extra silverware in the kitchen. On our last night, I called the front desk very late and asked about the possibility of a massage. No problem, within the hour, not one, but two massage therapists arrived to give our massages. I was surprised to get such great service at the last minute. My only complaint was with the bathroom. Hot water was not really hot, and as I understood it from maintenance, it's something they are working to correct. My husband attempted to use the jacuzzi and it apparently hadn't been used in some time and spewed some residue. On this particular day, housekeeping had not come, and as it approached 5 we were concerned that we were going to be skipped and have to deal with the tub ourselves, but the front desk made sure we were taken care of. I wish we could've gotten later check out, but that's a problem with all hotels. They were very accommodating and allowed us to leave our bags and car parked with valet so we could walk around CG before heading to the airport. I would highly recommend the Sonesta for any stay in the CG area, especially if you are visiting UM.

The pool area is gorgeous and with a view to die for. The surrounding was great just a short walk you'll get restaurants,shops and cinema!

Room housekeeping was excellent one day and then the following days there were minor issues, but not of great importance. The bed was extremely comfortable as were the pillows; we had a full kitchen which was nice (ice maker so you didn't have to continually fill ice buckets)..the room was fairly spacious ....balcony same size on all but the larger units. Our bay view was on the side overlooking the pool and it was noisy (you also got a lot of noise from the restaurant on the same floor as the pool), but we turned on the ac fan and didn't hear a sound during the night. Privacy between adjoining balconies on this particular room was only a canvas panel and therefore not as private (sound) as the ones having concrete/glass dividers. One GREAT thing was that you walked right down the front steps and you were at the entrance to the festival. I would recommend the hotel and we will go back.

I've stayed at so many different hotels, mostly 4 and 5 star places and my level of expectation is high, while still appreciating someplace that is not overly done to the point of tasteless and extreme. My many visits to the Sonesta have left me now completely spoiled. And not nessecarily by the decor, it's simple, modern and understated, but by the staff. It could be 6 months between my trips to the Sonesta and they still remember me by name, they remember what it is I like to drink while at the pool, my seating preference while dining, and my preference for suites, as well as how much I enjoy their in room massages. Now, the really good stuff.... something I highly recommend. If you can, take advantage of their private dining on the beach. It is beyond romantic and the staff have it down to perfection. The delicate rose petals gracing the ground..... the dinner delivered to your table by the staff, unobtrusively, quietly bringing you exactly what you need, but never hovering too close..... the candles lit everywhere..... you can't help bu feel like their most important guest and like you are of celebrity status..... and that goes for the entire trip. No, it's not the Breakers, with an old world elegance (something that I do enjoy) but there is just something about this hotel that while large, gives it a very personal feel..... and do try the in room massage if you can, there is something just so relaxing about getting a massage while looking out of your suites windows down to the ocean while listening to the breaking waves.....

Hotel location is good and rooms, as typical in the US, are large and spacious. Booked a suite with two rooms as was travelling with my 2 children. Can't judge about breakfast as we find it a rip off unless you are really prepared to eat a lot. On the positive side, beds are comfortable. A couple of details have made me downgrade the hotel. Once arriving in a big van by the front parking area lobby (we were a group of 10), we were expecting help to enter lugage into the lobby. Expectations were a dream as we got no assistance at all. Once inside, the reservations made thru a travel agent could not be located by the clerks, so even that we thankfully had the rooms, check in was long and tedious. After a long translatlantic trip with young fellows, what one does not want is a problematic and long procedure to reach the room. To complicate things further, when I asked the reception for a US converter to plug my blackberry, they told me they did not have and all they had were for sale. Being an extensive traveller, I have never experienced such lack of customer care. I have seen both choices; either you leave a deposit and once the adapter is returned, the deposit is refunded or simply a \"here you are SIr\" and they expect the guest to return upon departure. In such a hotel category, I would expect that a belly boy brings it to the room. All in all, this hotel needs to review their customer service. For me, such \"small\" details can make a difference when returning to the area. I would probably stay somewhere else for the same price, expecting a more satisfactory experience.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "Michael E", "ReviewID": "UR121965895", "Content": "I spent six days at this wonderful hotel during my business trip to Miami.

Although the hotel itself is in a great location (close to the town, the sea, lots of restaurants etc nearby) we experienced a few issues whilst there. However, they were all very quickly and smoothly sorted out by the staff following an email to them when we arrived home. The location, although excellent, lets it down a little as there is a VERY noisy bar somewhere near to the hotel. Despite us being on a very high floor and the windows being firmly closed, we heard very loud music and shouting (including some vulgar swearing) into the very early hours of the morning during our stay. Bear in mind that we stayed at the Sonesta on week nights, so I can only imagine that it would be worse on a weekend. However, we informed the staff of this, they were aware and explained to us that this issue was currently in the midst of being resolved with the bar/club owner who would soon be told he couldn't play music so loud. Whether or not that has happened is another question. Also, our air conditioning unit was extremely noisy, so much so that we could not have it on in the night as it would make such loud banging noises, so we had to put up with the heat as it seemed more acceptable than the noise. We did have the engineer come up to our room twice however he did not fix it. The actual hotel itself is beautiful. Our view of the city and bay (our suite was on the corner so we benefited from two views) was absolutely gorgeous and the rooms were clean, tidy, and up to date other than a cupboard door which fell off during our stay! The pool area was lovely and again, had amazing views and would have been much nicer if another unpleasant guest had not thrown his/her cigarette out of their window on to the lounger next to us! Of course, this is not the hotel's fault, however it was concerning, what if there were a child on that chair? Again - the hotel itself is gorgeous and the shortcomings of our stay were resolved very smoothly and we were extremely grateful of the outcome. I would stay here again to give the hotel another chance to impress us as I see its full potential.

And the view. Make sure you ask for a bayfront room. opening the curtains every morning to sail boats moored at the bay and the miami beach skyline in the background was the equivalent of a spa session. the pool is amazing, too. For us it's very important that it shouldn't be cold, and they manage to keep it at a warm temperature that's still refreshing. The size is just right too. And again, the view. The Panorama restaurant by the pool is good, too. I especially recommend the shrimp tempura. Tasty and a bit spicy. The Sonesta staff also makes a difference. Every one of them was kind and helpful. The guys at the pool are always checking if you need something. The waitrasses at Panorama, always welcoming and nice. A special word goes to Elizabeth Dubon, the reservations supervisor. She was outstanding. She understood that, with two small children and arriving at 6 am we needed a room to freshen up and she managed to give us one without having to pay for the night before (because check in time is 3 PM). Moreover, our flight back to buenos aires was postponed from 11:50pm to 8:30 am the next morning, and she let us spend the night at a one bedroom suite for a special low price. It's hard to find staff so sympathetic and kind anywhere. She took a lot of stress out of our experience. We also really like the area. We're steps away from Coco Walk in Coconut Grove, and there are many restaurants around. it's a ten minute drive to Coral Gables and a 15-20 minute drive to South Beach (an area that we really like, but that's not very convenient with two small girls). One piece of advice, though: don't leave your car at the valet parking. There's a much much cheaper parking lot literally next door, and you don't have to wait for the valet to bring your car over (sometimes, when two or more parties are waiting ahead of you, it can take them up to nearly 10 minutes to bring your car).

I can't imagine having any better view than that of Biscayne Bay, the sailboats, and the sunrise. The service around the pool during the day was very attentive yet not overbearing. The employees work very hard in the heat making sure that guests have everything they need to enjoy their experience. One of the pool attendants, Alex, was especially helpful. I ordered lunch at the pool and thought it was very refreshing and delicious - and generous by hotel standards! The pool itself is beautiful and gives the feeling and appearance of an infinity pool when you are in it. There is also a good-sized jacuzzi and cabanas off to the side for a proper lunch or dinner table setting. We also received very good service from the bartender Patrick - who quickly attended to our coctail needs. Did I mention the location? The best!

From the moment we drove into Valet parking we immediately felt that we were in good hands. The Valet staff was quick, friendly, and efficient. The Bellmen were also very friendly and quick to assist us with our luggage; no small task for since we are a family of 5. Once we started walking up the steps into the Lobby my sense of smell was totally stimulated. The first thing that I thought was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wow, it smells great in here! What is that? I want it in my house!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pristine image and modern-style d\u00c3\u00a9cor does not disappoint. It ranged from vibrant wall to wall paintings, and oversized leather sofas to minimalistic glass reservoirs with rock crystals and flowers. The lobby said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m chic, full of style, modern but not eclectic, and you can call me home as long as you are here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The lighting is ideal, and in the evenings the lights are dimmed and candles are lit making the ambiance magical and romantic. As we approached the Front Desk we were continuously greeted by every staff member that walked by us. At the Front Desk my check-in process was also speedy. The suite was ideal for us. It was open and spacious, well decorated but not cluttered. Each bedroom had a large flat screen TV, the living room as well. No one fought for the remote! We were accommodated on the 19th floor, with a beautiful 2-bed, 2 \u00c2\u00bd bath, fully equipped kitchen, washer/dryer, wrap around balcony, with a gorgeous view of the bay, suite. Every day during our stay I woke up to the view of the horizon sky meeting the ocean. The view alone set the tone for my entire day. With the full cooperation of the staff I was able to fully relax and enjoy this impromptu vacation. My children enjoyed swimming and frolicking in the pool. The pool is located on the eighth floor with another great view of the ocean. At times my hubby would go to the pool with our older children while I watched them play and swim from our balcony; as I stayed in the suite with our 1 \u00c2\u00bd year old. On our last night as the sun went down, and while the children swam the sunset away. We were able to enjoy a pool-side appetizer from the Peruvian infused cuisine at the restaurant. Needless to say at 10:30pm I was still hungry for more! The Panorama Restaurant was ready and able to provide us with more of their tantalizing cuisine as late as 11:00pm at night. However, we decided to pass and instead plan a special trip to dine at the restaurant. My husband really took the time to enjoy the Gym located on the PH floor. The city-view from the Gym, along with the chance to watch the sun rise helped him get energized for the day. He was there at 6:15am and back again at 8:30pm. He ate, slept, exercised, and enjoyed the amenities to the fullest. Through it all, our housekeeper was fabulous. As the days went by she anticipated our needs to the degree where I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to ask for anything. Upon her regularly scheduled chores she found the time to cater to our family life by bringing us more bath towels, more kitchen towels, if I was asleep she would tend to all else without even waking me up. I would sometimes catch her on her way out of the suite. She was absolutely wonderful and very sweet! The proximity of the hotel to the retail shops and restaurants in and around Cocowalk was such a great benefit for us. In the evenings after dinner we would take a stroll to Cocowalk, or sometimes go out for dinner. The concept of walking to a restaurant was fun for us! A highlight for me was having a Starbucks Coffee Shop within a 5 minute walking distance! I must mention that the superb hospitality and outstanding experience began over the phone as I made our reservations. I called with a 24 hour notice, to book a 1-night stay, and within 4 hours our plans changed and our stay changed to 4-nights. Furthermore, once I was there we just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part and extended our stay to 5-nights. I cannot recall the names of every staff member that made our stay unforgettable. But here are some for your reference: Reservations: Elizabeth Dubon and Karen (girl from C.A.) Front Desk: Nathan, Nicole Loo, Irlanda, Cassidy, and Adrian Bellman: Gustavo Panorama Restaurant: Svetlana Housekeeper: Rosa (maybe) I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch her name since I was always handling the children or asleep :) Pool Boy: Alex, a very helpful, friendly, and patient young man. Valet Parking: They were fast and efficient. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch their names either. FYI: Overnight parking is $23 per night. Overall, our stay-at-home vacation (because we are Miami residents) was one of the best vacations we have taken. As parents we were able to enjoy our children and fully relax at the same time. We strongly recommend this hotel and would return for another extended stay.

From the moment we booked in we knew we were in for a fabulous time. We had been upgraded to a suite which was like a small apartment. I almost moved in permanently. The large living/dining room was beautifully furnished and decorated and the open plan kitchen was well stocked. The views from the sliding doors which led out onto the balcony were of the city of Miami. There was a powder room off the living room which had a washing machine and tumble dryer housed in a cupboard. Through into the large bedroom (with a very large and comfortable bed) revealed breathtaking views of Biscayne Bay through the sliding doors and out onto the wrap around balcony on one side and the sliding doors out onto the balcony city side. Then walk in closet was well stocked with hangars and housed a safe and ironing board and iron. The shower room was well stocked with quality toiletries and large fluffy white towels. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and fresh. There was a large television in the living room and bedroom and free wifi connection which enabled us to keep in touch with everyone 'back home', and research the local area. The complementary champagne and chocolate strawberries were much appreciated on arrival after a long flight. The pool bar and restaurant area on the 7th floor was comfortable and cool with a nice breeze and the sun loungers had lovely squashy cushions. The staff are helpful and friendly and give the impression that they are seriously interested in you having a good time and interested in you. The Peruvian food is delicious. The public areas are bright and furnished with individual art work which even if not to your taste is a great talking point. The staff from the bell boys, the bar staff the reception staff, the young man who dealt with the towels, the chambermaid and the chaps who parked the car were helpful,pleasant, friendly and remembered your name. Special thanks must go to Elizabeth Dubon who went above and beyond to ensure we had a great time. When asked if there was anything we needed, we asked if it was possible to have a kettle in order to boil water for tea as we were using a saucepan and within an hour a hob kettle arrived. Someone had been out to buy it! We enjoyed our stay so much we booked a day visit after our cruise before flying home and there was the kettle. Coconut Grove is a lovely area with lots of bars and restaurants and a marina. It is out of the main bustle of Miami and very pretty. We discovered a fresh food market near the hotel and the produce was wonderful so I was also able to indulge my love of cooking. A drive down to the Keys is well worthwhile but use a sat nav. Seaquarium is also well worth a visit but prepared to be soaked, especially if you are close and are presented with a flower by a dolphin. we enjoyed our nine day cruise but really looked forward to going back to the Sonesta even though it was just for a day. We had to leave all too soon and wish we could have stayed longer. We have stayed in 2 other Sonesta hotels and thought the Sonesta St George in Luxor could not be bettered but this hotel did better that in spades.

The location could probably not be better in the Grove. For other parts of Miami the location is also OK, not too much of a hassle to get around. Arriving at the hotel the first problem is to find a place to park. There is a garage next door to the hotel charging $15 per day. The hotel charges $23 for the valet - we had considered parking at the garage but since we were going to come and go several times during the days it seemed easier to go for the valet parking. Still I do believe that they charge to much for parking. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful upon check-in. We were a bit early but they arranged for another room, a better than we booked, for us. Still I got to say I was a bit disappointed seeing the room. The rooms are fairly small to be in the US (would be considered large in Europe) but they were still OK. The room offer all the things expected but it is clear that it is not new. The TV was a flat screen but looking at the picture quality it is either an older model or a cheap model (the Hampton Inn and the Best Western I stayed at earlier the same trip had much better TVs). The coffee maker was also a bit old and could not really heat the water to required temperature. The good things were however a nice balcony with views of the water, very comfortable bed and nice bathtub. The room would however benefit from adding some new furniture and replacing TV etc. The biggest issue I had was however the sloppy cleaning. The first day I did not notice anything special but the second day I dropped my wallet on the floor and when I bent down I also got a good look under the bed and there was a nice thick layer of dust there. That prompted me to check a few other places (under the chest of drawers, on the shelves etc) with equally bad results. It appears is if the cleaning staff only do the quick and easy things and skip the actual cleaning (would of course not be necessary to do every day but the dust under the bed rather suggested it was several months since the last time). The pool is very nice and has nice views of the water. There is also a jacuzzi beside the pool. We did not try the restaurant but it seemed a bit pricey for what was on offer. The hotel also offered a nice fitness center, it was located at the very top floor with nice views of the city. There are also 2 squash courts in the hotel - a real nice addition but since I did not know it when I booked I did not bring my racket (the ones available to borrow where pretty poor quality). The exterior of the hotel was undergoing some renovation, did not really disturb as they appeared to be working on the city side of the hotel. The annoying parts of the hotel were more the fact that they try very hard to be more of a upscale hotel but do not really have the necessary quality to do it. What then remains is more of overcharging for average quality.

A helpful hint to others in the same situation: mention that you might want to cancel your reservation and stay across the street at the Ritz Carlton Hotel and the staff will spring into action to serve you though. I observed one couple do this during my time of half conscious loitering in the Sonesta lobby.

This is a hotel where the website photos actually match EXACTLY what the hotel looks like. The decor was elegantly simple, with original artwork everywhere. The room was in perfect order and always looked like new each afternoon. The view was just what I hoped, and we spent time on our balcony morning and night. I also want to mention that EVERY staff member greeted us everywhere we went and seemed genuinely concerned with making our stay meet our needs, without being pushy or over gracious. We ate breakfast at the hotel the first day, as a last resort because hotel breakfasts are so often way overpriced for what you get. I have to say it was the best breakfast (french toast with mango and other fruit) I have ever had in a hotel. While not cheap, it was worth it. We even went back the second day.

The rooms themselves are equally modern and were very clean with a satisfying array of ammenities. I will say though that as nice as the rooms were, I would have liked them to be a little bigger in size. (Side note, their shampoo & conditioner are great! They come in this amazing mango-coconut scent that I am still trying to find back home here in the Northeast. ) The hotel was an amazing outdoor pool located on the 8th floor. Again, the pool is not very large, though what it lacks in size, it makes up for with the amazing views you get from the pool area (great sweeping views of the bay and rest of Coconut Grove). While some of the hotel staff were really nice and impressively helpful they seemed to work alongside some colleagues who seemed indifferent at best (like some of the concierge staff and pool bar staff). This hotel is within walking distance (about 3 blocks) from the heart of Coconut Grove's downtown area. The Coco Walk facility is so close by as are many other restaurants, bars and shops. This downtown area stays open quite late. However, note that this hotel is not very close to the beach. South Beach is the closest beach area located about 15 minutes by car from the hotel (approximately $30 by taxi one way). As I was told by the hotel, there is no direct public bus route that goes from Coconut Grove to South Beach - so your transport options are pretty much limited to a rental car or taxi. This hotel is also about a 30 minute ride from the airport. This is a great hotel which I would definitely recommend it to friends.

The restaurant overlooks the harbour too which is lovely when you're dining.

We were on the 18th floor and the music was so loud I could not fall asleep until the club closed. When I called down to the front desk at 2:00am to complain, they were quick to answer that it would go on until 3:00am -- this has obviously been a major issue for them. I could actually make out the songs (at least those I recognized) and could hear the DJ announce \"last call\" -- IT WAS THAT BAD! The room were were in was cramped -- you could barely walk around the bed without bumping into the furniture around it. We had our 18-month-old with us which made this somewhat treacherous for her. We had to request a crib three times before they brought one up to the room, but luckliy it arrived before bedtime. The pool was quite small... much too small for the size of this hotel. But it was not terribly busy and warm. When we checked out, I complained about the club noise and they half-heartedly apologized. The receptionist said they receive a lot of complaints and forward them to the police in the hopes that they will be able to get the club closed down and that I should request an oceanside room next time... but that's all they said. They did not offer to reimburse us or even drop the $23 valet parking charges which I thought was the minimum they could do. I know we got a good price on hotwire.com ($105 including tax), but when I am paying for a 4-star hotel I expect to be able to sleep through the night, not be bothered by the adjacent noise. On the positive side... the location is nice and you can walk to lots of restaurants, etc. The lobby was nice and hip, as was the furniture in the rooms.

Any and all service requests were honored the first time. We found the staff to be generally professional and congenial at the Front Desk, valet and Restaurant. Dollar for dollar you are going to get more hotel at a better price at the Sonesta Coconut Grove than South Beach or downtown. Coconut Grove has its own personality without quite as much insanity as South Beach. Unless you are doing the beach every day, Coconut Grove is a great alternative to South Beach or downtown. You have plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance and even more within a five minute drive. You are ten minutes to downtown and twenty to South Beach. I would definately book the Sonesta again.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Virginia", "Title": "\u201cPre-Cruise Stay\u201d", "Author": "NovaTam", "ReviewID": "UR8501632", "Content": "The Sonesta Hotel and Suites in Coconut Grove was very nice.

We booked a Biscayne Suite for a low AAA rate. The 19th floor wraparound terrace with its views of the marina, the park (although you can't see it, the Barnacle Historic Site is there, beneath the trees) and the pool, was fantastic. The two bedroom suite affords loads of pricacy, as it is actually two hotel rooms with an entrance foyer--so each bedroom's occupants have complete privacy . Then there is a small but modern kithchen area, a washer/dryer in the third bathroom, and living area. The price of this huge suite was half of what we were about to pay for a much smaller ONE bedroom suite at Loew's. We went to So Beach one day and were so glad we didnt stay there. It was loud, hectic, and like the worst of Las Vegas. Returning to the little streets and cafes of Coconut Grove was lovely. The staff at Sonesta is excellent!!!! Everyone is friendly, knowledgable about the area, and courteous and helpful. The bellman/general assistant Jouvert (spelling?) was particularly outstanding. We used the valet parking--yes, a bit of a splurge, but a treat to have the car waitng for us when needed. The pool was clear, clean, and sparkiing, with enough room to swim laps. There was rarely anyone else there or in the hot tub. One night there was a wedding which interfered with our use of the pool--not officially, we just felt a bit awkward swimming in front of the wedding guests who were in adjoining reception area with patio adjacent to the pool deck. Only two negatives: the hallway on the floor leading to our suite had a somewhat mildewed, humid scent. Howeve, there was no trace of it, once in the suite or its entryway . In fact, the rooms were perfectly clean, wtih spotless bathrooms. The other problem was that one day, shower pressure varied--sometimes strong, sometimes barely more than a stream. I forgot to mention this while we were there, but have no doubt that had we done so, it would have been looked into.

When we go there they had us on 11; I requested a higher floor, and they gave us 16. You don't want to be close to the 8th floor because that is where the pool, restaurant, and outdoor bar [if you want to call it a bar because the bartender is always MIA] are. Room is basic; bed was a little too soft for me, but comfortable linens. Balcony with 2 chairs is nice to have, overlooking the Biscayne Bay. There is no ocean right there; you must rent a car or you will feel too isolated. You want to request the ocean view, even though it is really a bay view. You don't want to be facing CoCo walk which has a very late and busy nightlife. There is a kitchenette in the room, so you can buy things and keep them in a small frig, or make your own coffee if you wish. There is NO gift or snack shop or any shops for that matter, in the Sonesta. There is no turn-down service at night, but if you want fresh towels you can tell them, and they are happy to refresh your towels at night. Also, very limited breakfast restaurants here. Only decent breakfast places to eat near by are Coco cafe [very limited menu], and Green Street [great omemlettes made any way you like; very busy and service can be very slow; tell the hostess you want to see your waiter as soon as you are seated]. There is also a Starbucks a few doors down to the right where you can read the New York Times and relax. It is always very crowded with a line. The pool is miniscule with very few chairs and NO lifeguard . Again, another tripadvisor member mentioned this, so I knew not to expect a great pool scene. But since we took many day trips, the pool was not the main priority. There is only 1 restaurant with a very limited menu. If you are NOT the adventurous type and rely on a good concierge, this is NOT the place to stay. They are pleasant enough, but not knowlegable, the same with the front desk crew. To save some money park at the garage next door which is $5 each time you enter, as opposed to the twentysomething dollars that the hotel charges for each 24 hours. There are other $5 parking options in the neighborhood. This hotel has many permanent residents here who own their units, so my take on this place is that if feels much more like a highrise doorman building with basic amenities, than a hotel with lots of amenities. Fitness room on top floor is okay if you just want to keep up with your regular routine -- nothing fancy, again very basic. Also, NO attendants in the fitness room. If you want luxury go to the Ritz-Carleton around the corner; it is gorgeous and the service is first class all the way around. Of course you will pay through the nose for that. If you are not planning on spending much time in the hotel as we did, the Sonesta is just fine. Just do your research ahead of time, so that you have an agenda for your visit. I recommend South Beach, Key Largo, and Key Biscaynne. If you love bike riding go to Key Biscaynne. It's not expensive and it's very flat and pretty, and they have a state park there to explore by bike or foot. South Beach is good for shopping, and of course happy hour. It has become so popular and crowded that biking there is frustrating because you are always concerned about running into someone. There are also 2 fun restaurant rows you have to visit. One is Espaniola Way, and the other is Lincoln Road. Don't bother wasting your money to go to the Bass Museum; extremely disappointing as there was nothing much to see. You can also rent chairs with cushions on the beach in South Beach for the day. South Beach is a real scene, so we chose not to stay there, but it is fun to visit. Key Largo is a drive, but we found a great tiki bar/restaurant right on the water called Snapper's and had great half price drinks and appetizers [awesome shrimp and oysters, and sooo cheap!] We left late and were stuck in traffic so we didn't get to do any exploring down there. Many people told us to go to Islamorada [the next Key], but we'll have to do that next time and leave earlier. There is major road construction going on along U.S.1 South, which we did not know about ahead of time, so be warned. Take Card Sound Road as an alternate route to avoid a lot of the traffic; do not take US 1 all the way down to the Keys. We stayed at the Sonesta for 4 nights. Overall, it was a nice get-away, and when we got bumped up to first class on our return flight it was icing on the cake! We took this trip without our 2 kids, and we had a really nice time just having alone time and exploring. There's lots to explore and see if you have wheels.

When he found he couldn't fix the problem quickly, the hotel moved us to a wonderful suite that looked over the bay. The rooms were simple, elegant and comfortable. The staff was always friendly and more than willing to help with any requests. I personally enjoyed sangria night at the poolside bar- very nice! The hotel was close to everything, specifically a Starbucks just a half a block down- I have to have my coffee in the morning. The valet parking was totally worth the extra money- it was secure and much less stressful than trying to find a parking space.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definately stay there again if back in Miami.", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cSounds like it's better to book an internet deal than direct\u201d", "Author": "jill052", "ReviewID": "UR5891043", "Content": "From my experience, most hotels would usually give you a better deal if you call them direct which we did and got the parking package for one night at $169 (with taxes, etc. it ended up costing $189). This was supposed to include free valet parking and free breakfast according to the man I talked to when we booked. We stayed Sat. night, Sept. 23, which looks like it's the same weekend that the previous lady stayed for $110. The hotel is clean, and very well done as a renovated older hotel. It has a new sleak, modern decor and our room had a king bed as promised with white linens which I wish all hotels would use. I also liked the coffee maker in the room and the paper at the door in the morning. We didn't feel like we were told the \"whole truth\" when we were told we'd have free breakfast with our room package. As it ended up, it was a free continental breakfast. We weren't real upset by this news so went to breakfast the next morning to find out that the hotel only gives you ONE free continental breakfast. I felt embarrassed and wanted to leave but the gracious lady managing their restaurant insisted we stay and she told us to help ourselves. (the fresh fruit and pastries, juice and coffee were all wonderful and the restaurant is overlooking the water with an outdoor patio that was perfect for a lazy morning). However, when we asked again at the desk as we check out, whether the breakfast for one was a mistake, we were told,\"No.\" Very, very strange. So if you're offered a \"free breakfast\" with a package, ask if it's full or continental and if only one person in your party of two using the room gets to eat.", "Date": "September 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cYou cant beat this Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "cubanito1", "ReviewID": "UR5831475", "Content": "Ok I have looked far and wide for hotels in Miami and took a chance on this one. It was great for $110 a night. You are close to everything in the Grove, plus ins central so South Beach is 10 minutes away. The rooms were not that big I had a normal king bed in a standard room woth no balcony. However for 20 bucks more a night I could have...Im just cheap. The room service for breakfast was amazing and well worth it. The staff was on top of anything I asked for. You have to have a drink outside by the pool on the 7th floor, its really cool. Dont valet your car! There is a parking garage right next to the hotel (actually connected) its usually 6 bucks for 24 hours...only if there is an attendant then is a 12 buck maximum (1.50 an hour). My suggestion is look around there are lots that charge 5 bucks for 24 hours..use them since the hotel charged 19bucks a night for valet. Oh and here is a trick, if you pay your parking stub from the garage next to the hotel at those automated machines..you have 8 hours to use the stub to get out....get it? I paid $1.50 at the machine and didnt have to use the ticket to leave for another 8 hours saving me a lot!!! Youll see those machine when you drive into the garage.....warning though, on the weekends the garage gets crowded with club hopping nuts..not safe to venture in there alone if your a girl. Just use common sense or ask the concierge to have security escort you which they will do. But the hotel is the only hotel I will use from now on.

The Sonesta is very clean and well maintained, light years ahead of pricier hotels in South Beach where we usually stay. The view of the Bay is spectacular. The staff was the friendliest and most efficient we've run across anywhere in our numerous Miami visits. We followed the advice of other reviewers who suggested we park in the public garage next door (literally) to the Hotel and paid $3 a night ($6 on weekends) rather than the $18 charged by the valet service (which might be a better deal if you enter and exit several times a day).
