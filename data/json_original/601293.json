When you would tell them that you are staying in the hotel and need to use the Internet, they would tell you to go to your room or go outside in the street.

Close to Dubai airport, but a good distance from the main shopping centers. Unfortunately, my short stay was spoilt by two unplesant episodes. The maitre had a furious row with one of the waiters in the presence of a full dining area. This was embarassing not only for the poor waiter but also for those who were trying to enjoy their meals. The lack of social skill dispalyed by the waiters was reinforced by the reception staff. At the check out I had the unpleasant experience of the receptionist calling the floor to double check that nothing was taken form the minibar. This is routine only in hotels with poor customer care, surely they had my credit card on file... I was releaved to be informed that all was fine! In addition, when I questiioned why I was charged twice for the internet, connection I was told that I used both a cable and the wireless. I protested but my complaints were met by very poor customer skills, poor english and extreme rudeness. I had to pay the full ammount. I explained that this was unacceptable but it all fell on deaf ears. Never again. Dubai offers millions of cheaper hotels that provide better service.

Surprisingly the rooms we had on the 5th and 7th floors which were directly above the nightclub were quiet! You could just hear the bass if you were near the window.

The internet is really expensive, at AED99 per day, but it was fast. The hotel isnt for families, or bringing your wife (unless she is open minded), From about 5pm to 4am the lobby is full of prostitutes and men who look like they are out of a 1970's gangster movie.

Finally I went back up, they had forgot about me and were rude when I reminded them I was there. The lobby was nice and the place had a unique look. The room was small, dingy, and had a bad smell. The porters were great, but rest of staff was inattentive and acted like they didn't care. They charged for internet service. At the price I paid, that was just a slap in the face. There was no wireless internet in the room and the Internet cable was too short to be able to use without placing the computer on the very edge of the desk. Twice I had no hot water.

But apparently this chick isnt you used to hearing no, because she copped serious attitude. Politely said no a 5TH time, and finally got the dial tone. Went to use the internet, and it advertises high speed internet. UMMM, yeah high speed means less than an hour for a website to load. Overall, the bedding and the room were nice. Old world russian, which was quite an experience. Didnt hear the nightclub very much, but sure did get a lot of offers on the way down to get something to drink.

Being a native Russian with certain expectations to authentic food, I had a pleasant surprise - the cuisine corresponded to what it really is in Russia. The Russian dancing show (daily, 10 pm and 11.30 pm) was creative, obviosly done by a professional choreographer, with flashy costumes, but a bit loud music. A mix of traditional and modern themes, though for a native Russian it's a kitsch as these shows are done for tourists in all major hotels and restaurants of Moscow and St.Petersburg. Still, the show was the best part of the experience and provided a good value for money spent in the restaurant. The food portions were huge to say the least. The starter, salad 'pod shuboi' (herring, red beat, potatoes) , was as if it was home-made and came in a large plate; it was like a main course (corresponding to the way it is done in Russia). So, I carefully chose the lightest main course. However, my fish in 'Moscow style', was definitely for 2 or even 3 very hungry persons, and I was not able to finish even a half of it. Also, I noticed that some traditional dishes on the menu were quite heavy and will be hard to digest in the hot climate of Dubai as many of them are designed for Russian winter time.
