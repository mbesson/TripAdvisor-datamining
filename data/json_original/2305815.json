Very, very nice! The units are extremely large (I believe around 1,800 sq ft) and very well equipped. We had a 2 bedroom unit (with a third bunk bed room where the washer/dryer is?) with 2 bathrooms. If you wanted to bring kids, loads of room and they would have their own bathroom. The kitchen is ample size with a nice island to sit at. Large living room area with a good size TV and lots of channels to surf. Huge walkout with Jacuzzi, table and 4 chairs and a hammock. The master bedroom is also very large and again, a large and lovely bathroom with a sliding door quasi walk-in closet. This really is a beautiful place and modern. These are all the nice things, but we had a couple of issues. The first unit we were in had some ants. I killed them all, and thought I got the ones outside (they were coming in under the sliding door) but when we woke up in the morning, there was a line of ants (in the hundreds, and maybe even thousands) that went under the door, through the living room and dining room, up the island and were feasting on some bread that was left out, in a bag. The front desk was quite good and moved us to a new unit. We then decided to use the washer/dryer (note that it is only one machine and does both the washing and drying, but can\u2019t take very large loads) which meant there wasn\u2019t enough hot water to fill the Jacuzzi. No big deal, we adjusted. Also, the facility is quite empty, a lot of the units have nothing in them at all. But we like peace and quiet, so we were fine with this fact. They don\u2019t have any evening dining, so, you can either call a cab, or, as we did, have a car so you can go out to PDC to have a dinner. The internet is not available at your room, so you have to go to the snack bar or to the front desk area. They have a very nice gym that I used three times. Very nice, and quiet, beach area. Next door on the beach, and apparently \u201cpart\u201d of the Pure Mareazul is the Beach Bar. It is a very nice place to grab a drink or a bite. Order the nachos with beef, it came with chunks of beef (rather than ground) that were probably some of the best tasting beef I have ever had in my life!!!!! Pure Mareazul is connected with the Nick Price golf course. We got to play at 50% off, which came out to $80 (regular price $160). Wow, what a course, we absolutely loved it. We have played almost every course in the Mayan Riviera, and this is one of the best. The Pure Mareazul is not for everyone, but, it is a very nice, clean modern facility.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot Ready for Prime time... nor for vacation time\u201d", "Author": "Rhea63", "ReviewID": "UR125511447", "Content": "Firstly, this is a CONDO COMPLEX who is trying to market as a hotel. Yes, condos are lovely and grounds are lovely and ocean is amazing, BUT this depends on what unit you are placed inside. A bad and non-working unit can ruin a hard-earned and paid for vacation!!! If you want to stay at Mareazul, consider finding \"owner rented\" units that are far more lovely and ready for rental. We had the pleasure of seeing inside a rental unit that is individually owned and on the rental market through other vacation rental agencies. ( VRBO, etc) Other members of our vacation party stayed at the resort in one of those units and we wished we had done so ourselves. NO restaurant - really. Its a snack bar with only 4-5 tables that is supposed to serve 300 condos? Not enough chairs around the pool ( I counted 55 chairs ) to support 300 condos?? Front desk does speak enough english, but not so much. Suggest a rental car as you are a bit far from center of town and restaurants which is essential since the \"restaurant\" ( again it is not really one) closes at 5pm??? Further, the class of people staying at this \"hotel\" is clearly low. We entered the spa/shower and gym to find dirty diapers left in open trash and wet towels laying on floor. Also we had to compete with guests blaring their ipod speakers around the pool and witnessed someone changing their oil in the parking lot??? All of this is really too bad as the locale and facilities are so gorgeous but the delivery is definitely not catering to 4 or 5 star clientele... Mareazul management should visit a 5 star resort and take some well-needed hospitality tips.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPoor service.

These modern condos are beautifully designed and spacious. Our 2 bedroom, 3 bath beach-front unit was equipped with high end appliances, had a roof-top jacuzzi in addition to a large deck with a hammock and patio set, and even had a washer/dryer. The pool area is gorgeous and since this place was pretty much empty, we never had to fight for a chair or umbrella. There is a long stretch of beach that also has plenty of places to sit and nice sandy areas to swim. The staff was very friendly and one guy at the snack bar (can't remember his name) went above and beyond for us. We were hoping for a quiet, relaxing vacation and we were not disappointed! As the other reviewers have mentioned, this is not really a resort. If you enjoy having lots of organized activities or shows, like to be waited on constantly, and want access to lots of restaurants etc, this place is not for you. Housekeeping comes in every day with clean towels, makes the bed, and does some general cleaning of the apartment; but there were rarely any extra towels or back up toilet paper, etc. There is a snack bar and beach club where you can purchase food and drinks, but they are only open until 5pm, so if you like lounging at a bar, you are kind of out of luck. We are pretty independent and don't typically use a ton of amenities, so we didn't really mind. There are no representatives from Grayline or other concierge services, so you are also on your own for organizing and scheduling activities and tours. As much as we loved the place, I do have to mention a few issues we encountered. The condo we had did seem to have quite a few bugs. There were little beetles and on 2 nights, we had a giant cockroache come running across the balcony. My legs and back are full of bites from something, and although I'm not certain, I think it may have been bed bugs since I don't recall being bit. We never did figure out our phone, so we were unable to call the lobby and had to walk all the way across the campus any time we needed anything. Sometimes it was difficult to locate staff and we actually were blown off by one of the desk clerks when she said she was going to get some info together regarding a snorkeling tour, but never came through. Lacking a phonebook or any local area brochures etc, it was hard to plan where to go and we ended up having to just wander the strip on 5th Ave. I was also not impressed with the food. We had good food at the snack bar, but the beach club served us moldy bread for breakfast, melted/freezer-burned ice cream, dirty glasses, and the extra slow service was maddening. All in all, these are beautiful residences with a great beach/pool, but they do lack some of the amenities of a typical resort. If you want a quiet get away and don't require a lot of pampering, this is a wonderful choice!", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cNice and big and clean pool\u201d", "Author": "Ewelinka87", "ReviewID": "UR124463254", "Content": "Nice and big and clean pool area Short way to golf Short way to downtown Playa Del Carmen (5 min drive) Nice and big apartments, all new, fully furnished, kitchen, 2 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, washroom, walk in closet.

The complex was almost empty, rooms not furnished ... 2. It took 45 minutes from Playa del Carmen to find the place as the adress in the site doesn't allow any taxi to localise it. We called several times the number indicated in my booking confirmation. After 4 calls, we managed to have someone by phone who told us the number was not the correct one. We could at last call the good one.\u00a0 3. We were just arrived to the place that a young woman requiered us to pay the totality of our stay.\u00a0 4. The suite was huge and modern. However, the balneo has not been cleaned. There were also some defaults on walls and furniture. See the pictures.\u00a0 5. We requested to the reception an ipod station for our room as mentioned in the description of hotel complex in booking.com. They did not come back to us. We had to contact booking.com to fix this issue. They bought an ipod station that they provided us the evening. We made the check out the day after\u00a0at 8am\u00a0... I had to set up it in the room by myself. 6. We did not enjoy the breakfast. It was\u00a0from 8 to 10 am\u00a0in a snack. We asked them if it was possible to do something\u00a0at 7:50 am\u00a0as we had to leave\u00a0at 8am\u00a0to our excursions. They answered clearly no.\u00a0 7. The reception was open\u00a0from 7am to 10pm\u00a0only. We wanted to go in the center after\u00a010pm. Nobody present to call a cab for us. The matter is that the hotel is in a huge hotel zone. You have to walk very long to get the principal road.\u00a0On booking.com, they mention a 24hour opened front desk... 8. The TV reception quality was very bad. 9. The freezer was not cleaned as well. Mainly ice maker compartiment 10. Before leaving, the reception asked us to pay 127 pesos more to fix the error made by the employee during the check in. The explanation was not clear enough, talking about an exchange rate they fixed themselves. 11. The flat should have cleaned every day : it obviousmy wasn't and we found the flat for the second night in the same state that we left it the morning. 12. Reception answering the phone was not able to hold a conversation in english : double price from foreign mobile and even not understood.\u00a0 13. We spent times on phone with\u00a0booking.com\u00a0to help. This was clearly expensive.\u00a0 14. The wifi was not available in the rooms. I needed to work and the only places where a connection was available were the lobby outside and the snack closed\u00a0at 5 pm.

They were in the process of opening a restaurant at the pool, but it wasn't open while we were there. The pool was spectacular! Huge and the kids loved it. There was a cute little jungle gym for the kids to play on too. The view from our balcony was beautiful.
