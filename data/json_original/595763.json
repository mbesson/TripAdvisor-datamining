My wife flew in on Friday, Oct 8th, to spend a couple of nights with 6 of her girlfriends (they stayed at 2 apartments in the Lincoln Park area). I followed 2 days later on Marathon Sunday, and took a cab from O'Hare to downtown. No traffic at all even if the marathon had just ended. Presidential Towers is a 4-tower complex on West Madison, and spans the Jefferson and Clinton blocks. We stayed at Tower 3 which is run by Habitat Corporate Suites. Tower4 is called the Dog Tower, obviously for guests with pets. All rooms in Tower 3 are furnished. Towers 1 and 2 are managed by the owner of the entire complex, and units are mostly unfurnished, and are for longer leases. The towers are tall and not unattractive. The reception desk at Tower3 is not usually staffed, but a phone will summon a staffer. We were processed immediately by a young, professional male staffer in a few minutes. Our paperwork including a city map were all pre-prepared in an envelope with 2 keys and swipe cards. The apartment lobby was undergoing renovation, but aisles and hallways were reasonably clean. There were at least 3-4 security men controlling the long hallways leading to tower3. Access to elevators is by swipe card. There were 4 fast and quiet elevators. Our 35th floor hallway was clean but plain. We had a one-bdrm apt with ample living/dining area, and a decent-sized kitchenette. Both our bdrm and living/dining areas had ceiling-to-floor glass walls on one side (facing the NW part of the city). Aside from usual ceiling lights, we also had 5 floor/table lamps --- 2 did not have bulbs, and the 3rd had a busted bulb. We called about this the following morning, and all lamps were in working condition when we returned in the afternoon. Kitchen had a fridge/freezer, range/stove, DW, and full complement of utensils, pots/pans, china, glassware. Large walk-in storage closet beside main entry. Three-piece bath was decently-sized and clean, with usual set of towels and soap/shampoo. Water pressure was needlessly strong --- can we think of low-flow heads to conserve water? Furniture was so-so, and same as 3-star hotel. Queen bed was comfortable. Street noise, esp. sirens, was evident even up on the 35th. Walls could have been better insulated. On our 2nd night, we could hear the guy next door watching a sports event. There is a very large, fully-equipped fitness center run as an independent enterprise. Guests of Habitat are entitled to free use of the center. I did not see an in-house restaurant or coffee shop, but there is a Potbelly soup/sandwich place at the corner of one of the towers. There were also a handful of shops incl McDonalds at the back of one tower. The end of the one Metra line is located at a building about 200 meters away from the Towers. We took this train to get our usual seafood fix at Bob Chinn's in Wheeling. The trains were packed because of marathon participants leaving the city. Mag Mile and shops/restaurants are not far away, and the walk is pleasant if one is in reasonably good health. In summary, it is a decent place but not memorable. We paid $165/night, way below the usual hotel rates in the downtown area.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cElegant, Comfortable and the best view of the downtown\u201d", "Author": "travelarounddaworld", "ReviewID": "UR68383858", "Content": "I had been to Chicago on a business visit and the company had booked me into Presidential towers. The hotel looks very imposing and is in bang in the centre of the downtown. I was allotted a room on the 27th floor which had an awesome view of the I90/I94 expressway. It was a studio apartment and I should say it was very comfortable and had all amenities in place for my stay. Had a living room with a TV. The kitchen with a microwave,dishwasher and a cooking range was sufficient for me to cook myself for the entire tour. Apart from this they also have a supermarket as well as lot of shops in the basement. They have a wonderful Thai restaurant which I always used to hit in the weekends. The service was really good and the entire studio is cleaned on a daily basis. They also had a pay per use washing facility in the basement. The only cause of concern for me was the security as I could not bring in guests without them going through a lot of security checks and me coming down and accompanying them. But otherwise the facility is top class, the view of the downtown is awesome and it also has good access to all the parts of the city.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Lafayette, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place at a Great Price, No Problems\u201d", "Author": "Boilers0809", "ReviewID": "UR65194119", "Content": "We stayed here for one night.

I did not get internet until the second day of my stay and then it went out again because the phone went dead. Promises were not kept and voice mails were not returned. The bed was extremely soft and the springs were dead. Even though I was on a higher floor, I could clearly hear street noise at all hours (especially sirens). A light bulb was out in the bathroom and a burner on the stove was out. The room had a pretty good view from four large windows which had shades, but needed curtains to block out light at night. The televion remote worked about 10% of the time, so surfing was out of the question.

We wanted more room and comfort than the average budget hotel for our 5-day stay, and we certainly got it -- and at a budget price! We were walking distance to Union Station, and on several major bus routes. The room was only technically a studio, as the bedroom was separated from the living room by a 3/4-wall. The kitchen was well-stocked with the basic utensils, but remember to pick up some salt and pepper and napkins in the grocery store on the ground floor. The building also houses a McDonald's and a Thai restaurant (mediocre at best, but handy). Our only minor quibble was that they cleaned the room the day before we left, without notice.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cMid west beige\u201d", "Author": "Bradstir", "ReviewID": "UR29689298", "Content": "Melting pot of mostly ethnic corporate travellers and low socio-demographic profiles as the Presidential Towers complex also houses what they refer to in US, section 8, housing for low income households.

Furnishings pretty ordinary but practical. Security a bit over the top but assuring. Beware having packages delivered. Packages addressed correctly rendered me deceased and sent elsewhere. Lost luggage delivered to the complex by the airline was like an Easter egg hunt til found it was sent to the valet that closes Saturday 3pm and does not re-open until Monday 7:30am.
