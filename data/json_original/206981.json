The room was cleaned each day during my week's stay and suited my needs well. Loved the deep bath with plenty of hot water. Would prefer to see little toiletries discontinued as there is so much wastage with small plastic packaging. Soap dispensers are more eco-friendly. Wifi was not always reliable and it was inconvenient to have to ask for a new password every 24 hours. Unlike previous reviews I had no trouble adjusting the cooling in the room. It was quiet and not so much light in the room that it bothered me particularly. I got the distinct impression that the focus in this hotel was on making money from business travellers whose company pays the bill, rather than provide service. For example, no tea/coffee in the room and this had to be paid for in the lobby along with everything else. I refused to pay 18 euros for breakfast, and walked to a nearby coffee shop instead. On my return to Madrid another hotel was recommended to me at a far cheaper rate, with excellent free wifi & a delicious, free buffet breakfast. From a seasoned traveller's perspective, you don't actually make money charging extra, instead you lose customers - worth keeping in mind. This hotel could be so much better simply by focusing on meeting the needs of guests, especially by including breakfast, providing a better wifi service and having an iron available.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cTiny room and bad AC\u201d", "Author": "lourdesferreiro", "ReviewID": "UR131605863", "Content": "This was the worst hotel we stayed in in Madrid.

It gave the impression of a busy hotel with high nightly turnaround, which would make sense given its proximity to the football stadium, but as a result it felt rather impersonal and perfunctory. I can't complain about the comfort of the room, the quality of sleep or the breakfast - all were fine, but nothing to write home about. The reception staff were efficient though there was a long queue for both checkin and checkout.

The room was hot but hey you can always open the window. The safe was big enough to put my laptop in. I had my dongle so didn't use the free internet but NB if you want to use it you do need an ethernet cable. There was no sign of tea+coffee making facilities in my room but to be fair I wasn't bothered and didn't ask about it. Despite being on a main road it was not especially noisy - no noisy nightly bin collecting here! The chambermaid was a sweetie, always with a happy smile; the reception staff were very helpful, making phone calls for me when I had problems with my inadequate grasp of Spanish, and printing boarding passes etc. Moreover this hotel has ramps everywhere so is presumably wheelchair friendly, but certainly very useful if like me you have heavy luggage.
