Room was clean and we had a nice view of the courtyard. Front desk was very helpful with a flower delivery I had- they even made sure the orchid bouquet stayed fresh in their refrigerator in the back room. Several Disney people with different jobs each day greeted us and some even remembered our name. Boat service was great. We always rent a car there- as it is easier to get around to every place other than the Magic Kingdom. I would not recommend the bus service- from MANY people I have spoken with over the years there at various hotels we have stayed.

On checking in we found we had been upgraded from our booked woods view room to a courtyard room, we had a great view of the pool and bay lake, which gave us a great view of the electrical parade that Disney does for the MK resorts. The noise from the pool during the day can be loud especially with the music from the daily pool parties for the kids. The rooms are a little tired, but ours was clean, with new thick white towels, beds were clean and comfy too. We timed the visit in a busy period with spring break so the wait times were long for rides, and now living in the Caribbean we found the evenings a bit chilly too. The pool area was nice, but busy and the pool not that large, so unlike Saratoga Springs where we stay each September, there wasnt really any quiet pools to escape the noise and crowds, though they do have another pool by the villas. There also seems to be a lot of visiitors from the Fort Wilderness coming over as the resorts are connected using the pools even though there are notices that the pool is for lodge guests only, though not sure if this is policed but it needs to be. The food was good at Roaring fork, the quick service restaurant and also we had breakfast at Whispering Canyon, which was good too, we would stay as this resort again for a week without hesitation though we have booked into Yacht Club for break in July, which we booked before leaving for te trip, we are looking to come back here at Christmas....", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cA Great Lodge!\u201d", "Author": "Yoheadden", "ReviewID": "UR126291352", "Content": "We researched this lodge online before we booked our vacation, but it didn't get us ready for the grand lobby.

The bathroom area made it easy for all four of us to get ready in the mornings with the shower and toilet area having a door, and two sinks in an area of their own. The balcony was nice, even if the view wasn't the best, but it did surprise us one night when we returned to our room just in time to see the fireworks at Magic Kingdom. Well, part of the fireworks. We could see a few of the higher launched bigger fireworks, but still it was a neat little bonus. Only one minor issue that I would advise for others staying here is in regards to transportation. Disney does a great job moving people across the WDW resort with their busses, monorails and boats. However, this resort, because of its location, can make travel times to the parks a little longer than others.

They really do go above and beyond with the servicing of the rooms. the Lodge is so tastefully done, and really is a different feel from the other hotels in the park.

Since this would be our first trip to Disneyworld, I wanted to ensure that we received the same magical experiences that we receive at California's Disneyland Properties. From the moment we arrived, we were met by a less than enthusiastic staff from the bell hop to the front counter person named \"Jenna\". It seemed that the staff were tired and did not want to be there. Even though there was only one person ahead of me when I checked in, I waited over 20 minutes before I was able to be waved over to start the check in process. This was bothersome because I saw a half dozen \"Cast Members\" standing around not doing anything. Because I'm so use to the magic and attentiveness of California Disneyland, my expectations were for Disneyworld to be the same if not higher. In addition to the poor reception and first impressions, our room was dirty, with potato chips found on the floor, an iron not put away, a defective ironing board were just some of the issues with our $400 a night \"upgraded\" room. The walls to the room were so thin, we could hear everything our neighbors were doing. Some of the reviews of the Wilderness noted the rooms were dated. After having been there for a week, I entirely concur. The magic simply was not felt nor did we ever feel it staying at the Wilderness Lodge. With that, our first trip to Disneyworld proved to be memorable but in a negative sense. In my opinion, it appears at least with respect to the Wilderness Lodge, the business and customer service culture is a stark contrast to the better managed and well run Disneyland hotels in California.

I was greeted by several cast members of the Wilderness Lodge as soon as I got off the bus who took me directly into the lobby. The friendly lady, showed me the lobby and various areas that I may be interested in during my stay...at that point, she took me up to the 7th floor (conceirge level) of the resort. I met up with a great guy name, Mike, who told me \"that the only thing I have to worry about is going to the parks and everything else will be taken care of.\" Mike showed me the comp area for the guests and then showed me certain areas around the 7th floor that I may be interested...then, he allowed me to do an early check-in...mind you my flight came in at 9am and check-in is 3pm...He graciously said that a room was ready for me and I was able to check in early...wow what a treat to be able to settle in early! The room (7108) was beautiful...top floor...small...enough for two adults and two small children... it peared over the Wilderness Lodge Villas and the woodlands ...What I truly loved was to be able to leave my patio door open all night long as we slept to get the fresh air of the great night...very quiet and peaceful. The boats were not available on the night we wanted to visit the Magic Kingdom because of the weather; however, on the last day, I was able to take a quiet boat ride by myself and enjoy the relaxing tranqulity of the lake around me. I would say the last day was my favorite because it actually reminded me that I was in New England at a ski lodge...I know this is not supposed to represent New England...however; after my friends left to travel back home and I was waiting for the Magical Express to pick me up... I walked around the property alone. It was a cold (Florida standards 60 degrees) light mist rain and very cloudy...I actually looked out my patio and saw a woodpecker making all that noise...(I thought it was fake, because of the Disney effects,) but this was real. I decided to take a walk since I had some time to kill before the transportation to the airport. I walked along the pool area, the rising guyser and the beautiful streams... the mist of the chilling rain and the rising smoke coming from the chimney of the Tarpoon Bar made it all so special. No one was around and it seemed like I had the whole place to myself.... ...very nice white sand beach, hot tubs to relax after the long walk around the theme park and shopping...and moreover; the Artist Point restaurant is fantastic...we has the oyster cerviche appertizer and the salmon and veal chop as an entree...wonderful and melt in your mouth!!! In essence, my other conceirge was Kevin (who had a great sense of humor) and was excellent with providing top notch service, while we were there, made our weekend vacation fantastic! . The Wildneress Lodge is an overall beautiful entity to stay...I recommend the conceirge level on the 7th floor...because the service is outstanding...and the overall stay, will hopefully make many memories for many more people to visit this outstanding resort.

I had really high expectations, and it was even better than I thought it would be. Here is what I liked: I liked when we stepped out of magical Express we were greeted and escorted to the check in. We asked for a Woods view room and received it... before check in time! Our room had a view of the castle! I loved the balcony and overlooking the pond and all the trees. It was quiet, and relaxing. The Pool - It was plenty big that you never felt on top of eachother. I loved the double jacuzzi's in the pool area and the pool facing the lagoon and also the lodge- the brook that went into the pool. Agh, I can't expalin or say enough about it. So nice! The waterslide was perfect for my boys ages 4 and 7! I loved the boat to Contemporary and Magic Kingdom. What a way to feel relaxed after a day in the Magic Kingdom!! Or going to dinner at the Contemporary and getting there by boat- so nice! The atmosphere of this hotel was so comfortable- relaxing- romantic- peaceful. I just loved it. I loved the big porch with the teak chairs overlooking the courtyard. I loved the walk way to the boat. The fireplace in the lobby with the rocking chairs. The rockers in front of the brook that goes outside.... AMAZING place! I loved sitting in the jacuzzi and hearing the music from the Electric Water Pageant and going out to the beach to watch it with my boys.... I love the look of Artist Point and want to try it on my next trip! I loved the dimmer switch on the lights in the room- it was great as a nightlight and made my kids feel very comfortable in a strange hotel room! I LOVED that we didnt need to walk outside to get our morning coffee! Having everything in one building/lodge was really nice!

I'm glad we were there to see all the decorations...they were magnificent both inside and out. The lodge is not too large and there are many public areas that are intimate and relaxing. The pool area - both at the main lodge and at the villas were lovely and restful. Guests of the lodge and villas may utilize all facilities. The beach area was nice although you cannot go into the water. The boat rentals were fun to use...my son went out on a Sea Racer (he is 12) and the rest of us went out on a Boston Whaler. It was a lot of fun. We didn't have time to take out the bikes - but if we stay here again...we would definitely do that to take advantage of the trail system. As we do enjoy making some of our own meals, as a family, we would probably prefer to stay in the Villas. More space and kitchen facilities - but nicely connected to the Lodge by a covered walkway.

We have visited Disney World for the last 7 years staying @ Pop Century (1) Caribbean (2) Polynesian (1) & Wilderness Lodge the last three years. Unfortunately, the bus service @ the Lodge, a deluxe hotel, was the worse & did not improve year to year. Our last stay was the most frustrating as far as transportation goes! We spent 10 days @ the Lodge & waited daily for over 35 minutes for parks. I will share two of the longest waits. The first was the biggest dissappointment because it was to the MK. We waited for 38 minutes for a bus to the MK.....a 2 minute bus ride!! Why?? Even with the stop to GF it should never take 38 minutes. We, along with another family, complained to the WL & the bus showed up about 5 minutes later. This was not an isolated experience but instead a daily occurrence. The MK bus was never less then 20 minutes & again the bus ride takes 2 minutes. They also have a boat ride to the MK but often we started our day before the first boat was due to arrive. Second, was the bus to Typnoon Lagoon. Allow @ least an hour for this trip both ways. The problem with this bus is it goes to the GF, Fort Wilderness, Downtown Disney & then to Typhoon Lagoon. You add all that to a 30 minute wait for the bus & it's not a magical start to your day!! We love the beauty of the WL & of course the convenience but they need to really improve the bus service! Although we love staying on property we are thinking of staying off property @ the Hilton & driving to the parks to save time & frustration! We would be giving up the experience but we stay & pay for the deluxe for convenience. You take that away & we can get a better overall resort off property without the frustration of loosing hours waiting for a bus!! It's not fun to start or finish the day waiting waiting waiting!!

We had been here once before and decided to come back because of it's cosy feel and short distance from the magic kingdom. When we arrived from UK we had a few problems at check-in because our travel company had not applied our tickets and dining plan to our reservations. The staff at the Wilderness Lodge could not have been more helpful. Because of the time difference they would not be able to correct the mistake till the next day and said they would do this first thing tomorrow and said we should charge any food to our card and they would take it off our dining plan the next day. They even sent the manager, Benett to reassure us that everything would be sorted and he was extremely helpful and friendly as were all the staff. Sure enough when I went to the lobby at 8am the next morning everything was sorted and our dining plan sorted, I was very impressed. Our room was cleaned every day to a high standard and despite being a adult couple I still loved coming back to a new towel animal in our room. The roaring fork was great, and we were allowed to get food and bring it back to our room. However, after 10 days we did a bit bored of burgers and chicken nuggets but still great for a quick bite. The pool was very quiet during our stay and I loved relaxing in the hot tub and having fun in the pool. Being an adult couple we didn't get involved in the children's party by the pool but it looked like fun. The only comment on the pool is that it didn't seem overly clean first time we went in, however we put this down to it being an outside pool and leaves would envitably sneak in and it was the late afternoon. But when we went in the next morning it was still filled with leaves or dirt which kind of put me off. It did get better through the stay though. We had no problems with transportation as the buses were always only 10mins wait. However, we begun to find that the bus to the Magic Kingdom was faster than the boat because it was less busy but not as nice as sailing across the lake.

The whispering cannon restaurant is amazing the staff are soo funny and you have to take their mannerism with a pinch of salt as its whole part of the act. The food there is mouth watering and the buffet for breakfast is a must try and they bring the buffett to you so if your funny about sharing food with strangers you dont have to worry at all as they cook to order. The rooms were comfortable and access to all the parks are excellent as you only have to share a bus with the grand floridan so you dont have loads of bus stops before you get to your hotel. if your coming from the UK the dinning plan is a HUGE MUST. Its value for money is excellent at first its a bit confusing on what you can have etc but once you get the hang of it the amount of food you get is excellent. But BOOK the table in UK online before you go out there as everyone on a dining plan books ahead and therefore getting a table can be hard. One thing i must say that everyone if they can do it you must its excellent.

The bags were automatically sent to the hotel (which was nice). We were the 1st to get to our hotel (seeing as there were only 2 other families on the bus) we walked into the lobby and began our check in process when the bus driver came running up to us with our stroller which we had forgotten in the undercarriage. So nice of him!! The staff at the desk were extremely helpful, we were originally given a room on the 6th floor but my husband had recently hurt his back so we asked for a ground level room and they upgraded us to a woods view at no charge! The room was right near the boat dock and a short walk to the quick service restaurant and the pool. The boat transportation was the best! I loved not having to wait very long and enjoying the relaxing ride being able to look at the other hotels you pass on the way! We always timed out the boat ride making sure not to leave right after the fireworks finished or right when the park was about to open. I would like to say on a personal note we encountered a very nice cast member named Olga working at the pin shop. She was the nicest lady! We decided to get our first pins and lanyard from her and she even gave us a few pins of her own! I won't forget the wonderful service we encountered while we were there! We will definitely be making a trip back next year!", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hollywood, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "thebellcaptain", "ReviewID": "UR123339170", "Content": "We stayed at Disney's Wilderness Lodge from December 3rd through the 17th. Great time to stay, as the Christmas celebrations around Disney World are in full swing, but without the tremendous crowds. We had booked the hotel in January of 2011, in order to lock in a good price and to guarantee our room. We completed on-line check-in ten days before we arrived, which made check-in a breeze. The cast members working the front desk were extremely pleasant, and answered all of our questions regarding transportation and room availability (we arrived at the Lodge at 7AM, well ahead of the 4PM check-in time). We were assigned a room on the fifth floor, overlooking the swimming pool by the Villas. I would recommend the fourth or fifth floors in either of the wings, as the sounds from the lobby and the Whispering Canyon Cafe will not carry that far. Food at the Roaring Fork, which is their quick service restaurant, was very good. Breakfast platters were always tasty. Hamburgers were pretty good. I wouldn't recommend the pizza, as they were just so-so. Service was excellent. Room service is very expensive, but the delivery and presentation was fantastic - food was still hot, and the ice cream was still frozen. We ate at Artist Point, which has fork-tender Filet Mignon and excellent Bison steaks. The drinks are not watered down, and with a full-service bar they can mix any drink you desire. Artist Point is very expensive, and I wouldn't recommend it for families with small children, but I highly recommend it for couples looking for a romantic evening. Housekeeping was fantastic! Mimi, our housekeeper, always kept our room neat and tidy. On our second day onward, we would always leave a note listing what we needed restocked, be it soap or toilet paper, plus a couple of dollars as a way of saying thank you for all the hard work. Every day we came \"home\" from the parks to find a different kind of towel animal, plus little chocolates, plus all the toiletries restocked in a nice and neat fashion. The few times we ran into Mimi in the halls, we always thanked her for all her hard work. I cannot stress enough how far a little kindness and a few dollars can go to ensure a clean room with little special surprises like the towel animals. We tried out the pool. Cold, but not too cold. Because it was a relatively quiet time in the resort, there were only a handful of other people in the pool, which made it very pleasant. The hot tubs were oh so nice! Warm without being hot, and they offer a great view of the artificial geyser the hotel has, which goes off every hour on the hour during the day. Boat transportation to the Magic Kingdom, Fort Wilderness, and the Contemporary Resort were pleasant and quick, with boats arriving every ten minutes or so. Bus transportation, on the other hand, does leave a lot to be desired. I agree with other reviewers in this regard - you often have to wait 30 minutes or more for the bus to arrive, and then have to travel to other resort hotels to pick up other passengers before finally arriving at your destination. Plan accordingly! The Christmas decorations were gorgeous, as well as subtle. You had to get up close to the main tree to really see the detail of the ornaments, which reflect the hotel's theme of a National Park Lodge. If you have the time, I would recommend the free guided tour of the hotel that is offered at 9AM from Wednesday through Sunday. Ask for Ranger Jack; he's very knowledgeable about the construction of the hotel, as well as the hotels that the Wilderness Lodge is based on. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Disney World, but be prepared: it is quite expensive - but well worth every penny!", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful vacation !\u201d", "Author": "Shanzylee", "ReviewID": "UR123333255", "Content": "We stayed the first week of the New Year.

During the evening and morning when we were in the room we could hear all of the toilets flushing on the floors above us. At times you could hear the flushing of toilets 10 times a minute. Not the most pleasant noise while trying to get some rest. We only ate at the resort for breakfast at the quick service location and what a joke that was especially when it got busier. The food ordering area was very small with no organization what so ever and then once you got your food and that stress was over you had to struggle to find a table to sit at. In my opinion the quick service location is way too small for the size of the resort. The real benefit of staying at this resort is the proximity to the Magic Kingdom. It was just a short boat ride away and you could even see the fireworks from the room. All the other parks and attractions were a 15-30 minute bus ride with multiple stops.

Nice touch. -Good customer relations throughout the stay.

No main on/off switch -Rooms can be noisey if you get an adjoining room, but even if not you can always either hear poolside children, or even with a woods view room the constant honking of the boat horns at 7am to 2am is a real pain. Can the boats Please stop honking every 7 minutes??? -Our room was next to a public balcony and we were disturbed regularly by noisey guests taking in the view and woken at 9am one morning by a violinist outside our room playing for a wedding of a couple getting married on the balcony next door to our room. Whilst that would have been lovely to some guests, we were not given any prior warning and were disturbed of a much needed lie in after a late night at the parks -No food in the hotel after 11pm.How can a hotel this price not have food after 11pm if you have had a late night out and have been too busy to eat at normal times? -Our room overlooked a public balcony as mentioned where people kept smoking. It was not a designated smoking area and every time we complained we were told security would sort it, but they never ever did. It was not only dangerous and stopping us from enjoying our balcony, but also made our rooms smell every day of smoke. I complained 6 seperate times. Once 3 men were smoking cigars which took an hour to smoke, and thats why I know security never came as they had time to finish smoking them. -Internet wifi in rooms was a nice idea, but a nightmare. For our 9 day stay it was drop off after 30 seconds at most. It was completely unuseable from your room. There is no longer an option of a cable connection. You had to go to the main lobby to get a solid wifi connection. I asked for help resolving this and the IT technition said it was because too many people were using guest wifi in the rooms. This was all day and night though. We were in room 4075 by the way. -Chairs in lobby area are quite uncomfortable and there are no quiet areas to sit and read in this hotel due to the lobby being so noisey from the whispering canyon cafe. -The beach is nice, but tiny. Lovely to sit on when quiet, but Absolutely tiny and used by the hotels childrens club which meant dodging footballs all afternoon. -The so called quiet pool is not quiet and gets no sun so is pretty pointless. -The main pool plays very loud music from a huge speaker all day long. - First deluxe resort I have stayed in that doesnt offer a turndown service on an evening.

We found the resort to be beautiful, although after 14 nights the room did get a little on the small side for 2 adults and 3 kids (ages 8, 4 and 18 months). The roaring forks had some great food and we ate there often - get the adult chicken nuggets instead of the kids, the meat is much better. The surrey bikes were heaps of fun, and the pool was awesome. The boat to the MK was great, although did get busy at peak times. Sometimes the buses seemed a bit out of synch - for example, HS would have early morning EMH, but there would be no buses for 20 minutes but you would see 3 for Epcot. That got a bit annoying, but the buses did not take too long to get places once you were on them. Just to mention, the laundry was a good size too and we never had any problems getting a washer or dryer, although you needed 2 cycles of the dryer to get the clothes dry. All in all we had a really enjoyable stay, and would definitely stay at the WL again, but maybe in the Villas, which look beautiful!", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aiken, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cAverage rooms, exceptional property\u201d", "Author": "mdv76", "ReviewID": "UR122094079", "Content": "We were there the week before Christmas so the lodge was decorated beautiful for christmas.

One can save a ton of money by staying off property. However, the downside is constant use of one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own vehicle to get back and forth from the parks. Also included is the additional expense of more gas consumed, and parking fees. Another option is to stay at one of the lower-cost hotels on Disney property. This allows the tourist to leave their car parked, and the cost of theme park vehicle parking is bypassed. The downside of this is that it may cost a bit more to stay on Disney property, and the only form of mass transit for these types of Disney resorts are buses. Lastly, is the most expensive but time-saving and least stressful way to stay at Disney; a hotel around Bay Lake. I have camped at Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fort Wilderness most of my life. The boats and buses made it easy to get around. The first time I stayed in a Disney hotel was the Port Orleans, Riverfront. It was a nice hotel, but the lack of buses made wait times a maddening experience. For the holidays, my wife and I decided to do it up, and go all out. We got a great Florida resident rate for Disney's Wilderness Lodge, so we booked it. PROS: Location: I love any Disney property that overlooks Bay Lake. It was quiet and the property is beautiful. Transportation: With buses and boats at our disposal, we rarely had to wait to get where we were going. We opted for the boats, because I prefer them, and there always seemed to be a boat on the way. The ease of transportation made our stay at WL totally worth the price. Resort: This place has to be one of the nicest hotels on Disney property. It has an outdoors feel of Fort Wilderness, but the elegance of the other resorts on Bay Lake. Room: Our room was set up quite nicely with details and furnishings only Disney could afford to pull off. The bathroom was roomy and had plenty of good water pressure. Water temperature was also on point, and the room was clean. The bed was soft, and we had plenty of pillows. Safe: The safe is a small key type, and securely held all my valuables. Balcony: Our balcony was nice and overlooked a small pond. Restaurants: We ate at Roaring Fork, and Whispering Canyon. They offered nice items. WC is a funny place to eat because the servers yell and carry on. CONS: -Our room was across the way from the boat thoroughfare. We were awoken daily at 7am with Disney boat horns as the vessels would approach the WL dock. -Our room was next to the elevator. At night, it was noisy with all the guests getting in and out of the elevator. -The room is lit with 4 lamps that are arranged with two over each bed. There is no master on/off switch. Each bed post has a switch for its lamp. This means that one has to switch on 4 switches to adequately light the room. -The main lobby looks impressive, but we stayed off of one of the wings towards Bay Lake. I would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve liked to stay in the central lobby area. Beyond the trivial, this is a great place to see Disney. Yes, you may spend a little more money, but the time saved in not waiting for a stinky bus is well worth it.

We picked the best resort for that! Because it's modelled after Banff and has a lodge feel, it was very cozy with a welcoming lobby and gorgeous pool, 2 hot tubs, and a geyser that goes off every hour. We had a pool view and it was very nice. The room, like at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and villas are styled to be on the darker side. The furniture, bedding, and room decor were all themed with animal carvings. Beds were very comfortable. The granite bathroom sinks were outside the room with the toilet and bathtub/shower which I like. There was a coffee / tea maker with tea and coffee and condiments; toiletries; a refrigerator; in-room safe; and ample closet and drawer space as well as 2 luggage racks. The location was very convenient - a 20 minute boat ride to Magic Kingdom as well as buses. We have been to Disney 6 times now and it always takes at least 30 minutes to get anywhere at Disney with their transportation. The bus to Downtown Disney stops at the Grand Floridian first. And do note - the only way to get to Downtown Disney from a theme park is to take the free Disney transportation to a resort first. Our room cost $240/night (35% seasonal discount). Certainly more than if you stay off Disney property but the Magical Express is included and you get the Disney feel. We also visited nearly all of the other Disney resorts to see their Xmas decor and felt most in the holiday spirit at this hotel. Joined in Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party which was great. See my other reviews regarding where we've stayed for Disney trips. I would recommend this resort. Make sure you make advanced dining reservations online so you don't have to wait or find out the restaurants are full.

Many people that we know say this is their favorite Disney resort, and I definitely can see why. This was our fourth trip to Disney in about 5 years, but our first venturing into the Deluxe resorts. For those who don't know, Disney has three \"tiers\" of resorts: Value, Moderates, and Deluxe. The Value and Moderates are all motel-style (no lobbies), while the Deluxes have often elaborate lobbies, concierges, and higher-quality \"table service\" restaurants. Some of the Deluxe resorts are located on the monorail line or have boat services to the some of the parks. The Wildernes Lodge is beautiful: the lobby is huge, with natural wood timbers throughout. During the holiday season, it is dominated by a large (probably 50 foot) Christmas tree. It is very imposing. There is a boat service to Magic Kingdom, as well as the Fort Wilderness Campground and Resort, which has a number of activities. The pool area is landscaped to continue the outdoor/natural motif. A water slide is tucked away within large boulders for instance. It looks so natural that ducks were swimming with us and were not bothered by people in the least! There's also a geyser nearby that erupts every hour. The resort has three restaurants: Artist's Point, which Disney calls a \"signature\" restaurant (read: expensive), Whispering Canyon Cafe (a family restaurant), and Roaring Forks, which is a counter-service quick service restaurant. There is a also a pool-side bar. Since we have two children, we got bunk bed rooms. Even though I know that Disney rooms are small (when compared to comparably priced hotel rooms outside Disney), I was still surprised once I saw them. This is the one thing that bothers me about the Disney resorts--they're definitely charging a premium for the service quality as well as the locale. The rooms have a set of bunk beds and a queen bed. The furniture is very heavy, so that makes the room seem smaller as well. A patio or balcony opened up to the courtyard area.There is also a flat screen TV. In our case, there was another negative to our room: it turned out there was a transformer or something located somewhere in close proximity to it which buzzed. This kept my wife and I up for the first two nights. When we complained, we were offered (and took) another dentical iroom on the same level. While this was a little inconvenient (we had to pack up and move the kids at 9 o'clock at night), we felt that the staff was very accomodating towards us. That's the best thing about this resort (and Disney in general): the service. All of the employees at Wilderness Lodge went out their way for you, and sought to make you feel that you were the only ones that mattered. As an example, I wanted to order my wife a special treat for our anniversary. Mary, working the concierge desk, not only put the special events coordinator in touch with me (she actually called me), Mary re-contacted me to make sure I was satisfied. We experienced many such instances of great service while staying here. For families, I can't recommend the Wilderness Lodge enough. It is more expensive than the moderates, but the proximity to the Magic Kindgom by boat (which is like a ride in itself), and the exceptional service provided by the staff, make it a great choice for a resort while visiting Disney.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThis sholud not be called a Deluxe Resort\u201d", "Author": "TLL1", "ReviewID": "UR121568599", "Content": "We stayed at the Wilderness Lodge between Nov. 27 through Dec. 3.

The pool is surrounded by tropical foliage, running streams and a waterfall!! Enchanting!!. There are so many activities for children, young adults, adults and grandparents to do. We have rented a small boat to skittle about in the large lagoon wizzing past other Disney hotels. Taken a romantic horse and buggy ride through the woods ( it was a little pricey) gone horse backriding through trails which was a bit boring. We went over to the Wildneress campground and rented a golf cart and had a grand time exploring. Sometimes we just come to this resort just to get away from home ( we live in South Florida) All transportation to other Disney resorts and parks are free , there is a Disney bus to take you but can get very crowded and lengthy as it stops at other resorts.

The closer you get the bigger it gets, the way it fits into the Surroundings is amazing.

Walk through the front doors and a transformation takes place, you are taken to a different place and time in history. You forget that just outside lies the pure magic of Disney. The sounds of other families, resort tour guides, the sound of the bubbling spring, yes there is a spring in the lobby, takes you away and the outside world is replaced by a Disney World. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, not that you will be spending much time in it. Back to the Spring. In the back of the lobby there is a small Bridge that goes over a babbling brook that starts with a spring that gently pours up out of the ground. Turn around and look through the huge viewing windows and an entirely different landscape unfolds. Walk out the back doors and follow the stream from under, yes under, the wall and down through a rock arch way, a short flight of stairs and you come to the end at the pool. In true Diisney fashion the pool area is now a Scenic over look as you would see in Yellow Stone. There is a replica of \"Old Faithful\" that goes of on schedule.

Plus, we had a view of MK and could watch the fireworks from our room every night. Bottom line, Wilderness Lodge is a nice resort but unless you like very old beds, you may not get a good night sleep. Here are my top 5 Disneyworld tips: 1. Get to the park early. By the afternoon, lines are way way longer. 2. Book breakfast in the park prior to opening time. This will get you inside the park before everyone else. 3.Buy an advance photo pass CD. You will save $50 on the regular price. Well worth it! That way, you don't have to carry the camera around plus, the photographers have all the best picture spots throughout the parks. 4. You don't really need a step-by-step touring plan. The only plan you need is this: Go to the most popular rides first thing in the morning and get a fast pass for the rides you want to go on again. Study the park maps before hand to quickly locate your favorite rides. After that, enjoy the rest of your day! 5. Get a wait time app. It is a great tool which can help you decide where to head to next. There are several apps out there but our favorite is called \"Magic Guide\" which shows the wait time on a map. There is plenty info on the web regarding WDW. Do your research and have fun.

The prices at the Whispering Canyon restaurant were a bit pricey ($28 for waffles, suasage, and coffee for wifey and I...not including the tip) however the food was good to very good. The cafeteria style restaurant's (Roarin' Forks) food was poor at best. The seating area is very small and congested, especially from 8 AM til 10 AM. Our room was sufficient, but I was expecting more from the bathroom area being a deluxe Disney hotel (very basic and similar to what you would have at Port Orleans Riverside).

We decided to \"upgrade\" to a deluxe resort and had received a 35W% off promotional pin from Disney which made the difference from moderate to deluxe level a negligible amount. If you've made it to this review you've no doubt come across countless others which sing praises about the resort, staff, location and value- this review will do the same, but from the perspective of a 30-something couple with 2 young children in tow under the age of 6. Location/Transportation- PRIME!!!! I do not care what anyone says about monorail resorts, as they have nothing on the WL and it's quick boat ride across 7 Seas Lagoon. Boat's serving the resort under a red flag arrived approximately every 10-15 minutes, while blue-flagged boats which hit WL, Fort Wilderness and the Contemporary came with the same frequency. There was no greater joy than leaving ML at closing, to see 600 people lined up for the monorail while the red flagged boats within the same walking distance were truly \"walk-on.\" Being so close to the MK meant that the other resorts were no more than 20 minutes away by resort shuttle bus. My only complaint here is that for Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom, WL shares a bus with the Grand Floridian, which added an extra 10 minutes to any bus ride, as you went out further to pick up GF guests, only to then turn around and come back past the WL on your way to a park. Again, this is a minor thing but worth mentioning as we were somewhat suprrised. given that both are deluxe-category results. Room- We had booked a courtyard view with bunk beds and requested an upper-floor so that we could take in the view of the pool, Bay lake, etc. I'm happy to report that the hotel didn't honor that request and we received a first floor room, just steps from the pool. With 2 small kids this particular room couldn't have been any more ideal. Bunk beds worked out great, side rails were provided within 10 minutes or our request, used on the lower bunk. Linens were very fresh, room was immaculate and loved the separate vanity/tub/toilet setup. My only criticism here- with 4 people, the room does feel a bit \"small\" and \"cramped,\" but we spent so much time outside of the room, whether it was on the property or parks that the size of the room wasn't much on an issue. The only other critique here, again, not a major one- lighting in the room is not the best. I know that Disney was going for a \"rustic\" look in the rooms, and they've accomplished it, however, lighting could still be improved, since what's provided it fairly basic and doesn't serve to really compliment an otherwise stellar room experience. Setup was a queen bed, bunk beds with twin matresses, desk with 2 chairs, in room fridge, safe (keyed), closet, dresser with limited drawer space (we normally live out of suitcases) and bathroom 2 sinks, storage below vanity, hairdryer, coffee maker, toilet, tub and shower with curtain. This room was considred a \"Courtyard with Bunk\" in terms of pricing category. Grounds- Disney hit their mark here as you really do feel as though you're staying at lodge nestled somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. The lobby is truly awe-inspiring and the attention to detail in terms of landscape design (greens, pool) is flawless. Pool is large and seating around the pool is quite ample. You never felt as though you couldn't find a seat near the edge of the pool, even on days where the weather was just perfect. Loved the touch of the geyser and hot springs, and the beach location, while we didn't visit it other than to rent watercraft, was picturesque. From the moment you step onto the property, you're firmly convinced that your hotel is somewhere outside of central Florida. Food- We have eaten at Whispering Canyon in the past and love the food, along with the service. The place seems to be always packed to the gills and the food is really quite good. We always seem to opt for the skillet and everyone leaves with a full stomach. The Roaring Forks quick-service restaurant is limited both in terms of choices and seating- I suppose that we were spoiled by the Caribbean Beach last year. We did not eat at Artist Pointe during our stay.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOur new favourite Disneyworld Hotel\u201d", "Author": "potosalinas", "ReviewID": "UR119504262", "Content": "Spent 7 nights here from Sep 14 - 21, 2011 and had a ball. The only reason we would consider staying outside of a Disney resort is because it's such a challenge to get the kids away from the hotel! No zero-entry pool but our toddlers didn't mind, the little kiddie pool was deep enough (~12\") and kept them entertained for hours. The hotel itself looks awesome from the lobby to the surroundings. The playground on the beach and the beach itself on the seven seas lagoon were a lovely touch and we felt added to the magic, especially every evening when the water parade would come around.We rented a 4-seater \"bike\" (forgot what they're called) and took the kids for a ride to Fort Wilderness and on the way saw some squirrels and were even lucky enough to see a deer! Plus it was nice to just enjoy a quiet ride away from the business of the parks. The boat rental provided a similar level of relaxation which we enjoyed. The room was pretty standard, clean and comfortable which was all we wanted/needed. Occasional towel animals waiting for our return to the room were a nice touch. Only one minor problem and that was the internet playing up. Was fixed in minutes and we even got the 24 hour period free! I can see how some people felt the rooms were small because if our kids (aged 3 and 2) were a lot bigger it might start to feel cramped but we'd still feel cozy. Bottom line is don't expect the Waldorf Astoria and you won't be disappointed. Even though there are no Magic Kingdom views, our room (courtyard view) allowed us to watch the fireworks every night over the resort which we thoroughly enjoyed and the kids looked forward to each night. Whispering Canyon was awesome and is worth experiencing at least once! We loved it and would love to do it again but our location makes it a little difficult! Roaring Forks was good enough to keep us satisfied when we were too tired to venture anywhere else to eat with its standard fast food fare. Can't fault the transport system as it was always prompt but we'll probably rent a car next time just to make things more convenient. Plus you get free parking anywhere in Disney and no need to get up extra early to catch the bus for a breakfast reservation! Overall it was a great stay and we can't wait to go back.

Breakfast was the same each day cereal and fruit, lunch cookies and goldfish, dinner hot appetiser, chilli, pot stickers, chowder and salad, cheese and crackers, dessert was a cobbler. The staff were very friendly and always looking to chat, and always ready to welcome you back after your day out.

I will have to say, hotel aside the weather was miserable!!! I would not recommend going during the summer if at all possible--the crowds are ridiculous and the weather is terrible. However, our family was impressed with some aspects of Wilderness Lodge. It was our first Deluxe category stay at Disney and we were interested in finding out if it were worth the extra money we paid. The transportation to Magic Kingdom is a cinch. Not enough good things can be said about having a direct boat to the Kingdom. Epcot isn't too bad as it is easy to take the boat and then get on the monorail. Of course endless walking is involved, but this IS Disney. Now, if you want to go to Hollywood Studios, Downtown Disney, or Animal Kingdom, prepare for the longest 4 mile bus ride of your life. First the bus must stop at Ft Wilderness Campground, and that is out of the way quite a bit. This was a big downer for my family but we spend more time at MK than any other park so I think that we can let that go. The hotel has a beautiful theme and grounds and two queen size beds. Our room was upgraded on arrival to have a nice view of the pool and the geiser. I will say for those sensitive for noise, ask for a different room. On the 5th floor we could still hear the pool music loud and clear. They do stop that before too late though and its fine with the doors closed. The Whispering Canyon and Artist Point are both nice places for dinner or breakfast, which made life easier, no reservations were needed for either. Not much more to say, its a Disney Hotel and when it comes down to it, even the deluxes lack luxury of even a Holiday Inn, the internet is NOT free, and there is no free continental breakfast. Regardless, in Disney you are paying for the privilege of staying in a themed hotel with proximity to the parks. We have stayed at the Pop Century, Port Orleans Riverside, and Coronado Springs Hotel in the past. Out of these, Wilderness Lodge wins out on theme and proximity.

First impressions are lasting impressions and the drive up as well as the lobby are stunning. I traveled with my wife and my 5 year old daughter. The room was a good size but we paid extra for a view but the view we had was mostly of other balconies and a little bit of the pool. We were close to the exit to the pool/geyser area, which is very impressive. We booked a 2pm lunch at the Whispering Canyon Cafe because we heard that it was very lively and fun for the kids. I guess our time was too late because it was not what we expected. The waitress tried her hardest to but there was no atmosphere since there were only 4 or 5 tables. There seemed to be more life when we walked by the Cafe later in the week so I'll put it down to bad timing. The quick serve restaurant was good. There was a great selection and it we never waited long for our food. The location was great for access to the Magic Kingdom. There is a boat that's only a 5 minute trip right to the front gate. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus to the other parks. The one thing I liked was that the bus only stopped at the campground before going to the park and was the first stop on the way back. My sister-in-law stayed at the Broadway Inn and was the 4th or 5th stop on the way back from some parks. As usual in Disney, everyone was very helpful. From the front desk, to housekeeping to the shop, everyone was great. I preferred Animal Kingdom only because of my daughter's experience. It seemed like there was more for her to do and waking up to a giraffe eating from a tree right outside your room was unbelievable. The Animal Kingdom Lodge was as impressive, if not more, than Wilderness Lodge and the pool area was great. People had issues with Animal Kingdom being too far away from the parks and long waits for the buses but I didn't find this an issue. When it comes to comparing the 2 lodges, I guess it just comes down to taste. We honeymooned in South Africa and our daughter loves animals so that's why we lean toward AKL.

The lobby is a \"WOW!\". Rooms are clean, as is almost always the case with Disney. Pool area is not big enough for all the tons of people who stay here, but the water is kept warm and the surroundings are pleasant with lots of \"rocks\" and pine trees. The pool is especially nice for kids, because during the day, the Disney folks do poolside Bingo, a dunk tank sort of thing where kids can try to get their dad's wet, and there's a pool volleyball net. There's also a small slide, but this is strictly for real young kids. The bus stop is a short walk from the elevators, but a nice tip is the boat ride you can get from the dock behind the pool to Magic Kingdom, which is a nice break from the busses, and a GREAT way to leave the park and get back to the hotel, especially if you're willing to leave a little before the fireworks wrap-up. The restaurants are nice, but here's a tip... for a very affordable hot, tasty breakfast, head to the small snack shop near the entrance to the pool. You can get enormous bacon-cheese-and-egg croissants here for about $5.50 and they let you walk the food back to your room, using provided trays. You can buy juice, too, and if you have leftovers, most rooms have a fridge, so, \"Viola!\". For about $8 a pop, you can get two Mickey Waffles. I would highly recommend the Bananas Foster. Again, this is a cheaper alternative for familes who don't want to waste time and tip money on table service in the morning. You can also get cheap lunch sandwiches and even fudge a cheapo dinner here, if you happen to be at the hotel. There's a nice bar that will allow you to take drinks into the lobby in the evening, or out on a nice, quiet deck just off the lobby. Oh yeah---this is typical Disney---I had accidentally left my room key after using it to charge a drink at the bar, and the bartender tracked me down on the outdoor deck to return it, all with a smile.

February is a nice time to visit WDW because not all of the schools in the country are off, so it's not crowded, and by that time, I really need a break from the snow, ice and cold! Ask for a room with a Wood's View in the North Wing if you like a more peaceful vista. On the higher floors- 5&6- you might get a glimpse of the fireworks in the Magic Kingdom- but I love the ground floor rooms in the center of the hallway; easy access to the lobby on one side and the end door the pool and the dock on the other end. The best part is that you can watch the otters play in the pond outside your patio window! Mousekeeping was great, as usual, and it's always fun to see if any towel animals are waiting somewhere in your room when you get back from the parks! Don't forget to tip them EACH day, because you may not get the same person every time. While the waters in Bay Lake can impact the ferry runs to the MK, but it was running and is the fastest way to get to the MK. In the colder months, it's nice to grab a lounge chair and sit on the narrow white beach ,listening to the waves lapping on the shore while the kids rent bikes and head over to Fort Wilderness! Then go back inside and curl up with a book in front of the huge fireplace or in the second floor window seat overlooking the Lake. The Wilderness Lodge is considered a \"Deluxe\" Resort, and the rooms here (and at the Animal Kingdom Lodge) are a little smaller than at the other Deluxes, but there are often some really good deals to be had if you ask when making your reservation.

As there were 5 of us we were forced to book adjoining rooms. This was a bit annoying as we usually request a cot for our son, and all of stay in a single room. But this is Disney, and you know what that means to your wallet. Plus this is one of the \"premium\" hotels in DW, so my typical frugality would be frowned upon. The rooms were spacious and clean, with towel animals left by housekeeping, a mini fridge, and double sinks outside of the bathroom. Both rooms had balcony's that overlooked the pool. The room and decor are in need of an update as it did feel kind of gloomy with the dark prints and overly painted woodwork. I believe the hotel was built in 1995 so it is due.

Two of us had visited Wilderness Lodge before, and two of us were first timers to WDW. We opted for early check-in, and arrived at 8:00am. As we were leaving the security checkpoint, we overheard the guard radio ahead to the lodge, and so when we pulled up at the front there were attendants waiting for us. (actually, they were dancing while our car pulled up) They unloaded our luggage and checked it in with Bell Services. They use a barcode system so it was quick and painless. We opted to self-park and got a spot right in front of the building. During check-in our attendant tried to get us into a room right away, but when there were none available he collected our cellphone number, and we received a text when our room was available (about 10:00am) Meanwhile our luggage stayed with Bell services. When we got back to our room at night our luggage had not made it up, but we checked with Bell services and they sent it up right away. The room was much larger than I was expecting, on the 2nd level. We had a terrace overlooking the pool. We paid for a standard view room, so I am not sure if this was actually standard view or if we were upgraded because of space... Either way we were not complaining! The room had a fan and AC, and they were quick to bring up extra pillows. The soaps were pretty nice, and the room had nice touches. It is too bad that we did not spend more time there but there is too much to do outside the room! A few other reviewers have mentioned that it is annoying that room service ends at midnight, and I would agree: We got back very late from the park and would have loved to have some snacks brought up, or to be able to use our bottomless mugs at the snack counter for some coffee or pop. Unfortunately everything was closed up tight and in desperation we ended up ordering Dominos Pizza. We would also agree that the fee for internet use is a little bit 2001. I know that it would cost Disney a lot to support a free wireless network, but we are paying a lot to be there, and if Super 8 can do it, Disney should be able to figure it out. The pool area was very clean, and there were a LOT of towels available, even well after \"closing\" hours. It was great to come back from the park and have a warm swim and soak our feet in the hot tub. The smaller pool at the Villas was nice to try out, but neither were busy by the time we had a chance to try them out (very late at night and early in the morning). Above all, convenience of the parks, and the service from \"cast members\" was what makes this hotel worth the money.

Three adults and 3 children (17, 15 and 10). Since we had a large number in our party, we were upgraded to the Concierge Service. Check-in was a breeze. We were a little early, but were hand delivered upstairs to the Concierge Lounge and had refreshments while waiting. Check-in staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful during our entire stay. I don't believe we waited more than 45 minutes for our room (early flight) and were given a room next to the pool area, which was great for the kids. Room was a bit cramped for the number of people, but honestly, we were there for the parks, play, swimming and exploring. Sleeping, showering and a quick rest was the main use for the room which suited us just fine. The hotel itself was immaculate and cleaning staff was fantastic. The pool was great and well supervised by lifeguards. My daughter loved the on-going activities around the pool area. She and I also enjoyed some of the nightly movies on the beach. The teenagers loved the game room. The VIP Level Lounge offered a quick breakfast. We would leave early in the morning, so always grabbed something the day before for a quick breakfast for the kids. Nightly snacks, appetizers and FREE alcoholic beverages were great. The Whispering Canyons was hysterical. I think you need to have a personality that matches the antics-if you are looking for something quiet, it is NOT the place for you. We loved our waitress and the continual noisiness of the restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised when the Head Cook came out and visited with me due to my severe tree nut allergy. Going into restaurants and eating food that I have not cooked myself is extremely scary, however he walked me through the menu and even made me a special desert. We used the bus system quite a bit, which may be the only complaint, as some times we needed to wait a long time. Another complaint is the lack of internet - would have liked to have posted pictures for the family back home, but as mentioned, we were not in the room that much.

The Whispering Canyons restaurant is so unbelievably noisy, yet quite plain, boring and bland inside. The Artist point restaurant is too posh and you simply cant relax with those type of prices and lack of atmopshere. They miss a trick with not having a view of the fabulous woodlands or pool areas from the restaurant. I also find it hard to believe that hotels that cost this much dont have a bar in the lobby or main area to sit and relax in. If there was one, we certainly couldnt find it. A woodland view room can get quite tedious after several days, and a standard view room can leave you overlooking delivery lorries day and night. However online it is impossible to book any club level rooms so goodness knows how you do that. The pool was unuseable in December due to the cold weather and Disney really need to consider indoor pools at their hotels. The health club had minimal and often broken equipment. I find it incredible to believe that a hotel in 2011 does not have wifi access in rooms and room service stops at midnight. What are you supposed to do at 1am for food when you return from your extra magic hours? Especially when most food outlets are closed in the parks by that time. Even a sandwich would suffice but you wont get anything here. The room does not have a stocked mini bar. I cant remembert the last time I paid \u00c2\u00a3300 per night for a hotel room without a stocked mini bar, no wifi, a small room, and no room service after midnight. I think the improvements to customer relations need to be looked at at this hotel more than any other. Staff walk past you without aknowledging you and the check in staff can be very rude. I had to ask for our honeymoon badges and she then didnt even congratulate us. She just looked as if to say \"how old are you\". It was very embarrassing. Especially after we had queued for 45 minutes to check in. It was so slow and the room we had requested (woods view) was not what we were given. It was the reason we spent so much money on a deluxe resort, to get deluxe treatment, but the staff at the wilderness lodge really fall behind the Coronado Springs resort whos staff were extremely friendly when we stayed there. We also had huge problems booking online and Disney would not allow us to carry our Dining plan accross from The Coronado Springs Resort where we had spent our first 6 nights and bought 14 day park tickets, into the Wilderness Lodge where we moved to for Christmas Eve and our final 7 nights. Its disgraceful and Disney really need to close this loophole with the disney dining plan booking problems. I find booking with Disney so restrictive in that you can not contact the hotel directly and ask for a bottle of champagne on arrival for your wife etc. You send email after email that goes unanswered and telephone operators, apart from Dsiney Dining operators, can be extremely rude.

The theme pulls you in as soon as you walk in the door, you are surrounded by sights, sounds and scents that all work together to welcome you. To get to the parks you can step out back and take a a short boat ride or take one of the many buses that stop on a regular basis. (note: this is the one resort on the lagoon that is not connected with the monorail, mind you that wouldn't fit in very well with the theme, but you can always take a boat to the Contemporary and then use the monorail if you like). Every hour during the day \"Old Faithful\" erupts out back next to the pool. And if you find you are at the hotel in the evening instead of one of the parks, make sure you take a stroll down by the docks. Each night they have a light parade on the water that is not to be missed (ask the front desk for the time they are scheduled to come by). As with Disney in general, that cast members go above and beyond for you. They will check you in and hold your luggage while you go to the park if your room isn't ready yet. They can help mail gift items home for you. And they are always friendly and welcoming. When deciding on my rating I was torn between \"Excellent\" and \"Very Good\" only because of the expense. I mean it's not everyday that I would spend hundreds of dollars on a room at a hotel. But then I thought I had to be more fair and objective about it, the only way to do that is to compare it to the other hotels that are of the same level of service and in the same area.

This was the last day of our trip and the first time we stayed onsite. It was supposed to be a highlight and we splurged to stay here. I was expecting a lot of Disney magic, but did not find it. With that said, however, the foyer was beautiful and breath-taking. It had a gorgeous fireplace and a creek that flows down to the pool. We were excited to be there and couldn't wait to get to our room. The young lady who checked us in, however, was less than enthused. She did not exude any of the Disney charm that we had previously heard about. Another family was being checked in by another cast member immediately to our right and there was such a difference in the approach; the other lady was super friendly, excited, gave the other children what looked like Disney loot bags and constantly referred to them as prince and princess. My two young children received nothing. I'm not sure if it was an oversite or something, but my two children noticed they didn't get a treat upon check-in and the other kids did. Not a great way to start. We asked about the delivery of our luggage and the lady simply said to give our luggage tag to the bellhop. She never gave us any direction as to where or who the bellhop was. It just wasn't good enough, particularly for the money we paid to stay there. Our room was on the bottom floor and it was showing its age. We were very underwhelmed by it. The only plus was that it was located close by the pool. We paid for a courtyard view and this was really disappointing; literally, our view was of the restrooms. We found a Mickey shaped towel on one bed; nothing on the other which I found odd. I was expecting a lot of Disney extras and hidden Mickey's but was again disappointed. It was a regular room with two beds, one having a Mickey shaped towel, and the worn bedspread had hidden Mickey's as did the wallpaper. There was one Mickey shaped soap and a coat rack that had a few Disney characters on it, but that was it. Nothing magical or fuzzy. So the room and check-in was a let down. The pool area was great, though. It has a kids' slide, lots of towels and a place to buy drinks and snacks. The geiser was not what I expected, either. On the hour, it spouted out a little water, but nothing like I had read about in other reviews. I actually think they may have been having technical difficulties with it because it was so small and short in duration. Nothing great to see. My favorite part was the beach/boat rental area. Just a short walk from the pool, this area was awesome. Beautiful view, little play structure for the kids and a nice sandy beach. We rented two small raycer boats and that was a lot of fun. We travelled all around Seven Seas Lagoon and Lake Bay. It was awesome and something I would highly recommend. The other thing I loved about this resort was the water taxi to Magic Kingdom. It was only a five minute trip and it was very scenic and lovely. We even saw some deer on the way to the MK. The boat wasn't crowded and it was such a relief to know we didn't have to battle with tram lines and the parking lot at the end of the night. I loved the water taxi and its convenience. The water taxi almost made up for the let down of the room and the less-than-magical check-in. I also liked the convenience of charging items on the room card; we used it at MK and the charges showed up on our bill at check-out. It was nice not having to carry money to the park. Overall, the Wilderness Lodge had some positives: the beach/boat rental/pool area and definitely the water taxi. The negatives for us included the check-in and room in general. I know the resort is supposed to be rustic, but there is a difference in rustic and run down. I liked certain aspects of the resort, but I felt certain other things should have been better for the money we paid.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGood, Not Great, Mixed feelings on the Value\"\u201d", "Author": "Mainstream_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR116421029", "Content": "My wife and our 3 children (ages 6, 5, 2) decided to stay at a Disney property for 2 nights prior to our real vacation at Cocoa Beach.

It was ok for the kids. Pretty bland for us. - Why does a hotel that costs 300 - 400 a night have powdered coffee machines?

Hotel Room: We had two rooms located next door to each other and they overlooked the maintenance parking area...and we had no problems with noise. It was actually nice to have no one that could see into the room at night it we had the drapes open and we could see the Magic Kingdom fireworks in the evening over the trees!! The room was spotless and the decor was cozy!! Both rooms had 2 double beds and the rooms were a perfect size...and the bathroom had double sinks! You also get a coffee maker and fridge which was super! Pool: We used the pool once since we spent everyday in a park. It was very nice, a good size and the water slide looked like fun!! Hotel: The front desk staff were very good!! We were able to check in when we arrived at 10am and got our rooms immediately. The hotel is large and beautiful and the property is very nice as well!! I loved the lodge feeling!! The gift shop had everything you would need...we visited almost everyday to look around and to pick up water for the next day!! Bus and Boat: The two modes of transportation from the Lodge are bus and boat. We never waited longer than 10 minutes for either of them. The boat was really nice to use to get and forth from the Magic Kingdom and we also used it to get to the monorail!! Dining Plan: THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!

However, even though the Poly is very nice and has the relaxing tropical feel, the WL seems to be more of a family oriented resort. Our teenagers love the pool, the ability to stroll around the lodge, and of course the beautiful lobby area with the massive fireplace. On this last visit we had a wonderful room on Club Level with a PERFECT VIEW of the castle. We could watch the fireworks every night from the balcony of our room. We also enjoyed the ability to have the food and drinks available several times a day. There was always many choices including cookies, brownies, cereals, bagels, muffins, fruit, assorted juices, hot chocolate, coffee, cokes, water, etc.. The dinner meal would vary, but always a nice hot dish as well as salads and all the extras needed. Well worth it to us!! We have stayed at Christmas too at the WL and LOVE all the special added touches for the holiday season. It is so nice to come in from the parks and see that huge roaring fireplace!!

The front desk was very nice and helpful. The store had everything we needed although the prices were high (as they are througout Disney) for food/drink and medicines that we had forgotten or ran out of. We stayed at Polynesian the year before and loved the monorail access but overall Wilderness Lodge is great - it is a bit less expense and while the monorail access is nice we spent a lot of time at MK and used the boat launch so that helped with cutting down on times on buses and waiting for the bus.

There are Junior suites that have separate bedroom. These aren't on the club level, but they allow club level access. We enjoyed staying in the junior suite because of the separate bedroom, as well as the view from the balcony. We could enjoy the light show from our room! Plus, since the club has drinks and snacks available, we simply grab some bottled water and snacks and head to the parks! We have not dined at Artist Pointe since it is more upscale, but we enjoy the Whispering Canyon Cafe. The staff is greatly entertaining! The kids like the \"stampede\" when they allow the kids to \"ride\" horses through the restaurant. Not to give away any of the secrets of the entertainment, make sure you ask for ketchup!! You'll see why when you go! The pool area is very nice. There is a separate kiddie pool for the little ones. The larger pool offers a waterslide and there is a poolside bar.

My family arrived from a 20 hr road trip for 6 jam packed days of magic. We arrived right at 3pm (check in time) with wife and 4 children 14, 12, 10 and 8. We were taken upstairs by the hotel manager to the club level. Wife and I were introduced to the club level concierge team. Both ladies did a great job of making us feel welcomed. Asked tons of questions about our kids printed pictures for them to draw and walked them over to the snack area while wife and I received hotel tour. First room was on bottom floor on far side of hotel. View was non existent. Trees and shrubs only. Pretty disappointing. We called the front desk to ask for an upper floor and within 20 minutes received a phone call offering a different room. This room was in the main tower on the 6th floor. The view was priceless. Overlooked the bay, geyser, beach and pool. Again, nothing better than feeling the breeze off the lake at night and waking up the water and trees each morning. Insist on a bay view. It's worth the money!!! The resort itself has enough to consume your vacation. Two of the most memorable amenities were (1) The pool. I'm not usually a fan of public pools, but the pool was clean, lots of lifeguards, plenty of lounge chairs etc. great for families. (2) Club level service. What better way to power up before or after a day of Disney theme parks. Light breakfast in the AM, snacks in the afternoon, appetizers in the evening and desserts shortly thereafter. This was a must. The only regret was not having enough time to take advantage of all the hotel has to offer. Boat rental, watching Cars or Beauty and the Beast outside under the stars each night, great arcade, and much more. The only, I repeat only real complaint was no internet service. REALLY???? Disney come on. We paid an unGODLY amount of money for this trip and it was well worth it, but 10.00 per night for internet at a DISNEY property should be considered a crime.

Having stayed at several of the Great Lodges of the Western National Parks, we really enjoyed staying in the Disney interpretation of them. We would stay again on that account. This resort is classified as Deluxe by Disney but it's really a tweener between Deluxe and Moderate and in our case was priced like that (more than a moderate but less than most of the other deluxe properties). You might be a little disappointed in the room size and quality if you have stayed in the other deluxe properties. Our room was comfortable but not large and the theme carried nicely into the room decor. The soft goods are ready for an update. Our room had a mini fridge and a queen bed plus a 1 set of bunks. The bunks were preferable for our kids--they slept better each having their own bed. The pool area was also nice but not large enough to handle the crowd if the property is operating in hot / nice weather at near capacity. There weren't any available lounge chairs mid afternoon when returning from the parks. Contributing was the apparent lack of a pool attendant clearing left behind towels from abandoned chairs. We ate at the both the quick service restaurant and the Whispering Canyon Cafe. Food at the QSR was better / fresher than the QSR park food, and we enjoyed the WCC and were amused. Avoid rooms that directly overlook the main lobby above the restaurant due to the evening restaurant noise. The resort location is great for touring the Magic Kingdom with efficient boat transfer that we never had to wait very long for on either end. The bus service from this location however was unacceptable in our experience. We used it to the Studios and Animal Kingdom and waited > 30 minutes in both circumstances on both ends. The Studios bus route ran through the campground too contributing to making it pokey. Because the wait was so long, the bus filled for AK so we could go directly there, but it still was an hour from door to door (due to the wait) at the start of the day. My sense was that buses were filing at previous stops before reaching ours. If we stay here again, I'd get a rental car (self parking is free) and drive to the parks other than Magic Kingdom. Parking for resort guests is free at the parks. At the Wilderness resort, the Disney magic and service is very much present and well done throughout.

The flat screen TV was really nice, but the bathrooms were kind of gross. It appeared clean, but when you looked closer there was a lot of dirt on the sink. In the corners of the sink, there was a mini pile of dirt, and my toothpaste ended up with a booger on it. Ew! The shower was really nice, and the toilet had a button on the top instead of a side handle to flush it, and you have to press hard.

The only way you can have the bridge to yourself is by holding up a camera, but the lobby is actually pretty peaceful!

There's an arcade, and a package we chose, they give us 100 points, and that seemed like a lot, but each game is 75 points. The pool is a good size, and has 2 hot tubs. The only special thing however is the little slide, which closes at 10:00 pm and drops off in only 4 feet of water. The pool isn't crowded after 10, and is a little quiet the rest of the day. A great thing for everyone is you can rent boats and bikes! There's a really long trail in the woods and your boat is in a huge lake the theme park boats are in.

It started with the Disney Magical Express at the airport. The only way to go is flying and taking the bus to your hotel. I have never had so much fun. Whether a first timer or a seasoned veteran I will cherish my bus ride with my wife and son as we had a blast talking to all of the other families on the bus. We got off the bus and approached the main lobby where several Cast Members greeted us with \"Welcome Home\". It truly did feel like we were coming home. The lobby is absolutely spectacular. The height, the smell(it smells like fresh cut wood), the hot spring, the fireplace, the totems, the lounging areas, it was simply amazing. Check in was a breeze. Off to the room. The room is nice. Nothing special. The beds were comfy, the room clean, Decor was excellent. The hidden mickeys in the wall paper are a nice touch. The Cast Members leaving towel animals on the beds for our son or even better if we left his Disney characters out they would be arranged as a welcome party when we got back from the parks. Always plenty of toiletries left each day as I had to take home the Disney Hotel experience with me. Favorite part of the room was every time I walked out of the door I was greeted with the smell of fresh cut wood. I swear I think they pipe it in some how. Every morning my son and I would sneak off to the lobby to eat breakfast and right beside the Check in desk there is a little seating area with a large flat screen tv playing a loop of old Mickey shorts. It was great. At night when my snoring was too much for my wife I would venture out to other secluded seating areas to read a book. there is a small area on the 3rd floor with a fire place and two chairs that is wonderful. the rocking chairs in front of the fire place in the main hall will suck you in as well. The pool was fantastic. Kiddie pool could use some modernizing. Shame that the Moderate resorts have better pools for little ones than this \"deluxe\" hotel. The large pool is nice but much too deep for a toddler and baby pool not quite exciting enough. No happy medium. Wife visited the spa and now I have one more expensive gift I have to get for any giving occasion each year. So ladies I highly recommend the spa. She said it was assuredly the best part of the trip for her. Roaring fork was always packed at the beginning and end of the day as it is the snack, sandwich place to be. Ate at Whispering Canyon which was fun. Did not visit Artist Point, but enjoyed nightly beverages and good conversations with bartender and guests at the bar. Location - Transportation left a little to be desired. Buses were sporadic at best. Boat rides to Magic Kingdom were too few. But the nightly fireworks at MK from the beach were wonderful as was the electric float parade on Bay Lake. Overall - As I started with, it is the best trip so far.

Our room was clean and the kids loved the bunk beds. It could use a bit of remodeling (especially in the bathrooms, the tile looks old and dirty). The bedspreads also looked pretty tired.

It has a gorgeous fireplace and looks like a lodge you'd find in a national park (but much nicer). Our check in was very fast and smooth. We arrived around 10am, expecting to have our bags held while we went off to a disney park. Our room was ready though and within 15 minutes we had all of our stuff stored away and had headed out. Our balcony overlooked the pool area and the lake. The view was beautiful! The gift shop had lots of amenities, and while the prices could have been a bit lower for bottled water, it was nowhere near the price hotels usually charge for mini bar items. Taking disney transportation from this resort is not the easiest. It shares buses with the Fort Wilderness campground, and even the shortest time to a park via bus was at least 25 minutes. The water taxi to the magic kingdom was a nice option, but not super fast either. Overall, it was a nice resort. Our kids loved the pool.

We had a Wood's view on the 2nd floor. Most of the time, we had no idea we had neighbors, and the staff was incredibly friendly and very, very helpful. I had booked all of our dinning reservations prior to our arrival, but found I wanted to change some once there. No problem at all - the people at the desk in the lobby did all of this with much ease. The transportation was the transportation. The ONLY thing I can say is that if you get unlucky enough to get on a bus that is making stops at other resorts on your way to Epcot, it can take a while. Other than that, it was smooth as silk. And the boat to Magic Kingdom is the way to go. We forgot about the boat and took the bus one morning over to Magic Kingdom, and even that is pretty quick and painless. Our family has stayed at the Beach Club (my #1 favorite), the Port Orleans Riverside, The Caribbean Beach Club, The All Star Music, and now The Wilderness Lodge. I have to say that all the males in my family rate the Wilderness Lodge as their first choice as of now, and it is my very, very close second to the Beach Club. Yes, it is expensive.

Lobby is incredible, the landscaping is great, pools are beautiful, and Disney continues to worry about the little touches that Disney is famous for. Room was very clean. Air conditioner worked well (note this is always a problem at Disney lower priced resorts such as All Star Sports, Pop Century, etc.) and ceiling fan was a nice addition. We had a car, but I agree with other posters that getting to other hotels in not easy - had dinner at Animal Kingdom Lodge one night, but would never attempt that via the bus system. We decided to splurge and stay on the Club Level (Concierge Level). That was wasted money. Essentially you pay a fair amount more to get a continental breakfast and snacks throughout the day. Our room was on the 7th floor, but if you weren't in the right room your view was of trees. Top floor rooms also have solid walls up to about 4-5 feet so if you sat you saw little. Lots of employees working on the Club Level and every one of them was extremely nice, but not very helpful. As an example, we noticed a brass dragonfly desk light at the concierge podiums just off the elevators. My wife was interested in seeing if the lamps could be purchased or if we could be given the name of the vendor where we might purchase a similar lamp. Over the course of our week stay we asked 5 different CMs (employees if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Disney initiated) and never got an answer. BTW - an answer of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disney doesn't sell those items\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disney doesn't give out the vendor because ....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would have been a fine answer for us. That would be much preferred to asking for our room number so when they found out they could let us know or telling us that the woman in charge of purchasing items for the hotel was off today so they would follow-up and get back to us, yadda yadda yadda became annoying. Also, many of you who travel might think that a concierge can get things that normally you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like tickets to a Show in NY that is sold out, etc. That is not how Disney concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. We have been trying to get a reservation at Le Cellier (Canadian Pavilion in EPCOT) for several visits and they were always booked. We asked the concierge group and they basically looked up in the computer no different than what I had done a few hours prior from my laptop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I think I was faster although I only type with 2 fingers. How about checking, then taking my name and cell phone and text me if there is a cancelation during my stay. Speaking of my laptop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I agree with many other reviewers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no wireless ability in the entire hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are you kidding me? How about spending $475 for a Club Level room and I still have to fork out $9.95 for Internet access \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Hampton Inn in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who Knows Where, Georgia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gave me free wireless access earlier in the week. I'm paying $475 a night for a room and snacks and you still want me to shell out another $12 a day to valet park. Disney's greed sometimes shows - make it free that your valet guys will make much more money from tips and everyone wins. I love Disney and go there about once a year, but stop trying to test my loyalty! Worst thing was that I found myself throwing a handful of gummi bears in my mouth every afternoon to justify spending the extra money on the Club Level.

I booked a standard room because we're never there long enough to care exactly where our room is, so long as it's quiet. We were upgraded to a courtyard view when we arrived, and that was very nice. I was worried about pool noise from the courtyard, but the room was quiet. It was also located on a corner, so there was no one next to us on one side. There was never any noise. Our room was clearly aging but was clean and fine. On our last visit 6 years ago, we stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, and I believe we probably had better service there and friendlier staff, but that may be the difference 6 years makes. The AKL is rather distant, and we happened upon the Whispering Canyon Restaurant at WL on our last visit. Our wonderful dining experience there 6 years ago, & WL's proximity to the Magic Kingdom, made me decide to stay there on this trip. Our dining experiences at Whispering Canyon this visit were not as great as the one I recalled from 6 years' past. We dined there for breakfast twice and once for dinner. This is a fun, family restaurant. On our first morning, our waitress was fun and energetic. Our dinner was not the lavish canyon skillet that we remembered--my husband and I had trouble splitting it even though it was supposed to be for 2. Our waiter was nice and was prompt but lacked the energy of the servers at neighboring tables. And on our last morning there, our breakfast waitress was just a sourpuss, and our eggs were underdone and pitiful. The manager, Darlene, was wonderful at getting us into the restaurant, since it was completely booked & I couldn't make dinner reservations. We had simply walked in on our last visit to DW, and I discovered this time that we needed reservations even for breakfast. The quick service restaurant had excellent food but the options were limited. The concierge desk tried to help but didn't really go the extra mile that we experienced on our last visit to Animal Kingdom Lodge. The grounds are beautiful, and we loved the fact that we could catch a water taxi on regular basis to ride over to Magic Kingdom--and then the monorail on over to Epcot. We stayed to watch Illuminations at Epcot one night, then caught the monorail back to Magic Kingdom. We then went to the boat dock and managed to get on the water taxi just as the fireworks were going off over Cinderella's castle. That experience was much more wonderful than actually being in the park for those fireworks, as we were the next night. Our boat captain idled across the lagoon so that we could see the whole production. I can't say enough good things about the captains of the water taxis. We had terribly long waits for the buses at Animal Kingdom Lodge, but we didn't have that problem at Wilderness Lodge. The buses ran regularly. We had the deluxe dining plan, which allowed us each 3 meals a day--either sit-down or quick service--and 2 snacks each day. We were also given mugs as part of the plan (usual cost: $15 each) with unlimited refills in the quick service restaurant in the Wilderness Lodge. We like being able to eat without having to pay the huge fees that Disney World charges for food. The dining plans appear expensive but we feel that they are worth the money, and my husband likes signing checks without having to hand over money. He says that the money has already been paid. We had the premium dining plan on our previous visit, and it offered more dining options; I'm going to have to compare both plans and decide which was best before our next visit. My brother had the basic dining plan and doled out a lot more money than we did, so anything above that is beneficial. We dined at the Yachtsman Steakhouse at the Yacht Club, and it was wonderful. It cost us 2 meals each on our dining plan, but we had a large breakfast and just skipped lunch, eating our snacks instead. We also had a character breakfast at Cape May at the Beach Club; the breakfast buffet there was awesome and worth eating even if you don't want to encounter characters. The buffet included everything from cereal, fruit, waffles, croissants, to hot omelet casseroles, grits, bacon, and biscuits. Simply wonderful. I was very impressed with both the Beach Club and the Yacht Club as we waited for our reservations at their restaurants. Our daughter became tired at Epcot, so we walked on over to the Yacht Club to wait for our time (which was too near for us to return to the WL), and the lobby was quiet and elegant, despite the continuous flow of people. My daughter had a quick nap on the sofa there. I can't say the same of our time waiting in the Wilderness Lodge lobby. Several times there were noisy children running wild in the lobby; it is a family-friendly place, but one expects some manners. The Beach Club and Yacht Club just seemed to command more respect in their spaces. I will probably stay at one of them next time. I cannot comment on the pool at the Wilderness Lodge. Because we only had 3 full days at DW, we spent most of our time in the parks. We just didn't have time for swimming. The one evening that we returned and contemplated swimming, the pool was rather full for our taste, so we stayed in our room. The pool is really large, but we just aren't into crowded swimming areas.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cWedding Aniversary\u201d", "Author": "joinville", "ReviewID": "UR111023987", "Content": "After spending some time at Epcot during the Food & wine festival, we checked in at the wilderness Lodge, enjoyed the pool and had dinner at the Artist's Point.

We were told we were \"upgraded\" from a woodsview to a courtyard view. I told them I do not want a courtyard view, and rudly he said it is the only thing available. We walk into the room and we had absolutly no view. They put us in a corner where the balcony was brick and you had to stand on a chair to see anything. I complained right away and he said there are no other rooms available. At this point I am outraged. I ask for the Manager and he says he upgraded us again to a room on the 6th floor facing the Magic Kingdom. He did not tell us that it also faces the loading dock of the hotel and all you hear all day are trucks beeping when they back up to load and unload. I was too tired to complain and did not want to spoil our vacation so I sadly settled with that room. The staff is very rude and I didn't feel like fighting it. The hotel is very noisy, and you get contstantly woken up by the loud lobby and restaurants. Traveling to the different parks was a big pain, the busses do not come as often as other hotels and no Monorail connection. There is one small dinky boat that goes to Magic Kingdom that is usually full, and another smaller boat that goes to the Contemporary.

We arrived after check in time, around 5, and there was only one lonely soul working the desk. We noticed that those who had done online check-in got their own line and it was much speedier, so if this is an option for you, take it! Our check-in gal was able to finagle a king bed room for us even though we had booked a queen + bunk beds woods-view room online. The new room had a \"view\" of the villas' courtyard, which trust me, you want if you are a light sleeper. The courtyard at the main hotel was INSANELY busy and if our room had faced that we probably would have gone postal by the 2nd night! Speaking of insanely busy....this place was rockin. We could hear our neighbors very well and in fact, too well. Their kid was just going nuts every morning at 6 am and every evening at 7 pm. The sound proofing in this place could use some help and if you are a light sleeper, you might want to look elsewhere for accommodations. The room had a king bed as mentioned, a desk with two chairs and a dimming/vanity light, a TV/armoire combo, and a refrigerator in a cabinet. The fridge was a welcomed sight at first but then we realized it was cheap....or old...or both as it groaned all night long. Night two we had disconnected it. I believe all rooms have balconies and ours had a small table with two chairs. We were on the first floor and there was a walkway out in front. It wasn't so busy that it was like a scene from \"Summer Rental\" but there was a decent amount of traffic on the path, so we made good use of the curtains. The cable TV selection at Disney resorts just stinks. They did not have Versus anywhere on property, only at the ESPN bar at the Boardwalk, so unfortunately we missed our hockey game. C'mon Disney....you make way more money than I do and we at least have a decent cable package! The hotel itself has a very woodsy feel to it. There were three restaurants and a market/store. One of the restaurants, named Roarin' Forks, was good but the food was so greasy we started calling it the Greasy Spork. I was pleased, however, to find a hummus and quinoa sandwich there for lunch (there are healthy options at Disney, you just have to dig a little). The other restaurants are Artist Point - their fancy restaurant (we tried to walk up without a reservation and were turned down, so make plans in advance if dining here is important to you) - and Whispering Canyon or something to that effect. The funny thing about Whispering Canyon is that the servers are VERY loud and boisterous. If you are celebrating an event and are bashful, don't tell them as they will broadcast your event all over that place and some seemed annoyed by it while others loved it. The food at Whispering Canyon was tasty and the service was OK, not overly fast. After being turned down at Artist Point we realized we could sit inside of the Territory Lounge (attached to Artist Point), and eat off of the bar's limited menu or the full restaurant's menu. We ended up doing this twice, and had a very knowledgeable/funny server named Joey. All told, we had the cheese plate (awesome), the gnocchi (tasty), the snapper (very good), and the salad and mushroom soup (both awesome). They have good drinks in here (full bar) and I thought the wine list was priced very fairly. We rented bikes one afternoon ($9 for an hour, $19 for the day) and rode over to Ft. Wilderness. That was a lot of fun and a good way to get some exercise. I could not fault the boat service to either the Magic Kingdom or the Contemporary. It was always timely. We took the boat to the Contemporary and then traipsed around the Bay Lake resorts (Grand Floridian, Polynesian, etc), getting there either by foot or by monorail, and really enjoyed this \"tour.\" We were sniffing around the other properties to see where we'd like to stay in the future.

Cast members were very efficient in getting us into our room fairly quickly.Our room was not too far from the main elevator or the lobby. When you pay for a standard room do not expect much more than that.We did have a balcony but the view overlooked the service entrance and the garbage dumpsters-not a pretty sight.In light of this being the cheapest category of rooms available at this resort, i feel they should be further discounted to reflect this. The noise alone at 5 am with trucks beeping below us was not a welcome on the first morning of our stay.This continued all week.The room itself was clean but i did get a musty smell upon first opening the door to the room.Never had any problems with housekeeping, towels were always refreshed and even left us a towel animal one day.I did have to call to front desk to request the bed rails that i had placed on the reservation as they were not in the room when i had arrived.

There was a nice beach area/playground for the kids to play in the sand and movies were shown in the night time.Very nice for the kids and it was never crowded here.Hot tubs were nice and never overcrowded either. FOOD-Primarily ate at the counter service restaurant but found the same food choices everyday to be dull.We mainly bought breakfast items to our room in the morning to eat.There was a toaster and microwave available to use in the main sitting area.I would recommend buying the reusable mugs if you plan on buying most of your drinks here to save yourself some money.There were tables outside to eat but there were many blackbirds around the area.This was bothersome and my kids were actually afraid of them as they would swoop down and try to take food right off your plate.I actually witnessed one man come out thru the door with his tray and drop the whole thing on the ground when a bird swooped down at him.

We were contacted four separate times and assured that it would be the Most Magical Honeymoon we could imagine. We were assured that the Honeymoon Suite at the Wilderness Lodge RESORT was beautiful and Magical as well. We were asked repeatedly if we were coming to Disney for a Special Occasion and assured that is would be special and Magical. We were Very Excited\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Upon our arrival, we were not greeted as we got off the bus. We had been told to go straight to the concierge floor and our luggage would be delivered to us, however we had no way to get to the concierge floor without a key. We asked for assistance and guidance and after what seemed like much confusion and a significant amount of time someone came to get us at the Bell Captains Station with a key to allow us onto the 7th floor. As we stood outside the room we were handed a packet of information two keys and told everything we needed would be in the packet and our luggage would arrive in 2-3 hours. We were not acknowledged by name or that it was our Honeymoon. When we entered the suite we were very surprised to find it was only a King Sized Bed that barely fit the room and a Large Jacuzzi Tub that was rather difficult if not dangerous to get in and out of. This room was in no way a suite. We unpacked our bags and found that there were not nearly enough hangers, we called down to housekeeping to ask to have some delivered and were told they would be brought up. They never arrived. After we settled in we realized that we had forgotten our camera and went to the concierge station to ask if there was any place to buy a digital camera that is was our Honeymoon and we had forgotten ours. The response we got was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, just buy a cheap disposable one or have the photographers take pictures of you and just deal with it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That evening we had reservations at the Artists Point, we arrived and again though the food was wonderful and the service very nice no mention was made that we were celebrating our Honeymoon. We thought this was odd as such care was taken as we made each reservation were asked specifically if we were celebrating a special occasion. The second day we went to the Magic Kingdom and noticed people wearing buttons that seemed to identify them and why they were there: Birthday; Anniversary: 1st Time Etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We asked someone and they told us that upon their arrival they were given these and were having so much fun being acknowledged for their stay. We went to the concierge desk in the lobby and asked about this and they seemed a little baffled then after rummaging around in a desk gave each of us a button that read \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Happily Ever After\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Amazingly, we were still not even congratulated or acknowledged by any employees at this resort for our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Magical Stay for our Honeymoon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By the third day we were having to request hair conditioner be left in the room when it was cleaned and noticed that the room (the Jacuzzi in particular) was not being tended to properly. Empty bottles left on the side of the tub and no replacements for amenities. (Still no hangers). We became wary of the actual cleanliness of the Jacuzzi and decided not to use it for fear that is was not sanitary. Unfortunately this was the only feature that seemed to set the room apart as a special HONEYMOON SUITE. By our fourth day we were beginning to feel invisible in this Magical Place. We went to the concierge in the lobby and asked what was going on. We booked the Platinum Plus Package for a Magical Honeymoon and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get Hair Conditioner replaced in our room. Friends told us, that they had stayed at Disney for special occasions and were greeted with baskets of fruit a bottle of wine or champagne and fun acknowledgments and treats throughout their stay. We had not even been congratulated on our Special Day! The woman we spoke to looked confused as if we were asking for the world, my wife was nearly in tears. She said she would talk to someone to see if there was anything they could do. A little like having to ask for a gift that should have been a surprise. A few hours later we received a plate with an orange, two green apples some grapes, dried fruit and nuts with a box of chocolate and a preprinted card congratulating us on our honeymoon from the staff. It felt almost insulting that we had to Beg and be brought to tears to be noticed. Whoever, it was that helped us plan our days and reservations (we worked very hard to be sure that everything would go smoothly before we got there) failed to tell us that some of our dining reservations were in different parks than we had other events planned and it would be impossible to be in two places at once. We had to reschedule a meal at the Brown Derby one day (which turned out to be a blessing as the meal and the service was horrendous. When asked if we wanted a drink one of us said no, so the other was just ignored, then when we finally got our dessert, one of us was done and the other was promptly removed even though it was only half finished.). We missed our evening at Cirque de Soleil and dinner reservations due to the fact that although we were told we had reservations we found out that we had to arrive at least 90 minutes prior to claim our seats and could not make it in time from where we were. We were told it was an easy stroll from Epcot when we made the schedule. The following night we were scheduled to go to Fantasmic. Thank goodness we brought our itinerary with us, because we were never made aware of tickets or procedures to get to the VIP seating. After waiting for someone to help us for over 20 minutes and much confusion we were finally allowed to come through the special line and be seated. Our last full day of our Magical Honeymoon, we decided to sleep in for an hour. The housekeeper knocked on the door and I asked her to please come back. we left a note to PLEASE LEAVE HAIR CONDITIONER, as we had reservations at Victoria and Albert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant that evening. Upon our return to the room at 4:00 to start getting ready the room had not been cleaned and we had to go find a housekeeping cart to get the shampoo and conditioner we had begged for all week to be able to get ready for our Special Evening. At 4:30 there was a knock at the door for evening turndown service. Mind you the room had not been made up for the day as of yet and we were trying to get ready to go out for dinner. We asked that they come back later. 5 minutes later there was another knock on the door asking if we wanted the service or not. We declined as we were trying to get ready for our evening and the cocktail hour had not yet even begun on the concierge floor. On the concierge floor at the Wilderness Lodge Resort (we use the term resort loosely and believe at this point it should be removed from all descriptions except for the cost) it would appear that most of your guests believe this to be a dinner plan. We witnessed people in their swimming attire piling up plates of food and carrying with them not glasses but Bottles of Wine and sparkling water to sitting areas and their rooms. We were appalled by this behavior and were told by the concierge that this happens all the time there. If this is the case and although it is listed in the description of the Resort that there are certain dress codes and behavior required in certain restaurants and areas (i.e.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Artists Point, an the Concierge Floor) we feel very misled and taken advantage of. Not once were we told or was it suggested that perhaps this was not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Disney for our Magical Honeymoon Experience. We were in fact assured over and over again that the room was Beautiful with a beautiful view (which was the back parking lot) and we should expect a Magical Experience. On our departure morning we had breakfast at the Whispering Canyon Restaurant and for the first time in Eight Days was wished a Congratulations by the Manager of the restaurant only. We waited 20 years for this Dream Honeymoon and we thought that we had truly made the Perfect Choice in coming to Disney for a Truly Magical Experience. We talked about our excitement for our plans for our trip with everyone we know and even people we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Upon our return understandably everyone wants to know all about our Magical Stay and we are sure they wish to Share In Our Blissful and Magical Experience. Sitting here writing this e-mail with a Heavy Heart and Tears Streaming Down My Cheeks recounting our experience, we truly wish that our Magical Honeymoon Story would have had the Happily Ever After that was promised.

I really liked the resort and I encountered some things I didn't like, but they aren't what is keeping me from coming back. I just have other Disney resorts I like more (I've made more than 50 trips since 1991) and would give a higher priority to. The grounds of the resort are beautiful, well maintained, and really make you feel like you are far away from everything. The lobby is grand and breathtaking. The cast members were some of the nicest I have ever encountered at a Disney resort. There are plenty of amenities and services available. Every request I made (king bed, ground floor) was fulfilled which surprised me. My biggest issue with the resort is the layout. It is somewhat confusing and hard to navigate. Perhaps more directional signs with room numbers would help. Even after 4 days I kept finding myself going the wrong way, hitting dead ends, and ending up on the wrong floor to reach my destination. They give you a map at check in...I suggest you keep it with you at all times. My room was very clean and well kept. The decor isn't exactly something I would put in my own house, but it matches the theme of the resort well. The room was a lot larger than I expected and found there was more than ample space for storage. The bathroom was large and clean but had a very annoying exhaust fan that was on a motion sensor. It went on every time I even walked past the bathroom...I would have preferred to have it on a switch so I could keep it from going on/off so much. My patio faced the quiet pool which was nice. The bed was incredibly hard but I have yet to find a Disney bed that isn't. They also have the worst pillows, but again I am used to them by now. The one thing that kind of bothered me was that the linens, blankets, and towels were the exact same ones you could find in a $90/night All Star Music room. Since I was in a deluxe resort I expected something a bit nicer. Maybe only concierge guests get that. I used the pool twice and was happy to find there was a \"deep end.\" This is a rare occurrence at a Disney resort these days. It claimed to be 5ft deep but I am 5'2\" and the water was almost over my head. The pool was crowded but the lifeguards had everything under control as usual. I ordered room service for breakfast two days and they were on time and the food was good. Price wasn't too bad for room service. Another two mornings I went to Roaring Fork for breakfast and was happy with the selection. It wasn't as horribly crowded as I had anticipated...good thing too since it is a small area. I used the boat transportation many times and was quite impressed. I never waited more than 10 minutes to get a boat and the trips were quick. Maybe I just had good timing, but I definitely had planned to wait longer. The one time that I took a bus to Epcot I was the only one on it...despite that it was early in the morning and all the other buses were packed. Strange, right? All in all, I had a great trip but like I said before, I am not dying to go back. Nothing against Wilderness Lodge really, I think I would just prefer Beach Club or the Polynesian if I am going to stay at a Deluxe resort again.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cGoing above & beyond to ensure a magical stay!\u201d", "Author": "alh5908", "ReviewID": "UR108868789", "Content": "We stayed for 7 nights with our 2 children, ages 4 & 6.

As if this weren't enough, our family was involved in a car accident in our rental car about 20 miles from resort. When I called the Dining Reservation number (all I had with me) from the ER they made sure I got connected with the resort and assured me they would get our family back safely. At midnight, a cab came to pick our family up at the ER and return us to the resort. The next morning at 6am they helped my husband get all of our problems taken care of so we could enjoy the rest of our stay. They arranged for a scooter for him (he had a broken foot) and fast passes for our family.

Thanks to overbooking in our room class because of an Ironman competition this trip was amazing. Before I get to the grounds and other common areas I'd like to mention just what is included on the Club Level. We stayed in 4169, a lovely room with a view of the lake and the sandy beach area. The room had two queen beds with French doors separating the bedroom from the living room. The living room had a full sized pullout couch in it and there was a small balcony with a table and chairs to soak in the beautiful room. Our room key granted us access to the 7th floor. We had no idea what to expect but were happy to find evening snacks which included Buffalo with Edamame, Sesame Chicken Salad, Venison Meatballs, artisan cheeses and fruits, Hummus, Uncrustable PB & J's for the kids, Espresso BBQ Grilled Chicken Skewers and more. There were complimentary soft drinks and juice boxes for the kids and Widmer Hefeweizen, Heineken, Bud Light and Yuengling beers plus some nice Chardonnay wine choices for adults. There is also a huge coffee machine which can make everything from espressos to hot chocolates. We stopped hoping to get a quick snack and ate so much we didn't eat dinner later. Yes - the food was THAT good! We had previously stayed at the WL in 2004 and 2005 so it had been some time since we last visited. The grounds are still lovely with tons of wildflowers. We took advantage of the small boat transfers to Magic Kingdom and used the buses for Epcot. We swam all 3 days and the pool is large and my girls loved the waterslide. The pool bar has a nice selection of adult drinks and there are ample loungers available for all guests. We watched Old Faithful erupt a couple of times which was great and we ended up eating one night at the Roaring Forks Cafe. My girls, of course, asked for \"More Ketchup\"! The Artist Point restaurant was fabulous. I had Dungeness Crab salad which I loved. In all the prices there seemed consistent with Disney's better dining choices. The game room was a fun diversion during a rain shower and my girls were able to find some video games to keep themselves amused and they played air hockey as well.

Our first time with children (twins age 2) This place was amazing! Very expensive I must say . We stayed in the studio which is in the building with the Villas. Compared to the other hotels ( moderate) it is a little bigger but not by much ( so depending on what you want to spend you can do a moderate and still be happy).The studio had one queen size bed and one pull out sofa. Perfect for us. Sofa bed was pretty comfortable. All rooms with balcony/refrige/micro. We were located on the 3rd floor. This hotel has alot of walking to get to certain areas. The Villa where some other family members stayed the room was not much bigger then ours they just had a full kitchen and washer and dryer. Very close to MK. And you can even take the boat over there if you prefer not to take the bus. Buses did not seem to run as often as other hotels. Not sure of the reasons. It is close to Magic Kingdom but not to the other parks. Now we had stayed at French Quarters and we thought that was further away but as we found out it seems that hotel was in the middle for distance to all of the parks. I would say the only difference between the moderate and the high end hotels is what is at the hotel. There were 2 pools. The larger pool has a slide and a baby pool ( to which was great for us) it also has another pool which is pretty large closer to the Villas but that does not have a slide. And the large pool always has something going on for the kids. Rooms were very clean. And we had maid service everyday. Maids were very nice. BUT one day I noticed a maid coming out of a room with a purse that she was zipping up. THAT I DID NOT LIKE! Went to general manager at desk and asked if this is normal for them to have maids carry purses in rooms and I DID NOT LIKE THE RESPONSE I GOT. He informed me that he would have to have house keeping call me and let me know what the policy is for the maids with purses because he did not know. HELLO your the general manager? And I did not want them to have my name and number as I was not looking for my stuff to be taken. And though he took my info no one ever called me. SO BEWARE OF THAT! I would say that was the only thing we did not like. But over all it was a great hotel! If you are trying to compare I would say a moderate hotel is just as good . We did the meal plan and the quick service area is not as big as the moderate hotels but this hotel does have a full service restaurant. like I said before the buses picking you up at the parks does not seem to come as often as some of the small hotels.

At 2:00, I went back to the desk and there was another boy there. He said he didn' know why he told me that because check in is not until after 3:00. At 3:00, I went back and spoke to yet another person. He was very nice, though fake, I thought. He acted like he was going to try to find another room that was ready, but when he went over to the woman who was obviously his supervisor, she said no. Then she came over and proceeded to tell me that check in is not until 4, so technically they have another hour!!! At 3:40, I went back and started getting loud, but had no luck again. After about 5 minutes, I got the text that the room was ready and to \"have a magical day\". By this time, we were both in pretty bad moods. When we got upstairs, we saw the staff in the hall and it was obvious that the pace at which they move is extremely slow. To sum up this hotel, it is old and tired. The rooms, especially the bathroom fixtures, show the age of the hotel. The shower head is ancient and to top it off, there was no hot water. We only wanted to pay for the least expensive room, knowing we would not be in the room much, but we were shocked to see just how bad \"standard view\" is. All we could see was a parking lot for trucks (that beep when they back up at 6am) and a slimy pond. I do understand that part of the high room rate is for the transportation, which is still very good and fairly quick. In addition to this high room rate, they have the nerve to want $10 a day for internet. There is no microwave in the room, but there is a refrigerator. This is very annoying because we like to make coffee in the afternoon or after dinner. They obviously want you to go downstairs to buy whatever you want. I would never stay here again, but I do recommend staying on the grounds because it makes getting around so much easier.

Well guess what, when we got to the gate to go to our reservation we could not get in. We had used our card for another park and we could not go in. We went over to guest relations and tehy would not help us at all. They told us the only way we could go in was to purchase park hopper passes an additional 54.95 per ticket making our dinner cost nearly $400.00 for our daughters birthday. We had to cancel our reservations. My wife and daughter walked away crying their eyes out. I ask to talk with a supervisor twice but was denied both times. It is all about money with Disney. Where dreams come true, not for my family. We returned to Wilderness Lodge to see if we could have dinner at the restaurant in our hotel. The host at the restaurant was as rude as the support staff. We ended up eating at a snack shop for dinner. The whole reason we went to Disney ruined. Our only bright side of the whole stay was our housekeeper Linda.

Visited Disney over 10 times, stayed on Disney property 4 times and would happily go back 4 times a year if I could afford it and take that much time off work! Having said that, I don't think my attitude to the Mouse would jade my view on the hotel quality - I am no nonsense when it comes to my vacation, after all, it is my hard earned money! I am single and went on holiday with just my teenage son back in August 2010. We booked the accommodation directly with Disney and added the Deluxe Disney Dining plan which was on offer at the time. We also added the free Disney bus from MCO to the resort. Since most people stay in Disney property to experience the full \"Disney Magic\", I will include a review on other things besides the hotel in case it helps others. - Loads of people do the Disney Dining plan now. Absolutely ESSENTIAL that you book up your meals as soon as you can online (6months before when I went). If you don't you will not be able to eat at the best Disney restaurants. Fact. - Quite a long walk at the airport to the Disney bus stop. We then sat on the bus for over 30 minutes before departing. After a 10 hour flight this was a little annoying - although it was free so I guess you can't complain. Wouldn't do it again - would pay the relatively small fee for a private transfer. Multiple stops before arriving at Wilderness Lodge. - Goose bumps pulling into our resort - the lodge is really beautiful and we were helped with our luggage by the doorman - Only a 5 minute check in and receptionist helped explain the dining plan. Lobby spectacular. - Room was standard double on the lowest floor. We didn't have much of view, but then again we didn't pay for one. When I'm on holiday with my teenage son - neither of us could care less about the view really! Room did seem a little dated, but was a great size, nice big TV and table, dressing area etc. Housekeeping very good. - The Whispering Canyon Cafe (think that's what it's called) - very cheesy - particularly for our English way! But it was sweet and charming and the waitresses were very friendly to my kid. Breakfast very good and filling. - Disney deluxe dining gives you A LOT of food. In all honesty too much for us. We never ate the full three courses we were entitled to but had some great dinners. Particularly recommend the California Grill and the posh restaurant at Animal Kingdom lodge. Had a pretty decent steak at the steakhouse at Epcot also - although had to wait 45minutes despite having a reservation which we arrived 5mins early for. I have NEVER experienced that in all my life. We missed the fireworks because of it :-( - The disney buses /boats / monorails are very good - but you can wait up to 15mins. I don't care because it used to take 15mins from Carpark to park entrance when you drove so all works out in the end. - Pool very nice and clean. Loved the music around the pool (mainly for the kids activities I think). We got sun loungers middle of afternoon - unheard of in some hotels. - In all honesty there are not that many brilliant rides in Disney Park - ie. you will not find 10 roller coasters. However, there are some real gems which do make your stomach go, and are such good fun. Rock n Roller coaster / Terror Towers at MGM, Everest at Animal Kingdom, Test Track at Epcot, Splash Mountain at Magic Kingdom. Typhoon Lagoon excellent, although better slides at Blizzard. - Found nothing to complain about during the holiday (unusual!), but was looking forward to some Coaster action and something a little more upmarket at Universal Resort by the end of the 7 days. Debated whether to give this 4 or 5 stars. The hotel itself compared to say Mandarin Oriental in Washington DC is not a 5 star. However, the location, ambiance and general execution of the wilderness theme sways me a little to a 5.

The pressure was now on Disney to make sure they would live up to those years of expectations, and the hospitality giant did not disappoint. It was one of the best vacations of our lives. The Wilderness Lodge Resort is themed around staying in an old National Park Lodge, only on a bigger and grander scale. The lobby is six stories tall and made of giant logs with Disney totem poles greeting you as you enter. Disney has a rapid check-in which allowed us to get to our room without waiting in the usual long lines. This was great and got us to our two queen bed room within 10 minutes of arriving. The room was beautiful and reflected the theme of the hotel and Disney's attention to detail right down to the towels in our bathroom. Although the room itself was not big and the beds were a little hard, you still felt cozy staying on Disney property. The bell staff soon arrived with our bags and spent a good 10 minutes answering our many questions about the hotel and the Disney parks. I must say that Disney knows how to maintain a well trained and happy staff. I cannot recall running into a single \"Cast Member\" at the resort who was not friendly and went out of their way to make our stay the best. Staying in a Disney resort may cost a little more, but they make sure you know your money was well invested. The Wilderness Lodge has plenty to keep the family entertained when you're not prancing about in the Magic Kingdom or around EPCOT. The resort wraps around a giant pool complete with a water fall and several hot tubs. The lake, which our room overlooked, has several different types of boats for rent and bicycles to allow you to ride around the Fort Wilderness area. Although my teenagers were too old for it, there are daily activities scheduled for the kids that looked like a lot of fun. A free taxi service was provided for us to the nearest Disney golf course so we could try our skills at the game. Disney has so many wonderful restaurants to choose from one could not eat at all of them if you stayed a month. The Wilderness lodge has a wonderful fine dining restaurant serving seafood and steaks. There's also a fun casual dining restaurant overlooking the lobby where the servers pamper you in a western atmosphere. The little cafe serves meals all day and into the late night. A bargain there is to purchase a Disney Mug for $9.99. You get free refills from the cafe for the rest of your stay. Disney did not disappoint in any way. Our stay at the Wilderness Lodge was magnificent.and everything we dreamed it would be. Although we visited during the off-season when rates are at their lowest, it's clear that Disney's craft in making you feel special knows no off-season.

The shopping inside the hotel is very nice too. Arcade and marina's are fun to kill time in too. The best view at the lodge in my opinion is the woods view. You can look out the back and see trees, but also hear and depending on the side of the hotel your on see the fireworks from the Magic Kingdom. I found the pool views to be annoying because if you try to nap durning the day you can very easily hear all the activity going on. Food at the Wilderness Lodge is also excellent. You have the option of Roaring Forks which is their quick service which has good food that is quick. Whispering Canyon is a nice sit down, just make sure to ask for the ketchup!

They couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even give directions to the elevator and it really was not obvious and was several minutes walk from reception. So we were back at reception 3 times and had to queue each time to ask a question. We also phoned reception from the 'king' room to try and get it changed to the 2 x queen bedded room and we were left on hold for initially 15 minutes, then she came back and said \"Not forgoten about you\", then immediately put us back on hold for another 15 minutes before cutting us off. We then went back down to reception and queued up again for us to be left stood at reception whilst she went into the back room to sort it out - another 20 minutes. We did get a 2 bedded room eventually, but it was well after midnight before we had our bags moved, etc. Anyway, Saturday at Disney's Magic Kingdom was perfect. We left the park at around 8pm and caught the boat back to our hotel, from which we watched the fireworks. We were frozen by then, but had had an amazing day. When we got back to the hotel, I had organized our room to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPrincessed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the Disney fashion, but we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in, as our keys wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work.

I was not happy with this, as we were absolutely shattered. No apology, no smile, no nothing and the surprise for my daughter was ruined. On Monday morning I decided we should give the hotel a chance to redeem itself, so we went and had a good look around. We came to the conclusion that it is a very nice hotel and all the staff are lovely, except those on reception and they continued to the end to have long faces and to be totally unhelpful. I am so disappointed and so surprised that Disney employees would be like this. Wilderness Lodge is a Disney Deluxe hotel and I expected it to be excellent, but it is not. It is only OK and is very expensive for OK! There was no evidence of a Manager and they need one to sort out the miserable, unhelpful reception staff. They have left me with such a bad impression of this hotel. If I passed any of the hotel staff in the corridors - on the long walk to the elevators - they would avert their eyes, rather than smiling and saying hello.

Our flight into Orlando was delayed, so we did not check-in until after 11pm. The employee at the front desk was not the typical friendly Disney cast member. He checked us in with little to no enthusiasm and proceeded to point us in the wrong direction to our room. After wondering around the Lodge for 5-10 minutes (kids and luggage in tow), we finally went back to the front desk and waited several minutes for the less then helpful front desk employee. He finally pointed us in the right direction to our room. Also, we were celebrating 2 birthdays and a first time visit, none of which he acknowledged. As others have stated, rooms in the lodge are small, just your typical 2 queen bed hotel room, nothing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about our room. Our room was clean and lodge theme in carried throughout in typical Disney fashion. We had a clean and comfortable room, perhaps a little overpriced, but that is to be expected at Disney. The main reason we chose the Wilderness Lodge was its location and transportation to the Magic Kingdom. You can hop on a boat and be dropped off right at the main gate outside the Magic Kingdom (closer then the monorail or bus stops). It can be a chilly boat ride this time of year on the smaller open boats, but there are larger enclosed boat that makes trips from the Lodge to the Magic Kingdom as well, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind waiting for the enclosed boat. You can also take a boat from the Lodge to the nearby Contemporary Resort and hop on the monorail to go to the Magic Kingdom, Polynesian, Transportation /Ticket Center (switch monorails there if you want to go to Epcot), or the Grand Floridian. The various transportation options available at the Lodge are a plus. We recommend dining at the Whispering Canyon at the Lodge. You will not leave hungry, huge portions! Our server, Bob, was a lot of fun and very helpful at explaining the Disney Dining plan to us. But if you are looking for a quiet meal, look elsewhere. This is a place the kids will enjoy and is very entertaining. We did not dine at Artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Point (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a signature restaurant and we were too cheap to use 2 dining plan meals per person). The quick service, fast food type meals at the Roaring fork are edible at best. Typical tasteless burgers and pizza you will find throughout Disney. They do have some tasty snack options- blueberry muffins are yummy! There is a microwave in the back of the seating area at the Roaring Fork too, so bring some popcorn or snacks from home to heat up in the microwave. This was the first time we took advantage of the Free Disney Dining Plan and we completely recommend it. Once you understand what you can order, it will save you a ton of money. We debated whether top take advantage of the Room discount or free dining (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do both). We could have saved about $300 on our room, but we saved more with the free dining offer. Each time we had a character buffet or table service meal, we paid $80-180 for 2 adults and 2 children for 5 nights. Not to mention the fast food type meals would have been $25-40 each day for 5 days. So if you are planning on eating at the Disney restaurants- take advantage of the free dining offer!!! Overall, the Wilderness Lodge is a great choice. We have stayed at the Caribbean Beach and Coronado Springs in the past, and the Wilderness Lodge is our favorite.

This hotel is beautiful and the location is second to none. This is our 6'th time staying at Christmas and it holds so many memories to us until this last trip. We arrived and were immeditely queried on to why we had 11 people staying in our room. After 1 hour all was straightened out...so we thought. Later on that night, our meal cards would not work ( we purchased the DVC meal plan) , so off we go to the front desk. They told us that we would have problems since we had 11 in a room. I told them we had 7, plus a child. After 45 minutes all was straightened ou. Next morning the cards would not work, and off to the front desk. Again, we were told that we have to many in our room and there would be problems. After an hour, all was straightened out...until the evening when our keys would not let us in our room. Down to the front desk. Greeted by :how come you have 11 in a room\"?. Next morning meal credits would not work on card. I go to the front desk and ....you guessed it. \"How come that you have 11 in your room\"? I explain and ask to see a manager. The manager comes out and looks at me and tells me that we have to many people in our room. After an hour all was straightened out. Until the evening when the meal credits would not work. Back to the front desk for 45 minutes to get straightened out. Next morning we go for breakfast....meal cards would not work. We go to the front desk and were told we have 11 in a room. I ask for a manager, he comes out and says he wants to make sure that we did not get any extra meal credits since we have 11 in a room. I am stunned but quietly explain what has all happened. I am wondering how many managers they have since I never speak to the same one. Next morning, we have no meal credits left on our cards. I go to the front desk and they see me coming and quickly run away as they know that I have been having problems that they have no way of fixing. For the next three days we had to pay for all our meals for counter services and hand in the receipts. The table service meals had to be verified as being paid by the hotel before we were allowed to leave the restaurants. This took up to an hour each night. I also had the keys reissued on three different occasions amongst many other incidents that happened. This went on for all 7 days. By the time the holiday was over I was ready to go home. I asked the front desk manager to phone me when I got home, but I had to phone them. I had lost 19 counter service and 24 snack credits due to them cancelling them on me. They reimbursed me for them but they sounded like they were doing me a favor as they stated that they never refund money for meal credits that were not used by the customer. I had to remind him that I COULD NOT USE THEM since they eliminated them from me with 3 days left on my vacation. They never once acted like anything was wrong and it was always like it was my fault for some reason or another. Honestly, Iwas expecting a phone call from the manager apologizing for all the inconvenience, but that was not happening. They just wanted to not recognize that there was a problem. I understand that something like this only happens once in a blue moon, but if it happens to you at this hotel....you are on your own. As I had said this hotel is beautiful, but after this experience and the hotels reaction to this problem, I can no longer visit this hotel for fear of it happening again.

The pool and hot tubs are very nice but crowded in afternoons when activities are on and music is overly loud. The beach is okay but small, no activities, no swimming and mostly empty. The lobby and theme of decorations and architecture are so enchanting but the rooms, service and value are such a disappointment. The landscaping - trees, geyser, waterfall - are lovely but you don't sleep and get service in the landscape and we had no view of it.

The comforters were AWFUL - reminded me of a motel quality, same for the rest of the linens...just really not impressed with every aspect of the room (for the price paid). We also found some kid's hairbands under the curtains, so obviously it wasn't cleaned very well. The tiles in the bathroom are from the 70s and it was just gross & old. So were the towels. I would NOT tip to get a towel animal, we got 2 while there and my child could've cared less. The TV channels were terrible & I think they only change the sheets every 4th day. One day, housekeeping did not even pour/rinse out the coffee I had made that morning they just left it along with the coffee grounds. More complaints? Why yes! We used the Magical Express which was far from magical, but that is another post. We requested 1pm check in multiple times since our flight arrived around noon. Well, the room was not ready even though check out time is 11am. So we sat around the hotel (without our luggage) killing time until it was ready - checking back every so often. Finally around 3:45 (check IN time is 3pm) I was furious so I went to check on it again. Come to find out, it had been ready all that time, but housekeeping did not alert the front desk. Really? We complained and got some fast passes from the manager for that inconvenience. Then complained again when it was close to 5 hrs and our bags still hadn't been delivered from Magical Express. It was ridiculous.... My advice if you are not having a \"magical experience\" is to tell them that and they usually will comp you something. We had a friend staying in the Villas part of WL and their room was much nicer. The boat service to MK was the best thing about this hotel. The bus service to the other parks were a beatdown, in my opinion, but it was really the only option to get to the other parks. The Quick Service place here was a ZOO!!!

The view was wonderful though our room which was upgraded without an additional charge was on the 5th floor and overlooked the lake and pool area. I could even see the Electric Parade at night and the fireworks from our balcony. The resort's pool was fantastic with the lifeguards and waterslide. My son could of stayed there all day rather than doing the parks. The pool bar did lack food though just snacks and drinks.

We also used the counter service restaurant which was less expensive than I was expecting. The other restaurant was ok the food was not really good at all Whispering Canyon but the service was funny and hokey for the kids. I think the Wilderness Lodge caterers to the kids better than Animal Kingdom ie., boat rentals, ping pong on the beach, bike rentals, pool area, arcade, movies on the beach at night, etc. but on the other hand my son loved the animals at Animal Kingdom. The geysor going off every hour was also a nice touch and the waterfall. The MK ferry ride was wonderful and such a great way to arrive at the MK.

The lobby and public areas are cleverly designed and look amazing. It is Disney imagineering at its finest in a Northwestern theme. However, this resort really does not belong in the Disney Deluxe category. Here are the good and bad about the Disney Wilderness Lodge: The Good: 1. If you stay here take time to walk around the entire hotel. There are so many interesting corridors, balconies, staircases, fireplaces, pathways, nooks and walkways to see. The pools are nice (with the exception of ducks sometimes swimming in them) and the landscaping is top notch. Overall a very atmospheric place. Disney out did itself in the design of the main resort areas. 2. Very convenient boat rides to either the Magic Kingdom or Fort Wilderness & Contemporary Resort. The Bad: 1. The rooms themselves are small and have no comfortable sitting chairs like other Disney deluxe rooms. Also housekeeping short sheeted the beds and the flat screen TVs did not have high def reception. Also we could not turn off the closed caption function on the TV. The toilet/shower part of the bathroom was dark and drab looking. The shower spray was very wide and uncomfortable. The refrigerator did not get very cold. The room was clean, but rather worn looking. 2. Poor concierge service - the concierge told us to our face we were getting a Florida resident discount on our Disney tickets. The next day we found out we were charged the full admission price and complained. We were told that you have to buy tickets at least one day in advance to get the FL resident discount. So the concierge basically lied to us. Also another concierge gave us bad directions to Downtown Disney and we wound up back on I-4. 3. Poor reservations system - made dinner reservations for the Whispering Canyon Cafe in the hotel and were seated 25 minutes after our reservation time. Most respectable places would offer a free drink or appetizer as an apology for such a screw up. We just got a \"We're so sorry\". 4. Annoying ducks - ducks swim in the pool from time to time (so I assume they poop in there too.) Ducks also beg for food if you eat at the outdoor dining tables of the Roaring Fork Cafe. Staff seems indifferent to them. I guess the ducks are more important than the guests. The Bottom Line: I'd stay here again but only if I got a decent room rate. I would recommend to family and friends but only if they can get a great room price, too. Kids, in particular, seemed to be having a good time here, due to the grandiose theme. Also, If Disney wants to be honest about the overall quality of the Wilderness Lodge they should place it in their moderate resort category. If not, they need to ugrade the rooms and service for it to really be a Disney deluxe property.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dania Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cCreepy Crawlies & Dirty\u201d", "Author": "Disneynuts2010", "ReviewID": "UR86576961", "Content": "After over 30 trips to Walt Disney World Resort, we had tried almost every Disney resort except for Wilderness Lodge, so we were excited to check it out. The hotel lobby and grounds were beautiful, but the size and cleanliness of the rooms leave a lot to be desired. Also, after unpacking, we all went out on our patio to take in the view of the woods and lake. Then we were joined by an unwelcome guest\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6an alligator. He was swimming in the lake and then parked himself on the grass a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from our patio. People from upper level balconies were throwing food down to the alligator drawing him closer to the hotel building. Even the guests staying in the room next door to us left a whole muffin sitting on their patio step trying to draw animals closer. Who knows what they were thinking? Needless to say, we were unable to sit or relax on the patio, and my daughters were scared to death every time my husband opened the patio door. At first I thought it was a fluke that there was an alligator at Wilderness Lodge, but he obviously lives there since he was there all four days of our trip. How can Disney allow this at a family resort when they are such dangerous animals? The second thing that was incredible to me at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd resort was the condition of the boat that takes Wilderness Lodge guests from Magic Kingdom back to the resort. I am referring to the larger boat with windows and a front and back open seating area. The small wooden boat was fine that we took to Magic Kingdom. On Sat. and Mon. night after leaving Magic Kingdom, we all boarded the S.S. Creepy Crawly (the larger boat) to head back to Wilderness Lodge. At first I noticed a very large mosquito on the wall and killed it with a tissue, then my husband said not to bother. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what he meant until I looked around (inside and outside) the boat and the walls and ceiling area were all covered with these huge mosquitoes. Then to make matters worse, there were huge (you have no idea) spiders like I have never seen before on the middle and bottom part of the boat walls and seats. People were literally ready to jump off of the boat once it finally docked at the resort. Also, there was a thick layer of dust on the bunk bed frames and in the dresser drawers. And the queen bed sheets and one pillowcase had black dirt marks on them. I reported this to Mousekeeping but did not receive a reply.

We've been to Disney and stayed on the property four previous times, but this was our first time at the Wilderness Lodge. Overall, I would recommend the hotel. Very pretty setting, loved being on the water, the boat transportation to the Magic Kingdom was fantastic. We opted to upgrade to the 7th floor concierge level where breakfast, snacks, appetizers and desserts were served every day. Overall, we loved that feature but by the end of the trip we were very tired of seeing the same food day in and day out. Nothing is changed - every day it is the same muffin, cereal, cookies, etc. However, we did save a ton of money by having breakfast there along with beer and wine in the evening. I will say that the check-in process for the 7th floor was very confusing. We received 3 sets of keys and parkhopper cards. We were later told it was because we checked in on a Saturday and the people working on the weekends are not as experienced as the weekday folks. Who knows? The pool was nice, but we ended up at the quieter pool by the Villas more often than not. As I mentioned, the boat transportation was great. Bus service to Epcot was very very difficult to get. We've never had that problem before. We also waited for a long time at the parks for the buses as well. We ended up taking our rental car because it was faster. The beach party actitivies at the pool are nice for the kids. We rented bikes and enjoyed that as well. If you're considering the concierge level, please know that you will have a balcony but no view unless you walk to the edge of the balcony and look down.

As others have commented, the rooms aren't huge and the bathrooms a little tired, but you won't be spending too much time in the rooms though, so this was no hardship. Downsides? The dining options for a 700 room hotel are pretty rotten. The roaring fork counter service option is small and the selection tiny by comparison with, say, the equivalent option at the Contemporary. The Whispering Canyon is the best option, but given the paucity of the other options is massively over subscribed. We waited for 30 minutes to sit down for breakfast one day, 15 on another and on busy days the kitchen clearly struggled. Dinner reservations? We were there 10 days and couldn't get in for a faintly normal reservation time once, so if you want to eat in the hotel in the evening you will need to make Disney Advanced Dining Reservations before you leave home. The service btw here is noisy, but great (Nanci especially). I have written separately about artist point, the upscale option in this hotel. How to solve this conundrum? We took the boat to fort wilderness and the contemporary, and ate there in the evenings when we weren't eating in the parks or downtown Disney.

Based on the look of old Yellowstone the structure is simply magnificent with a floor to ceiling fireplace, an enormous lobby, three restaurants, a gift shop, and of course, the pool, the grounds, the geyser, all just spectacular. The Yosemite suite is an entity unto itself! This is \"Disney luxury!\" It features floor to ceiling doors surrounded by a huge balcony all around, a living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom with King sized bed, and 2 baths, jacuzzi and shower separate. It is furnished in leather, in western style, with frontier decor, plush rugs, furnished kitchen..everything you could want or need for your comfort. This suite required a key card in order to even be allowed onto the floor, a private lounge for that floor, two incredible concierges, wonderful cleaning staff that folded our washcloths into beautiful little shapes..there was an enormous gift basket of chocolate awaiting us upon arrival, and cookies, free soda, brownies, and other treats along with coffee, tea, and spirits served in the lounge until 10 pm nightly. I could gladly have stayed in the hotel and missed the rest of the Disney world experience! The Artist's pointe restaurant on the main floor is five star gourmet!! Every single Disney representative that we met, did all they could to assure us that we would have a magical day, and every day that we were there, was indeed magical!! What an experience! This is not an inexpensive experience, but it really is luxury at its finest. If it's just \"the two of you\" then stay in the Yosemite suite. You won't regret it! Only one negative, that you must pay for internet service. Strange to stay in inexpensive hotels along the way with free wi/fi, and Disney charges $10.00 per 24 hours.

Same lovely lodge, same lovely Artist's Point restaurant, but here and there new perks like a daily afternoon pool party (with great tunes!) and other little pluses. We had friends stay here as well, who had previously only stayed at a value and a moderate resort. They too, were stunned at the wonderful level of service, amenities and attention. In fact they had thought this was because of the poor economy, we explained that because it's a small resort (for WDW, at least) and a deluxe one, the level of service is far more attentive. A poster below said this is the second most expensive resort after the Grand Floridian. That is completely incorrect. Wilderness Lodge and Animal Kigdom Lodge are the two LEAST expensive resorts in the deluxe category--in fact they're sort of a little \"near deluxe\"/upper moderate category unto themselves. Which makes them an excellent value, but also explains a slightly smaller room, etc. For the record the second in cost to the Grand Floridian is the Polynesian. Both of these are nearly twice the price of Wilderness Lodge. I really don't get the noise complaints, either. We're always facing the raucous restaurant and lobby, but once our room door shuts we can't hear a thing. As for the reviewer who stated he \"always stays at boutique hotels and is used to that level of service\"---I worked for a well know boutique hotel company for several years. None of them offer any more service than does Wilderness Lodge or these days, a limited service chain near the airport. FYI, \"boutique\" is just a marketing label that you pay extra for! Our daughter was 10 this trip and seemed to enjoy it even more than when she was 7---she viewed the lodge as \"her own\" and enjoyed all the attention the staff bestowed upon her.

Normally I prefer boutique hotels with a high level of service, so my review might be a bit slanted towards those expectations. This shouldn't take away from other people's experiences (I realize that many people save for years for that \"once in a lifetime\" Disney trip) but as someone well-traveled I expect a lot, especially from a brand like Disney. I will pay more if I get more, especially if it makes things easier and more convenient. My wife and I got a great package deal for Labor Day week for a room at the Wilderness Lodge which included the meal plan and park admission. As this is a review of the hotel, I'll keep my comments focused on this part of the trip: Location The location of the hotel is generally excellent, with quick boat service to the Magic Kingdom. Bus service to other parks (Epcot, Animal Kingdom, etc.) was generally painless, although not always as timely as it should be - there would be no bus for 30 minutes and then 2 buses in a row. First impressions and check-in Painless and friendly. Great views inside the hotel. My wife checked in online and it was easy enough (juggling 2 little ones) to get through check-in and get our key. The room Incredibly average and small for a resort hotel (it was a 2 queen bed standard room). The look and feel was like a Ramada Inn or mid-range hotel, even when you include the desired \"rustic\" feel of the room. Everything seemed clean, but the air conditioning wasn't working - after a call to maintenance someone came after 30 minutes and got it going again with a temporary fix, saying that they would send someone the next day to fix it properly. There was no follow-up, so after another call it was fixed while we were out, but my son's pack and play (which he was sleeping in) had dust balls all over it from the maintenance person cleaning the duct. Sloppy. Also, while I can't be sure, I woke up with 10 small red welts on one arm and leg one morning that looked suspiciously like bed bug bites (the pattern isn't like mosquito bites). As i'm not 100% certain I didn't mention it to hotel staff, but I suggest anyone staying in hotels these days to always check for bed bugs! TV Entertainment While I realize you're not at Disney to stay in your room, at times it would be nice to see a movie, or something \"special\" related to Disney. Other than the resort advertising channels, there were only a couple of standard Disney channels. No pay-per-view was available, and very little for the kids to watch while we were getting ready. Disney has missed the boat here, as they could easily show old short films, or have some PPV options available. The pool Nice pool and well watched by lifeguards. Note that there are ducks around that will occasionally swim in the pool, and if they do their \"business\" while swimming the pool will be immediately closed for 15-30 minutes for an \"unscheduled cleaning\". This happened a few times during our stay. Otherwise it was a decent pool (there is a kiddie pool as well) but nothing really special when you consider this is a deluxe resort according to Disney. The playground and \"beach\" By a \"beach\" area near the boat rentals there is a small playground where younger kids can play, which was helpful. Meals - Roaring Fork This was a \"quick service\" restaurant. For the first couple of days of our stay it was very busy at peak times, with an over 10 minute wait for hot food. Later in the week it was quieter as most kids were back in school. The food was extremely average, but edible, especially if you like greasy McDonald's style breakfasts and lunches. Note for those on the meal plan - it's sometimes confusing. If you have oatmeal, it counts as a \"snack\", but if you have oatmeal with fruit, it's a quick service meal. I wish Disney would have a better plan which didn't have you worrying about counting, and what constitutes a kids meal and what's an adult meal. That's a separate issue but I felt like I was part of the socialist republic of Disney trying to keep up with what was what. For example, breakfasts came with 2 drinks, while lunches with a drink and a dessert. My 2 year old was expected to \"share\" our meals, so I found it easier here to order an adult meal that my kids could share as it was the same \"cost\" in quick service points as a kid's meal. A hint if you drink a fair amount of soda/coffee/tea/iced tea - the $15 cup purchase is great as you can refill without wait (or cost) for the duration of the trip. Meals - Whispering Canyon Cafe This is a \"table service\" restaurant, and it was OK, with a fun experience. The food was average yet again. We had dinner here the night we arrived, and despite a 8:05 confirmation we weren't seated until 8:40. With 2 young children tired from the trip down it was brutal to wait, and yet there were tables free, so either they reduced their staff levels or something else happened, but we had to practically push and beg for a table by 8:40. The service itself was very good. Meals - Artist Point The best meal we had at Disney the whole week was here. The food was fresh and tasty and the service was on-par with what I'd expect from a good restaurant. Note for those on the meal plan this counts as 2 table service meals each. By my standards, the portion sizes were excellent (some used to large meals would complain) and the kid's dessert was great - a cookie that kids could \"paint\" with a little brush and edible coloring on a palette, and a white chocolate edible puzzle. \"Concierge\" service Anyone staying at the Wilderness Lodge (and likely other properties) should note that it's more like an info desk than a true concierge. For example, we wanted to make changes to a restaurant reservation after a long day. We were told by the concierge that the restaurants were all \"full\" and they couldn't accommodate us, despite a light week (this was the day after Labor Day, apparently Disney's least busy day of the year). We were then forwarded to the Disney reservation line that anyone would call (which is incredibly painful and lengthy, but that's another story). On a positive note, everyone was nice. The net-net - I recommend this hotel, but with caveats. Aside from the amazing lobby view there wasn't anything special about the hotel or the overall experience, and certainly not \"deluxe\" in the true sense of the word.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cThe Wilderness Lodge was AWESOME\u201d", "Author": "dlive6678", "ReviewID": "UR78796320", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the WL over the Labor Day weekend with our 2 little boys, my mother, and my in-laws.

The rest of the hotel outside of the actual room is pretty spectacular. The lobby is huge and beautiful as is the outside pool area and trails. Little disney touches everywhere which is really what sets a disney hotel apart from just a Hilton or other hotel. Staff were all friendly, bus and boat transportation was good. This is the kind of hotel that is nice to just sit and relax in the lobby or hang out by the pool. I wish we'd had more available time to do just that!

You walk into one of the most beautiful lobbies I have ever seen. Our check in was quick, efficient and informative. Even though our plane was an early one, they had a room ready for us immediately (10:30 a.m.). We had a courtyard room with two queen beds. This is a deluxe Disney hotel and the beds were WONDERFUL! My husband, my teenage daughter and I all slept quite soundly each night and we had NO BACK PROBLEMS! Mousekeeping kept our room spotless each day. We asked for new linens a little early in our stay and this request was met happily. The fridge in the room is a nice addition as we could keep water and sodas there all the time. Our teenage daughter loved the pool and the daily music and dancing that they had. The restaurants are great. Artist's Pointe though expensive is a lovely place for a romantic dinner. Our daughter loved being able to get food and snacks at the Roaring Fork from early in the day to 11 at night.

Maybe I am spoiled because we normally stay at the Polynesian or Grand Floridian and so I expect all Disney \"deluxe\" hotels to be deluxe. The Wilderness Lodge is more on line with the Disney moderates resorts except for the fact that they do have interior corridors and valet parking. The positives: Housekeeping was exceptional -- for the first time in all my Disney vacations, including club level at the previously mentioned deluxe resorts --- we were never left any towel animals. The Housekeepers at the Wilderness Lodge left us 3 during our 6 night stay and towels and all amenities were always kept stocked. The rooms was always immaculate and the turndown service was always a welcome sight to return to. The parking valets were always accommodating and prompt. The bus transportation was excellent, we never waited more than 5 minutes for a bus, however, the boat transportation from the Magic Kingdom to the Lodge was sporadic and never enough to accommodate the amount of guests the Wilderness Lodge has. The room was just adequate, smaller than the Poly or Grand Floridian. We were staying Club Level and normally the Club Level concierge cast members are always so helpful and have a great attitude. Not so at the Wilderness Lodge, with the exception of two cast members, Loyda and Miguel, the rest looked like they were auditioning for the part of Grumpy in Snow White. I asked one about printing boarding passes for our return flight, she told me they couldn't do it, something to the effect that it interferes with the resort airline luggage check in service. (Meanwhile back at the Poly, Grand Floridian and other Disney resorts --- including Guest Services at the Parks, they were all able to print boarding passes) Now to the concierge lounge --- if you are into exotic food, go for it. Anytime I saw the offerings at the evening hour service, I thought of the food they made contestants eat on Fear Factor (Buffalo on a stick, meatballs made of Reindeer (sorry Bambi), but nothing except cheese and crackers ever passed my lips there. Another negative about staying on the club level floor, the room's balcony has a solid wall, so you have no view unless you stand. If you want deluxe at Disney, go for any other resort (Poly, Grand, Yacht Club, Beach Club, Contemporary). If you're just looking for a place to sleep and want something just a slight bit better than the moderates, then go for the Wilderness Lodge, but in that case, I would honestly rather save the money and stay at Port Orleans-Riverside or French Quarter.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pace, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "bishoparc", "ReviewID": "UR74364358", "Content": "Yes, it's a very large resort.

I always get a courtyard view - which is noisy during the day with the pool activities, but the view is phenomenal. Last time we were on a high floor (6) facing magic kingdom so we had a view of the lake. We were able to see the firewords just over the top of the building. NO - you can't actually see magic kingdom, but the view of the courtyard, pools, river/waterfall, \"fake\" Old Faithful and the lake was breathtaking. This place is just charming. I have stayed at all the other deluxe resorts that are Magic Kingdom resorts and this is my favorite. The room is not fancy at all, but charming. The contemporary hotel is where you would stay if you like a nice modern room. The wilderness is not on the monorail, but a quick boat ride to the magic kingdom or contemporary hotel is nice. The area where you catch the busses to Hollywood studios or Epcot is nice and shady, so not too bad to wait there during the summer months when it's hot. Roaring Forks is a great restaurant for counter service food and they have a nice selection. VERY CLEAN - typical Disney fashion. You will pay a lot for this resort, but once you stay they are always having deals for 40% off room rates. We paid only 184 last fall and 213 this past spring per night for the courtyard view. Again, it is not a fancy room for that price, but the amenities at this hotel for the little ones is worth every penny. They had \"cookie decorating\" every day where you could visit the Roaring Forks and get a free cookie and put on frosting and sprinkles. Too cute!! Check out the Grand Canyon strata in the lobby too! We ate at the Whispering Canyon cafe and had great service and food.

The view was perfect. Mousekeepers kept the boys surprised with animal towels each night we returned from the parks. Two queen beds and lots of drawer space. A fridge to keep extra drinks cool for our return was perfect. The pool area was perfect because it is open until midnight so it is a good way to cool off and wind down.

Disney service is hard to beat on all levels but if deluxe is within budget, do it by all means. I was able to self park but valet was avalible ( it's not far from the front lobby ) When you first enter the lobby..WOW..kids of all ages are amazed. What a beautiful, tall, rustic wilderness look.Luggage and coolers to the room after a swift check-in to room 4118 via the bellhop(with a short tour of the lobby ) The room was great.! I don't know what other people complain about. Sure, bigger is better, but with 2 queens,fridge,lots fo draw space,flat screen tv,ceiling fan,clock/radio/ipod and a balcony overlooking the woods .It was fine for the three of us. Clean and cold a/c. Lighting was fine (energy save bulbs) Murals of the West and wilderness adore the room. And this was a standard room. Now the pool and grounds are truly the best. I read a lot of reviews beforehand, but nothing quite like seeing it for yourself. My 9 year old girl loved the poolslide. There are bunnies hopping around and even ducks that will wonder into the pool occassionally. There is also activites by the hotel sataff daily. We won a stuffed animal playing Bingo !! The Lifegaurds act well trained and professional and I never seen them yell at the children for having too much fun ,anything pretty much goes.A steam flows fromt the lobby thru the grounds, over a waterfall and into the pool. Throw a coin and make a wish.Then it continues to the lake. Food is a quick service mini food court that we enjoyed with burger,nuggets ,pizza ..(buy the refill cup for about $13 it;s worth it) The other two resturants we didn't try ( we had our own daily snacks ,which i recommend bringing ) One resturant is great for the kids with lots of noise and silliness and the other is a formal sit down one. I highly recommend take the lodge tour with Ranger Joe (check the daily activities) It's free and you learn all about the logde in an hour or so. He also does the family flag raising which I heard was a blast. but have to make reservations when you arrive. I have so much more to say and I said when i made it home i would write a review to show justice to this AAAA+++ resort. To sum this up.....Do the Wilderness Lodge, I can't say enough. It makes you feel like you;re in the wilderness and on a lake. Food isn't cheap so be prepared, rooms are more than you need, everything you need is on the resort and lobby area.

You get to go to the top of the hotel and put the flags up. They even gave us a free breakfast for doing so. We experienced many moment of special attention and this place was awesome. My only complaint was that the food at the cafe was less than spectacular and unable to handle large amounts of guests. We highly recommend the Disney dining plan and really enjoyed our stay.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cI Said I Wouldn't, But I Did....And I Regretted It.\u201d", "Author": "gatorpac", "ReviewID": "UR69778617", "Content": "My family stayed at Disney's Wilderness Lodge for 3 nights pre-cruise in April.

I wish I had heeded my own advice because the entire time we were at the DWL all I could think about was how much I missed staying at the Poly. I'm certainly not slamming DWL, but there are two vitally-important factors that weigh HEAVILY in favor of the Poly vs DWL. They are (1) location and, (2) room size. Both are undeniably superior at the Poly. The first thing I noticed when we got to our room at DWL was the size----small. Very small and cramped-feeling. Our room at the Poly in the Tokelau building never felt small. Looking back at our pictures confirms this. In the Poly we had a sitting area with two chairs and a sofa. There's nothing like this in a comparable DWL room. And, the other factor----location. No discussion really needed here. Monorail and TTC at the Poly. Boats and buses at DWL (oh yeah....Poly has these, too). If a wilderness theme is your thing, I suppose DWL wins there. It's the Poly for me from hence forward.

This trip was a little unusual for me in that we wanted to experience a weekend at a Disney resort without visiting the theme parks. We made a great choice! Arrival/Lobby Pretty impressive lobby and gorgeous grounds. Very well maintained. Valet parking is available, but expensive: $12. We self-parked and walked the short distance to the hotel. Even at 11 am our room was ready, including a special request. Check in was a breeze...we were done and at the pool in 20 minutes. Room Other reviewers here are right that the the rooms aren't the highlight here. They are pretty standard but comfortable. Bed wasn't as good as the Contemporary across the lake but better than at the All Stars and I slept straight through the night so I can't complain. Our room was on the first floor with a woods view so we had a great patio outside complete with a pond and...yes...a real alligator swimming around. Not sure that was Disney-approved but we enjoyed keeping our eyes on \"Toothy\" during our visit. I recommend the woods view so you don't have to look at a parking lot but don't have the noise and hubbub of the courtyard unless that's a good thing in your eyes. Pool Awesome, but busy. Get there early to claim a spot. If you prefer a quieter pool experience there is a second pool around the building next to the villas. Stayed there until the daily summer afternoon rain came. Pool Bar Drinks are expensive...spent $10 each on frozen drinks. Yummy though. Artist Point Restaurant Most expensive meal of my life....but completely worth it. Great service, amazing food, very personalized. My menu had my name on it. We had the venison potstickers for an appetizer. Try the buffalo or the Copper River salmon when it's in season for the entree. End with the berry cobbler which is simply amazing. Whispering Canyon Cafe Didn't eat there this time around but wanted to say it is part dinner and part entertainment. Not a quiet place but probably a great place for the kids. Roaring Fork Snack Bar Great good for when you want to get going. Free soda to those with refillable mugs. Marina Spent a couple of hours running around the lakes on their Montauk boat which was a great deal of fun, provided great photo opportunities and was a great way to relax on a hot day. Transportation Since my trip wasn't all about the parks I had no complaints, but it is worth mentioning if you are going to be doing the park thing every day the transportation here is limited: boat to Magic Kingdom and other MK resorts, bus everywhere else, or drive your car and pay for parking. Shopping One store, lots of stuff for the kids and hotel-themed products. If you forgot film, batteries or want some groceries be prepared to pay for the convenience. No gum is sold on Disney property. Overall It was a great stay and I can't wait to go back. I would recommend it and have done so to many friends and family.

If you are planning a trip to Walt Disney World and considering - even CONSIDERING - staying at a Deluxe hotel, let me say that you cannot go wrong with Wilderness Lodge. Our first time we booked and stayed in a king bed room - club level. It made for an awesome honeymoon! Our 2nd trip we booked a regular room - no view upgrade- not on club level. We were upgraded to a woods view and upgraded again to club level. I cannot say enough about this amazing hotel. The total environment of the hotel is a departure from the rest of the Disney hotels that I have visited. Wilderness lodge is very laid back, very relaxed, and very well themed so that you know you are at Disney, but it's not 'crazy Disney'. The transportation options are incredible - you can't beat a boat to and from the Magic Kingdom - the monorail is right off the dock in front of the MK if you want to go to EPCOT. Bus transportation is typically every 10-15 minutes. The gift shop is incredible if you are an outdoors type of person! The dining options are great! We have eaten at Roaring Forks and Whispering Canyon - we have not eaten at Artists Point, but we have heard that it's great! The lobby is the MOST incredible lobby of ALL of the Disney resorts! We have visited almost all of the Disney Resorts, and nothing beats the feeling you get as soon as you walk through the front doors! It's such a dark, cool, and relaxing space. Even when Whispering Canyon is at full roar, and the lobby is full of families coming and going - there is still a great escape here! If you have the budget I would definitely suggest staying Club Level. The breakfast options are good, and the afternoon snacks are great options if you are going to hit the pool - and you can't beat free snacks, wine, beer, and cordials in the evening! Perhaps the best of all is the pool - with the stream running out of the lobby, the huge waterfall in the back, the pool, two hot tubs (set at two different temperatures) and then Fire Rock Geyser! Yes, this western-national park themed hotel comes complete with a geyser! The walk through the woods from the dock brings you back to the pool area with a beautiful view of the waterfall, and you can take a quick stroll through the tunnel - and then back into the lobby. Yes, folks there are even crickets and other woodland noises. Each morning on the way to the boat we would see rabbits, ducks, shore birds, lizards, and squirrels! If you stay here, don't forget to go next door to see the Villa's lobby. There are quite a few things to see next door! Disney Vacation Club has a property here as well - The Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge. We stayed one night at the Villas on our trip this past December and it was just as magical as staying in the lodge itself. We are Disney Vacation Club Members, so we hope to stay here for a week or so in the next two years, but first we are trying out the Boardwalk Villas! I have read a few reviews comparing Wilderness Lodge to the Animal Kingdom Lodge - we have stayed at both - and found Animal Kingdom Lodge to be somewhat annoying actually. From the front door of the lobby to our room, it was over 1,000 steps - door to door - and we weren't even the last room in the building! But, for more on Animal Kingdom and Kidani Village see my review for those that I will post as soon as I can. But, to finish my review of Wilderness Lodge - I have to say that you have to experience it for yourself! Finally - be sure to tip your mousekeeper daily if you want towel animals!

Bus and boat service to the parks were very convenient!! The Whispering Canyon restaurant was incredibly fun. At dinner time, just as for ketchup and see what I mean. The adults were smiling and laughing like kids. Also, the Roaring Fork Cafe was very convenient with a wide variety of food choices. Both venues had quick service with friendly attitudes. My children loved the bunk bed in the room. Comfortable room, but a bit on the cozy side. The minor drawback was the collateral hotel noise late at night or early in the morning.

I thought the room was a standard size regular hotel room. Not overly small. I loved the fridge and the A/C worked like a champ. Mouse Keeping was awsome and it was very very quiet. My only small issue is there is not a really big selection of food. Roaring Forks is ok but basicly the same food you get in the parks. I would have liked to see alittle more selection at the quick service spot. The boat the the MK was great. The bus to the MK however was terriable. Waited over 30min each time I tried to use it and wathced multiple busses come for epcot,studieos and AK. I would stay here again and in fact I am thinking about treating my folks to a visit.

We had wanted to stay at the Contemporary, but the Disney reservations agent sold my wife on staying at this 'deluxe' hotel. Deluxe it most certainly is not! It is dirty, old, and worn. When we arrived we were 'upgraded' to a 'woods view' room. When we got to our floor, we found that our room immediately next to the ice maker and the elevator! There was a gap under the door, so no privacy was possible, you could clearly hear every conversation in the hall. The upgrade 'woods view' overlooks a retention pond that was completely coated in green scum - so buyer beware. The room was disgustingly filthy. There was dried urine on the back of the toilet seat, the mirrors were splattered with who knows what. There were lightbulbs out in the bathroom and over the bed, and one of the cold water faucets would not turn. The room and hall were terrinbly worn looking, the cabinets and doors are banged up, and the carpet looked old and nasty. Not Deluxe by any strecth of the imagination. My wife and I complained to the front desk and asked them to clean our room thoroughly while we were out at the park - I told them I wanted it \"CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN\". When we returned, the things we complained about had been cleaned, but the trash had not even been emptied. So I did not have a good feeling at all about the cleanliness of anything in the room at this point. So my wife and I checked out - we did not want to stay in this filthy room. The manager was helpful, and offered us an upgrade to the 'concierge' floor, but my wife and I had enough at this point. The manager assured us we would get a refund for the night. I have had to call 3 back three times this week before I could get anyone to explain to me the status of my refund. I am told will take 2 weeks? They took the payment for the room out of my account the same day, but I have to wait 2 weeks for a refund?? Ridiculous. Also, when we arrived, we accidentally went to the Wilderness campground instead of the lodge. When we asked for directions, the security guard was rude and impatient - very un-Disney-like. I cannot recommend the Wilderness Resort Lodge at all.

Upon check in we were given a room off of the main lobby. I think this was important because the lobby with restaurant seemed to always have a buzz about it. Neat for walking through, but not for sleeping close to, I can imagine. We ALWAYS travel with a little white noise machine, so we slept like babies every night from our sixth floor room and during every afternoon nap even though it overlooked the service entrance parking lot where trucks would arrive/leave at all hours. The key to this standard \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno frills\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 view? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just over the trees to the Magic Kingdom. We had an awesome view for the fireworks on the nights we were back in our room by show time. Issues with the room: 1) Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller than you think it should be. Again, we only used it for sleeping, so not a huge problem. Though we were comfortable with our daughter, it would have been tight with 2 kids. 2) Dark \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after being in the sun all day, walking in and turning on the lights it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like anything turns on. It takes a few minutes to adjust to the low wattage lights. Even then, the room seems awfully dark, which probably contributes to the feeling of it being small too. I went down to the lobby at night to read after my wife and daughter were asleep. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only dad down there with a book or laptop. 3) The bathroom sinks are recessed under an upper counter on the vanity. This made it very awkward to use the sinks. My wife and I had trouble washing our faces and our tall 4yr old daughter, who has been reaching faucets everywhere for a while now, could not reach these\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6frustrating and confounding since this is supposed to be a kid friendly place, right? We did NOT do the dining plan and I feel like we saved money and ate healthier too. Between a cooler and the room mini-fridge, we were stocked with water, Coke, juice, milk, and fruit. We had breakfast (cereal/breakfast bars, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) each morning in the room, and packed PB&Js/chips/drinks, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 for either lunch/dinner. This made the character meals a little more palatable. $100 for a family of 3 to go through a mediocre breakfast buffet? Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be honest\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying for personal time with the princesses or Mickey and Minnie, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it goes. We had dinner one night at the place downstairs by the pool. Food wasn't that bad. Best value was a deli sandwich or a salad. 2 could easily split these huge portions. A note on Disney Transportation: I hate waiting in line. The boat to the Magic Kingdom is great if you time it right. If not, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 20-30 minute wait. If you want to be at the Magic Kingdom when it opens, be at the dock 40 minutes prior to opening. i.e. if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the 8:30 boat, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way in the world you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be there for the 9am park opening. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with the buses because we spent so much time on them our last trip. Another resort guest perk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no parking fees. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $15/car/day/theme park to park your car if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying off campus. We took the boats several times and a bus once to the Magic Kingdom, but drove ourselves to Epcot/Hollywood Studios/Animal Kingdom. I drive faster than the buses and can operate on my own schedule. Nothing worse than waiting in a 40 minutes line at 10pm for a 20 minute bus ride when you could take your own car and be back at the resort in 15 minutes. Will we stay at the Wilderness Lodge next time? Undecided. Animal Kingdom Lodge a couple of years ago was a little nicer, but the Wilderness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is better. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably try yet another of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh end\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 options else if we can afford it!", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cLoved this Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "RoamingtheUSA", "ReviewID": "UR64168605", "Content": "My wife, daughter, and I visited the Wilderness Lodge during the first week in May.

Altohough we knew it would be a long shot, we asked if we could be a \"flag family\". Much to our surprised Gloria checked the book and there was an opening. I have to say that you have to ask about being a flag family. It was a great experience, and one that our six year old daughter will remember forever We stayed in room 5041 which overlooked the pool and lake. We had seen reviews that warned of sound issues during the day in rooms that face the pool. We could not hear the pool sounds with the sliding door shut. Every night at around 9:30 there is a light parade on the lake right in front of the hotel. It lasts about 5-10 minutes and the kids really like it. On a few nights we watched the fireworks at Magic Kingdom from the parking lot of the hotel. At the end of each day in the park we came back to a clean room with different towel animals on the bed each day. On our next-to-last day Housekeeping left ballons in the room for our daughter. We rented a car to get to most of the parks and avoid the crowded (and slow) buses. The parking was free because we were staying at a Disney property and it only took on average between 9-10 minutes to get to and from each park. We did use the boat to get to Magic Kingdom and was pleasantly surprised by the speed...only about 10 minutes. Overall, this is an excellent hotel with a great location.

All the food tasted like there was something burning in the oven and had this awful taste. So definitely rent a car so you can get out and eat some decent food as relying on this hotel to feed you will grow old fast especially if you are staying more than a couple of nights. If you do go to the Roaring Fork, stick with the sandwiches/salads. There were ducks swimming in the pool and water was dirty I think mostly from the kids running up and down the slide. Very crowded in the pool area. One hot tub was broken. The other was not that hot. Would stay again, but for a shorter stay because of the food few choices and not that good.

Lighting is dim, towels somewhat ratty, and the room we stayed in wasn't especially clean for a hotel billed as deluxe (it's about on-par with your typical U.S. hotel). However, we did not spend a whole lot of time in the room, so it wasn't really a major issue. When getting a room reservation, unless you're looking for a Spring Break vibe, ask for a room at least one floor up and not facing the main pool; our room was totally quiet on the fourth floor and facing the quieter smaller pool. The rest of the hotel is pretty amazing: the lobby and grounds are nothing short of stunning and extremely well-kept; the main pool (despite the closed slide), second smaller pool, and three hot-tubs are great and clean, although the music is a bit much in the main pool; there's a little beach on the lake which is delightful; you can rent bikes and boats right near the beach; hotel features a lot of activities for kids and families around the pool and beach; room service was excellent all three times we used it; and the hotel staff and concierge were extremely helpful and responsive. Three restaurants on property: one for quick service (Roaring Fork) is OK to good for breakfast and lunch, but please do yourself a favor and skip dinner there. Whispering Canyon Cafe is better and a fun experience for families unless you want to just shut up and eat. Artist Point was really good (albeit expensive), plus it offers a nice bar. Service at the latter two was a bit slow, but overall very good, including attention to our young daughter. Location of the Lodge is a huge plus; it's a very quick boat ride to Magic Kingdom and boats are generally frequent, especially during the day. Riding the boats back and forth was fun, pleasant, and convenient. Bus transportation to the other parks, however, was a bit of a shortcoming here. Sometimes it takes forever for the bus you're waiting for to arrive so you can get to Epcot, or Hollywood Studios, etc. You wind up killing quite a bit of time waiting for the bus and riding there and back, plus the trips are often slow. We took the boats and connected with the speedy and fun Monorail whenever possible. We did not use the child care services or workout gym, so we can't comment on that. Bell-hop and valet services were excellent. Good store for getting Disney stuff in lobby. Restrooms off the nicely appointed lobby were immaculate. We enjoyed our stay here and, despite the few shortcomings, we plan to return. After also having explored the Contemporary, Grand Floridian, and Polynesian a bit for meals, etc. during our stay, it's my opinion that each of the deluxe properties has a few drawbacks (including the constant and annoying piped-in Disney soundtrack music) depending on what's important to you and what isn't.

In a word; tiny. The size of the room is what I would have expected from one of disneys value hotels. Two shoehorned beds dominate the footprint of the rooms. The bathroom was also subcompact with very poor lighting. No frills what so ever in the room. Nothing about this room said Delux; which is what they're selling to unsuspecting people here. I've been to the contemporary, Yacht Club, and the GF; all of their rooms were far better. Like most disney experiences, the service was hit and miss... I opened a tab at the pool bar for us one afternoon. My wife (who is nearly 37 years old), came back to our chairs and told me they wouldn't serve here a glass of wine without ID. I was shocked this was a problem. The two of us haden't been carded in over 10 years; ESPECIALLY AT A SO CALLED DELUX HOTEL LIKE THIS! I went to the bar to try to rectify the problem and got no where. She had to go back up to our room and grab her ID. Needless to say, this was ridiculous and almost ruined our day. Another problem we had was at the baby sitting service (the cubs den). The staff was very nice,but english was not their first language. We left our son with them one night and an hour later I recived a call from a woman on the staff that we had to return and pick up our son because he was upset. Now I don't blame them for that, but the problem I had was that her accent was so thick, I couldn't understand what she was saying. I had to have her hand the phone to a manager. what a nightmare!!! Even though we didn't have dinner, we were still charged the baby sitting fees. The hotel manager did make it up to us with a credit, but it was an overall mess!

The swimming pool is fashioned like a running stream, and of course \"old faithful\" blows out back. The resort is on a Disney Lake, so you can step right onto a ferry boat that will transport you to the magic kingdom. There are buses that take you to various parts of the Disney property, Or you can drive (less than 5 minutes) to the monarail. There are several restaurants in the lodge including a fast food service, a formal bistro, and a country-family-style restaurant that is alot of fun. Our family lives in Florida, so we see palm trees & sunshine most of the year. The mountain lodge ambiance is a welcome change of sceneray for us, and reminicint of our visits to Yellowstone.

We had booked a standard view room but were assigned a room on the 4th floor that overlooked the smaller quiet pool, villas building, and also in view of the beach and lake, views we thoroughly enjoyed from the balcony and much nicer than we had hoped for considering we'd booked a standard view. Neither the quiet pool nor the larger main pool were crowded during our stay, due in part to the colder weather toward the end of the week no doubt, and we enjoyed them most the first couple of days when the temps were in the upper 70s during the daytime. Our room was immaculate and just the right size for the three of us without feeling claustrophobic, with 2 queen beds that we found very comfy with soft bedding and plump pillows for a good night's sleep after a day out and about at the theme parks and resort. Animal towels greeted us several times upon returning to our room courtesy of the mousekeepers. We were pleased with the dining facilities at the Wilderness Lodge and with their staffers. We ate dinner one night at the Whispering Canyon Cafe and service and food there was excellent and the chef and server were extremely helpful and accommodating regarding my daughters' egg and peanut allergies. The same was also true of staff and food at the Roaring Fork counter service/food court where we ate dinner several times, and room service pizza delivery was also prompt and pretty decent pizza for our first night's meal after an early evening check-in. Disney's bus service to the Magic Kingdom was particularly swift and direct, arriving at the Magic Kingdom only about 5 minutes after pickup at the Wilderness Lodge. Bus rides to Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Disney Hollywood Studios took a bit longer and sometimes involved stops at Ft. Wilderness or the Grand Floridian after pick up at the Wilderness Lodge, but still were reasonable considering we were on vacation and I was free from the responsibility of driving us around. We also utilized the Disney boats between the Wilderness Lodge and Contemporary Resort and Ft. Wilderness several times and didn't have to wait for a boat more than a few minutes at most, and in many cases found the boat was docked and ready for us to board instantly. Our only snafu involved the Magic Express service for our return to Orlando airport and that was partially our fault. We assumed the buses used for Magic Express were all expressly (pardon the pun) painted/labeled as such because this was the case for the buses we had rode on previous trips. We stood by idly under the roof near the Wilderness Lodge's entrance to keep out of the rain there while watching a yellow Mears bus pull up and then leave around the time of our scheduled pickup, not realizing that the yellow Mears buses are also sometimes utilized for the Magic Express service. Oops. Disney should be more proactive in informing guests of the use of Mears buses on occasion, and the bus drivers could also make more of an effort than this particular one did to be sure guests who are obviously waiting for a ride aren't missing their bus as well. Live and learn, lol, as we did when we inquired at the resort airline check-in counter about why our bus hadn't shown and learned the Mears bus should have been our bus. We ended up catching the next Magic Express bus (a clearly labeled one to boot) about 45 minutes later, and still luckily had plenty of time to spare to make our return flight. All in all, we had an enjoyable trip and found the Wilderness Lodge was well suited for our family, and give it a big thumbs up.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cIt was an average stay.\u201d", "Author": "dwest61071", "ReviewID": "UR58405494", "Content": "My family (with 2 kids 5 & 7) stayed at Wilderness Lodge from 3/3 to 3/10/10. Our room was on the 5th floor and when we looked over the railing outside our room we were looking down at the Whispering Canyon restaurant. Out of our balcony window we saw the roof of other buildings. Not exactly impressive, but we didn't go to Disney to sit in the hotel. Upon arrival, a nice employee helped my hubby get luggage out of the car and bell service brought the luggage to our room. That was nice. We drove a rental car, since being frustrated with how long the Disney Magical Express took to get us to our hotel last year and the ensuing 4-hour wait for our luggage to arrive. We were concerned about having a room overlooking the Whispering Canyon, but it wasn't overly noisy. They gave us a room with bunk beds even though we didn't pay for one. The room was clean, maid service was average. One day it took until 4pm for maid service to clean the room, but other days it was more timely. When we left a $10 tip we got towels made into animals, other days we got nothing. One note for families with small children, the rooms that overlook the lobby area have railings that you can look over into the lobby below. We have 2 children with HF autism, and they could have easily climbed over these railings and fell 5 stories to their death. So if your child is adventurous in any way, you may want to ask for a room on a lower floor. Our kids were good about it, but I was initially concerned. My biggest complaint would be the food. To eat in the Whispering Canyon it's like $35 a plate, and for a family of 4 to eat there a week is not economical at all. We didn't eat there even once. We ate at the Roaring Forks quick service cafe for breakfast 2 days and dinner one day. The selections were too limited and the food too expensive. A tuna sandwich was $9 and it didn't include anything, not even a drink. And the drinks had no refills unless you bought the refillable mug. We ended up either eating at the Disney parks or we went off property to Cici's pizza and the Steak and Shake. Both were more economical and offered a variety of food items. The Roaring Forks food court was very small. At the busiest time there were 10 families in there and it was full. I was most disappointed with the fact that the water slide at the pool, one of the main reasons we booked this resort, was CLOSED for refurbishment. I called and checked around when making the reservation because I wanted my kids to have a great pool and slide. This was very disappointing. I also saw many unsupervised children in the hot tubs and no lifeguards (or parents, sadly) manning that area in the day time. The hotel was certainly not full, in fact relatively quiet, so this was a surprise. Overall, my kids liked it there very much. We traveled to Magic Kingdom by boat and liked the Electrical pageant at night time. When traveling to Epcot or Hollywood Studios by bus, however, we waited 30 minutes or more for a bus and then had to stop at Fort Wilderness or the Grand Floridian hotels also. On the plus side, the busses were less full, but this seemed to be true overall with attendance at the parks lower. So I would say it was an average stay. There were a couple of nice perks (like water transport) but other than that it was similiar to the All-Star Movies resort we stayed at last year. All-Star movies was more crowded, but had a great family atmosphere, large food court, great pool and ambiance. At Wilderness it was quieter but fewer amenities; pool was smaller-half closed, arcade smaller, food court smaller. It was okay but not sure we'd stay there again.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cA FANTASTIC resort and a MUST stay for all Disney fans!\u201d", "Author": "guerns17", "ReviewID": "UR57784715", "Content": "We stayed at the Wilderness Lodge during December and it was AMAZING. The lobby is beautiful when you walk in. They have a huge Christmas tree and holiday decorations all around. It really got us in the Holiday spirit! We had paid for a courtyard view room and we ended up on the south side of the resort directly facing the beach and water . We were on the third floor. It was BETTER than being right in the courtyard area because that becomes quite loud during the day. The room was great. Two queen beds, flat screen TV, IPOD player/clock (this was really cool because I did bring my IPOD and we would just sit out on our porch and listen to music), two sinks; which are separate from the toilet/shower room. The bathroom is a nice size compared to the value and moderate resorts. There is also a mini fridge, ice bucket and glasses, coffee maker (we never used this), as well as a closet. Below the TV there was a dresser to store your clothes . The porch was my favorite. It has two chairs and a small table. Our porch was a little different because of the design of the resort the third floor in this area has a lot of stone work and it made the porch VERY private. Which I really prefer because sometimes it is awkward to have a thin board between you and your neighbor. We also ate at the Whispering Canyon Cafe and it was GREAT. They do have kind of a quirky thing that the servers do and they try to joke around with you and do other crazy things, but we came toward the end of the night and we were seated toward the back and our server was just fine. We were just there as a couple so we don't really get into that, but a family with kids might enjoy it. The food was YUMMY. We had the Canyon Skillet which is an endless meal. They just keep replacing food you run out of. It comes with a Smoked Pork Ribs, Pulled Pork, Oven-roasted Chicken, Beef Brisket, Mashed Potatoes, Cowboy Beans, and Corn on the Cob Mixed Greens Salad with Apple Vinaigrette, Coleslaw, and Fresh-baked Cornbread. So it is A LOT of food. We had no room for dessert in the end so pace yourself!! :) We only ate at Roaring Fork counter service once for breakfast. It was great, nothing amazing, but I heard that the lunch and dinner selections were really fresh and good. The pool area is awesome. The pool water is constantly fed into the pool from a water fall that starts in the lobby! There is a water slide, but we never went on it, and there is a hot tub, but it was always so busy we never went in that either. If you are looking for a quieter pool walk over to the Villas at Wilderness Lodge because the pool is smaller and there are not as many people there. Another neat aspect of this resort is the geyser that goes off every so often. I think kids would love this. Finally, the boat to and from Magic Kingdom was really fun. We never waited in line long and it got us right to the Kingdom in no time. The buses were great as well, I think probably the best I have had at Disney. The buses do share other stops at the Polynesian resort and Wilderness camp grounds, but it really did not add to the time getting to and from the parks very much. My recommendation is to definitely try this resort.

When entering the expansive lobby you will be greated by giant toten poles on each side of the lobby and wood animal carvings all over the place and beautiful back ground music from movies such as Big Country, Dances with Wolves, etc. A big fire place at a far corner of the lobby burning real fire, even during the summer! Great place to sit and relax from the heat or to just check out the lobby. Make sure you ask for a tour of the great lobby, it's free. For restaurants, there are 3 places, Roaring Forks a counter service restaurant for sandwiches, burgers, fruits, chips and desert. The brownies are bigger here compared to the value resort (Pop Century - stayed there right after Wilderness Lodge) for the same price! Whispering Canyon Cafe an all you can eat buffet restaurant. The wait staff are a blast! Make sure you ask for some ketchup and see what happens. Make resevations for this restaurant because they do fill up quick for breafast and especially dinner. And Artist Point, a very expensive restaurant. There is a bar near the lobby just around the corner from Whispering Canyon Cafe. There is Mercantile, a store to buy mickey shirts, watches, books, cups, candy and personal hygene stuff. There are 2 heated pools located at the back of the resort. A bubbling stream leading from inside the lobby through the outdoor grounds to the main pool (water from stream seperate from pool water) and continues on from the other side of the main pool to just before Bay Lake. The 2nd pool is smaller surrounded by trees for more shade located on the right side of resort where Disney Vacation Villas are. Also a kiddy pool and 2 jacuzies. Pool have multiple life guards on duty to help keep the kids safe. People swim even after closing hours which seems to be ok. There is a outdoor bar near the main pool. There also is a geyser near the pool that shoots water up every 90 minutes(?). The area surrounding the main pool is beautiful with a water fall, plants and trees....and live ducks swim with you plus live bunnies help keep the grass short around the area. Take a leisure boat ride to the Magic Kingdom or to the Contempory Hotel for lunch/dinner if your not in a rush, its a great relaxing ride with great scenery of Bay Lake and the now closed Discovery Island and parts of Seven Seas Lagoon. There is a beach on Bay Lake great for sunning but no swiming in the lake. There are boats, bikes and fishing rods for rent. Outdoor Disney movies shown during the evennings near the beach. You could head over to Fort Wilderness Camp grounds by boat, bus, or even walk for horse back riding, meals at Trails End buffet restaurant or even a dinner show at Hoop De Do Musical Review. There is a small arcade just outside of the lobby heading to the bus depot. Also a weight room for you exercise fanatics, located in the Disney Villa building located on the right side of the resort heading to the bus depot. There is a laundry facility to wash and dry clothes. My room was located on the 6th floor, left side of hotel facing Bay Lake, with the pool view! Trually great view of the pool and Bay Lake! Recommend getting a room on the 5th floor or below because the view from the balcony is obstructed by the roof. You will have to stand up and look over the roof for the view. Room had 2 queen size bed (bunk beds are offered), with a small undercounter size refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer, thick towels, free newspaper Mon thru Thurs., ceiling fan, digital tv and great a/c. There is a (very) small room safe in the closet to lock away your valuables. The room rug seemed a bit warn, the shower curtain rod was a bit loose, and shower head a bit clogged up, other than that, no complaints. Maid service was wonderful. Free buses to and from the parks were never that long a wait and never qiute packed compared to the other bigger resorts that have more rooms (Wilderness Lodge with only 700 rms versus Pop Century w/2880 rms, All Star Resort combined w/6000rms, Caribean Beach with 7 stops around it's resort, fill the buses up fast and often), but the buses here do stop at one other (small) delux resort depending on which park you are going to. It beats getting (and returning) a rental car, getting lost, finding gas, worrying about damage to the car, and remembering where you parked at each of the huge parking lots. FYI, the bus from the resorts to the Magic Kingdom drops you off right near the entrance, compared to driving to the parking lot, taking a tram from the parking lot to the transportation center then taking either a ferry or monorail to the Magic Kingdom, then you have to do that in reverse going back to your car! Tough to do after a long long tiring day. But if staying at a Disney resort, parking at all the parks is free. This is the only delux resort on or near Seven Seas Lagoon not part of the Monorail System. The night time water pagent light parade runs thru Bay Lake from Seven Seas Lagoon. You could see parts of the nightly Magic Kingdom fire works form either the boat launch or even better from the beach. I used the Disney Magical Express to and from the Orlando International Airport (MCO). I've heard scary stories about the Express going to multiple resorts to pick up/drop off from MCO which can take a while. It all depends on the time of day. At night (off hours) it's great! It sure beats driving which I have done serveral times . If you want to take Disney's Magical Express, make sure you request it when booking your trip. They do not eccept walk ons! Disney Magical Express runs 24 hours a day and they will take care of your luggage for you from MCO airport straight to your room while you go to the parks and back to the airport when vacation is over. = ( But if you come in after 10 pm and before 5am(?), you will have to get your luggage yourself and take them to the Magical Express counter and bus, and from the bus to your room. The Magical Express is located in Terminal B on the 1st floor at MCO. Remember that!!!! I didn't. (heh heh) Do remember to tip the room maids, and other help. Did I miss anything?????

Like some of the reviewers, we were also given a ground floor room at check-in. At first, we were unsure, but then we realized our location was perfect. We were halfway between the Roaring Fork and the exit door to the boat launch, and we never had to wait for an elevator or climb any stairs. Everything was totally convenient to us. We had a lovely patio, and a mama and papa duck who liked to visit us every morning. The lobby was breathtaking - beautifully themed with plenty of space and loads of comfortable seats. There was plenty for the kids to do (arcade, Cub's Den, cartoonist at night) without having to \"plan\" an activity. I agree with others on some things, like the lighting in the rooms. A little dark, but I believe that was intentional, given the motif. Bright fluorescent lighting would not be reminiscent of the great lodges of the Pacific Northwest. Honestly, it also helped us to relax when we came back from the hustle and bustle of the parks. The rooms have connecting doors to the room next door, which makes things a little noisy sometimes. We had noisy neighbors for the first few days but thankfully they checked out. Maid service, while not \"white glove\", was good enough, and our attendant left little animals made out of washcloths in our room each day. My daughters were absolutely THRILLED with this, and began to make their own animals to leave for her. We found the front desk and concierge to be helpful and attentive, although I did overhear some people talking about the difficulty they had getting quarters for laundry. These same people were making racist remarks as well, so I am not sure I trust their opinion on anything, but I thought I would mention it. As for food, we were pleased with Roaring Fork - everything was fresh and tasty. Whispering Canyon was about as good as most places in Disney, which means average. But we didn't go to Disney for the food, we went for the experience. Whispering Canyon was fun for the kids. Everything is overpriced but the meal plan saved us a lot of money because we shared quick service meals. I know there are a lot of complaints about service, luxury, etc., but I think people have to remember that the price of Disney resorts is at a premium because of the real estate they occupy and the amenities they offer. Of course the monorail is the most convenient method of transport, but we had an easy time with the boat to MK and The Contemporary, and the buses to anywhere in Disney World. If we decide in the future we absolutely must be on the monorail, we can stay in one of the 3 resorts it serves (and pay more than the Wilderness Lodge rates, by the way!). One day, toward the end of our trip, we took a stroll over to Ft. Wilderness to check out the ponies and horses. We had called ahead to see if our 7 year old daughter could go on a trail ride and they informed us that the minimum age was 9 but that pony rides were available. When we arrived, we saw a sign that said \"Maximum height for pony rides: 48inches\". What is a 50 inch tall 7 year old to do? She was very disappointed, and we were annoyed that no one had told us this important piece of information when we called. However, we did get a chance to pet the ponies, and view some of the horses that work in the parks. We even saw one of them the next day at Magic Kingdom!

At check-in we were informed we were being upgraded from a standard room to a 6th floor room overlooking the pool/courtyard. I was somewhat disappointed we were assigned a handicapped room and wanted to ask for a different one, but being it was an upgrade my husband said we'd try the lower bed out and yet I would have preferred a regular bathroom with a tub. The patio on this 6th floor room didn't allow us to see below without standing, which would have been difficult for one in a wheelchair to see w/o standing. The laundry room was so small, so I got up at 4:30 am to make sure I could have washers and dryers before it got crowded, yet the quarter changer was out of change so I had to get quarters from the lobby clerk on duty at 4:45 am. I was a little surprised that a man was lying down on a chaise lounge by the pool, that turned out to be a hotel employee that was supposed to be cleaning the pool area. Once I dangled my feet in one of the hot tubs, he suddenly appeared with a closed sign & placed it next to the other hot tub w/o a word to me. He was probably surprised to be caught sleeping or lying down on the job. It was cold our entire 5 nite stay from 2/2-2/7/10, so I never even swam in the pool or got into the hot tub. The hot tubs were both full of guests when the sun was out and we were in the hotel. I was disappointed with the employee from housekeeping assigned to our room. There was a towel animal on the table the day we arrived, so I left a tip the next morning. Another was in the bathroom with a shower gel bottle that 2nd day, so I left a bigger tip the 3rd day. No towel animal was in 0ur room the 3rd day, so I didn't leave a tip. The next day we ret'd to our room from a park and noticed the 2nd animal was removed by this housekeeping employee, probably because she was mad we didn't leave a tip when she didn't leave an animal. It was the principle that she took an animal and didn't replace it. I informed the asst mgr (night) our last (Sat) nite, who contacted Housekeeping. The 2 ladies came to our room and delivered a whole bunch of towel creations, one with a lei on the top, I was so moved. They both apologized. I was so happy to get more than one animal from a Disney World hotel as we have never gotten more than 1 animal on any visit in our past 6 visits to WDW resorts since 2008. I left my sunglasses in the room on our last day on the bed, and called the hotel from one of the parks. They called me later that day after while we were in one of the them parks stating nobody turned in sunglasses from our room. I assume that 'maid' was not going to turn in any sunglasses if she found them on our bed whenw someone complained about her. I will return to Wilderness Lodge. The reason I chose WL was because of the $750 Disney gift card incentive and the lower rate/nite than other Deluxe hotels on Disney Property. The geyser was cool, but it was so cold that we had to wait quite a while for one boat, and the second time we waited to go by water, it took so long we gave up and went by bus, as did another family 10 minutes after us. I hope we can return to WL with a similar incentive and possibly swim and sunbathe. The small food service area surprised me as we have been to Port Orleans Riverside many times and enjoyed their selection of food/beverage.

This is, obviously our favorite hotel. It is very calming and comforting in the midst of the craziness of Disney. Plus it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the least expensive deluxe hotel. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the monorail but that ensures that the illusion of the Pacific Northwest continues. The Christmas decorations were up and the holiday music was playing. Even though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to enjoy the hotel as much as in the past since we had park tickets for each day of our stay, it was still wonderful to spend our down time here. The only downside was that the Christmas choirs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start appearing until the second week in December. The express check-in that you do on-line prior to leaving home was great.

It is one noisy place during the day with a staff person on the bullhorn. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great that there are activities for the kids, but come on. Some of us would like to take a rest mid-day and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not possible with all of that noise and music. We were lucky in that Disney was running a special at that time. I was hoping to catch the 'pay 4 days stay 7' but the only package available was the free dining plan. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never done the dining plan before (free or otherwise). It probably saved us more $ in the long run than free nights, especially since we rarely eat off site, except for the occasional visit to Celebration. Per person, you receive one snack, one counter service and one sit down meal per day's stay (although you don't have to use them on specific days). Some of the better restaurants (CA Grill, Yachtsman Steakhouse) require 2 sit down points per meal. The counter service meals were wonderful for lunch. You received a non-alcoholic beverage, entr\u00c3\u00a9e and dessert (ditto for dinner). Examples of snacks are pineapple dole whip (try one, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get hooked), popcorn, coffee, soda pop, Krispy treats, ice cream bar, etc. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use your sit down points for breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsave most for dinner and use counter service points for lunch. Just to give you a flavor of what where we were able to dine, we ate dinner at Sci Fi Diner and Mama Mellrose at Studios, Yachtsman Steakhouse, CA Grill, Pescos Bill at MK, Rose & Crown at Epcot. We enjoyed lunch at Germany and Chefs de France at Epcot, Flametree Barbecue at AK and at Polynesian counter service restaurant. We paid for lunch at Brown Derby since it requires 2 pts even for lunch. We also got a coupon for one free mini golf and discount and souvenir at Planet Hollywood along with a few other items (free arcade, etc.) that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take advantage of. The entrees at Yachtsman Steakhouse alone are in the $30-40 range. If they are offering it at the time, be sure to do this. You will get your money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth. We had a bunch of snack coupons left the last day, so we took home a lot of really delicious Krispy Treats. The Lodge is much quieter than the other resorts. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why because there are still kids running around. Maybe the calming music and colors helps. I have to say that service was much better than in years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 past as well. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a ferry from WL to MK. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to try it yet again\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgot rained out the last few days we were there. One of these days, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go over to MK on the boat even if we come right back. To reiterate what must have been said previously, a geyser goes off hourly, the pool starts as a brook in the hotel, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge fireplace and the lobby is just breath taking. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at Artist Point this trip but have had good meals there in the past albeit very long meals. The snack bar seems to have improved as we grabbed a quick breakfast a couple of times there. We do not like the food or atmosphere of Whispering Canyons (I wish they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come up with something else), but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the kids enjoy it. The nooks and crannies are still enjoyable and blessedly empty, with great views of the lobby and the beautiful music to lull you to sleep in an easy chair or sofa. Some of the rooms have views of fireworks from MK (and you can hear the music) and/or the electric water parade. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice gift shop where you can purchase outdoor Disney themed items along with snacks and sundries. You can rent a bike and bike over to Fort Wilderness. We did this one year, riding a surrey. It was a lot of fun but obviously we did this in the winter months\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just too hot and/or humid in the summer. The pool has a bar/snack shop, hot tub and slide, but we usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the pools any more. Housekeeping was fine and did leave a few hearts and I LUV YOUS spelled out in towels on various days. No towel animals, which was ok I guess as we still have some from previous visits. However, if we had never visited before, that would have been disappointing. We were celebrating an anniversary of sort. We did receive buttons and a few cast members wished us happy anniversary but not all that many. We were offered free glasses of champagne at Brown Derby, but, being that it was lunch, we declined. So our lovely waitress brought a heavenly serving of dense, chocolate mouse instead. We received a card from the hotel but no balloons or chocolates as we did when celebrating anniversaries and birthdays in the past. I guess the economic times have hit Disney as well. As I said, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time in the hotel this trip, but the time we did spend was relaxing and nothing went wrong unlike my past trip. I left with a better feel for Disney than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had in the while. And I almost forgot to mention the mattresses. They must have been changed since our last visit three years. They were the most comfortable mattresses I've ever slept on--anywhere. I have an extremely bad back, having been rear ended by a school bus when I was stopped, and I always worry about how I'm going to do with a mattress other than my own. I wanted to check those mattresses on the plane when I left, they were so comfortable. I would recommend staying on site\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou get too much in the way of convenience, extra hours, free parking, time and atmosphere not to. And since there are hotels for every budget, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really no need to stay anywhere else. Plus if you are really watching your $, stay on site and don't get a car. You can get Disney's Magical Express from the airport (won't have to carry your luggage--goes right from plane to Disney bus to hotel) and you can use Disney transportation throughout. However, we always get a car; it's just more convenient and we sometimes can't take the crying, tired kids at the end of the day, plus we like to park hop and we visit the other hotels and that is a nightmare to do on Disney transportation. At least for us, it is difficult to stay anywhere other than WL. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay there, make a trip to check out the lobby and the grounds. My bet is that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be spending your next visit to WDW there.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sairam66", "Title": "\u201cgorgeous but very poor service\u201d", "Author": "sairam66", "ReviewID": "UR56336905", "Content": "We have stayed at Wilderness Lodge numerous times, and always enjoy it.

The bathrooms are beat up from the nasty Florida water with the tubs stained with a gross yellow color. The beds were hard and not exactly what I'd expect for the price. Even though we went a week before the big President's weekend the maid service was terrible and our room was only cleaned once on a five night stay.

The food was terrible at all the restaurants, and we were glad we had a car to leave the resort and not be tied down to Disney food 24 hours a day. Unfortunately we had to use the Laundry facilities due to the bad weather, and it was like a zoo with only five washers for a hotel with over 850 rooms. You had to camp out in the laundry room to snag a washer or dryer, felt like a line at Magic Kingdom. We had another offsite hotel booked but thought getting the \"magic\" mornings and evenings would be worth the extra cost.

Here's why: (1) kids aren't into the decor -- they just want to be in the parks and on rides -- so the State Park theme didn't matter much; (2) the wait for the boat to/from the Magic Kingdom is sometimes short, sometimes quite long and sometimes the boat is an open craft (no walls), and sometimes enclosed -- it was cold when we were there, and it was colder on the boat -- we will definitely stay somewhere on the monorail line next time; (3) the rooms are basic, reasonably clean, but nothing special; (4) you must take the boat or the bus to get anywhere (such as to the other resorts for dinner), which was a bigger hassle than expected; and (5) our room had excellent acoustics from the water, so we heard the boat whistles/toots all day long.

I am sorry to say, however, that I probably won't be back. Having stayed at several other WDW resorts, I was expecting great service and a nice room, and I didn't really receive either. When we first arrived at the Lodge, we checked in and were given our room. It was on level 1, which I really wasn't thrilled about, but the check in \"cast member\" stated that it was currently all they had available. I was a bit taken aback when the \"cast member\" further stated that she was surprised our room was already cleaned and available for check in. This was at 2:50 PM and check in time was supposed to be after 3:00, even though I had requested our room be available at 2:00. Upon entering our dark room, I noticed that we were given a king sized bed, even though we had requested two queens, but figured I wouldn't complain since I was so tired from our freezing day at Animal Kingdom. The bed itself was maybe 1.5-2 feet off the floor, which was a bit strange and made it difficult to get in and out of (I'm about 8 months pregnant) They apparently use queen sheets to make the king sized bed, because every time we sat on the bed, one of the corners came off and it was obvious the sheets didn't fit. The bathroom had no tub, which made it hard to bathe my infant son and the fan in the bathroom was malfunctioning and made a constant annoying humming sound. The huge shower was a bit dirty, with many stray hairs throughout each corner and dingy tile grout. These of course are not huge flaws, but I was just disappointed in the room in general. I've had much nicer rooms at the cheaper Port Orleans and Coronado Springs resorts. I later came to find out that we had been given a handicap accessible room, even though I didn't request or need it and would have preferred a regular room. I also noticed that it seemed to take a long while for room service trays to be cleaned from guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doorways. We walked past the same several dirty trays 2 days in a row, which was really gross. I wouldn't expect that level of service from WDW, and I thought that they maybe neglected the rooms on our basement level a little more than the rest of the hotel. It also took forever to have our room cleaned each day. We came back from the parks at 5:00 to the same unmade bed and no clean towels, which was really unacceptable. (Normally I wouldn't care, but since the bed was so jacked up to begin with I couldn't really figure it out or bend down low enough to make it myself) It wasn't just us who had problems either. My mother and grandmother checked in one day after us. We had requested that our rooms be either connected or close by and they actually put them on the 5th floor. When they checked in (at 4:30 pm) they were given keys to a room that they discovered was already occupied, with Disney bags and luggage to boot. Good thing they are not thieves, because they could have easily swiped someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s' souvenirs if they wanted to. Upon their asking if a handicap accessible room was available (my grandma is wheelchair bound) they were told that those rooms were only for those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who really needed it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?!? This is obviously hilarious, because I was given such a room even though I obviously didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need or want one. All in all, the grounds are great, the Whispering Canyon and Roaring Fork are pretty good, but my room and the service was definitely lacking.

We did not go the Whispering Canyon - very loud sometimes and pricey. We bought breakfast food in the Mercantile and had a lot of breakfasts in the room that way. My wife went on the hotel tour and loved it - learned a lot about the lodge. The pool is a lot of fun - heated - swim with the ducks - great slide and they provide entertainment at the pool every afternoon and evening. We also didn't realize there are Disney movies shown on the lodge beach every night outside. We went on the pirate tour fireworks boat with \"Patch\" the pirate - fantastic. Snacks and drinks at the Contemporary - meet and greet with Captain Hook and Schmee. Patch was great - knows a little about every town in America as he got to know everyone on the boat. Stand up comedy (clean Disney humor) and fireworks for kids and adults - every kid gets a pirate prize when you leave and Peter Pan was on the dock when we got back. We went on the bass fishing trip on the Disney lakes - 2 hours - about $240 for four and we each caught a bass - JR the guide was excellent with our kids and us - very laid back trip - just perfect. Bring along your portable DVD players - oddly there are none in the rooms. You can rent DVD's at the Mercantile. On one day my daughter had a stomach bug (probably snacking too much on too many things) and made a mess on the carpet. Instantly housekeeping cleaned and disinfected the carpet and we didn't smell anything. They also left the towels animals most days. Regarding internet access - Disney - its 2010 - put in the free WiFi - you can afford it. We actually accessed the internet with a USB dial modem and a local 407 area code access number - sure it was a little slow but we were jsut checking business email - nothing more - we were at DIsney to have fun. The only negative I had was the bell hop as we were leaving - he got very opinionated after he learned we were from Massachusetts (the senate race) and made sure to tell me what he thought about the state and its politics. I was on vacation at Disney - I didn't need the outside world intruding or his opinions.", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBest Location for families with children\u201d", "Author": "momoftwinsOntario", "ReviewID": "UR54497489", "Content": "Our family had a wonderful stay at the Wilderness Lodge.

Unfortunate for me - the room was located next to a staircase fire door and when that closed the whole room shock. By the next day my daughter complained, I went to the front desk and without question and with a smile moved us to 3115 - the fantasy continued - our sliding glass door was in the trees facing the courtyard - at night the trees were illluminated by lights, you could hear the creek, from the balcony - you could also see the pool area, the lake, the gyser (that goes off on the hour - what a treat to see)- the view could not be beat. At night you could watch the light show. Whispering Canyon cafe was a hoot, be sure to ask for catchup and a little more soda and Roaring Forks cafe was great. We had the refillable mugs and had hot cocoa every night. We had the deluxe meal plan and even with signature meals did not use them all. My daughter loved the resort so much she did not want to go to the parks. She swam, attended children's programs, games, arcades and roaming the lobby with the totem poles, indian items and fire place and rockers, and the stream starts in the lobby. The boat to Magic Kingdom was the easiest and such fun. Never a line. We rented a two person Surry and rode over to Fort Wilderness and checked out the ponies. Staff was always there to help. Devora was our cleaning person, and everyday she made us new animals, it was such a treat to come into the room and see a new creation. The rooms are regular size, but then there were only two of us. There were two sinks, safe and refrigerator - and that was fine for us. The beds were sooo comfy and the pillows also. I wanted to take their blankets home. Yes there were always plenty of towels - I think there were six daily for us. Oh there is laundry facilities $2.00 washer and drier and we used them. Pop in washer, play bingo - go back pop in drier another game of bingo. I can not express what a joy it was to stay at this hotel. I have never stayed at a deluxe - but if you have kids and they need to run and roam this it it. They have a play ground, water slides and a beach. Please consider this one.

We had a fantastic time. The hotel has very nice public spaces. The lobby is impressive, the streams are lovely, and the pool was beautiful. The kids (6 and almost 4) loved the water slide and the ducks that have made the pool home. They also liked the activities around the pool. The woman who ran the activities when we were there was great with kids and spent time building with blocks with our son and helping my daughter with chalk. When we arrived our room was ready. We asked if any upgrades were available and they did upgrade us to a pool view room at no extra charge. The rooms were fine. There was nothing particularly exciting about them - yes, they are in the \"camp\" theme. The kids were happy. The downfall is the bathroom. The double sink is outside the shower/toilet area which is fine. But the actual bathroom is small and not impressive. It's fine and clean, just nothing to write home about. I just kept thinking we could have been staying off property at a Ritz Carlton for considerably less - but we would have lost a lot of the convenience. It just made me wonder if this was \"luxury\" what was \"moderate\" like. I would not be interested in finding out. As far as convenience, I would not pay extra to stay at a hotel on the monorail. From what I saw the Grand Floridian, Contemporary, and Polynesian were all about $100 more per night. I have to tell you that we really enjoyed taking the boat directly to the Magic Kingdom. It was beautiful and relaxing (our weather was good though). There is a separate boat that brings you to the Contemporary so you could take the monorail from there to the other hotel (we had some character meals planned at the Grand Floridian). We checked out the Contemporary and Grand Floridian properties. The Contemporary was stark and I don't think as fun for kids. The Grand Floridian was very fancy - my daughter called it Eloise's hotel. But I still preferred the natural beauty of Wilderness - with lots of trees and wild greenery. The only big downfall of Wilderness are the restaurants. We didn't go the top end restaurant there as we were with the kids. The casual sit down restaurant is fun for a one time meal. The servers joke around with you, the kids run around on hobby horses each hour on the hour, and it's fun a raucous. That's a one time thing in my book. Then there is a fast food type place. The only healthy options are a couple salads. Lots of double bacon cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, etc. It would have been nice to have some higher quality there. We ended up going and eating at a lot of other resorts for character meals - there aren't any at this hotel. We had no problem hopping over to other resorts in the morning, but by the evening we were really tired and just didn't want to have the hassle of venturing out. I would have liked some other food options. But, bottom line, we all enjoyed ourselves and I would stay again... Oh, and some people complained about how far it was to the lobby or the docks. Well, I have to say that is pretty shocking. The property is really not that big. I think that a lot of people have gotten lazy. If you have a disability I could see the halls being long.

The boats to Magic Kingdom and Fort Wilderness were convenient and we never waited more than a few minutes for one. The thing I liked most about this resort compared to many of the others is that everything was close by. At most of the Disney resorts you walk and walk to reach the buses, restaurants, and pools, not here. We ate at the whispering canyon cafe and enjoyed it. We also ate at the Hoop Dee Do Revue at Fort Wilderness. This was a fun dinner show, but the food was mediocore. Every night at the resort they do family portraits with your photo pass. I highly recommend this especially if you come back and get cleaned up from a day at the park for dinner. Its the perfect time for a photo and they do a very nice job. The cast members at the front desk and restaurant were friendly, but I must say that most every one at the resort was not. We waited an hour ( patiently) for the lady in front of us to chose her photos at the resort photo pass desk the guy gave her top notch service and when it was our turn we weren't even spoken to or acknowledged. This was one instance we had out of a lot during our stay. We encountered many unpleasant and down right rude cast members on our trip this time, more than ever before.

Issues with cleaning and cleanliness. The rooms need updating or a good cleaning. Concierge service was erratic: different information depending on who you got.

Ten minutes later I called the Disney reservations number and found the carriage rides were wide open. This was the first trip to Disney where we had difficulty obtaining reservations.

Wasn't too sure about the ducks in the pool and my daughters were playing one day and splashed water toward them and got in trouble by the life guards, hmmm, didn't think ducks were suppose to be in the pool, but didn't bother us, guess disney wants the ducks there, ha ha. Overall, the resort workers here were very friendly, on occassion ran into one that was a little grumpy but for the most part they were friendly and very helpful. I had a moment one morning to go onto my balcony, we had a room that overlooked the courtyard, and the water sounds were so peaceful, with three kids I didn't get that often. My parents stayed on the woods view side and it was also very quiet. The boats were good no big wait time, but sometimes ten or fifteen minutes, busses were very quick to come and pick you up. The food at the Roaring Forks was good, lots to select from, just be careful how you use your dining plan for combinations, etc. The Whispering Canyon had great food, we really enjoyed dinner and breakfast there. Didn't try the Artist Point. I would recommend this resort, we will definitely consider going back, I would like to try other disney resorts, but since we liked this one so much I will be afraid I will be dissappointed and wished we would have been at the Wilderness so we will be back here. ONE THING WE WILL NOT DO AGAIN: is the Whoop De Doo Show, not worth it, the show was nice the food was o.k., BUT, they asked everyone to be there one half hour early, we went as well as did everyone else registered, they gave us a peice of paper and we stood outside in the heat for a half hour before we got in. It was really, really hot and with kids, not nice. I was upset, thought ok, don't be upset you are on vacation, then I went to the restroom, where there were lots of moms rubbing cool rags on their kids faces and just as upset as I was.

The rooms are spacious and clean (as are all Disney hotels). The beds are extremely comfortable. We stayed in a Courtyard View room and requested a view of Silver Creek Falls. It was wonderful! We looked out over the falls and over the pool. The lodge also has two excellent restaurants -- Whispering Canyon Cafe and Artist Point -- as well as a quick-service location. Aside from the wonderful atmosphere and comfortable rooms, location is a key feature of this hotel. Wilderness Lodge and Animal Kingdom Lodge are the two least-expensive Deluxe Resorts at Disney. Their pricing is the same, but the location of the Wilderness Lodge is far superior. We were just a 10-minute boat ride from the Magic Kingdom!

Our trip was from Thursday, September 24th to Monday, September 28th. We originally had booked the Coronado Springs Hotel, before arriving by Disney Magical Express and our driver getting pulled over by the police. We finally arrived at the Coronado Springs Hotel only for the hotel personnel to tell us that we would not be staying there and we would be going over to the Wilderness Lodge. So off we were, back into a white van this time with one of the Coronado Springs front desk employees driving us over to our new hotel. When we first walked in, the main lobby of the Wilderness Lodge is beautiful, with its tall timbers, and log cabin look, it really gives the feel of being out west. The Disney feel was there as I was trying to find the hidden Mickey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in their d\u00c3\u00a9cor. There is a living room area over to the right of the check-in counter with a TV playing Disney movies that my daughter really liked. Check in was quick, staff was very nice, and our rooms were on the 7th floor club level with access to the Old Faithful Club with concierge service located right off the elevator. My room was one queen size bed and one set of bunk beds which my daughter thought was the coolest thing around. Rooms were exceptionally clean especially the bathrooms; housekeeping really does a nice job. The flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the room were also great to relax and watch some TV after a long day walking the parks. The Old Faithful club was the added bonus. My room was a few steps from this great kitchen area where we were able to have breakfast in the morning before going over to one of the parks. There was usually bowls of fruit, an assortment of cold cereal; (Cheerios, Fruit loops, Raisin Bran) bagels, muffins and other pastries along with coffee, tea and juice. This would close by 10:30 a.m. and then reopen about 11:15-11:30 with cookies, brownies, gummy bears etc. The Mercantile store downstairs in the lobby was great for any last minute souvenirs, and I thought it was great that they closed at 11:00 p.m. The quick service restaurant was also convenient too for snacks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and they closed at midnight. I had two quick services left on my card the last day so I went to the Roaring Fork and used it for rice-krispy treats, cookies, etc. to bring on the plane for my daughter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and just to use up the last meals I had left so they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to waste. There is also a photopass desk across from the Mercantile store, that you can purchase pictures taken in the park. I thought this was a great perk as the photopass people are right there to help you with your picture selection. I do recommend doing the Mickey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Not So Scary Halloween party in the Magic Kingdom. The parade that Disney puts on is the best, the headless horseman rides by pretty quick and if you blink or turn your head you will miss him. My daughter liked the trick or treating in the park after the parade was over, just certain attractions are open as you get another map of the parks with your wristbands.

Everyone else stayed at the Port Orleans-Riverside resort, a moderate resort. We've always liked the woody/outdoorsy feel, so the Wilderness Lodge was appealing, but it was a deluxe resort, so it was more costly. Luckily, it went on sale, so it wasn't that much more expensive, but I feel that we got a lot more for the money. The resort looks like a giant log cabin and you're greeted by a giant lobby when you enter the building. There's 7 stories to the resort and each side has a totem pole (The Eagle and the Raven). The floors are wooden and the resort gives a very open feel. There's a spring in the lobby which leads to a river outside which leads down to the pool. Check in was super-easy. We checked-in online, so everything was waiting for us when we got there and the online check-in line was easy to find. (In Port Orleans, it was harder to find and several 2/3 rooms were not ready at check-in.) We went up to our room and it was a \"long\" hallway that opened up to the sinks/vanity on the left, the closet on the right and then the room itself which had a queen bed and a bunk bed. The motif all stayed with the outdoorsy feel, with carved wooden animals on the bed posts and a beautiful carved headboard. The room was a little dark because there are 2 small lights at the head of each bunk bed and no overhead light on that side. Our room was 5061 which was in the corner of the courtyard which gave a nice view from the balcony. It had a large flat screen TV and sufficient drawer space for 2 parents and a child for 1 week. The one downside to the room was that we heard what sounded like a sliding closet door opening and closing all the time. We think that it was the service elevator that we heard because our room was next to the stairs and I believe there was a service elevator in there. It wasn't loud enough to keep or wake us up, but it was kind of annoying. The pool was great. There's a small kiddie pool good for toddlers/babies. There are 2 jacuzzis, one was set hot and one was set warm. The hot one is on the left with the pool to your back. The pool has lifeguards until 8pm and the waterslide closes at 8pm, but the pool is open until midnight. The waterslide is not huge, but you can get some speed on it. The pool is 3'6\" at the exit of the slide. Beyond the pool is the walkway to the boat dock. You can take this boat to the Magic Kingdom or the Fort Wilderness Resort/Campground. There were a lot of bugs on the walkway, but out by the dock, it wasn't bad. At night, you can see the fireworks from the MK, but many of them are obscured by the trees. At 9:35pm each night, they have a floating electrical parade which was probably my son's favorite part. (We saw it 4 times!) Boats float out and there's music playing and they light up individually. You can also see it from the balcony area on the 5th floor and hear the music if you don't want to go down to the dock. Food options: We never ate in the Artist Pointe, so I have no opinion on it. The Roaring Forks is a \"quick-service\" cafeteria-style restaurant with some really good food. I think we had dinner there 4 times during our stay. We didn't get the $13 refillable cups, but many people did and seemed to fill up quite a lot. The flatbread pizzas were very good. The bacon double cheeseburger is HUGE! The fries were awesome, the pasta salad was just ok. There was plenty of selection to choose from. The Whispering Canyon restaurant gets a lot of press as being very good. The food was delicious! The bottomless milkshakes are awesome! (seven flavors including chocolate, caramel, bubblegum and cotton candy) It is pricey, so it's best if you're on the meal plan. Dinner for 2 adults/1 child ran around $90, not including the tip. They have various things going on while you're eating including a wooden pony race, sing alongs and call outs. Be sure to ask for some ketchup while you're there! Our first night we ate there, the food was good, but our waitress was awful, it took forever to get anything and they ran out of a bunch of stuff (including the milkshakes and iced tea). The 2nd time we ate there was more out of necessity than desire, but the experience was night and day. In the end, I would recommend the Whispering Canyon, but plan on possibly having to wait. Also, make your reservations early as they fill up quite a bit. A couple of odds/ends: The room has a small fridge and there's a microwave in the Roaring Forks, so you can keep leftovers. We also brought a giant bag of cereal, dollar store bowls and spoons and bought milk at the mercantile to not use up one of our items from the meal plan. We had so much food to eat that we didn't eat too much of the cereal, but did have our glass of milk in the morning. The resort has a pretty good store with touristy stuff in addition to bread/milk, etc. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. One item that we noticed different from the Polynesian (where the magical express went first) was that no one greeted us when we arrived, we were dropped off and then had to find our way in. It would have been nice to be greeted/welcomed. However, at the bus depot (off to the side, not in the front of the resort) where you took buses to the attractions, there was someone there to answer questions, so that was nice when 5 Hollywood Studios buses came, but no Epcot one.

Not a major problem for adults, but it made it impossible for the kids to brush their teeth! We had to turn one of our carseats into a makeshift step stool for them, and even then it was a challenge. They should provide step stools in the rooms for the kids. Also, they only bring glass for drinking. Again, not a problem for adults, but a 4-year-old should not be holding a glass!

As stated in many other reviews the lobby is awesome - be prepared to take lots of pictures I have seen some negative reviews for people staying there very recently and wonder what happened to them; The staff is EXTREMELY friendly - everyone we met in the resort and the parks The resort, grounds and room were spotless Our room was cleaned daily - housekeeping was there by around 9:30 each day because I bumped into them a time or two when leaving Sheets were changed daily - towels and wash clothes made into little animals. Our room was in great condition - shabby and outdated?? NOT! The pool was excellent with a water slide - water was chrystal clear and warm - my son, 3 1/2, LOVED the water slide..as did most of the children. Tip: The pool is open late, till midnight I think, but the water slide closes at 8:00 PM because this is when the lifeguards go off duty and it becomes swim at your own risk. This is also why the poolside bar closes at that time ( we did not use the bar but I seen some reviews complaining about why it closed \"early\") so if you want to use the slide, be aware of the hours. They might change with the seasons so ask a lifeguard to be sure. The beds were very comfortable in the room and we had a big screen tv (which we barely turned on) and a balcony overlooking the wooded courtyard and the lake.We had a queen sized bed and a bunk bed in our room and it worked out great with my son sleeping on the top bunk and us using the bottom for staging clothing, cameras, etc. The only reason I did not rate the room a \"5\" was that I think a deluxe resort room would be bigger. The room was defintiely a comfortable size but it being a bit larger would push it to a 5 but it was never an issue, this is purely opinion on my part. Tip: The room has a safe (very small maybe six inches deep) and a small refrigerator but no microwave. There is a microwave in the eating area of the Roaring Forks restaurant on the main floor which you could use if you needed to but you cannot heat anything up in your room (there is a coffe maker in the room though). Keep this in mind when taking home leftovers. I also listed value as a \"4'. We got a great deal on the room during a special they were running - Defintiely look for these when traveling. If I was going to pay full price for the room staying there a week, I might look at one of the cheaper resorts depending on the cost just because it is pricey ( relative term of course) so that is why it gets a 4 not a 5. The Roaring Forks is a fast serve restaurant but the food quality is very good and good sized portions. It looked like some of the food ( pasta) was microwaved but the sandwiches were big and I watched them grill burgers, chicken breast sandwiches and make pizzes so the food is good. The main restaurant - Whispering Canyon - in the lobby is very good - it is loud but fun - it is SUPPOSED to be loud - the staff jokes and carries on with the guests - and ALL YOU CAN DRINK MILKSHAKES - 7 FLAVORS! Transportation around the area is well managed - Different buses take you to and from the various parks and at most there is one stop between the Wildenerss Lodge and another resort, both going and coming. The waitts are minimal. There is a boat that runs solely from the Wilderness Lodge directly to the front gate of the Magick Kingdom and back and is about a 7 minute ride each way. We used this several times. Tip: If you have a little one and are bringing a stroller - if it works for you bring an umbrella stroller - MUCH easeir to get on and off busses and boats. We had one and saw a lot of people wrestling with the larger types. Also it rains intermittently in Florida as the norm and in the parks you will be \"parking\" your strollers outside in the open while going on rides. Bring a cheap rain poncho or large plastic bag to throw over your stroller if it looks cloudy while you go on rides so you don't come out to a soaked stroller and belongings. We picked up ponchos at home at Walmart in the sporting goods section for $5 - they cost considerably more at Disney All in all a beautiful resort, clean comfortable room and great service Now - only \"problem\" as previously mentioned was dining in the parks and the resorts for sit down or \"table service\" meals - almost everyting was booked ahead..months ahead..long waits for openings without a reservation - if you could even get in at all at some places. Without a reservation be prepared to wait about an hour at some locations, this includes the Whispering Canyon Restaurant. TIP: Make reservations ahead of time and I mean days or weeks ahead if practifcal. If not, try the concierge desk at the hotel,,they really try but they are also using the same web based system you can use at home. best bet, go direct to the restaurant you want the day before if you can - they have much more control on-site than the concierge or you at your pc. We did this a few times at restaurants showing booked for the entire week and the people at the podium got us in the next day with a reservation or gave us times to come back on stand-by that were not crowded. Other than the first day or two of learning the \"system\" we had no significant waits for meals after this. Final \"problem\" you pay daily for internet acess in your room - we did not use it, we were on vacation ..so are you..hit the parks or the pools and enjoy your stay!", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "fl", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place!\u201d", "Author": "neslxcivic", "ReviewID": "UR44830445", "Content": "This was a wonderful hotel to stay at.

This was our first trip to this resort and there wasn't one thing we can complain about really. Arrival: Check-in was prompt. Our luggage was delivered timely. All of the staff were helpful and so nice and pleasant. Room: At first it was quite a let-down location wise. We had a standard room and looked out on the smokehouse and a swamp. Then we remembered that we wouldn't be in the room during the day much so stopped stressing about it. What stood out was at night when we were not at the Magic Kingdom to see the fireworks up close, we had a perfect view from our balcony and it was such a nice ending to our day. Our room was nothing spectacular really - nice flat screen tv I guess. We didn't receive any towel animals. We did tip but after the 2nd day, we realized nothing extra was going to happen so with the cost of the room being so pricey, we thought that we were already paying for them to do the basic cleaning and replacing our towels and it wasn't necessary to give them anything more. Restaurants: We only ate at Whispering Canyon and Roaring Forks 1x each but what we did have was good. We loved the refillable mugs especially since they offered tea and Coke Zero. Big plus!!!! Amenities: The pool was great. We usually came back in the mid-afternoon and it was nice to go out and swim. Since we were there the day after Labor Day until Saturday, it wasn't crowded at all and we had plenty of room to swim and relax. The boat ride was great and so efficient. We never waited very long. The bus to Hollywood Studios was quite long and it seemed like it took forever to get there but I guess that is the way of the bus system there. Overall, we would recommend the Wilderness Lodge.

Our room was in a great location - at the lake end of the 4th floor -overlooking the woods and pool area of the villas next door. Very quiet. Quick access to the stairs to get down to the pool and to walk to breakfast. Ambience - is nice. The wilderness theme is carried throughout the resort right down to the smallest detail!! Very warm and relaxing. The main lobby is quite spectacular and the views are wonderful. Restaurants - we ate at all three. We had breakfast everyday at the Roaring Forks. Yogurt and fruit parfaits and huge fresh muffins were yummy - but they also had fresh fruit cups, whole fruits, cerals, oatmeal and hot breakfast options. We had lunch there our first day when we arrived. It was great. Huge fresh made to order sandwiches and salad. Didn't have dinner there. The people working at the checkout were helpful and really pleasant. We had dinner at the Artist Point. It was lovely. The service was terrific and the food was really good. We had dinner one night at Whispering Canyon. It was very hectic - which was fun for the young ones. I wasn't crazy about the food choices. Not my favourite dinner of the trip. The pool area is really nice. A small but fun slide in the middle and lots of room to move around. There is another pool at the Villas next door and it is less crowded. There is a small wading pool, as well for the little ones. There are two hot tubs for late at night, if you like hot tubs. We ended our hectic days at the theme parks with a swim and beer by the pool - very relaxing. Rooms were kept very cleam by housekeeping. Fresh towels everyday and our linens were very clean. Really comfortable pillows and beds, as well. We leave tips daily (rather then at the end of our stay) and always have excellent room service. Our room was cleaned by noon every day of our vacation. I think that the rooms are starting to get a bit dated - but they were clean and ours was oversized - so we can't complain. Also loved to have that first coffee everyday out on the balcony with the paper. Very relaxing. Gift shop in the resort was really well stocked. Everything from bottles of wine to T-shirts. The games room was fun - lots of arcade type things to do. This was our first trip to Disney. We've managed to avoid it for all these years by travelling other places with our kids.

The room was okay but was never cleaned before 3.45pm each day (just when you are returning from the parks) and so we ended up swapping towels with the cleaners in the corridor - so in effect our room was not cleaned half the time. When I complained the receptionist was dismissive and rude - folding her arms and quoting me how many rooms they had to clean every day. (No Disney magic here then).Some of the hotel staff were friendly but I found most of the reception staff unhelpful, arrogant and patronising. The access to the Magic Kingdom by boat across the lake was good but as stated in other reviews the buses stop at other hotels on the way so the journey can take up to 45 minutes to go just a couple of miles.I could go on about the lack of extra 'magic hours' but will concentrate on the hotel review. The Roaring Fork cafe was basic, very busy and serves microwave meals (including the burgers)! It was impossible to get booked into the main restaurant - 'The Whispering Canyon' until 9.30pm due to guests booking it solid 90 days in advance. That said on the one occasion we did dine there it was terrible - poor choice of menu and very noisy. The pool area is dated and in need of refurbishment. By far the worst feature of the holiday is the change in guests staying at Disney since we visited two years ago. In 2007 we met nice friendly people. Since the introduction of the free 'Disney dining plan' the hotel is now full of loud, greedy individuals who are obsessed with getting all they can to eat on their 'plan.' They are loud and their children run around the hotel unsupervised till all hours. Not what we expected from a 'deluxe' hotel and Disney need to do some serious re thinking.

Upon checking in, we told the lady we were on our honeymoon and she congratulated us with some \"Happily Ever After\" pins and a room upgrade! The room was clean and designed to theme perfectly!! We really loved all of the details and \"hidden mickeys\" this hotel had! My husband got a kick out of looking for all of the secret Mickeys they had hidden at the hotel :) The hotel pool was great. The geyser was not working when we were there, but I imagine when it is it is pretty cool! There were 2 jacuzzi's which also came in handy after walking all day. I would suggest buying a suvenier mug from the take out resturant they have near the pool. It may seem like alot at first, but it allows you to get as much soda or juice from the fountain as you would like for free for the remainder of your stay.

Our room had a very small (I mean, barely large enough for 2 people to sit side-by-side) balcony overlooking a wooded area. We did enjoy relaxing out there, though. - Housekeeping service was great. We requested turn-down service, and each evening they turned down the beds, left chocolates, replenished towels, and left us adorable towel animals! - The staff were very courteous and helpful. The front desk person did a great job of welcoming us to the resort. - The ferry service to Magic Kingdom Things I didn't like: - The ferry service to Magic Kingdom. :) Every time the ferry comes in or leaves (which I believe is every 15 minutes during the day?), they sound a horn. If we happened to be in our room relaxing between parks during the day, the annoying horn could be heard every 15 minutes. Not great for napping. - The famous geysers were not working at all during our stay - The hotel was nice but lacked the feel of elegance that is typical of other Disney Deluxe Resorts (Grand Floridian, Yacht Club, etc).

Our housekeeper was great and checked with us to see when it would be a good time to tidy up our room. She even left great towel animals for us when we came back in the afternoon. Room service was fast and the front desk had a great scavenger adventure for the kids to find the hidden Mickey Mouse heads. The food at the Lodge was great and large portions to take back for later. The lobby is very grand and we regret not taking the tour which talks about all the details in the large area. The pools were great to include my girl being able to swim with the ducks that hang around. Keep your eye out for a couple rabbits which like to come out along the walking path.

Overall we got a great deal through the military which was well worth the money spent. If you want some advice about the parks, get the fastpass right away for the rides you want, go early to Hollywood Studios which was the most unpleasant of all the parks.

The location is great- we used the bus service almost exclusively and with exception to Downtown Disney and Animal Kingdom there was little to no wait for a bus and the ride was less than 15 minutes. The wait for the Downtown Disney and Animal Kingdom buses was a bit longer (about 10 minutes) and did take longer (30-45 minutes) to arrive at the destination but they are the farthest away from most of the resorts as well .

Don't get me wrong the lobby is fabulous but you're not sleeping in the lobby. The rooms are quite small for a deluxe hotel but my biggest gripe about this place were the midges and mosquitos. They were there in their droves. I wanted to watch the electric lake show but within 5 minutes I'd been bitten 15 times. I paid the extra to stay here for the balcony - sitting out in the evenings after a busy trek in the parks - well - in my dreams. If they didn't attack you on the balcony they were watching you through the patio doors, desperate to attack. My next big gripe was the room allocation. We booked with Disney and paid extra for a Wood View room. The first room we were given overlooked the bus stop and the edge of the car park - there were two trees. That was the wood. We asked to be moved. The next room they gave us was situated at the edge of the service area for the hotel. And when I mean service area I'm talking about the size of a Wal-Mart distribution depot. Not only was it huge and ugly; the large articulated lorries were delivering at 5:30 am in the morning with their reverse beepers going. I felt sorry for the standard rooms that directly overlooked that place. I would have left the hotel and gone somewhere else. So we asked to be moved again. They gave us a room 10 rooms away from that last one. We could still hear the service centre but at least we couldn't see it. We overlooked a swamp and some trees and the lake. The best thing about this third and final room was that we could see the Disney castle and fireworks through and above the trees. It was worth complaining but we shouldn't have to. Most importantly I cam concerned about the Disney service. It's going downhill. Some cast members are great but others......one cast member who was carrying the trash voluntarily gave some helpful information on events around the parks and then wanted a tip! He didn't get one but it made me feel very uncomfortable. One of the Captain's of the ferry boats needed to go to charm school but the others were fantastic and great. It's a shame that their colleagues let them down. One morning I went down to the main pool for an 8:15 swim...urghh..the pool was freezing cold and there were plasters stuck to the edge. The pool water was a foot below the top and not going through the vents and large bugs the size of scorpions were swimming away like this was just an extension of the lake. I was so disappointed.

The bathroom was a walk in shower, and all 1 big open space with tile. There was ample room to move around, and we were on the ground floor (Room # 1154) so there was a patio looking towards the Villas. The large bathroom was because we were given a wheelchair accessible room. No big deal to me, it was nice to have the oversized shower! The bed (1 King) was comfy, and the room theming was nice. The bed lights were ingirated into the headboard and there were light switches built into the bed posts. We took the boat over to the contemporary one night, it was quiet and peaceful.

The one time we did use the bus was from EPCOT to the hotel. This was just after illuminations and the bus was packed. I expected as much, however our driver did not seem to bright. We were literally standing onto of one another, and she kept trying to cram more people in! After some mild yelling on the crowds part she stopped letting people on and left.

Many times during our stay there would be several busses come and go to a few of the parks, but others would have one only every 45 minutes or so. They had also combined routes with other disney hotels and we had to stop at 2-3 other hotels before making our way to parks. I did not remember this from the last time we stayed at Disney in 2002. I thought each resort had dedicated park transportation. We also attempted to take the ferry to the Contemporary for a character meal, however, we had to wait nearly an hour and one of the boats that came during the hour was full with no room for other passengers. On a positive note, the lobby areas and pool areas are still fantastic, we enjoyed the water parade in the evening and the concierge was extremely helpful in getting meal reservations for us.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cEXPENSIVVVVVVE\u201d", "Author": "TravelingMusicMajor", "ReviewID": "UR33209596", "Content": "Rooms are small and not very clean.

As usual, this trip was with my wife and 2 year old twins. The rooms are almost identical in size, layout, and quality of similar rooms in the Polynesian and Animal Kingdom. The room has touches to make it feel \"lodgy\", like \"carved\" headboards with a wilderness scene on it. Overall, I found the rooms to be less quiet versus other WDW properties. For starters, the toilets have some sort of pressure boost on them that make them extremely loud. We were on a lower floor and heard toilets in adjacent and above rooms going at all hours (extra magic hours at MK meant people coming \"home\" at 2 and 3 AM). The other noise complaint I have is the frequent horns blowing from the boats taking people to the Contemporary and MK. I ate at the Whispering Canyon restaurant for breakfast and found it moderately entertaining. The scene is a quasi-western feed house (more like Wall Drug) and the characters do a lot of shouting and tom-foolery. It's very entertaining if you're the 5-15 crowd. My 2 year olds didn't get it. As an adult, I enjoyed some of the pranks that were played on other guests (like putting all the ketchup at one table then \"making\" them take it to the other tables on demand... was more fun than my description). Breakfast options include an all you \"care to\" eat skillet which contains pancakes, waffles, egg, sausage, bacon, and home fries. The food itself was good, consistent with other similar meals at other Disney resorts. The main swimming pool is decent. It's smaller than AK's. It's a standard entry (vs. beach entry) and in the main pool, I think the shallowest portion is about 3 feet deep. There's a short water slide. There's also a children's pool near by that is bowl shaped and is maybe 18 inches deep. The pool area is themed with a geyser/waterfall motif which creates some good visual interest. Bus transportation is available to all other major Disney destinations and to Downtown Disney (where you can connect elsewhere). There are 2 water taxis... one to the Ft. Wilderness campground & Contemporary hotel, and the other to MK. Just a guess, but it seemed like the taxi to MK runs every 20-30 minutes, or so, during the day.Personally, I preferred this aspect of travel to MK versus the bus system from other Disney hotels because it maintained the ambiance of being away from the typical hustle and bustle. Overall, I was very satisfied with the Wilderness Lodge and would definitely recommend it to others. My main complaint about toilet and boat noise wasn't enough to keep me away, but if I had a choice between similar WDW properties for a similar rate, I think I'd choose AK or Polynesian over Wilderness Lodge.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Disney Experience\u201d", "Author": "Canadian007", "ReviewID": "UR32970999", "Content": "We stayed at the Wilderness Lodge June 13-20 2009 with our family of 2 children (6 and 2). We had a great stay and highly recommend this hotel. ROOM & FACILITY As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are a bit small, but for our family of four, was fine. There was a refrigerator in the room (which was convenient) and it was cleaned every day. The maid even asked us when we expected to leave our room every day so she could plan for cleaning it before we would return. We had a \"woods view room\", two queen beds, with a view... on the woods. So not a lot of \"view\", but all the sound from the fireworks at Magic Kingdom at night and the boat arriving at the lodge. It was not a big issue for us, but if you are sensitive to noise, you may want to make sure you are not on the Magic Kingdom side. It is true however that you will have a fair view of the fireworks at night, across the trees, especially if you are at least on the fifth floor. Advice: if you want a room with bulked beds, or a view of the pool/lake, make sure to book your room as such. We booked our room through Club Voyage/Nolitour. The only room category they offered was \"standard\" and \"woods views\". The travel agent told us that \"wood view\" was the top category and we just had to ask for bulk bed/lake view on the file and it would be considered. This was incorrect information as they have many rooms categories. The type of room we wanted was another category that required a small additional charge. They were not able to updgrade us to a different category at check in because the hotel was booked solid. Our room was still very fine - but the advice is to check directly on Disney web site for the different room categories and not rely on your travel agent. The hotel has a very nice pool, I would say a bit small given the size of the hotel - so it was very crowded all day, but we could always find a spot. There is a convenient pool bar offering various drinks. You can get a life jacket for infants at no additional charge. Bicycles and boats are available for renting just by the \"no swim\" beach. RESTAURANTS We highly recommend Disney Dining plan - it saved us a lot of money. DO BOOK your restaurants in advance, otherwise you may not be able to eat even at your hotel's restaurant. We could never have a spot for dinner at the Canyon Caf\u00c3\u00a9, even if we booked our restaurants more than two months in advance. But we did have breakfast there and it was very enjoyable, lots of humor, family oriented. We had dinner at the Artist Point - excellent food and service, but a bit over-priced. Note they will ask for two meal vouchers on the Disney standard dining plan. As others have said, the busy Roaring Fork is fine - but with limited menu options. TRANSPORTATION We found the Disney transportation service very convenient and reliable. The Wilderness Lodge is a 10 min. boat ride from Magic Kingdom. We never waited for the boat more than 10 minutes. So if this a first trip to Disney with young kids, probably one of the best spots in the area, beside the Contemporary, Polynesian and Grand Floridian directly on the mono rail. (But the Wilderness Lodge do come across as the best one for family with young children). The bus transportation service to the other parks is also very convenient. On our transportation to the Animal Kingdom, we waited for about 20 minutes - that was the biggest wait time we experienced. Advice: if you have an early breakfast reservation at the Grand Floridian (ie 1900 Park Fare character meal), take the boat ride to Contemporary and then the monorail.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Place to Stay in Disney Orlando\u201d", "Author": "PA-PJ", "ReviewID": "UR32935922", "Content": "We booked a 5-day trip to Disney and stayed at the Wilderness Lodge.

The hotel staff were all helpful and extremely kind. They went out of their way to make our stay \"magical\". We ate at two of the three restaurants. The Whispering Canyon has a great atmosphere and the food was delicious. The Roaring Forks serves cafeteria style food. There was a wide selection of foods to choose from. We brought our own beverages from home, so we did not use the resort refilllable cups. I saw a lot of people lugging their resort cups around. The cups are not that big and you would have to continue to fill them. I think it was much easier to bring your own beverages considering the mugs cost $14 and the individual beverages were $2.75 each. We used the Disney Dining Plan and were very pleased with the amount and the quality of the food. The snack option comes in handy when you are in the parks and the weather is steaming. Trust me, Florida is extremely hot and humid in the summer. The pool area at the lodge is also nice. The hotel provides pool towels and life jackets. Transportation to and from the hotel is available via bus or boat. We enjoyed using Disney's transportation system. It was quick, convenient, and clean. The only down side is when some of the parks closed the buses, monorail, or boats were crammed with people. I suggest you take an extra few minutes if you are there when a park closes and wait for the crowd to disperse. The Wilderness Lodge is a wonderful place. Make sure you check out the lobby and the native American exhibits. The lodge also has an excellent arcade. It is easy to spot hotel employees because they all wear costumes.

Our 6 yr old had just as much fun there as the parks. Funny how kids are.

Some meals served in skillets like the western days. now the food inside the parks, at the sit down restaurants were always very good. Do yourself a favor and get the Disney dining plan. Each person gets 2 snacks, 1 quick service and 1 sit down a day. Plan your sit down meals in the parks you are going to be in that day-makes it alot easier! i cant even imagine how much $ we would have spent on food. Also, plan character meals for your kids so they can meet the characters. The kids love it and it also saves you time in the park-you donthave to stand in line to see the characters and get their pictures-you get that at the dinners or breakfasts.

I have stayed at all of the deluxe Disney resorts and the WL theme is simply spectacular. Our room was located on the 5th floor and overlooked the pool and Bay Lake. We were able to see the MK fireworks and the electric parade. I thought the room might be noisy due to the pool, but not at all. Since I have stayed there previously, I knew where I wanted my room to be located and the staff accomodated all of my requests. It was a little disappointing that the geyster was having a \"geothermal\" malfunction for our entire stay and never worked, but that certainly didn't deter from the resort. Mousekeeping was fine, but could be brought up a notch. Admittedly, I may be picky, but there were cobwebs on the ceiling that blew from the wind from the ceiling fan and a straw wrapper stayed on the floor between the nightstand and bed for 7 days. I did have to request another bar of soap since it wasn't replenished and it was brought up immediately. We went to all 4 parks and the transportation via bus and boat was excellent. We never had a long wait and all transitions were seamless. It was always lovely to wait for the boat and look at all of the wildlife on Bay Lake. We also used the Magical Express and that worked out fantastically. Probably our best experience with taking it was this trip. Our luggage arrived in our room within 3 hours of landing in Orlando. We also arrived at 9:30 a.m. so I suspect if you arrive earlier in the day, you have a better chance of your luggage being delivered more timely. The pool does tend to get a bit crowded but the lifeguards on duty were right on top of everything going on in the pool. My 4 1/2 year old daughter loved the rock slide! Whispering Canyon is great for kids and the Roaring Fork is fine for a counter service restaurant. They do have a selection of healthy choices as well as some not so healthy!

Having stayed in the Animal Kingdom Lodge previously, we were very pleased with our choice and noticed many similarities to that hotel. The Wilderness Lodge was stunning, the theme was great, and the grounds were beautiful. Every employee we encountered at the hotel was kind, professional, and helpful. The proximity to the Magic Kingdom was a big plus for us with the 2 small children. There was a short (8 minute) boat trip from the Lodge to the Magic Kingdom and we never seemed to wait more than 5 minutes for the boat to arrive (either at the hotel or the park). Like other Disney hotels, the rooms themselves were fairly small. It was sort of a tight fit for the 4 of us, but we made it work. We had one of the bunk bed rooms which worked out well. We had the 4 year old sleep in the bottom bunk, hung a blanket from the top bunk, and gave ourselves a bit of privacy. We brought our own travel crib for the baby, but Disney does offer these if needed. The housekeeping staff did a good enough job, and the linens were actually pretty comfortable! The hotel room was not especially clean, but it wasn't too bad either. Overall a good choice for a family. Next time we would consider one of the 1-bedroom villas. We had a courtyard view. We were often in the hotel room fairly early (with the 7 month old). Every evening Disney put on a short (about 15 minute) water parade on Bay Lake which was quite loud inside the room. It never seemed to bother the kids though. I guess this is one of the things that goes with being so close to the park!", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLots of tips to get more out of your stay here!\u201d", "Author": "heatherjp", "ReviewID": "UR30380233", "Content": "I have loved this resort in the past, but you can really sense the demise of Disney....due to corporate greed. The staff are unhappy and very phony. Service is \"alright\" at best. You really need to bring your own joy to a Disney vacation these days...you won't find it there. The vast majority of people visiting Disney these days are obese or unhappy. We saw SO MANY people in people-movers because they were either obese or disabled. It was sad to see. It was very reminiscent of the movei Wall-E. We saw so many parents yelling at their children and eachother. My husband and I came to the conclusion that our own town and community was more \"Disney\" than Disney World is. I honestly used to love Disney and it was a tradition for our family for a little while. Our children are about to turn 5 and 9 though so I doubt we would ever return. The pool at this resort is a lot of fun and very beautiful...do not eat at the Whispering Pines though! The staff are obnoxious and loud...it is not the place to relax after a busy day at the parks! It is supposed to be all \"cutesy\" and festive but it is just rude and annoying. A tip.....go the the Territory Lounge with your family and get a fun drink or two and some nachos and snacks! It is a great atmosphere, very peaceful and a great deal in comparison to the other options! At Artist Point a meal costs about $30 or up! Even on vacation that seems silly to me!And you will pay just as much for everything at the busy little Roaring Forks cafeteria. In closing, if you want a Disney vacation, the Wilderness Lodge is very beautiful....but stay by the pool and relax as much as possible! Don't wear yourself out...it will make the vacation fly by and you'll be too tired to really enjoy it! Also...Cub's Den is a nice option for childcare when you would like a few quiet hours...perhaps some time in the hotel room and a cocktail at Roaring Forks! That was what we did as we felt safe being in the same building as our children...and it was only for 2 hours. (They have a two hour minimum) Also...ask them not to give the departing gift to your kids!!! It is a bag of junky candy....and will keep your kids up late! We were very angry with them for giving our kids candy late at night! Another tip...ask for a room on the fifth floor facing the inner courtyard/pool/magic kingdom. These rooms have lovely balconies and you can enjoy the fireworks...even though they claim you can't see the fireworks...trust me you can! :) Enjoy! One more tip! The 7th floor club level doesn't have as nice rooms (in my opinion) but they do have lots of complimentary food and a beautiful , peaceful lounge to eat and relax in, so if you spend the extra for the room, you may save money on food. We never bought any food AT ALL while staying on the 7th floor...but really missed our 5th floor room. Maybe you could find a room with a similar courtyard view on the 7th floor ....and that would be perfect! Our room assignment faced a service area and the balcony was so buggy that you couldn't enjoy it. And the balconies on 6th and 7th floors have a high barricade that makes it hard to enjoy the balcony. Another tip! Focus on Epcot...we found it to be the cleanest, most fun and most relaxing this time around. And Blizard Beach is great (not Typhoon Lagoon) but make sure you go when not crowded..preferably a weekday and towards closing time. We went on a Saturday and it was CRAZY! A man ripped a floaty raft out of my 4-year-old daughter's hand....and it was so crowded with locals that you could barely move. We stayed till closing one cloudy afternoon weekday though and had a blast! Try to slow down and breathe deeply while at Disney and don't get sucked into paying too much for food and merchandise just because you are too worn-down! And buy your kids the $16 water sprayer fans the first day! They are pricey...but we broke down on the last day of our trip after the kids begged for them all week, and they really do feel wonderful and make the kids sooo happy! Heat exhaustion is a real concern, and these protect against that a bit!", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but transportation NOT so great\u201d", "Author": "IndianaKris", "ReviewID": "UR30328419", "Content": "We stayed at the Wilderness Lodge the week after Mother's Day. We had the special Disney promotion, buy four nights, get three free. That is the only way we could afford this hotel. The lobby and grounds are beautiful. And it really does have the FEEL of being in a National Park Lodge. The stream and waterfall sounded so peaceful (when not drowned out by the sound of excited kids!). And we paid for a wood view room but were upgraded to a courtyard view room. Our balcony overlooked the creek and you could see the pool and the lake and the geyser. Don't leave your balcony door open. We had it open just part of the way for fresh air and a crow came in the room. Before we could get it out it got sick and left a mess. It scared my daughter! They are very bold. And be prepared to share the pool with the ducks. They aren't afraid of people either. Of course, if I were a duck, this is where I would hang out also. The room itself was very clean. And the beds were comfortable. I do think Disney ought to get fitted sheets. But at least the sheets were long enough that you did not wake up without a sheet under you. But the sheets were also kind of rough. The shower did not have much force and the water would not turn off completely. And the toilet seat was loose. But the room was overall nice. There is a little more room than at the moderate hotels, but not a whole lot more. Mousekeeping did a great job and left us many towel animals the first part of the week. Then that diminished as I think we had a new mousekeeper. But they did a good job of cleaning. They did not do a good job of replenishing the shampoo. But they did replenish coffee and everything else. The staff was all very friendly. Roaring Forks is very small and very limited in what it serves. But it was usually not too busy and it made for a nice quick meal. But they did not have nearly as many food selections as other food courts, such as at Port Orleans or the Contemporary. IT was mainly sandwiches, soups, salads and burgers or chicken nuggets. I would have loved something more substantial offered here. But it was always clean and a good bargain with the refillable mugs. The hotel is very large and it was a long, long walk from our room to ROARING FORKS. And after a day of walking at the parks, it was not fun to have that long walk to the restaurant. We ate one time at THE WHISPERING CANYON and it was wonderful. They had you dancing and singing and the staff was a hoot. Charlie the host was amazing. And make sure you ask for ketchup! They also have free refills on their milk shakes...and they are home made ice cream and very, very good. The food was also very good there. That was our best meal during the whole trip. Kudos to the staff of the whispering canyon. We were there during an unbearable early May heat wave. Temps neared 100. So the parks were not as much fun as during cooler times and were surprisingly much busier than I had anticipated. We saw tons of school groups. So keep that in mind if you go in May. My biggest complaint was with the bus transportation. Others have said the wait was not bad. But we waited one time forever and saw bus after bus go by for other parks, but not for Epcot. And then they do not just go straight to Epcot. Each bus at Wilderness Lodge also goes to either Fort Wilderness or the Grand Floridian. AND it can take forever to get to some parks. Plus we accidentally got on a bus that went ONLY to Fort WIlderness from DOWNTOWN DISNEY and we spent a ton of time lost in Fort WIlderness. We finally flagged down a bus and the driver literally yelled at me. The worst thing is the Magical Express which I now call Miserable Express. They assign you a time three hours before your flight. You need to check in two hours early at Orlando Airport. So we were assigned 9:05a.m. but told to get there fifteen minutes early. We did get there early and waited for twenty minutes. Then it took time for the driver (who was very NICE) to load all the luggage. Only some airlines allow check in of baggage at the hotels. So many had luggage to store. It was about 9:30a.m. by the time the bus pulled out of Wilderness Lodge. So we had been there 45 minutes just waiting. We needed to be at airport at 9:55a.m. Well the bus driver then told us he had to make two more stops...the Grand Floridian and the Polynesian. He also said the bus had 51 seats but that they had put 59 on this bus assuming some would not show up. Who would not show up for their ride to the airport? Bus was packed. IT was 10:30a.m. by the time we made it to the airport. Then we had to carry our luggage up to another floor to check in at Southwest...where about 100 were in line before us. We literally got the last two boarding passes for our flight. It should not take an hour and a half to get to the airport. And why tell us to be there fifteen minutes early? I was so sick of bus transportation after this trip. My advice to you is to get a car. SO I say the WIlderness Lodge itself was great. The room was very nice. And I would love to stay there again. But I would get a car and avoid Miserable Express and the bus transportation to the parks. The boat to the magic kingdom was nice, but could get very packed at times And this was not during a so-called busy time. It is fun to watch the electic water parade at night.

I booked and get a king bed standard room with a courtyard view - and was in the \"bearface\" - very close to the elevator and facing straight down to the pool and the lake. the hotel has a wilderness theme - the Disney staff told me that it's story was the frontier people heading west discovered a fresh water spring and they camped next to it - eventually building accommodation for other travellers to also stay and refresh. It looks absolutely stunning - you've all seen the pictures - the HUGE foyer, the carvings, the fireplace, the light fittings etc - heavily themed - and thus a favourite with families. the hotel was opened in 1994 so a few things a bit beaten around the edges but it is mostly in good condition. My room was clean and everything worked. Toiletries limited to shampoo, soap, lotion and conditioner. Towels are good. GREAT location - buses to MK are a few minutes, the boat ride is really nice. Kids LOVE the Whispering Canyon Cafe - the servers take on roles of those original pioneer folk. I used the valet service - very prompt and no problems. got towel animals on 2 mornings.

No fresh or UHT milk - but you can buy this at the Mercantile or the Roaring Fork shop. typical disney - NOTHING is free - paid $10 / day for an internet cable (where is the wifi??)

This Hotel is really popular with families and the pool was very busy - the hotel was full on the weekend and Disney bumped my friends DOWN to Port Orleans! the staff are not intrusive. the rooms were well soundproofed and I'm reasonably happy.

The hotel and pool area are truly amazing. Kids loved the pools (large pool with slide, kiddie pool and two hot tubs). Even when it was crowded, we were able to find a lounge chair to drop our towels etc. The kids loved the ducks that swim in the pool along with the guests. The pool bar was ok, but a limit of two drinks per person seemed a little strange and we observed several people getting aggravated that they couldn't buy three or four alcoholic drinks at a time. Often there was only one bartender on duty and the line was 4 or 5 people long and it took 15 minutes to get a drink. We also thought it was strange that you couldn't get food at the pool bar. (only small bags of chips available). If you want \"real\" food, you have to go indoors to the Roaring Fork cafeteria and bring it out. Fortunately for us, on day one, the bartender told us about the food at the Territory Lounge which was so much better. A little further to walk, but definitely worth it, especially at night. The pulled pork flatbread is absolutely delicious! Overall though, most employees are just average, and not the least bit interested in helping. Example: we paid for a room with a courtyard view and had to go back three times to get what we paid for. When they finally gave us a courtyard view room, it was on the 6th floor with a really closed-in balcony. When you sat in the chairs on the balcony, you literally were walled in and had absolutely zero view of anything. It also was dangerous since my kids kept climbing up on chairs to see over the solid balcony wall which was freaking me out. We finally got a great room on the 5th floor, but it took some work. Also, no one told us that life vests are available for FREE for little ones for the pool. Just go to the boathouse where they rent jet skis and sign one out and keep it for your entire stay. Very convenient, but we had to find it out for ourselves. When checking out, I asked if there was someplace where I could get online to print our airline boarding passes, and was told by a woman at the concierge that the closest place was at another resort, the Contemporary. Another clerk overheard me and called me back and was able to get online for me and print the boarding passes, which the first person was completely unwilling to do. Very odd. If heading to Whispering Canyon Cafe, try to ask before you are seated for a waiter who will have some fun, especially if you have little kids. Our waiter told us point blank that they've \"really curtailed alot of the silliness because it was getting old\" but several other waiters were still doing all the fun and silly stuff so our 6-year-old was very bummed. Our waiter, Bob, was the pits. And yes, I did speak to the manager to let him know. After reading all the stuff about small rooms, we didn't really have an issue with them at all. The bathroom area is a little awkward, but we were four people for seven nights and had no problems. The ferry rides to MK are fantastic...a really great way to start and end a day. Never a long wait and definitely more fun than the buses. The onsite store has a great selection of gifts and snacks. The Roaring Fork has great breakfasts, especially for kids. We got two pancakes, two slices of bacon with butter and syrup and a drink of milk, juice or water for only $4.99 and the lunch selections come with a choice of fries, baby carrots, fresh grapes, jello or pudding. It really filled them and gave healthy alternatives. The free movies on the beach are fantastic. They show a Disney movie every night on the beach and you can see the fireworks from MK and the Electric water parade from the same location. Absolutely fantastic and my kids were blown away. Also, we highly recommend www.gardengrocer.com if you want to pre-order groceries and have them delivered to the hotel for a fee of $12.

For the past 5 years we have stayed at the moderate resorts of Riverside and Port Orleans FQ. Because of a SUPER deal of $200 per night, we decided to splurge and upgrade to a deluxe. We had visited the Wilderness (for dinner) and already knew how impressive the lobby and overall theme of the resort was. We did enjoy our visit, however we do believe for the money, we will return to the moderates in the future. The room and service were no more exceptional than what we were use to at the moderates. While we enjoyed the boat ride to the magic kingdom, we didn't find it any more convenient than the POR. I should explain that we always have a car on our trips and DO NOT use the bus system so I can not compare the bus system at the Wilderness verses our other resort choice. The food court was tiny compared to what we were use to at the moderates- I even drove over the POFQ for to grab breakfast to go one morning. The Whispering Canyon and Artist Point are great but if you are not on the dining plan they can really add up. I recommend the Whispering Canyon for anyone with children but one time per trip is enough for us. The rooms- we booked a standard view and I almost cried when we checked in. It was such a dark and depressing room (I had high expectations since this was our \"splurge trip\"). I would NOT have stayed in that room for our 5 night trip, luckily when I called the front desk with my complaints they moved us to an upgraded court yard view room. I had booked a standard view and Disney did not have to do this so I was very happy but I would have paid what ever it took to move once I saw the standard view room. The lodge motif is dark and the standard view room had a view of the roof gable that blocked most of the light- you could see nothing but the angled roofs directly in front of our balcony. The room decor was not my taste but it was ok for my husband who is a big hunter and likes the lodge motif. The room did not appear any larger or more luxurious than the moderate rooms. I did find the room and hotel very clean but this has been the case with all my Disney trips. The Wilderness Lodge lived up to its name- we saw a lot of wildlife. We saw deer on the beach, ducks in the pool, armadillo in the bushes, an eagle on the lake and bunnies everywhere. The pool is nice but my daughter rates the pool at the POR and POFQ higher. I guess in the end I would say that I am glad I satisfied my desire to experience the deluxe resorts but I am equally glad that I only spent $200 per night to do so. If we had spent any more that that, I would have been extremely disappointed with the value.

When we got to the room it was a pool view no free upgrade, but to be fair that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what I paid for. Rooms; the rooms are small, but as there was only two of us there was lots of room. We had a two queen bed room. I can see how a family of four would be beginning to find it tight. Our room was clean and tidy ad not much noise coming up from the pool. We had a great view of the electric water pageant every night which I found surprisingly entertaining. I know its only barges with lights on but is still fun. Mousekeeping; This was great, room cleaned everyday, fresh towels everyday (even though I hung them back up) and a few towel things, cant really say animals but fun things done to hold soap and TV remote. We also had a few messages from the mousekeeping manager checking everything was fine. Food; Whispering canyon is loud, but can be fun, the food was good for Disney, best mashed potato on site and the berry cobbler was to die for. Roaring forks is ok, the food is pretty standard but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open till midnight and is very convenient. The resort is not huge so your refillable mug is extra good here. Roaring forks is small, very small and can get super crowded at peak times, but if you time it right can be great. We often went down early for breakfast and sat out in the sun watching the ducks and rabbits. Artist point I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be negative but found it slightly uninspiring.

Check in was very easy as it was 1.30am and we were the only guests in the lobby (due to a ridiculous wait at Dollar car rental at MCO, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another story!). We booked a Woodview room which was located on the side overlooking the Lodge Villas and smaller pool. The room was more than adequate for the two of us and we liked the balcony and in-room safe option. As others have mentioned the rooms are quite dark. Also, the bathroom had a strange aroma and the shower strength was quite feeble. The resort was beautiful and possibly the most spectacular lobby I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. The boat transportation to the Magic Kingdom was fantastic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ran from \u00c2\u00bd before the park opened until 1\u00c2\u00bd hours after closing (including Magic Hours). We also used the Bus Transportation which was better than I had expected. Not realising it was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspring break\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting the crowds, but this was only really an issue at the parks - only time I have ever seen Magic Kingdom reach capacity! There is also a Boat and Bike rental facility. We hired a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBoston Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and had a great time sailing around Bay Lake and Seven Seas Lagoon, yielding to the steamboats of course! We also hired a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSurrey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Bike to explore the grounds, which was harder than it looked! The Boat and Bike rental place was understaffed though. We ate at the parks most days but did make use of the Roaring Fork restaurant a couple of times, which was great for quick snacks and sandwiches. If driving, the main road to the resort takes you through the Magic Kingdom toll plaza.

Somehow the staff managed to help us get hot chicken soup and crackers and even a funny \"citation\" from the security staff because he was behaving too well! They even told him to report to Mickey's Judge's tent the next day for a \"hearing\"! It was just the thing he needed to help him feel better! The rooms are so quiet!! I couldn't hear any of the teenagers that were next door, who never seemed to leave their room and ordered days worth of room service! I wouldn't want to see their bill! And the beds were huge and comfortable. It was so easy to sleep a family of four comfortably in the room. We always felt crowded in the moderate resorts. Lastly, the boat ride to and from the resort to Magic Kingdom was always an amazing beginning and end to a day! There is the added bonus of a beach, the evening water parade, and the geyser which \"erupts\" every hour!

The hotel has excellent theming though and having said that we had a pool view room that also looked across Bay Lake so were able to watch the Water Pageant from our room and see the MK fireworks above the building on the opposite side of the pool directly infront of us. Never went in the pool and tried to use the whirlpool but it was ALWAYS packed throughout the day. Roaring Forks (the CS food area) was adequate but again always busy. We do recommend the refillable mugs though very handy! A nice touch was that Mickey left us a balloon and 'Congratulations on your wedding' card on our second day - a lovely surprise which is now framed at home! We also never quite worked out why our beds got 'turned down' for the first five nights but not for the second - we had two seperate bookings so presume it was something to do with that and we had to assume that it was a honeymoon perk. Transport wise we did not use the resort buses as we had our own car as we prefer to not be reliant on Disney transport and we go to other places and do lots of shopping!! We did however use the resort launch boat from the Lodge to Magic Kingdom and it was a nice change of pace and very quick! Although from a personal point of view we would be unlikely to stay here again (for cost reasons) it was perfect for our special honeymoon stay and set it apart from staying off site as we usually do (the POR trip 12 months earlier was supposed to be a one off stay on property but hey ho!). If I were to try a Deluxe Disney resort again it would be the Polynesian or the Yacht and Beach club but that won't be happening unless the lottery numbers come up!!!!

First, with regard to the hotel, the location was excellent, as all the parks were easily accessible. Our kids loved that they took a boat to the Magic Kingdom. We were able to to do parks most of the day, return for a swim and then leave again for dinner. The lobby is beautiful and the food at the Roaring Fork is very good - fresh and diverse for a small menu. We had a standard room which was fine for the the size of our family. It had a queen bed and a bunk, which the kids loved. It did take a day to get used to liviing in a small space, but we adjusted b/c we were rarely in the room. The comments about the room size are true (on the small size) and the view was louzy if you looked down from the balcony (parking lot). Our maid service was excellent - cleaned everyday (folded the kids pajamas and placed their stuffed animals in a cute way). Buses to other parks ran efficiently. We visited the Grand Floridian for breakfast and the Contemporary for Chef Mickey's dinner, two other deluxe resorts and our hotel seemed more quiet and secluded, which we liked. The elevators are noteably fast. The pool was very crowded on Saturday, which is expected, given the 83 degree temp., but otherwise met the demands of our family. As noted in another review, there are ducks that swim in the pool. I, too, was dismayed by this, but it did not bother my kids at all. They enjoyed the small water slide and the kids activities. As mentioned, we booked the trip for our school vacation to benefit from the deal Disney was running, buy 4 nights, get 3 free. This promotion allowed us to stay at the Wilderness. We were looking to stay at a moderate class hotel (Port Orleans), but the difference in price and bed size (queen at the Wilderness; double is standard elsewhere) in the room made the decision easier. I do have to admit, I'm not sure I would have paid full price for the hotel, only b/c of the little time we actually spent at it using the facilities. We ran into a snow storm and looked into staying another night if our flight was cancelled, and the room rate was $495/night. Yikes. Overall, however, with the promotion, we believe that we got a great hotel for the cost. As an aside, we also bought a meal plan, which we have not ever done before. I recommend it. It was a quick meal lunch, snack and table service dinner. I was surprised that every dinner was over $100 for a family of 4, with both kids eating off the kids' menu.

The food is fairly priced in the counter service area.. if you have the dining plan (1 sit down, 1 counter service, 1 snack) you can easily have 3 meals a day... a snack can be a bagel, muffin, drink, dessert, etc. A good tip is if you have extra snacks left at the end.. get delicious pastries in Epcot in France or other pastry shops in the WDW and bring them home. Anyway, very comfortable beds and excellent maid service. Great nooks... 4th floor; couch and 2 chairs with fireplace to read the morning paper...

The Vacation Villa was lovely. Large rooms and well appointed. I about paid $900/ night for the villa. It was worth it. On the other hand, the Concierge rooms were $600 a night and were not worth the money! They were very small, the bedrooms had two king size beds and barely any room to move around in much less put suitcases in. The tiny living room contained a king size sofa bed which when pulled out left no room for anyone to walk around in the room much less sit and chat! The one small bathroom was poorly maintained- leaking shower head, rusty curtain rod rings and the double sinks in the alcove outside of the bathroom barely provided enough room for one person to be at the sink much less two! The food in the concierge dining area provided a continental breakfast (cereals, rolls, fruit and juices) in the morning. I don't know what they served in the afternoon and evening. The only hot food in the morning was oatmeal. The hotel lobby is crowded and noisy. The only way to get to the Magic Kingdom is by taking a bus or the small launch. Both were acceptable.

Back to the review... Gorgeous hotel, the lobby is a work of art. The room was fine for the four of us- two kids 11 and 8. I echo the dark bathroom part - one ceiling light with a dim bulb behind a dark shower curtain. Before arriving, I asked for special accomodations for a \"quiet room\" as my child has sleep issues and sometimes, if woken up abruptly at night screams at the top of his lungs, good ole night terrors. They accomodated my request and we were put on the 6th floor facing the Wilderness Villas pool area. nice and quiet. The room was clean, mousekeeping was very good- changed towels every day and supplied extras during the \"sick days\" . We got towel animals for two days then they stopped. I made a fatal erro rwhen planning the trip- buying the Deluxe Dining plan. I had no concept of what 3 table service meals and two snack per day per person would actually be like. My family are - regular to light eaters we faced the gargantuan task of trying to get our money's worth out of the plan. Let me explain - each table service meal comes with an appetizer, drink and dessert. If you go to the park and get a quick service meal at a take out place you don't get the appetizer just the drink and dessert. I tried valiently to make reservations for all our meals and nothing ever worked right, my family didn't want to go to the parks where the reservations were I had to cancel and scramble for a new place which are hard to come by once you are at the parks. We ended up on the day before we left with like 26 meals left and 30 snacks.... we did 2 room service meals (they count as two meals each per person) a signature dining at Artist Point (highly recommended - excellent) and bought home a lot of rice krispy mickey treats to use up our snack credits. I doubt we ate half of what we spent for this plan but I have learned my lesson - no more deluxe plans - the regular would have even probably been too much. the refillable drink mugs came with the package and we got good use of them. Getting to the Magic Kingdom was a quick boat ride from the dock, I never waited more than 10 min for the boat and the ride was an easy 8-10 door to door. We rented a car from Alamo for 149 for the week- I prefer having my own wheels when I'm on vacation. I get a liitle anxious on a crowded bus. There was free parking at all the parks and on site at the hotel with a pass they give you at check in. I felt I made a good decision when I saw people waiting on long lines for the buses. We were there the week before presidents day and were lucky crowds weren't too bad. We left the Sunday before Presidents day and that weekend everyone else showed up - the parks were super crowded with extra long waits for everything .

I am surprised to read some of the disappointing reviews, because my stay at the lodge was wonderful. The rooms are not 'luxury' as others complain, but if you've stayed at Disney hotels before you'll know that this is standard. The only way to get a truly 'luxury' room is to book a villa. After staying at Coronado Springs, which was very disappointing room-wise, this place seemed like a mansion. Sure the rooms are dark - it goes with the cozy wilderness lodge theme. Like bright rooms? Try the contemporary. If you've ever been to some of the older, more historic lodges in upstate NY or PA, this will be very much like them. The details to this building are incredible. The pool is nice, good outside bar with friendly staff, and the hottubs were pretty good too. We went here the week before Christmas and the lobby was beautiful with the huge tree in the center. Location is great with the boat service as an added travel option. If you want to find those 'secluded' nooks, find the two small fireplaces on the second and third floors above the front doors. Other than that, there really isn't too many other private areas - remember this is Disney - made for families primarily. The only complaint that I have is about the Roaring Fork. The fast food there is ok, not anything to write home about though. The menu was reduced beyond what was listed the hour before closing. The staff seemingly wanted to clean up faster to be able to close up faster. The food at the other restaurants at the lodge was good. Also want to mention Jikos - great food! Make your dinner reservations at any Disney restaurant EARLY! It might sound funny to have to plan your meals out a few days in advance, but it'll enable you to get reservations at reasonable hours - unless you like eating dinner at 9pm. It seems like a lot of complaints come from people who haven't been to Disney resorts before and don't know what to expect. Go to your library and get a few Disney travel books before you go. There are a few 'tricks' to making your visit better. And although most of the staff is pretty good at catering to your needs, you're going to find a few bad apples every now and then.

The lobby is really wonderful, and the pool and beach areas are nice. (The lifeguards are pretty crabby, though--stay out of their way.)

The Wilderness Lodge is far from what we expected and overall is disappointing. Let me give you a few positives and then the negatives about this resort. 1. The lobby of the hotel is very nice and entertaining for small children. Our two year old has really enjoyed the small bridges and streams. 2. The other common areas are very large and you can find plenty of areas to sit with your group without feeling like you are being crowded by the other guests The negatives to this resort are as follows: 1. The rooms are not a quality hotel. For example, we didn't even have hot water in the shower of one of our rooms. 2. The rooms are extremely small, the size of most NYC hotel rooms. 3. The rooms are furnished very poorly and lack the finishes of luxury hotels. The bathrooms are dingy and is really showing its age. I am confident this is all consistent with most of the rooms because I do have two rooms and they are both the same. 4. The LCDs TVs in the room have closed captioning on at all times on the HD channels and it can not be turned off. We found this out after calling the front desk during the Superbowl. 5. I paid for an upgrade on both rooms to be a \"Courtyard View\" and they are both on the second floor looking directly at the woods. I have been told that when I look to my right I see the Wilderness Villas and it has a \"Courtyard\" of which I am viewing. Not exactly what I had in mind considering the Wilderness Lodge does have a beautiful \"Courtyard\" overlooking the pool. I asked nicely to be moved and the front desk could not accomodate my request. 6. The valet parking does not answer the phone on a regular occassion and you have to call the bell hops to find the valet. A little disappointing especially considering the hotel and park have very light volumes. With all these issues we decided to try and just cut our losses and move to the Grand Floridian. My wife has stayed at the Flordian and had a wonderful experience. Overall, the Wilderness Lodge is not in the luxury class. I do understand that it was cheaper than some of the other Disney hotels. With this in mind, I asked to be change my reservation for the remaining 6 days to the Grand Floridian and I would pay the difference. I was told this could be done if I paid an additional 4 thousand dollars for 6 nights. This seemed a little ridiculous since when I booked the trip through Disney.com and we originally booked the Grand Floridian. The Disney travel consultant convinced us that the Wilderness is better for children and still of great quality. It was only $1200 more for both rooms for all 8 days and I was wanting to change after 6. I was told that I need to pay the \"rack rate\" difference which is insane when rooms are available. Overall, my experience has been far from \"Magical\". Forget the fact that I did not get the rooms that I paid and upgrade for, I did not have hot water in one of the showers, the rooms are on par with a Holiday Inn, I did expect a little of assistance from Disney. In no way has Disney tried to make my stay what I expected. I have no problem paying even $2500 more just to make it right, but the attitude of $4000 or take it or leave it seems to be a little crazy. If I had to do it all over again, either stay at the Floridian if you want a luxury hotel or just save yourself a lot of money with the other options. They did send my kids a picture Mickey and Cinderella worth about $5 because we were not happy with our \"Courtyard View Room\" Look at the other reviews like I did before I left.

We booked using miles through a travel agent and were worried when we saw our room. It was a standard room that was in the corner of the hotel, dark, depressing, with a terrible view of the garbage dumpsters and a side parking lot. We went back to the front desk and immediately requested another room. We were unaware that a standard room is equipped with 2 double beds. In order to get a king bed, you have to move up a room class. Luckily, the front desk staff was very very nice and upgraded us with no charge and gave us a much better room. The view was ok. Still a parking lot but we could see the fireworks over the Magic Kingdom each night. The rooms are basic. Nothing special and a bit dark because of the color scheme. They have a refrigerator, which is nice. The bathroom was not very nice. The ceiling had rust on it but no mold. Overall pretty clean. The beds are comfortable and there was a ceiling fan which was nice. The room had a small balcony with a table and chairs, which we did not use, given there wasn't really anything to look at. It's also very very close to the balcony of the neighboring room. The room temperature was good and the AC was quiet. We could occasionally hear kids outside in the hall but overall it was pretty quiet. The concierge desk staff were very helpful. Being our first time at Disney, we didn't know it would be difficult to get dinner reservations at the Disney signature restaurants. We ate at Artist Point at the Wilderness Lodge, which was very good, and did not have difficulty with reservations there. However, when we made reservations at Jiko at Animal Kingdom Lodge and Narcoosie's at the Grand Floridian, we could not get reservations before 9pm. We booked the day before or day of, so likely we were booking too late. Both Jiko and Narcoosie's were wonderful. Staff were terrific as was the food. The dining options at Wilderness Lodge included Artist Point, fancy sit down with pacific northwest theme, Roaring Fork, cafeteria take out with sandwiches, soup, chili, chips, fresh fruit, baked goods, pizza, and hamburgers, and the Whispering Canyon Cafe that serves a sit down breakfast every morning. It's pretty loud and mostly for kids, but we found it pleasant enough as a couple. They serve BBQ for lunch and dinner but we didn't eat there except for breakfast. The fitness center was very nice. Plenty of cardio equipment including elliptical machines, treadmills, stationary bikes, as well as free weights, weight machines, and stability balls. The fitness center is always staffed and there are towels and cups for water from the water fountain (not the best tasting water... it seems to be an Orlando thing). The fitness center is in the Villas at Wilderness Lodge, a very short covered walk from the main hotel. We, in fact, had thought we'd booked a room at the Villas, which have kitchenettes, but found out after we arrived that our reservation was actually at the main hotel. Be careful, because it can be confusing. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at Disney's Wilderness Lodge. We would stay there again but would probably try Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge next time, which is right on the Animal Kingdom property with a view of the Savannah. The ambiance was of a smaller version of the Wilderness Lodge and not as loud. Beware of the standard rooms.

My luggage was misplaced upon arrival, and I overheard conversations by other guests who had the same experience. Finally, water transport service from the Magic Kingdom back to the hotel after fireworks was abysmally slow (although I think I overheard the captain state they were short one boat that evening, so what we experienced definitely wasn't the norm). However, this resort is absolutely beautiful, and the concierge, front desk, and food service staff members are superb. Additionally, this has a great workout facility in the Villa section of the resort. The resort is large, but it had a very intimate feel to it due to its somewhat isolated location in the woods. Despite the location, it is very convenient to the Magic Kingdom, Contemporary Hotel, and Fort Wilderness via water transport. I have a family member who has special food requirements, and I found it extremely easy to accomodate him in this resort. There is a small counter in the room over the refrigerator and away from the bathroom and other living areas of the room (I LOVE it when I don't need to use the vanity area to prepare food). Additionally, our close proximity to the Roaring Fork dining area allowed us to have a microwave, toaster, and paper goods available to us all day long. If you have special food requirements, definitely request a room close to the Roaring Fork. Speaking of food -- I am perplexed by the negative reviews regarding the food, as I am a picky eater and loved absolutely EVERYTHING we ate there. We made use of ALL of the food services available, including the Artist Point, Roaring Fork, Whispering Canyon, and even the bar menu, and everything was more reasonably priced and of much higher quality than anything we ate at the parks or other resorts. My gourmet-loving kids who usually order salmon over chicken fingers at restaurants RAVED about the juicy burgers and flat-bread pizzas. Yes, seating at the Roaring Fork is an issue, but I enjoyed taking our food back to the room and enjoyed eating on the balcony while enjoying the beautiful views.

The hotel is gorgeous, both inside and out. We had a king bed room (non-handicapped) that was a courtyard view that also bordered the lobby. There have been a few complaints about the size of the rooms, but I did not think our room was particularly small. There were two sinks outside of the bathroom which were great for getting ready in the morning. My only negative comment relates to the bathroom itself. It was an extremely dark and depressing bathroom. It looked like the type of bathroom you might find at a low end Days Inn. It just didn't really seem to fit with all the other fine elements of the hotel. Since we were staying over the MLK weekend, we were not sure what to expect with the boat service to the Magic Kingdom. However, we went first thing in the morning and there really was not much of a line for the boat which was great. Also, we went to the MK for extra magic hours on Sunday night which ended at 2 AM.

I didn't do much research and I didn't know what to expect but I wanted to get away to a warm place and not have to drive so I picked the hotel based upon the reviews I saw on this website. I'll say, in general, that I arrived during an unforeseen cold spell which brought rain and cold temps and caused lots of cancellations so the hotel seemed pretty empty most of the time -- strange since it is such a giant resort. For example, on a couple of occasions, I sat in one of the rocking chairs in front of the giant stone fireplace in the 5-story wood-beamed lobby and sipped my tea and finished the murder mystery I was reading. It felt like staying at a really big, family cabin. I'm not sure that it would feel this way under ordinary circumstances (and full occupancy). The lobby and the facilities are what make the place unique. The \"spring\" at the end of the lobby which feeds a waterfall and creek which spill into the end of the swimming pool is one-of-a-kind, along with Mallard ducks who had no qualms letting us share their river/swimming pool with them! There was a slide which had the same jerky left/right movement (at the end) that a lot of the Disney theme park rides do. Intentional? I ate breakfast in the snack bar every morning and I thought the variety was ample: muffins, yogurt parfaits, waffles, cereals, juices, etc. Check in was swift but it took 3 times to find a room that was acceptable. The first was a ground floor room that was dark and faced onto the grounds between the hotel and the adjacent 'cabins' (which was another wing of the hotel with suites that had kitchens). There was no wall or landscaping to provide any privacy in the room and since there was a path running past the room (at some distance away) it still felt a little bit \"non-private\" so I suggested a room higher up. The second room reeked of cigarette smoke -- strange for a hotel that, according to the concierge had become \"non smoking\" over a year ago. The third room did the trick, facing onto the \"cabins\" on the fifth floor. In spite of the grandeur of the rest of the resort, the rooms were kind of average. (I wouldn't call them small as others have). After all, they had 2 queen size (or 1 king size) beds in them plus a dresser and a table with a couple of chairs. I've stayed in hotels in NY that could barely fit ONE double bed.! But, the feeling of smallness is intensified because the rest of the place is so large. Still the room had plenty of little quirks. Here are some of them: The decor was supposed to be \"rustic cabin\" and it was, in some places but then looked kind of Holiday Inn in others. For example. some of the light fixtures were ordinary modern fixtures that they painted \"to look old\". Kind of strange. There was a flat screen TV which I never turned on and granite counters in the bathroom but the bed was a little bit lumpy and uneven. (There were two in the room but I didn't bother to try the other one). The toilet was one of those \"water saver\" \"exploding noise\" ones with the button in the middle of toilet lid that you would press and the water would be sucked down in a split second. I found it to work about 50% of the time; during other times, it would sputter a little and then I'd have to wait for it to reset (30-40 seconds) and I'd try it again.. The bathroom was split into 2 parts; toilet and tub/shower in one room; sink in the other. The door to the 'tollet room' opened OUT and literally banged into the left half of the sink counter The toilet/tub room had an exhaust fan on the ceiling which was connected to a motion sensor so if you reached into that room to grab your bathing suit that was hanging from the shower rod, the fan would turn on and it would stay on after you walked away for about 2 minutes. Conversely, if you were in the bathroom and you were motionless for a while (I was doing some tourist-related reading), the fan would stop until you moved your head or arm. It took a little to get use to. I found the refrig to be noisy (I'm a light sleeper) so I turned it off the first night. Lastly, the draperies were in 2 parts. The right portion would not pull shut (there was a wand for pulling it toward the center of the window). A previous guest had pulled on the curtain, not on the wand and had twisted the mechanism that allowed the drapery to slide on the track. I got on a chair and bent a piece of the drapery bracket until it was straight and I had no further problem with it. The people at the concierge desk were absolutely wonderful, recommending restaurants, transportation options, etc. All in all, I'll rate it as \"3 circles\". I probably wouldn't stay there again since the best part is the common areas which I could visit anytime without staying there. I also thought it strange that a huge resort like that didn't have a business center. I left my laptop at home but had to do some business but the only access to a computer was at the Disney Contemporary Resort which was a short boat ride from the Wilderness's dock. Not a big deal, just kind of silly: waiting for the boat: 10 minutes; riding to the Contemporary: 5 minutes; waiting for the return boat: 5 minutes; riding back (via a different route: 10 minutes) So, that's 30 minutes of transit so i could spend less than 10 minutes on the computer. It just seemed silly since the Concierges at the Wilderness all had internet-equipped computers. Couldn't they find a tiny space to hook up a couple of computers for the guests who don't want to drag their own from home? I visited a number of the resorts and I think the Disney Beach Club will be my next choice.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cAll about the Disney Magic!\u201d", "Author": "drofnah", "ReviewID": "UR23591256", "Content": "I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel for a conference.

The STANDARD VIEW ROOM for $350 was much too small for the four of us. Now that my teenagers are adult size, we were very cramped. I also found that Disney no longer has the customer service that we have grown used to. I was told that the WL had rollaway beds. I have a son and daughter and need 3 sleeping areas(the bunk beds are for 4'10\" and under). My husband and I insist on sleeping together on our vacations and not with our teens! I had called Disney a dozen times because of numerous booking problems with our park tickets and eating reservations. Found that they no longer can be counted on for accurate information. When inquiring about the rollaway, I called the hotel directly to be sure we would get one. I asked for a manager and was assured there would be no problem. Well, guess what, no rollways on the property. We were given a blow up mattress to put on the floor. Now, if my kids were young they would of thought it cool. My 16 and 17 year old did not. Also, the room was so small there was no place to put it. They had to move out the only table in the room to fit it. The room did not have a reading chair, the only place to sit is on the bed. The manager refused any compensation or upgrade and explained that many hotels do have rollways but this one never has and the manager I spoke with was confused .

The Wilderness Lodge is a beautiful resort inside and out. I returned from a five night stay on November 28th. Several months ago, while planning this magical Christmas time experience for my family of four, daughter 11 and son 8, I posted a forum thread asking for the deluxe property that had the best Christmas magic. The Wilderness lodge was the unanimous choice. Indeed it was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The atrium lobby is home to a six story Christmas tree, and there are wreaths all over the resort, and many, many smaller Christmas trees adding flare to the experience. We had table service dinner reservations at other deluxe properties. From a lobby point of view, I had no regrets in choosing the Wilderness Lodge. It is very roomy, warm, and I really appreciated the Christmas music and magic of the decorations for my children. We had a courtyard bunk bed room overlooking the time share villas wing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool.

The bunk beds were my kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request, but I will not be asking for those anymore. Both of my kids were nursing head bruises by the end of our stay from not being used to having limited head room when getting in and out of the bottom bunk. And, these bunk-beds are well made and unforgiving to a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head. Other than those occasional tears of pain, the room is very satisfying. Definitely enough room to be comfortable. There was a two drawer chest that housed a mini-fridge at the bottom, and a three drawer dresser. There is a double vanity that had enough shelving for all of our necessities. I found that I could store three of our suit cases under the bottom shelf of the vanity. That freed up more space in the closet for hanging clothes and dirty linens. In case you have time, there is a flat screen television on top of the three drawer dresser. We did eat in the Roaring Forks food area for one lunch and each breakfast. It was the best lunch I had while at Disney World. For a resort with 727 rooms, there are only 64 places to sit in the eating area. Overall the food choices were filling and tasty. This was my family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third trip to Disney World, the second of which we stayed on property. Both times we had the Disney Dining Plan of one table service, one counter service, and one snack per day. It is really a good deal, but has changed since we stayed two years ago, mostly with the table service meal. Two years ago gratuity was included and everyone received an appetizer, entr\u00c3\u00a9e, and desert. Now the gratuity is additional, and there is only an entr\u00c3\u00a9e and desert. I was told the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153snack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for each day is good for items less than $4. With that said, some things are cheaper to simply pay out of your pocket. The Mercantile within the property can allow you to get more from your snack dollars. The Mercantile handles everything from apparel to souvenirs, to milk and beer. I learned by the 4th day it was smarter to buy milk and water from the mercantile. Doing this allowed us to get a true food snack with our snack of the day. Also for purchase is a property exclusive refillable mug for 12.99. If planning on going before the end of the year, you should know that it is extremely busy! I leaned on the Birnbaum guide during my planning for this trip. Based on his words and a friend of mine who went last year during the week of Thanksgiving, I felt sure it would be less crowded than my previous end of May trip in 2006. It was much, much worse. While waiting on a ride, one of the cast members told me his daily memo on attendance was 30,000 in the parks. I asked what was the lowest he had seen and he said 10,000 in September. There were electric cars and strollers in every direction! The on property status does allow for early and late hours to the park on certain days, not to mention the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fast pass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option that accompanies your own property status. You can plan on waiting 45-90 minutes on rides such as Soarin, Test Track, the new Toy Story experience, etc. At least it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hot. We were able to wear shorts and t-shirts from 11 am till about 4 pm. It was mid 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s during the day, and 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at night. The pools are heated to 83 degrees. There are three things you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to bring: money, patience, and a little more money. I love Disney World and hope to take my family there again, but everything has a price tag. If you are taking stroller aged children, your going to be exhausted. And, Disney is charging $15 a day for a stroller rental.

The only thing about doing that is you cannot contact the hotel until 24 hours before check-in to make sure your room request was received. And you also can't get the Disney food plan either. My wife called the day before and everything seemed fine with our room reservation. We rented a car at the airport and drove to the Lodge. When we arrived we checked in (we stayed for 6 nights) and the room was nice. We had asked for a room with a queen and a bunk bed but they were all gone. When we got our room it had 2 queens. There are 4 of us (2 kids, 5 and 8) so we called the front desk and they immediately brought up an air mattress. The woman set it up for us too and we put it on the floor right next to the second bed. Our kids had a blast bouncing on it! It worked out great to have my oldest sleep in one bed and our daughter on the mattress. I had read reviews about not getting a room that faced the lobby as the Whispering Canyon Cafe restaurant is anything but whispering. Our room did in fact face the lobby but we were above the restuarant (a few floors up) and did not hear much. I would advice if you do or can sleep with a \"white noise\" machine, it probably won't hurt. But to tell the truth, we were so exhausted every night, you could have landed a plane next to us and we wouldn't have noticed. I think if you were across from the restaurant it may be a bit more noisy, but coming out every morning and seeing the beautiful lobby and the view out the windows to the lake, it was worth it. Also, as an extra bonus our room balcony faced Magic Kingdom. The couple nights we went back early at 9 PM we would still go out and get to watch the fireworks! Very cool. The hotel does a very good job at making sure you are happy. When we arrived with our car we had to get a parking permit and leave it on the dashboard. The one thing we did not realize was on our second day when we went to another park and drove, that permit got us into the parking lot for free. Saved us $12 right there, not a huge amount but add it up over 5 days with 5 different parks.... The Wilderness Lodge is very convienent to Magic Kingdom. You can just go down to the dock (a short walk) and the boats come about every 15 minutes. The longest we ever had to wait was 10 minutes. The one thing you may want to avoid is waiting by the hotels dock after dark. They have some lights there and when we came back one night you could just see the millions of mosquitos eating the people alive who were waiting. You can wait up near the pool and then wait until you hear the boats horn, they blow it about 3 minutes before they are tied up to the dock and ready to start boarding. The pool is beautiful with a great waterfall feature above the pool. The bar at the pool is the place to get a drink anytime as the bar tenders are fast and pour a good drink. The hot tubs are nice and comfy and you can watch your kids in the larger pool while there. The restaurants. We had breakfast at the Whispering Cafe one morning and it was ok but nothing special. Typical family stuff. The staff does have fun and on Friday night it was very loud there with every other person having a Birthday. We did not try Artist Point but it looked very nice. We really enjoyed the Roaring Fork the most. It is a quick service restaurant with pizza, chicken nuggets and hamburgers for the kids. They have the same for adults but also have some great gourmet sandwitches. Turkey with brie, roast beef with a light blue cheese spread, really everything was good. We did not buy one of the cups but probably would next time. The Roaring Fork was also a great place to grab breakfast. In the morning my wife and son would go down and get coffees and bagels for us and pancakes or cereal for the kids. By the time they got back I would be showered and getting everything ready, it saved us a good 20-30 minutes a day. On the second to last evening, we were exhausted from the day at the park and went back to the hotel early. We were all just sitting around and we decided to go for a walk. Just off the lobby of the hotel, we found a very nice game room with arcade games. A fun place to spend an hour and play games, get your picture in a photo booth, etc.. You also have to try the small speed boats. Very fun. You can rent them down by the beach area (they also have very cool bikes to rent there) and the boats are very fun. My wife had never driven a boat and it was easy for anyone to do. They are 2 seaters and don't go to fast, the best is to have either one adult or and adult and child in one. 2 adults I think you may not go very quick. Overall we had a great time at this hotel.

The room was very clean, comfortable and a good size for us but somewhat small for our daughter and family. I discovered that all of the rooms are the same size (regular rooms-not the suites or villas) but you pay extra for the views.The towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable.

The counter service area was a bit small but the food was always good (same menu everyday but we liked everything they had). The pool and beach area were always clean and never overly crowded. You actually swim with the ducks! We were able to take the bus to any destination but chose the boat transportation most of the time. We attended the Hoop-de-do review and it was great-alot of fun. The night we attended many of us had taken the boat to the campground and were caught in a downpour-soaking everyone on board. We all ran into the Trading Post to get dry clothes and it was pretty funny to see about 30 of us all dressed in Mickey sweatshirts and shorts! The staff at the review provided warm dry towels for us which was very thoughtful. That night I lost my cell phone when changing into dry clothes and it was returned to me a day later-thanks to the honesty of the person who found it.

We fell in love with the Wilderness Lodge in 2000 during our first family Disney vacation. This was our 3rd stay, and I have to say that I think this was the best yet. We arrived at around noon after a VERY tough morning (missed our flight, had to re-book with another airline...NOT a great way to start a vacation with a 4 year old!), and were pleased to learn that we had been upgraded from a standard view to a courtyard view. Having stayed in a courtyard view previously, I knew that rooms facing the main pool could be very loud, so I asked for a quieter room where my daughter could nap mid-day. The cast member went to her manager, and to a certain computer to find us a wonderful room with a view of the villas pool and a sideways view of the beach and lake~room 4158. It was lovely to come back to the hotel and sit out on the balcony listening to the soft music coming from the villas while my daughter napped. On previous visits, we felt that the decor in the rooms had been a bit tired looking and in need of refreshing, and I was so happy to see that this room had recently been renovated. The furniture, double sinks and vanity, carpet and bedding all seemed fresh and new and sparkling clean. I would definitely recommend asking for a renovated room; it was a pleasant surprise. Mousekeeping was great...towel animals every day, and my daughter's princess accessories were always arranged creatively arround the room. Our room was always made up by the time we came back for a nap around 2:00 each day, and we always had plenty of towels and toiletries. We had a limited view of the Electrical Water Pageant from our balcony, but found it much nicer to view from one of the outdoor verandahs on the 4th or 5th floor off the lobby. The only negative about the rooms is that they are small...perfect for 2 or maybe 3 people, but a family of 4 would have a tough time. We had a few quick meals at Roaring Forks and was impressed with the selection of grilled items, sandwiches, soups and grab-n-go items. We got our dinner to go the first night after an ehausting day, and it was a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the restaurant to have a quiet meal in our room. If you are a coffee or soda drinker, the refillable mugs for $12.99 + ta are a great value...and a nice souvenir. I probably got my money's worth by the second day with my drinks as well as filling up on drinks for my daughter on the way out to the parks. You can also fill a cup with ice water for no charge...another great way to save a little money. We also ate dinner one night at Whispering Canyon, and were disappointed. Our food took nearly an HOUR to get to our table, and by that time, my daughter was melting down. When I asked if HER food could at least be brought out (what does it take to put some mac-n-cheese on a plate with some fruit?), our server apologized for the \"slight delay\" (?!) and brought our food. We've had good luck at this restaurant in the past, so I'm guessing it was just an off night, or our server was just poor. Either way, the food was good and it is a fun place for the kids. It was also nice to be home already after dinner...no bus, boat or monorail ride to get to bed! The weather was hot and humid, so we were able to take advantage of the pool a couple of times. My daughter LOVED the shallow kids pool, and I had a blast just watching her with my feet in the water. I also had a surprisingly good Margarita from the Trout pass pool bar. The location of this resort was ideal for us since we only visited Magic Kingdom and Epcot this trip. The boat ride to MK is so convenient and enjoyable, and I was able to roll my daughter right onto the boat without having to break down the stroller. This was a lifesaver on those frequent occasions when she was too tired to walk. We also took the boat to the Contemporary, and then hopped on the monorail to get to Epcot...again, no need to break down those strollers...HIGHLY recommended. All-in-all, this is a WONDERFUL resort with fantastic Disney service and all the amenities you would epect from a high-end accommodation. Staying here is a vacation unto itself, and such a pleasant respite from the crazy busy Disney theme parks. My daughter had such a great time skipping through the lobby, across the bridge over the bubbling spring, shopping in the Mercantile, and just eploring the many nooks and crannies around the resort. I would stay here again without hesitation. We'll be heading back to Disney in September '09 with the whole family, and would happily stay here if we weren't travelling with 5 people.

We are a couple in our early thirties with no children. We used the magical express transportation from the airport and had no major issues other than long lines to check in for the buses. We arrived at the lodge and waited a short time in line for check in but our room was ready at 1:30 pm so we were happy. The room was a bit on the small side but was ok for just the two of us. The decor was ok but honestly the room was smaller than a Holiday Inn type room. Mousekeeping did a really good job with keeping the room clean and fresh towels for us. The grounds are really nice at the lodge. You will really appreciate how quiet and relaxing the lodge is after standing in long lines everyday.

The bus service to other parks was ok but we did wait about 25 minutes one morning for the Hollywood Studios bus. Most other waits were 10 minutes or less. We used the resort airline check-in which is located outside the lobby in the front. It really sped things up not having to stop at the airline counter at the airport.

I forgot to mention that we rented a sea racer boat at the wilderness and took a tour of the lake around the magic kingdom, grand floridian, polynesian and fort wilderness. It was cool to see those places from the water at you own leisure. The only major complaint we have with this hotel is the noise level in the rooms. You can really hear everything going on around you in other rooms and in the hallway. We read this in the unofficial guide to disney and man were they right.

We have tried a bunch of the on-site hotels there but this one is our favorite! The resort is beautiful and laid out very well. Just to walk around the property and lobby is an experience - you do not feel like you are in Florida. We stayed a few days in early August, mostly to relax at hotel and check out the water parks. Our room was ready early which was a plus and very convienant to the elevators by the lobby/busses. Other times we have had to walk down long corridors from the elevators to our room - but those rooms are closer to lake and pool and boat. You can mae a request for which you prefer. Pool seemed very crowded but still nice - great water slide. Try the smaller pool over by the Villas for a quieter time. We checked out the Club Floor and Lounge but not sure its worth the extra money. As we are loyal fans to the Ritz Carlton in Orlando - it does not even compare or come close to their Club Floor/Concierge offerings. Kids Club at hotel is very nice - in afternoon they offer free arts and crafts. Also games out by the pool arranged by the lifeguards. Pool bar had very friendly staff but no waitresses - walk up only. The boats and buses are great transportation options to get you around. We had no problems going anywhere throughout. Tickets can be bought at front desk - much easier then waiting in park lines. We really enjoy this hotel, the architecture and ambience. The Lobby bar offers great wines and appetizers. The counter service restaurant is a bit small but some good options and open most of the time. Very big store off the lobby for all things Disney and drinks, snacks, toiletries, etc. - very handy.

It only took 1.5 hours to have our bags hand delivered to our room after check in--I thought that was really fast considering it was the middle of June. At check in we were given a handicapped room--this was fine because it was actually much larger than a regular room and we had an awesome view! We even had rabbits in our grassy area outside of our sliding glass door! The lobby was beautifully decorated and the furniture in our room was cute. Our maid service was wonderful and they even made towel animals for us everyday. We had a great collection by the end of the week! We did not eat at the family style restaurant in the lobby due to other reviews we had read. By the end of the day we were just too tired to eat somewhere that noisy. We did have some wonderful meals at Epcot (Italy), Magic Kingdom and at the Grand Floridian. The nightly parade on the lake was awesome and this was a great hotel to watch it from! Also the transportation from the hotels to the parks is great! One day we were the only people on the bus and instead of taking us to the monorail station the driver went out of his was to take us to the Grand Floridian for our lunch reservation.

Having stayed previously at Port Orleans Riverside and Carribean Beach I liked the Wilderness Lodge better. First of all, staying in any Disney deluxe resort gives you queen size beds as opposed to those tiny double beds they give you at the moderates and value resorts. I'm used to sleeping on a king size bed so this was important to me. Secondly, I liked how close everything was to my room compared to PO and CB which you have to walk far for everything. The pool, dining, the bus stop, and boat launch were all fairly close. We had connecting rooms on the 2nd floor which was much better for us than staying on a higher floor. Everything is on the 1st or 2nd level so we never had to wait for an elevator. We usually just took the stairs to go to the pool. We got a free upgrade to a courtyard view so we could see the pool from our room which was nice. If you plan on visiting the Magic Kingdom often like we did this is a great place to stay. The resort has a boat and a bus to the MK. The bus to MK was very quick running every 10 minutes or so. The boat was quick too. That being said, it did seem to take significantly longer to get to the other resorts (Epcot, Studios, and Animal Kingdom). Usually, going to those parks involved a stop at another resort on the way which added a lot of travel time. On one occasion it took us an hour to get to the Animal Kingdom. If you got a car I recommend driving to the other resorts but using their transportation to the MK. The Whispering Canyon was great, the Roaring Fork counter service restaurant was good, and my kids loved the pool and the waterslide. The staff was awesome too. They were so friendly. The resort theme was so great for the kids. I probably will stay here again when we return to Disney. This isn't about the resort, but I will say a few things about their dining plan. We got their basic dining plan for free on a promotion. The basic dining plan gives you one sit down meal, one counter-service meal, and one snack (fruit, water, soda) each day for each person. It was so nice eating at their restaurants (which are overpriced) and not having to worry about cost. They give you so much food. Each meal consist of one entree, one beverage, and desert. We could not eat it all. The only negative thing I can say is the sit down meals took up a big chunk of our time, especially when our reservations required us to travel to a different park. We didn't have a car so we relied on their transportation. Sometimes dinner ended up eating almost 3 hours of our day when you factor transportation time. We had to make all our reservations ahead of time cause the restaurants were all booked solid. They offer a deluxe dining plan which includes 3 sit down meals per day. I saw one of the Mom's on the mom's panel on the Disney website promoting this saying its so much easier. I strongly advise against getting this unless you want your entire Disney vacation to revolve around dining cause it would just take too much time and be way too much food. If you want that go on a cruise instead. The basic plan is the way to go. Use your snack for breakfast, eat a counter-service lunch at the park your at, and then enjoy a sit-down dinner in the evening.

I had hoped to stay there for our entire 9-night WDW vacation, but couldn't get all of my nights there and booked the Animal Kingdom Lodge for the other 4 nights -- which is why I compare WL to AKL throughout this review. Let me first say that it is hard to find many negatives with Disney resorts...they are fantastic overall. If you have already booked the WL, get ready to have a great vacation! Basically what follows is just splitting hairs! As far as the Wilderness goes, while it is a neat-looking place, I wasn't blown away by the interior architecture. (Maybe I would have been had I not just come from the beautiful AKL.) I actually found it a tiny bit cheesy. Just my opinion. Additionally, our room seemed a bit dreary (although the kids were excited by the bunkbeds). Our particular room had a view of woods as promised; through them, we could see some of the Wishes fireworks, which was fun. Not as great was the fact that we were situated on the lake side, so we heard the LOUD boat horns late into the evening (up until 11:30 or so) and early in the a.m. We also had to listen to the Electrical Water Pageant music every night, which takes place at 9:30 -- by which time we were usually in our rooms with our two small kids. This got pretty annoying because the music is synthesized and outdated (trust me, hearing it once is enough). We just had to laugh each night when it came on. The other thing I wasn't \"Wild\" about at the WL is the Whispering Canyon dining. It was good for a hearty breakfast, but we had zero desire to dine there for dinner. It just seemed chaotic, and unless you absolutely love barbeque, the smells are overwhelming. It's also right in view of the main lobby which was weird in my opinion. Granted we didn't eat dinner there so maybe we missed out. At the AKL, we loved dining at Boma's interesting buffet. The quick-service area was fine food-wise, but the seating area was small and unappealing as compared (again) to the AKL. The Mara quick-service there is awesome and has a great selection. Taking the boat to the Magic Kingdom from the WL is fun initially, but it does take a while. The pool area is very nice. The geyser is truly neat-o! The stream that bubbles down from the lobby and over a waterfall into the pool is very well done. The poolside snack bar staff was very friendly and accommodating, and lounging poolside adjacent to the lake is very relaxing. There's even a little beach. The buses were prompt and no problem in terms of getting to the other parks. Overall, our room itself and the unappealing dining will probably mean I won't pick the WL again. The AKL has it beat in just about every category if you happen to be deciding between the two. If being close to MK is what you are looking for however, I'd say try the WL. It's good but just not my favorite. (The Polynesian is also fantastic, but will cost more than AKL or WL because of monorail access.) P.S. We also ate at Artist Point.

There was one day we did wait over an hour for a bus, but as a frequent traveler to WDW, I realize that this is not the norm. The only real issue we had was our first room assignment. We checked in and had requested a king bed at booking. To my surprise, they notified us that we had been upgraded to a woods view room from standard view. Well, when we got to our room, I would have taken a view of a brick wall over the condition the room was in. It was an accessible room, which we didn't need. I was traveling with a very tall man, and this was just uncomfortable to him. The bed was very low to the ground, as if it were just a mattress on the floor. Also, the room was quite worn and I can't say that the mousekeeping did their best with a worn room. Handprints on the windows, crumbs on the floor, etc. I went to the front desk that evening and asked to be moved the next day. She spoke with the manager, and let me know it would be no problem. We were put in a MUCH nicer room, though it did not have a king bed, we were very pleased with the room. Also, as an added bonus...we were able to see the MK fireworks from our balcony at night. Cinderella Castle was seen through the trees! Overall, great stay and we will be staying there in the future.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cDisney's Wilderness Lodge\u201d", "Author": "TeresaHouston", "ReviewID": "UR17421333", "Content": "Stayed late June at Wilderness Lodge for the second time, it is a really good hotel and a very beautiful lodge. There are lit fireplaces on almost every floor with sitting areas for reading or watching TV outside your room. Somehow we got assigned to the 7th floor instead of our reserved courtyard view, but it turned out to be a bonus since we could watch the Magic Kingdom fireworks from our balcony, plus there is private concierge service and snacks provided by the Old Faithful Club - an all day snacking kitchen! Morning offers a free help yourself breakfast (with a pretty good selection), lunch and evenings offers other snacks including fruits, homemade cookies & milk, finger sandwiches and a small selection of wines, liquors, and alcohol - there's also a good quality coffee/cappaccino/espresso machine. The hotel has a bubbling spring just inside which runs to the outside and down the outside walkways amidst the generously landscaped grouds (Silver Creek Falls) until it turns into a large waterfall and empties into the pool, which is very inviting and with a nice slide for the kids. Just past the hot tubs is their Fire Rock geyser, which erupts every hour. We didn't use the pool bar (Trout Pass), but we enjoyed the Bay Lake beach and you can enjoy the nightly lights/musical parade sail by every evening. Their resterants are all good, with Whispering Canyon Cafe offering home-cooked meals at a reasonable price and the waiters provide entertainment and games; the highest priced is Artist Point - good food with smaller portions, not sure it's really worth the money (although the service was pretty good). but it was nice to try; the median priced resterant is Roaring Fork. The hotel has an excellent gift shop with a groceries selection, too. This hotel is also one of the few that has constant ferry service directly to the Magic Kingdom and is for hotel guest use only (comes in very handy after a long day in the park when you want to bypass most of the crowds to return to the hotel). Arcade, bike/boat rentals, hiking trails, premium fitness center, etc. This hotel also offers onsite airline check in and baggage check. We enjoy this hotel so much we skip the parks some nights and just stay at the lodge.

My husband and son took a walk from the hotel to the Ft. Wilderness campground...they saw armidillos, deer and rabbits on the walk. We did see rabbits and ducks on the grounds of the hotel...pretty neat to see. I never saw ducks in the pool when we were there so that was not a problem. We truly felt that we were on a great vacation and our kids did not want to leave. We love Disney World and try to go every 2-3 years...we usually stay at a family member's time share near Disney (Vistana, Orange Lake Country Club) but this year we decided to splurge and stay in a deluxe resort with all the benefits of booking a vacation package. Originally, we booked a campsite at Ft. Wilderness but decided not to take the camper down...we cancelled the reservation and booked the vacation package back in February. I booked our one week vacation via AAA and requested a standard view room (I also asked for an upper level room near the marina), 5 day hopper passes (Monday through Friday) and dining plan for 2 adults and 2 children for the week. We did not need airfare as we drove. The AAA agent booked the trip and did not tell me that we were upgraded to a woods view room. Well, we were pleasantly surprised when we could watch the MK fireworks from our room each night! Our balcony on the 6th floor faced the Contemporary and we could easily watch the fireworks. When requesting an upper floor near the marina, I figured it would be an elevator ride down and out the door down the path to catch the boat shuttles to the MK...I had no idea that requesting such a room would place us with a great view of the fireworks. Yes, it was expensive...a little over $3,000 but using the Disney VISA saved us almost $700 off the total cost of the package...we were able to accumulate almost 700 points and used those points to pay for the package. If you are planning a trip, I suggest getting the Disney VISA and use it for a few years and save up the points. You can use the saved points to offset the vacation package via the travel agent or by calling the Disney Travel Co. when you book your package. You can also use the benefit of the credit card to have a 6 month/zero interest method to pay off the vacation package. Also, if you use the Disney VISA in the World of Disney store in Downtown Disney, you will receive a 10% discount on your total purchases! We purchased the dining plan and strongly suggest you add it on...it was only $96 per day for our family of 4 but that included a counter service meal, snack and table service (including character dining) per person per day. The dining plan is linked with the number of nights you stay...we had the plan starting on Sunday, June 15 and meals were included through Friday, June 20...all benefits expired at midnight on Saturday, June 21, the day we checked out. We used all benefits of the plan...we ate well and we were never hungry although we might have gained a few pounds! We dined at The Wave (dinner-Contemporary...new restaurant and excellent...an absolute must...this restaurant specializes in local produce and organics...no food items are fried...only baked, broiled, sauted), Boma (dinner-Animal Kingdom Lodge...average buffet/will not go again), Crystal Palace in MK (Pooh characters at breakfast...wonderful for kids and breakfast was good), Liberty Tree Tavern in MK (character dinner, food with Thanksgiving theme...heavy meal but OK), Garden Grill in Epcot (character dinner...food was good, served family style but kids received standard kid food of mac-n-cheese and chicken fingers...restaurant revolves and shows views of the Land attraction) and finally, our last night was enjoying a dinner at the Wilderness Lodge at Whispering Canyon...good food and so much fun for the kids! We did have dinner reservations at the Grand Floridian Cafe (cancelled those because we were able to get a reservation for the Crystal Palace breakfast) and the Coral Reef at Epcot (cancelled because of heavy rain and we were able to get a seat at Whispering Canyon.) If we did not have the dining plan, it would have cost us $120-$150 per dinner or character breakfast, which included the tip...the dining plan saved us so much money...all we had to do was leave a tip! Don't forget...the dining plan includes a counter service meal which can be used for breakfast, lunch or dinner...we chose to use the counter service meals for lunch...most of those lunches would have cost us $30-$40 for the four of us per meal...so again, the dining plan is a definite way to save! We also used the snack vouchers for iced/slush drinks which usually cost around $4-$5 each...perfect on those hot summer days. The only problem we encountered at WL is that my son lost his Tower of Terror Mickey Mouse in the bedding of the hotel room...we think housekeeping wrapped up the sheets/linens and did not see it...the stuffed animals never left the room because the housekeeper would move them around on the beds and the kids could not wait to see how they would be placed. I called Lost and Found as well as filled out a missing item form at the front desk and was told that if found, they would mail it to us. The Tower of Terror Mickey was purchased two years ago on a special trip when our son rode the ride for the first time...bringing the Mickey back to Disney World again, two years later, was important to him...Mickey was coming back to visit. My daughter brought her Stitch stuffed animal (also bought on the same trip two years ago) but that one was fine...housekeeping continued to put it in different places. Unfortunately, we don't think we will ever see the Mickey again as once it goes to Disney laundry, which is in a huge building off site, it most likely will never be found or will be damaged during the laundry process. No one at the hotel offered to replace it if it was not found. So, other than having the Tower of Terror Mickey lost in the bedding, the Wilderness Lodge was great and we definitely would stay there again!! Last tips...get the Disney VISA and use all of the benefits it offers (unless you have a credit card that gives you more cash back or better benefits), get the dining plan if booking any Disney hotel...it is linked with the number of nights you stay and will definitely save you money if you are eating all of your meals in the \"World\", eat at The Wave at the Contemporary (the best meal we had during the entire week), use Disney transportation if staying on property as we did not drive our car once we parked it upon arrival, book your dining reservations 6 months in advance, especially for character dining...make them early as you can always cancel and/or make changes like we did. Most of all...enjoy your vacation!!", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "harrisburg, pa", "Title": "\u201cWilderness is Beautiful\u201d", "Author": "famvac04", "ReviewID": "UR17186409", "Content": "This is our 4th time at Disney in the last 7 years.

The rooms were decorated very nice with the bunkbeds and the flat screen tv. The rooms, like all we have stayed at in Disney were not very big, but we do not stay in them that much. The pool was again not as big as some but it was again very nice and very well guarded with many life guards. It had a nice water slide and how the stream from the lobby flowed into the pool was a very nice touch. The grounds were very well kept with cricket sounds and pine scents piped in. The resturants were very good. The Whispering Canyon was alot of fun with good food. Artist Point was quieter with excellent food. I tried a buffalo steak for the first time and it was fantastic. My son had the special cedar plank samon and loved it. The food court(if you can call it that) was a little small but never seemed to crowded. The transportation to the parks worked pretty well we only had to wait a lenghty time for 1 bus to Disney Studios. The boat to Magic Kingdom worked out great. We used this for many different uses and never had to wait more than 10 minutes. One of the only downfalls to this hotel was the maid service was not as creative as in the other hotels we stayed at. My younger son loves the towels decorated in different shapes and our maid never did this for him. I know this is minor but it bummed him out. Also the shower heads had the low flow heads which made the showers a little weak. But overall this is the hotel i would stay at again. I have stayed an Dixie Landings and Coronado Springs previously. My son and I took some trips to check out a couple of the other hotels (Animal Lodge,Polynesian,Old Key West) and without a doubt this was the best of the bunch.

Hotel offers excellent conditions to families: self operated laundry, Roaring Fork restaurant prepares hamburgers, salads, pizzas and also works as a minimarket to get cereals, milk, juices, sandwiches. All these can be taken to the room. Concerning the room location we took a standard view, 4th floor, north wing. Nobody goes to Disney to stay in the room, so it was ok, but kids enjoy MK Fireworks full view each night.

The lodge is beautiful, especially the lobby and grounds. I was also impressed with the little common sitting areas overlooking the lobby or overlooking the courtyard. The couches, rocking chairs, and fireplaces were a nice touch! We were checked in by Mary Ann who was very friendly and accommodating. We were pleased to find that we had been given an upgraded room at no charge. We had forgotten to request bunkbeds for our two kids, so I had written a note to the hotel before our arrival. Not only did they grant the bunkbed request, but they upgraded us to a courtyard view. The rooms are on the small side, but you really don't spend much time in them, since Orlando is chock full of other things to do. The balcony outside our room on the 4th floor was nice, and it gave us a chance to enjoy some fresh air read the paper, and enjoy some peace and quiet early in the morning. I was afraid that I might hear noise from bathers in the pool in the evenings, but when we shut our balcony door and pulled the curtains, I couldn't hear a thing from outside. We ate at Artist's Point one night (killer piece of halibut!) and a few times at Whistling Canyon Cafe and Roaring Forks. The Lincoln Logs were a big hit with the kids while waiting for our table at Whistling Canyon. As with most resorts, food is Very Expensive, and make sure you have a reservation during peak times. Buying the refillable mug at Roaring Forks is a good idea. We were able to see the Electric Light Parade each night from the dock, as well as the fireworks. The ferry to the Magic Kingdom and the Contemporary was great. We rode the ferry to the Contemporary and then jumped on the monorail one night just to take the loop around the different properties. I think one of the best things about staying at a Disney resort is the transportation system. We never waited more than 5 or 10 minutes for the buses, and they take you everywhere \"disney\" you'd like to go, including Downtown Disney. Also, this was our first time using the Magical Express, and not having to worry about our bags getting from the airport to the lodge was great. My kids (9 and 4 years of age) particularly liked the pool slide. (We adults liked the bubbling hot tubs!) We also had the kid's characters drawn by an artist in the lobby.

We visited during the peak time of March 28 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c March 30, 2008. The Hotel / Arrival: Upon approach to the hotel, you definitely get the feeling that you are entering a forest or a National Park out west. With the hedges cut in shapes of animals and tall pine trees, it was a very festive and unique atmosphere in the middle of Florida. I arrived under the porte-cochere and found our other family members had already arrived. The bellmen offered no assistance, but since I was only traveling with one bag, assistance was clearly un-necessary. However, the outside of the hotel and the architecture was striking and pleasant, and what was more pleasant, was that the hotel seemed relatively quiet for being in the Peak season. Lobby: Wow! What a lobby! Upon entering the seven-story lodge, you are greeted by tall totem poles, a bubbling hot spring, comfortable seats and a fireplace. The atmosphere of the lobby was quite inviting and truly made me feel a world away. However, check-in wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as smooth as expected. I had reserved a room with club-level access and was supposed to be greeted and checked in by a specialized agent. After fifteen minutes of confusion, I was finally taken to the room and shown the club lounge. Room: Because more family was meeting me later in the evening, we had reserved a Deluxe Club Level Room. The room is large for Disney standards. It has a large balcony overlooking the pool and geyser from the large living room. Attached to the living room with French doors is the bedroom with two queen beds. Then, finally, there is the bathroom, with easy access to the bedroom and the living room. The shower and the toilet are separated from the sinks. Furnishings could use a little bit of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153update\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but for the purposes of sleeping after a day in the park, the room would suffice. Housekeeping, or Mousekeeping, was great, leaving special towel animals on the bed or the floor every time we returned to the room. Club Lounge: The Old Faithful Club located on the top floor of the hotel is for the exclusive use of those who have booked a club-room. The floor is basic, with concierge desks (this is the reason to get club level, since they can help with everything Disney and with those Priority Seating times), five food presentations, and quiet seating areas. No one ever seemed to be in the lounge, so it was very quiet. The food is great for travelers like us, who wake up early and go to bed late to maximize time in the park. However, the food could not replace a meal for those who are hungry. Fitness Center and Spa: There was a fitness center on property, but come on, this is Disney, the daily walking / running though the park is enough exercise. A spa was advertised at the Grand Floridian Resort nearby. Dining: Since we spent most of our time at the park, dining at the Lodge rarely happened. However, I did notice a wild restaurant called Whispering Canyon Cafe in the lobby, which sounded exciting. Most people I talked to highly recommended the restaurant, and I suggest reservations / Priority seating since there appeared to be a wait. In addition, there is a semi-formal restaurant called Artist Point. There is also a cafeteria-style place toward the pool of the hotel, which served light items and items to-go. Cost: The Lodge is considered a Deluxe property of Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and therefore is part of the most expensive category of hotels. Again, since this was peak travel for Disney, the room rates were expensive. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall exactly what was spent on the room, but I believe the total for the room and park tickets for three days totaled over a thousand for three people. I only wish that I were able to spend more time in the room and the club for that cost. Service: I was shocked by how poor almost all of the service of the Cast Members was. I have been to Disney more times than I can count on both hands, and this was the first time that I felt like a burden to the staff. No one seemed happy and they all appeared to be highly stressed out. I understand that it was Peak season, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m giving them all the benefit of the doubt, but almost all of the other guests I talked to felt the same way about the service at the hotel and the parks. Transportation: Disney Transportation at the Lodge included a boat ride to the Magic Kingdom, Fort Wilderness, and the Contemporary Hotel. A bus is required for all other parks and resorts. The busses, we found, were less than reliable on this trip, but it always seems to take 30 to 45 minutes to get to the parks. Overall: A very pleasant stay. My advice: If you can avoid the peak time, you should. I have had much better experiences with the staff and overall happiness during value times.

The bathrooms are small and very non-deluxe. The beds are very ordinary and less desirable than the beds in a Hampton Inn or Courtyard Marriott. Disney charges very high prices for these elaborate lobbies with small plain rooms. Disney needs to re-price and re-advertise these as moderate resorts.

Ritz, Four Seasons etc. We will not stay at another deluxe Disney resort because they do not exist. There are plenty of locations close by that offer much more for less.

We ate one night at the Whispering Canyon - it was a little too loud and the food was just o.k. so that is why we only ate there the one night. We rented a car and found the parking very convenient. We also used the the boat transit which was the best way to travel to the Magic Kingdom. The only negative is that I found the bathroom was begining to look a little faded. There was mold along the tub and some of the shower tiles. It could use a little updating. Otherwise it was a perfect choice for our family and a vacation to remember!", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "norwich", "Title": "\u201clocation location location\u201d", "Author": "archantgirl2", "ReviewID": "UR16003377", "Content": "This is a true account of how we found this hotel. We spent our Honeymoon here for 14 nights in April 2008, and from the moment our taxi pulled into the drive of this beautiful building, my heart almost missed a beat, it was fab. From a bright hello from the bell hops on the outside station to the vast amazing lobby, you were filling up with a true magic experience. Check in was very quick, as it was on our records we were on honeymoon, the hotel upgraded us from a woods view room we had paid for up to a court yard (pool to you and I) view at no charge. Although we did have a disabled room which meant the bed was lower, a roll in shower, no tub, but that was fine. We were also asked if we would like to be the flag family, which of course we graciously accepted ( I had read about it on here and got very excited) the young girl Lauren was very helpful and nice. We got to the room and I didn't like it, because of the shower and we were on the 6th floor which meant our balcony was closed in. I went back down, they could not move us that night but promised they would move us to a woods view room in the morning. So we stayed the night still packed. We got into the room, got changed very quickly and went down to eat as we were starving. We went to Whispering Canyon Cafe, which I have made a separate review on (it gets very loud) we then went to roaring fork and purchased a refillable mug for the resort (and believe me, worth every penny the amount we filled up for free!) then to bed to find a Mickey head made of towels and a photo congratulating us from Mickey and Minnie with 2 balloons - a really nice touch. The room has a small fridge in it, which you can't find to start as it is under two drawers! It is noisy but you get used to it. You have a dresser with a plug socket, and a lighted mirror, handy for hair and makeup! You have ice and vending on each floor, and guest laundry are opposite the lifts on the ground floor. Lots of machines! Very good. Next morning we got a phone call asking if we wanted to move, and we decided to stay as the noise of the pool was not too bad, and the fact we got used to the shower. The staff were very accommodating. Every night we had a turn down service, and was left 4 chocolates every night (again a nice touch) mousekeeping staff was nice, but, and I say but.......... we noticed that they do not clean the room every day. They change towels, emptied the bins, gave you new shampoos etc but they did not clean. One night my husband was ill and was sick, 2 days later we noticed that it had not been cleaned from the toilet. This is the first time I had ever stayed anywhere where they don't clean every day. We figured that it was our own dirt and as we don't clean the bathroom back home every day we would live with it. We lived with it. We used the shop (Mercantile) on several occasions, and if you have a package delivered from a park to resort, it will end up here - not in your room, but that was fine with us. We sampled all the restaurants. Roaring fork almost every day for either lunch or breakfast (1 quick service credit on both). This suited us well on our Disney Dinning Plan. Artist point was very very nice (2 table service credits). The bar was also nice. The pool did get busy at times but then you expect that with the amount of rooms. We loved the pool and never found it hard to get 2 sun beds together. The troutpass bar is also good. There was a family of 8 baby ducks born whilst we were there and they were running all over the place, we loved that! We saw lots of rabbits, birds(red cardinals) (also a nest with babies in it) squirrels and an armadillo, which was a first for us! The spa was nice, with the 2 pools having different temperatures. The main pool was warm too, which was a pleasure! We went to the beach, on one day we rented a surrey bike (real good fun) and on another a Boston Whaler which was also very good fun. We also went over to Fort Wilderness campground and done the horse riding which was great. we had been in the hotel 2 days and not touched the theme parks! There is so much to do. They hold pool parties which are good fun too. Oh and at 9.35pm each night you can the the Electric water pageant, this is very out dated and needs looking at! We watched a couple of times and had a giggle at it! But I guess it was fun! Oh and if you catch the wishes fireworks from the boat taking you to magic kingdom, you will get a fantastic view! The bus service outside is excellent, we never waited more than 10 mins for a bus getting out of the hotel, sometimes coming back at peak periods we waited 45 mins but at closing times of the parks you sort of expect it. after-all there are thousands of people trying to get out and anyone who can't understand that must be daft! The boat service to magic kingdom, and fort wilderness / contemporary resorts are also very quick and had near to no wait time. The extra magic hours was a real benefit at magic kingdom, one night we were there from 10.30 pm until 1.30 am and done most of the park. with Epcot, that was different, EVERYONE wanted to go on Soarin', so no extra magic benefit really. We found it so handy having a room key that was a charge card, our admission into the parks and our Disney Dining plan too, really handy. You will need to show this to get your extra magic hour wristband. It has your name printed on it so you can keep it as a keepsake. Oh, and the hotel gave us \"Just Married\" badges, which gave us loads of perks everywhere, like free drinks, free bike ride, given front row on rides, in mexico a whole boat to ourselves which was nice! Loads of people coming over and congratulating us! Free Champagne flutes from Magic Kingdom at Cinderella's royal table. All sorts! When we were the flag family, ranger Stan was great bless his heart! He took us up, we raised the flags, videoed and took loads of pics from up there! What a view, do it if you can! You get a certificate, then he takes you to club level and you get a free breakfast after giving your family a certificate! Great fun - an absolute must! All in all we are really pleased we stayed here, ok so the cleaners could have done better, but you are paying for the location to the parks. The room was not huge, but big enough by far. we loved it. It looks a bit dark but this is keeping in with the theme. Also, there re light switches on the bed, so be sure to find them. Oh, and just a warning, every time you turn the telly on (a flat screen to boot!) it automatically turns on the disney top 7 must see's, anyone who knows Stacey will know what I mean! And although she is very cheery, when you get back from the parks all worn out and want half an hour of telly to wind down, she can get very irritating! And you get loads of disney channels including disney vacation club secrets, but no channels like the discovery channel which we love (I know what you are thinking - GEEKS!) as it is different to what we have back here at home in the UK (we don't have Sky) but then we only spent little time in the room so it didn't matter. We would stay here again, and though it is very expensive for what it is, I think it is worth it, just to be hassle free and you can come and go as you wish. We have always staying on International drive, and had to rely on the free shuttles to the parks which are great, but you have to book a time to come home, and you don't get to see the fireworks.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201clocation and hotel perfect\u201d", "Author": "MinnieTink", "ReviewID": "UR15993721", "Content": "We were there the week of May 5th and we loved it.

Our room did have the balcony overlooking the lobby with rocking chairs to sit in, which was our meeting place and worked out great. (There were 6 of us, all adults, traveling together.) All of our rooms were next to each other - a fantastic accomplishment on Disney's part - considering how many people constantly come and go.

We decided to stay at Wilderness Lodge for our four night stay as we felt it would be great for the kids. we even booked the Club Level to ensure some extra creature comforts. The bottom line was that we were very disappointed. the service levels were not up to snuff and housekeeping did my turn down on the first night before 5pm, before we made it back from the pool. on the second day, we returned home from the parks at 4pm to find our room not yet made. additionally, i called down for a toothbrush and shaving cream at 10pm and by 11.30pm i finally gave up. still nothing until i called down again the next morning. Josh and Anna the guest services managers were nice and very apologetic, but it does not change the annoyance of these incidents. The Club Level was also not what i was expecting. at the Polynesian the lounge is spacious and has some charm, the Wilderness \"lounge\" is a small area with some cookies and drinks. the tables are in the regular hallways and it has no atmosphere what so ever. the club level staff were pleasant but unlike previous trips, they were powerless to get bookings for breakfasts or dinners beyond that available to the general public. The worst part of the stay was the issue of travel to and from the Parks. the combination of boat shuttles and buses was nowhere near that of the monorail. there was actually an hour and ten minute delay for a bus home from Epcot on our last night. people were going crazy. i actually calmly reported this to the front desk and was told a manager was looking into the delay and would get back to me. i am still waiting!! Lastly, the pool was way too small and way too crowded to the point where my kids were not even anxious to swim. we normally spend half the day at the parks and half at the pool but that did not happen this trip, as just not desirable or relaxing. On the plus side, Disneyworld is a great vacation. my kids ages 8 and 6 had fun. Whispering canyons restaurant in the lobby is a hoot and food was good. we liked our room and it was plenty big enough for the four of us. keep in mind that bathrooms are small and very dark. i know i am sounding very critical and i guess that is because i am disappointed in this resort. my expectations of Disney are just higher. my suggestion is try the Polynesian before going here.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201conly ok\u201d", "Author": "deannamort", "ReviewID": "UR15406689", "Content": "we stayed at the wilderness lodge from 4/21-4/26.

I decided to pull up and pay for valet at $10.00 a day I thought that was reasonable. Here is where things got crazy, luggage everywhere, very disorganized, and the system is flawed. The idea is to leave your luggage with this group go to your room then call down for them to bring up the baggage. After I noticed the confusion I asked to have my bags taken up with us when we went up. Well that is against the rules they will not even give you a cart so you can take your own bags up. So I had to carry everything (remember 4 and 2 yr old) up to our room. Pay attention to the small print the hotel is not responsible for damage or THEFT to your bags. So ask next time you see this unorganized group what would you do if you had to replace all your things. I was told from the valet manager that it was a real busy day and that is why all the confusion. So in other words if they are busy you will pay the price!!

I would warn all normal people to really watch the set up before eating there. If you are into the screaming rude theme this is the place for you.

Many of the staff at Whispering Canyon remember us as well. It truly makes you feel like you've come home. Whispering Canyon is a bit pricey but their meals are experiences more than just food. Definitely worth it. Artist Point is one of the finest restaurants I've been to. The buffalo steak is very nice. Access to the parks is efficient by bus.

Let me preface this review with the fact that I am very critical of lodging. I have a little one with allergies/asthma so I tend to be overly concerned with the cleanliness of a hotel and room. Having said that, the Wilderness Lodge exceeded my expectations! The grounds, lobby, hallways, restaurants, and our room were cleaned impeccably every day - and every part of the resort, inside and out are immaculate. My family stayed there during the busy Easter week and we never felt overcrowded, rushed, or jammed whether it be in the restaurants or while using the resort's transportation services (boat and bus). Our room was located on the 5th floor and overlooked the waterfall and creek - It was very quiet - never heard our neighbors and enjoyed the electric water pageant from our balcony. We also loved the nightly turn down service - what a luxury after a busy day in the parks - and how lovely to even have them replenish your towels that late in the day! The pool area was quite nice with a wonderful water slide, hot tubs and snack bar right there on site. The restaurants were superb. Artist Point is perhaps the best meal at Disney - the food by far was our best meal ever on property (and we have been on property 5 times in the past 5 years). Whispering Canyon had both great food and such fun ambience that we cancelled reservations elsewhere to enjoy dinners there instead. Roaring Forks is the only place where perhaps I think could improve - as other reviewers have noted, it is a small space and the options are nowhere near as exhaustive as other food courts - having said that, what food they offer is prepared very well. I cant say enough good things about this resort. You can see the pictures and appreciate the beauty - but you need to really be there to see the little things that just make this the best property around. We cannot wait to return next year and foresee it as becoming our home away from home when visiting Disney.", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queens, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "FilmmakerMom", "ReviewID": "UR14655328", "Content": "My husband and I were concerned about staying on a Disney property with our six-year-old twins because of over-stimulation and over-exposure to all things Disney.

The staff was courteous and our room attendant made cute little animals out of our washcloths, which delighted the children. We generally spent our mornings at the parks and the afternoons at the hotel. Although we were there at peak season, the pool never felt over-crowded and the waterslide was a big hit. There is a great running/biking trail through the woods where you can see deer on a regular basis. There are also boat rentals on the property and boating there is very easy and the waters calm. The Whispering Canyon Restaurant in the hotel had great barbecue although a loud atmosphere. Beware if you ask for ketchup - you may get more than you bargained for! If your main reason for going to Disney is the Magic Kingdom, this is the place to stay. Travel to the Magic Kingdom was easy and pleasant by boat or by bus and never took more than twenty mintues, even with the wait.

Both boat and bus transportation are very reliable. We used the boat to Magic Kingdom and the bus to all other theme parks. The rooms are adequate and well appointed and they have a small fridge. One big plus in the room is that the double sink is separate from the bathroom and allows for multiple users to do \"their functions\" at the same time. Food is a bit tricky. The Whispering Canyons required reservations and we did not like their breakfast. The Artist Point is pricey and be prepared to spend $50 per person for dinner. We frequently used the Roaring Forks for breakfast and snacks, it was quite good. Water bottles (20 fl) are $2.00 all over (hotels or parks). If you are a coffee drinker in the morning, buy the hotel mug for $13, which allows you to have it filled with hot and soft drinks with no limits and you can transfer your last fill to a to-go cup for the ride. The extended hours was the only way we were able to take the Soarin' ride at EPCOT (60 minutes wait) compared to 120 minutes during regular hours.

Let me set my expectation level: I wanted something CLEAN and in close proximity to Walt Disney World (especially the Magic Kingdom). The Wilderness Lodge met these expectations - plus some! The hotel itself is gorgeous. The lobby is breathtaking. We simply didn't have time to eat here, and had to squeeze in time to swim. My kids LOVED the pool area (I loved the hot tub!). They really enjoyed the water slide. There were ducks in the pool which turned me off a bit, but my kids thought they were awesome. The geyser just past the pool was really cool also. What a neat thing Disney added! I absolutely LOVED the boat transportation to the Magic Kingdom. It is not exactly speedy, but it sure beat cramming onto a monorail car at the end of the night with everyone else. I felt the boats were timely, and the ride \"home\" was an extension of the enjoyment of staying on property. We opted to drive when we went to Animal Kingdom, Epcot (we took advantage of the extra magic morning hours that day which was AWESOME!), and Downtown Disney, so I cannot comment on the bus service. Driving was easy, and after the first day we easily found our way around. The rooms here are small, but very well equipped. I was impressed at the spacious bathroom area, plenty of drawer space, sufficient closet area, and CLEANLINESS. Our housekeeper was also very attentive and met our requests. The kids LOVED the bunk beds, and I cannot imagine they would have slept nearly as well sharing a queen-size bed (they are 7 and 5). Yes, the rooms are small, but as the \"vacationing Mom\" it forced me to have a week off also. I did NO laundry all week and didn't fix one meal or wash one dish. We used the room as designed: as a crash spot to bathe and sleep in after long days at the parks. We were pleasantly surprised by the added amenities (especially the pools) which caused us to want to spend more time there than we had planned. I personally heard very minimal noise, and we all slept quite well (even sleeping in several mornings after VERY late nights out with two little ones). I am very picky about hotels being clean, and I felt our room was very clean. I held my breath until we got to the room. The kids squealed when they saw the bunk beds. I squealed when I saw the immaculate bathroom! :-D The Wilderness Lodge is considered a \"Disney Deluxe Resort\" and is priced accordingly. Keep in mind you are paying for location, not huge, plush rooms.

First, there is no doubt that the public spaces inside and out are indeed fantastic and impressive. Everything in the soaring lobby and the man made stream and pools outside was amazing. Of course you could enjoy these spaces in almost the same way if you made reservations at the hotel resaurant. The disconnect comes when you go beyond the public spaces and into the rooms. There is nothing special about the smallish rooms to set them apart from any other rooms - except if you were anywhere else they would cost one half as much. And the room were a little worn. In one (we had two) the drapes were torn from the curtain rod and would not close all the way. Both looked like they needed some freshening and for someone in hosuekeeping to look beside and behind some of the furniture.

Our stay was 7 days and we had the park hopper tickets and the meal plan. Hotel: Very nice atmosphere, nice pool area, beautiful lobby. A little more trash laying around the outside compared to other Disney resorts. Room: Average. We had two queen beds on the second floor. The sliding door was improperly fixed with a cheap sliding bolt for the lock. You want this door to seal nicely because of the constant horn blaring from the boats. I improvised a few slips of paper under the door to seal it and keep the noise out. The TV is a very nice LG LCD flatscreen that is locked to receive about 40 analog channels. You will hear your neighbors. Bring ear plugs. The plumbing was noisy. When a sink was turned on there was a loud hum that went along with it. Maid service was excellent. They made a new animal out of washcloths and towels almost every night. Grounds: Apparently there is no enforcement of the smoking policy anywhere outside this resort. Encountered a few drunk and vulgar people around the pool and boat dock area. You can get an OK glimpse of the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the beach area. Pool was too cold to use a couple of nights. Roaring Forks (quick counter service): Can get very crowded in the morning and has a poor traffic flow design. Disappointing selection of soft drinks. Whispering Canyon restaurant: All you can eat breakfast and dinner. Dinner is barbecue. The food is very good. The noisy atmosphere and antics are cute for about 10 minutes, but gets old real fast. Disappointing selection of soft drinks. Front desk and concierge: Some of the most unhappy and least helpful people I've encountered at any Disney resort. Not rude, just not any different than any other counter person at any other place of business. Magical Express luggage delivery service to room: 5 hours. Don't have anything that can't handle a pounding. Our luggage was obviously thrown into our room in a pile right in front of the door. Two plastic luggage tags were broken. Transportation: Poor. We averaged about 2 to 3 hours a day waiting for buses and boats. There seemed to be some confusion amongst the drivers at times. Many bus routes will make additional stops before arriving where you want to go. Boats were crowded and a few times we had to wait for more than one boat. Airport check out service: Very nice. You can leave your bags with them and they will be checked all the way to your final destination. Not pertaining to the Wilderness Lodge, but DisneyWorld in general-not their best week. Broken down rides, rides closed for refurbishment and poor transportation certainly didn't make our week magical. The entire Disney property is not diabetic friendly. With a very wide variety of diet soft drinks on the market there is only a choice of Diet Coke , water or occasionally lite lemonade. My 10 year old son quickly got discouraged with this. I was actually told by one \"helpful\" cast member that I should take a cab to the Hess gas station for a better selection. For all of the promotion of \"year of a million dreams\", I didn't see it happen once in seven days. We will be attempting to get at least a partial refund from our travel agent. If you want a deluxe resort, stay at the Polynesian or an Epcot resort. Disney meal plan: Used to be good. Now it has changed. No appetizer and no gratuity. To boot, a very cheesy solicitation of business with a 18% and 20% \"suggested\" tip. I actually had one waitress (at Whispering Canyon) ask me if I wanted to charge my tip to the room or was I leaving cash.

I found out one thing of on property resorts at Disney. You are paying for the convenience of transportation and extra magic hours. The hotel room is not any nicer than a Hilton or even some Comfort Suites. It may actually lack in some areas. We woke up one morning to find that there was no hot water. We called the front desk and was told that yes a pipe was messed up and it would be a few more hours before the problem would be fixed. I would figure a hotel of this expense would have some type of backup system in place for this. I have stayed in many hotels and never not had hot water. I chalked this up as a freak disturbance and moved on. The next night we grabbed a quick bite to eat at the Roaring Forks counter service restaurant. I asked a simple question to please substitute grapes on the chicken nugget platter instead of french fries for my child. We were told they could not substitute anything for the fries and if we wanted grapes we needed to order the salad plate that came with grapes. I told them that my child would not eat salad but wanted grapes instead of fries on the chicken nugget plate. Once again the lady told us \"Sorry, no substitutions\". I was appalled as even McDonald's will substitute apple dippers for fries. On the way back to the room we spoke to the manager about the hot water and how we could not substitute grapes for fries. I know these seem like minor details but a substitution of grapes for fries should not be a problem. The manager listened to us about the hot water and grapes and basically said, \"Oh well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay.\" For the prices Disney charges they could seem a little more caring. The hotel is fine but just keep in mind the room is a normal room, nothing special. If you come with great expectations of the room you will be disappointed. The pool is a normal pool, and the food is normal Disney food. If you are going to use the benefits of the extra magic hours to get into the park early and stay late then the on property resorts are worth it.

This property is beautiful inside and out and considered one of Disney's \"Deluxe\" hotels. Having stayed mostly at moderates in the past, we decided to try something new. The property itself is gorgeous, I could have stayed in the lodge the entire trip instead of going to the parks and been just fine. There were many activities scheduled throughout the day, but we never actually made it to any of them so I can't vouch for the quality of these. But it was nice knowing they were available. The room was nice, clean and with a decent view. We had a woods view and could just see the top of the Magic Kingdom and Cinderella's castle from a our second floor balcony. There was a small man-made pond in front of our room. Nothing more than a few ducks. The high points of this property are the beautiful design and the proximity to the Magic Kingdom by boat. The convenience that this boat service adds cannot be beat. You literally arrive at the front steps. Anybody who's trekked to or from from the bus drop-off understands the benefit of this, especially after a very long day at the parks. It is a fun place to explore, there is lots to see and look for inside the lodge, and outside there is a walking trail. The area around the pools and beach is fun to explore, with a geyser and bear tracks on the sidewalks for kids to follow. The low points for me were the concierge and the dining. Concierge was friendly but had limited knowledge. I had questions about seasonal passes and show times at the Magic Kingdom. Concierge didn't know show times (I was told this was specific to the parks), which I understand but it sure would have been helpful info to help plan my day. They also didn't have info on the seasonal passes and had to Google to get the needed info. This was disappointing after waiting in line for twenty minutes to speak to the concierge. The snack bar had the exact same items as are available in the moderate food courts, yet there is only one cashier and it's a tiny tiny space. The lines were excessively long and there were very few places to sit. This made breakfast impossible unless you got there really early or else really don't mind standing in line. I don't understand why Disney made the snack-bar dining smaller in the Deluxe accommodations? The Whispering Canyon restaurant was fun. The kids enjoyed the goofy service and spinning buffet wheel on the table. However, it's not really worth it unless you have more than two or three adults eating.

After check in you will most likey go to the elevators, which are right behind a wishing well. This brings us to rooms, many people have probably commented on the rooms being dark. Well, the light switches are hidden behind or even IN the bedposts. Many people don't notice this. Also, many people don't realize that bunk bed rooms are available for a slightly higher price. My suggestion is that if your child is over 10 years old don't get a bunk bed room. The layout of the rooms is nice. My only complaint would be the stiffness of the sheets and the holes in them. Unfortunately, my sleep didn't feel very sanitary. Room service is very good, but its pricey. HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW!!!!! There's a water parade on the lake some nights. It's very pretty. Also, in some rooms fireworks are partially viewable. Don't try and argue with a lobby lady for a room with a view of the Magic Kingdom, because there is no such room. The boat transportation to the Magic Kingdom is very pleasent. It takes 7 minutes on average. (We timed it.) The roaring forks resturant is the ideal place to take your young child. It's an interactive restuant where, you will be asked to wave your napkin and waiters have names like \"Betsy May Brown Dog!\" It's really a nice experience. The other resturant aka the food court is so-so. They have pretty good chicken strips. WARNING: If you eat by the pool you may be swarmed with crows and even an armidillo or two. Trust me. There is plenty of Wilderness in this Lodge. During our stay I say 1 armidillo, 1 swimming aligator, trillions of ducks, 1 snake on the path to the boats and too many crows to count.

Maybe a little restrictive given that we were in the pool with them constantly and no more that a couple of feet away. We had to carry lifejackets with us each time.

The details like the carved wood beams and intricate headboards in the room were beautiful! We had a room on the 6th floor on the inside of the lodge. The room was very nice, fluffy towels, nice tv, mini-fridge, and a comfortable bed (not sure why others thought it wasn't! I slept through the whole night which I never do! and I own a Temperpedic at home!). The cons of this hotel: the bathroom floor seemed dirty, the Whispering Canyon Cafe (I like funny stuff too!) but this place was annoying with the loud guy yelling crap and the food was not that good except for the cornbread!, and I only got one towel animal (I was excited because on the first day we got a Mickey on our bed) and then there was never another! It sounds stupid about the towel animal but I thought it was cool and Disney makes me feel like a kid again! Other than a few small issues the place is amazing! The grounds were beautiful!! The hotel is very cozy! I would love to go back!!", "Date": "December 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange, Texas", "Title": "\u201cMostly Excellent Experience\u201d", "Author": "CletusSquatford", "ReviewID": "UR11631074", "Content": "Pros: -The bunk beds are a little small, but a lot of fun. -Room was clean. -Concierge was friendly and helpful. -Staff at the whispering canyon cafe were friendly and did a lot of fun spontaneous things (the cafe in general is a lot of fun) -My 3 year old had a great time on the \"hidden mickey\" scavenger hunt. -We had a decent view of the magic kingdom fireworks each night and the electric light water parade deal on the bay lake. -The food was excellent at the \"signature dining\" artist pointe restaurant. -Everything decorated for Xmas, live Xmas music performed in the lobby, random events for kids (like making animals out of towels and pipe cleaners) -The children's pool was a lot of fun for my 3 year old and there are 2 hot tubs which are life savers after long days walking at the theme parks. The fact that there is one stone step down into the pool all the way around wasn't really an issue. A child under 3 should be monitored while in the pool anyway. Bring your own floatation device. -You can buy a souvenir mug for $15 that gives you unlimited refills on coffee, hot chocolate, sodas etc for the length of your stay -The grounds are just lovely, well maintained, with various disney magic (like hoof prints going off into the grass with a hedge-scuplted buffalo). The stream that starts in the lobby, turns into a waterfall outside and then empties in the pool is also especially lovely. We even saw a mother duck with her 10 offspring at the top of the waterfall. Cons: -Yes, it costs more. but, It's closer to the theme parks, you get a lot of magical extras for the kids, you can take a fun boat ride to magic kingdom, you get a lot of conveniences, especially if you're on the disney meal plan. You get what you pay for. -Yes, the rooms are a little small for more than 2 adults and 2 kids, but you shouldn't be spending that much time in the room anyway. Quality of the sheets and mattresses were decent, I've seen better but i've also seen worse. -Yes you should make your dining reservations in advance, though we got seated within 30 minutes without a reservation and you can sit in the majestic lobby while you wait and your kid plays with the lincoln logs they have set up. Service was a little slow for us, but really it wasn't a big deal. -Yes some of the staff are useless. There are a lot of employees most of them were friendly, helpful, and the manager of the artist point restaurant was even going around checking on the tables and seeing how everything was. But there are a few bad apples. If anyone at disney is reading this, the guy doing the \"magic cookie hour\" at the roaring fork dining/snack stand was downright creepy. It lasted 5 to 10 minutes, enough for my son to put some sprinkles and icing on a cookie and he made him a certificate with his name on it and that was it. Other than that, it was a lot of fun for all and worth the money. I might try a different resort now that I know what to expect at the lodge but it was a great first trip.

Wilderness Lodge was a huge disappointment. While checking in the girl at the front desk acted like she didn't want to be bothered was actually short when I would ask questions. NEVER saw this before & haven't seen it since at Disney. I've read other reviews with the same problem at this resort.There were ducks swimming in the pool & all their poop was in & around the pool. NASTY!!I wouldn't let my daughter go in. Others were having a grand time swimming in poop. whatever!!! When we went to the restaurant Whispering Canyon Caf\u00c3\u00a9. You better be ready for this one. When we were there & someone asked for ketchup they brought about 20 bottles sometimes cases to your table. No exaggeration. Then when some poor unsuspecting soul asked for ketchup. You got to get up & give your 20 bottles to that table. Luckily we saw the show in action before & didn't ask for ketchup. Here is an idea I NEVER thought of . The said table with the 20 bottles of ketchup had probably 6 adults & about as many kids. One fine young chap LOVED ketchup was sticking his fries in the ketchup bottle then double dipping. Finally, that wasn't enough so he started licking the ketchup out of the bottle. No one at the table ever told him to stop. Guess what they did with the bottle???Put the cap back on it & sent it on it's round around the restaurant. I have never looked at a ketchup bottle the same since. This hotel is basically out in the middle of nowhere & if this is what you want then this is the resort for you. We like a little life ,we choose Boardwalk. Which we have had a few problems at Boardwalk too over the past 8 years but nothing worth writing a negative review over. Another problem I had which isn't really the fault of the Wilderness Lodge. But the FINE folks that stayed next door to us had this delightful bundle of joy That SCREAMED FOR 1 1/2 HOURS EVERY NIGHT until he finally went to sleep. Only to wake up the next morning SCREAMING. I am often confused by people who think taking a 1 year old to Disney World is a great idea. Little Johnny isn't going to remember the time he SCREAMED bloody murder every night for a week much less his picture with Mickey. Maybe the walls at Wilderness Lodge are paper thin. We have never had this problem at Boardwalk. Here is a note for people who take small children. We took our daughter for the first time at 5 years. We didn't have the mind set of DO ALL OF DISNEY OR DIE!!!! You would have to live at Disney World for a month to complete that Disney Quest.We would do as much as she could handle & then go back to the room & rest. Some days we spent half the day at the pool, of course not at the Wilderness pool.

My husband and I were extremely disappointed with the resort in general. After reading tons of reviews online about how wonderful this resort was, we booked it. We were expecting a lot more from a Disney Deluxe Resort. This was our first trip to Disney and we thought we did our homework. The hotel itself has a nice appeal when you walk in. The staff was very friendly but not overly helpful. The concierge did not even know when the Disney Magic Hours were, she gave us the wrong times, luckily my husband and I checked our own printed information. We also wanted information on some of the water parks and they seemed clueless. They only promoted the other Disney parks. It took 2 and phone calls and 4 hours to get a pack n play crib and a set of bed rails for the bunk bed. The room was the worst part of our vacation. We were facing a horrible swap/pond and a fence with dumpsters behind it. We asked for a new room but we would have been charged $35.00 more per night. We booked this room for $395 a night already. After being in the room for a half an hour I wanted to cry and couldn't believe we paid for this place. It pretty much ruined the entire trip. We had a double bed and a set of bunk beds for my 2 boys and a pack and play for my infant. My son's own bedroom is larger than this room. It was very small and extremely difficult for all of us to move around. We had to spend 5 nights in this tiny and very ugly room. This room was meant for 2 people not a family. The room was not very clean, the bathroom floor was dirty, the decor was very bland, and the beds were uncomfortable. The bunk beds were merely made of ply wood and the mattresses were like foam. The bottom mattress of the bunk bed did not even fit on the bed it was too small. You could see the ply wood sticking out from the mattress. The sheets and blankets were cheaply made and not up to deluxe standards. This was a very basic and average room. There was nothing fancy or nice about this room. There was a very small table and a flat screen t.v. (nicest thing about the room). We have stayed at many hotels and have traveled the country with our children. We personally like the Marriott hotels much better. At least the rooms have more appeal and are much cleaner. The staff also caters to you and the food is good. This is a rustic themed resort but we were expecting a much nicer room. The adult pool was very nice but the pictures on the internet make it seem larger than it actually is. If you have small children I would not recommend the baby pool. The baby pool is 15\" deep but it also has a step made of stone and stone all around the pool. My 2 year old kept falling all over the place and I was worried sick that he was going to either break his neck or knock out a tooth. All he wanted to do was go up and down the stone steps. By the time we left he had cuts all over his knees and feet. There were several other mothers at the pool who also thought the pool was dangerous for small children. If this is a baby/toddler pool why all the stone? I have been to many resorts that had pools just like this one with rubber around them. There were also many children who were around 10-12 unsupervised jumping in the baby pool scaring the small children. There were staff members walking around and didn't say anything. The food at the hotel was average and in order to make a reservation you have to call months in advance. They are also very overpriced for what you get. They offer a boat ride to the magic kingdom which was convenient but we rented a car so we really didn't need the other transportation sevices that Disney offers. If we do go back to Disney we will not be staying at a Disney Resort. For the money we spent we will stay at a Marriott or Hilton instead. At least we know the food will be good, the rooms will be nicer, and the staff will appreciate our business.", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "wyonative78", "ReviewID": "UR11190607", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Wilderness Lodge November 17 - 24, 2007 for our honeymoon.

We were on the first floor at the end of the hall and across from the second, smaller pool that is part of the Villas. Each room has a flat-screen TV, mini-fridge, and patio or balcony. We loved having our breakfast out on our patio! The property and rooms were immaculate. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Roaring Forks, the food court, was just fine for what it was.

They also had a small refridgerator , blowdryer and iron/board in the room. Sometimes it got loud from the whispering canyon restaurant. Which by the way we didnt like. The entertainment was good but the food wasnt good. We did complain about our food. We only told them that the steak didnt taste right or that it was bad and they took it off the bill. We didnt tell them that all of our dinner came out cold. Plan on spending there for a family of three with drinks about $100. ( all adult prices). The roaring fork was our favorite. The price was ok( $7-8 per meal) and the food was good especially the salads. We did take advantage of the unlimited pop service when purchasing there mugs. We only bought one considering we were mostly on the go the whole time. Now on for the pool area. It is small for the resort but we went during the slow and cooler season so it was fine. I can see how in the summer seasons that it could be a problem. They do have life guards there on site which is nice for small children. They also had a kids pool next to the big pool and hot tubs. The only complaint if any was that the washrooms werent close by the pool. Take advantage of the ferry's to the m.k. Its much faster then taking buses. Bring a sweater for the cooler season! Oh forgot to mention when taking the bus you may not go directly to the park , You might pick up ft. wilderness campsite and grand floridian depending how much the bus is filled. We did do one dinner and show at the aloha. The food wasnt good and the show was average. We paid for 1 catagory and it was with tip 179. for three. Cant complain to much- you get what you pay for. If you are going for a week and have a day or two of no activities I would suggest going to the parks during the week and not the weekends. We noticed the lines were much better in fact we pretty much walked right on. We went during the end of wine week (epcot)and soap opera (MGM) what a nightmare!

The hotel is beautiful and nicely located by the lake. We booked two rooms and asked to have two joining rooms since there were 5 adults and a baby so we can enjoy our stay as a family. The hotel staff told us they don't have any availability although I told them a month in advance and checked in early on arrival date. They appeared very annoyed with the request and didn't bother to spend a minute to even check for us. The following day, the room next to ours checked out and we asked to have the rest of the family moved to that vacant room so we can now have the joining room. The hotel staff (going back and forth with the manager) told me they are going to do maintanence on that room for the entire week so we couldn't have the joining room again. Two hours later, I found out they gave the room to a couple who checked in pretty much right after we were told the room wont be available. I thought we have really asked nicely to have the hotel staff to accomodate us for something that is so easy to do but they went out of their way to NOT make it happen. We have travelled and stayed at many hotels but have never seen such a blatant performance of lying by the hotel staff and the trouble they have to go through to make the stay unpleasant for their guests. I guess at the end, the rooms situation wasn' that big deal after all but I was disappointed at the kind of treatment we received. The rest of the trip was not spoiled by the hotel staff. We enjoyed the different parks and restaurants and will definetely come back to disneyworld again.

We had decided a year ago to do the \"Disney Experience\" and we spent many hours researching to make this an unforgettable trip. We knew we would be spending much of our time at the Magic Kingdom and decided on the Wilderness Lodge for its location and amenities. Upon arriving, the guard at the gatehouse greeted us with \"Welcome Home\" which really made us realize we were finally there! The Lodge lobby is just spectacular being 5 stories and done in rough logs and stone. We had arrived at 8:00 AM so we were not surprised that our rooms we not ready however, our packets with our hotel info and park passes were all set. The staff was friendly and attentive and told us to call back at 1:00 PM to see if our rooms were ready. We could have left our luggage there but decided that we would need some of the stuff for the park we were going to. We were able to get adjoining rooms with bunk beds for the boys that really gave us much more room. We were on the ground floor in the 1000's number and I think these were the best location because you are not far from the boat launch that will take you to the Magic Kingdom, Contemporary (Chef Mickey's), Wilderness Lodge Campground (Hoop-Dee-Doo Review dinner show or from the Roaring Forks counter service. However, it is about a 5-minute walk to the buses that take you to the other areas of Disney so this is something to think about. We had purchased the Disney Dining Plan and I can honestly say that that was the best decision we made. The first night we stayed in at the Lodge to unpack and explore and made reservations at the Whispering Canyon Caf\u00c3\u00a9. What a blast. The food was good but the wait staff was fantastic!! The meal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rushed. The kids had a blast with the stick pony rides, singing and other great entertainment. When the youngest asked for ketchup, he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop laughing for all the bottles that came his way. The Lodge has a large swimming pool that looks like it is at the bottom of a mountain stream with a great water slide. There are life guards at the pool at posted times and plenty of pool towels available. There is a pool bar with frozen drinks and beers available and behind it is a designated smoking area. Smoking is only allowed at two or three outdoor places, pretty much like the parks. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the water geyser that will erupt seemingly on 5 minutes after the hour. We found the Lodge to be well-maintained, clean, staff very helpful and friendly, a unique place to stay.", "Date": "September 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cWilderness Lodge was fantastic\u201d", "Author": "NycEmily", "ReviewID": "UR8841109", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed at Wilderness Lodge for 9 days in late August and had a fanstastic time. Although at first they attempted to give me a room with a parking-lot view, I reminded them that I had paid for court-yard and they gave us an excellent room. We could see the lagoon, pool, geiser and fireworks every night from our room. I would plan ahead by reading guidebooks etc because it certainly made a difference knowing where you were going and what you wanted to do. We planned our days around dinner reservations and then had juice, tea and poptarts in our room most mornings as the food is very expensive. We did not participate in the meal plan because I thought we really wouldnt eat that quantity of food to make it worth while - but in retrospect I think we would have saved a bundle. (One day my daughter wanted to stay at the hotel and play in the pool the whole day. We ordered in pizza, soda, dessert etc to the room - and it cost almost $50. !!!) Otherwise, everything was wonderful - lines were really not so bad - they over estimate the wait (if the line says 20 minutes or less - just go right in - you probably wont have much of a wait at all). My advice - 1) dont rent a car and stay at a disney hotel 2) stay for about 2 days longer than you planned to allow for \"melt-down\" days 3) make meal reservations and plan your days ahead of time and 4) eat breakfast in hotel room when possible.

I have been lucky with staying at what I call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the big 3\" resorts (Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Contemporary, Polynesian, and Grand Floridian Resorts.) This trip, we decided to try Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wilderness Lodge. I was pleasantly surprised on what I experienced. On most Disney World Travel Forums, The Wilderness Lodge is ranked as one of Disney World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular hotels. So needless to say, I had high expectations. Here is what I thought of Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wilderness Lodge. Location: Located in the Magic Kingdom Resort Area in what I think is the heart of Walt Disney World, the Wilderness Lodge is set aside from the other resorts in a wooded area in between Disneys Contemporary Resort and Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground on the shores of Bay Lake. It is in a peaceful setting when you are there, you do not feel like you are anywhere close to the hustle and bustle of the theme parks yet it is so close to everything and anywhere you want to be. Transportation Options: One of the keys on choosing a resort inside Walt Disney World is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel options from it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resorts. Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wilderness Lodge has two main forms of transportation offered by Disney. The 1st is bus service which serves Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fort Wilderness Resort, Downtown Disney, The Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney MGM Studios as well as Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon. Also, at the rear of the Lodge, there are two Ferry Boat options you can take as well. One boat services the Magic Kingdom (Green Flag) and the other Boat services (Blue Flag) Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fort Wilderness Resort and Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Contemporary Resort. This boat is also great because you can connect to EPCOT, The Magic Kingdom, and the Grand Floridian, Polynesian, and The Transportation and Ticket center via Monorail from the 4th floor Grand Canyon Concourse Monorail Station. This is a nice option besides taking a bus everywhere. Lobby: The Lobby makes you feel like you are in a giant Log Cabin. Located in the lobby is the front desk, Concierge, Bell Services, Whispering Canyon Caf\u00c3\u00a9, and Wilderness Lodge Mercantile. The lobby has a giant fire place that has old style rocking chairs where you can sit and relax. Also, the lobby is the start of the bubbling geyser that ends up at the rear of the resort that resembles old faithful. Also, the craftsmanship that went into the wood carvings that are in the lobby are remarkable. Rooms: The hotel is all one building (excluding the Villas which are Disney Vacation Club). The hotel is 7 floors and have dark brown and green colors. We found that the rooms were very nice. All contained flat screen televisions that were set in wood. Also, each room had a balcony with two chairs and a small table. Some rooms had a view of the pool, some had a view of the wooded area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around the resort. Regardless, each view was nice in it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own way. Each room had two sinks (his and hers), ironing board, mini fridge to store drinks, plenty of closet space, and a small table and chairs. All in all, the room was very comfortable with two Queen Size beds each containing 3 pillows each. Maid service was exceptional. Restaurants: Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wilderness Lodge has three eateries on it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property. Artist Point: I personally did not eat here but this is their premier restaurant. (Dress Code) Whispering Canyon Caf\u00c3\u00a9: A home Style Restaurant serving Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Roaring Forks: A counter service restaraunt serving snacks, pizza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, sandwhiches, homemade salads made in front of you and of course, Mickey Mouse Ice Cream Bars! Open Late till 11pm. Gift Shops: Wilderness Lodge Mercantile has everything from Resort Souveniers to Walt Disney World Souvenirs. It also serves as a small mini market for sundries and spirits. Pool Area: The pool was great with a full service pool bar next to it. Also, the geyser from the lobby runs through the pool area to the old faithful in the rear of the resort. Also, there is a beach area on bay lake (no swimming allowed) and full service fishing, boat rentals, watersports etc.. Service: What can you say. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disney! We arrive at 1:00pm and found out that our room was not available. Literally 10 minutes after leaving the front desk, we were in the Mercantile Gift Shop just browsing around and was approached by the general manager of the hotel. Within 5 minutes, she had found us a 6th floor room and were able to check in immediately! What can I say, service was excellent.

We were always too full to eat dessert so we brought it back to our room to eat later. By the end of our stay, we had to throw food away that was left over. We also had 18 snack credits on our dining plan left the last day of our trip. We used them in the bakery and for bottle water for the trip home. The kids loved the pool and the hotel grounds. We saw a lot of rabbits and tons of ducks, and an armadillo. The only problem with the ducks is that they think the pool belongs to them and they defecated in the pool, you would see it floating along beside you. NOT sanitary! We only swam twice during our stay after noticing the duck poop on our second swim. We had two dinners at the Whispering Canyon Cafe. The first night we had a great time and our kids were thrilled with the antics of our server Slippery Pete. They liked it so much they wanted to go again a couple of nights later. We didn't enjoy it as much the second time, I think because our server, although nice, was kind of boring for the place. The boat transportation was great to the Magic Kingdom and Fort Wilderness. The bus transportation to MGM, Animal Kingdom, and Epcot was a little spotty and it took forever to get to your destination on the bus. Forget driving your car, because while the signage was excellent to get to Disney World and our hotel the signs to leave the place left a lot to be desired! It took us 45 minutes to find Wal-Mart with a map! and only 10 minutes to get back! We do not normally have a problem finding our way around either. Overall we loved the place and the service was excellent. We would absolutely stay here again.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC", "Title": "\u201cawsome awsome awsome\u201d", "Author": "disney101Nc", "ReviewID": "UR8348499", "Content": "We arrived at the resort around 12:00.

We loved this resort. We did have the chance to see other Disney resorts and what they had to offer and we still liked ours better. The Grand Floridian was nice, but was too ritzy for us. The Yacht and Beach Club was a consideration in the beginning when making reservations but was $700.00 more--we were attracted to the beach/pool they had. After seeing it I wasn't impressed. I am glad we chose the Wilderness Lodge in the end. At the Wilderness Lodge we loved the pool and the bar next to the pool. They even made a Shirley Temple drink for my 7 year old. She thought she was big stuff. They have a place where you can get clean towels and disgard your used ones for the pool. They also have a beach with chairs and a playground area. The food restaurants were also great. There was a wide selection in my opinion. The Roaring Forks had lots of things to choose from and the price wasn't shocking--it was reasonable for the amount of food you got. The Mercantile shop was great also. You can buy cereal, popcorn, snacks, bottled water, beer, wine, health and beauty supplies and also a wide variety of souvenirs. My girls also loved the dolls/animals the housekeepers made and left on their bed after cleaning our room everyday. All of the theme parks and resorts were very clean!! I've read many different reviews about the transportion---some good, some bad. Overall all I vote good. It doesn't take long to figure out how to get around either by boat, bus or monorail. I would much rather use their transportion than have to drive a car and have to figure out directions and park the car in every parking lot at every theme park as well as other places plus pay for parking.

Had room service in the morning and evening turn-down service as well, which included clean towels and chocolates. We celebrated our 20th anniversary and also received a card and balloons and a button to wear on our shirts. Had a courtyard view room with 2 Queen beds. Very clean. Rooms had been updated since our last stay 2 years ago. Every room now has a small refrigerator, you do not have to request one anymore. In room coffeemaker/hairdryer. Small table with 2 chairs. Flat screen TV. Plenty of drawer space for clothing. Extra shelf storage space now under the 2 sink vanity as well .We traveled with our 2 teenage daughters and they love it here as well. Ate at Whispering Canyon Cafe. Always a fun time there. Plenty of good food and fun. Our waitress, Lazy Suzan, was great. The manager, Jimmy, was a good sport too, galloping around the entire lobby on his stick pony. The chef came out from the kitchen and mingled with the diners. Roaring Forks has an updated menu with salads and sandwiches and wraps along with the standard chicken fingers and fries and pizzas. Be sure to buy the mug if you don't have an old one and get the free refills on drinks. Mugs now cost $11.99 but worth it in cost of the free refills. The maintenance staff still makes the cute animal figures with towels and washclothes along with arranging any of your children's stuffed animals from home. Always cute. Great family hotel. Great honeymoon hotel too. Pool was great. Water warm because it is July in Florida. No surprise. The geyser still blows on the hour. Used the boat transportation to Magic Kingdom and buses to everywhere else. No problems. No long waits. Always got on a boat or bus. Boat staff and bus drivers very friendly. Love this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Also rented the Sea Raycers at the dock for 45 minutes. Always fun out on the water. Children must be 12 to drive but be accompanied by an adult.

Overall the lodge is beautiful and the layout was well thought out. First the bad: 1) At check in I was not impressed with the staff. They were not as friendly and receptive as we have become accustomed to at Disney. While we did receive a free upgrade to our room without asking, the clerk did not give us our parking permit in our welcome packet and wrote the wrong room number down. We also asked to be put on the list for the \"flag family\". She said she would take care of it and call me in the room to let me know what days were available. I didn't hear from her so I stopped by the front desk the next day and she told me that she was sorry that she forgot and all the spaces were now taken. 2) When the bellman unloaded our luggage he said he would meet us at our room in 20 minutes, he didn't show up until an hour later and after 3 calls from us. 3) The pool was fine but the ducks need to go. At first my kids thought it was cool to swim with the ducks but after having \"matter\" expelled by the ducks (you know what I mean) end up on them a couple of times they didn't think it was cool anymore. 4) The Whispering Canyon Cafe food quality was not what you would expect and too loud to enjoy your meal. 5) The Roaring Fork menu was fine but they need additional seating. THE GOOD: 1) The overall theme of the lodge is fantastic. It can be overwhelming at times just sitting in the lobby. The indoor springs and bridge were beautiful. 2) We rarely ever waited on an elevator. 3) The ferry service to the Magic Kingdom is great but be prepared for a wait if you stay till park closing or just after the parade. 4) The rooms were a little on the small size but honestly we don't stay in them much anyway so all in all we found them comfortable. 5) The covered walkway to the bus depot was very nice. 6) There were always plenty of clean towels by the pool and the lifeguards were very friendly and attentive. 7) The rustic setting on the lake is great and you don't realize that you are as close as you are to the Magic Kingdom. 8) It was very quiet in our rooms and we were never disturbed by noise from the hallway or pool. 9) And the best thing about the lodge, believe it or not, was the housekeeping staff. Our room was kept absolutely spotless. We left a note on our pillow asking to have extra coffee and towels left and we were amazed by the quantity they left us upon our return. Our children were left \"towel critters\" 3 of the 7 days we were there. One day we decided to stay in until late. We called housekeeping and asked them if they would delay cleaning our room until 6:00pm and they had no problem at all with it. One of the most impressive things also was that the person who had been cleaning our room all week actually stopped by one afternoon to see if we were satisfied. She also made a point to thank us for the tips we had been leaving her.

I believe they are relying on the atmosphere rather than luxury. We are smokers, soo the new policy of no smoking on property was a killer. there were smoking areas, a rather nice one behind the pool bar. I did not like waking up getting dressed, and walking down to the smoking area to smoke. There are people there, and I do not like talking with people before I wake up and have a cup of coffee and a smoke. Yes people wanna talk all the time you are there. I think a better alternative would be to allow us to smoke on the balconies!! rooms that allow smoking in the room STINK but balcony its outside. The bellman? I do not know what they do there. they seem to be bothered by my questions. Front desk? they were always great and helpful any complaints or advice they were there. concierge? they were always great. Transportation? the boats to magic kingdom were always there without a hitch. the buses ran great the only problem we had was going to downtown Disney. it took a while for them to come. Restaurants? Whispering Canyon was not what I expected at all we were looking forward to the jovial atmosphere, but it was far from that. I was looking forward to barbeque (it was all baked) no bbq. If I wanted all you can eat baked chicken I would have bought a chicken. I think that small children would have loved the little games they play with them. Roaring Forks- cafeteria atmosphere burgers and fries, pizza great for the first couple days. but not good for much longer. Artist Point- absolutely the best mussels I have ever had. my wife ordered buffalo toughest she ever had (it was sirloin) should have been ribeye for the price. they do not tell you that it is sirloin until you get it and try to eat it. I had the filet mignon delicious as any should be. I think that if you are going to eat anywhere in resort eat at Artist Point Housekeeping- Pam our normal housekeeper was the nicest most thorough employee there. we had a problem with the standby housekeeper (Pam was sick for 2 days). We left an envelope on the desk one for housekeeper and one for turndown each a tip. when the standby housekeeper came to clean the room, \"she accidentally took both envelopes\". if we would have not returned before turndown came we would have never known that housekeeping STOLE turndowns tip!!!! we were not happy.. the views were gorgeous the pool was great bunny rabbits lizards armadillos and even an alligator came out to say hello. great escape from the huge city of Philly.

My family just returned from our stay at Disney's Wilderness Lodge from July 9th to July 19th. We planned a long 10 day Disney Vacation for this summer and were really excited about staying at the lodge. This was our first time at this resort and our expectations were high. Disney far exceeded our wildest expectations on this trip! We started saving for this trip back in September 2006 and did the 10 day park hopper w/ dining and water park options. For this extended stay, we really couldn't afford to be too lavish, so I just booked a standard view room. I figured we wouldn't really be spending too much time looking out of the windows anyhow as most of our time would be spent in the parks. We arrived at about 10:30am on July 9th and I got us checked in while my wife and son checked out the Mercantile Shop (gift shop). I know people rave about the lobby of this hotel and I can't begin to describe how awe-inspiring it is to walk into this resort. I'll try, but heck, most of you reading this probably already have the Disney Vacation Planning DVD and have watched it over and over again already. From the minute you pass through the doors in the lobby, you are wrapped in Disney theming. The music swirls around you - as does the blessed air conditioning - and you are ushered into the vast expanse of the most spacious lobby imaginable! Prepare to crane your neck but be careful not to walk into one of the many chairs, coffee tables or other amazed tourists as you gaze about! The lobby is massive and adorned with huge teepee light fixtures - these, by the way, are not cheesy in the slightest! There are two giant totems guarding either side of the lobby as well as the \"Grand Canyon\" 82' fire place to gaze at. Again, as I mentioned, there are plenty of places to sit and relax and just soak in the ambiance or to wait comfortably while checking in. At the rear of the lobby is a bubbling geyser that rushes out of the building, into a creek, turnes into a water fall and ultimately flows into the pool. So, the pool actually begins in the lobby of the hotel! Another nice feature is the heavy Native American theming in decor. It was handled with great taste and attention to detail. My wife is an enrolled member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and she was most impressed with the respectful handling and presentation of Native culture in this resort. None of the war bonnets or jingle dresses in the displays are true Native artifacts, but they are amazing replicas that were produced with impeccable attention to detail. There are several Northwestern Tribes represented in the decor. NEAT STUFF! I suggest taking tour around the lobby and resort during \"down time\" from the parks. There are actually different displays of paleozoic artifacts that would be found in the Grand Canyon on every floor of the resort. Each floor tells about the layers of strata in the Grand Canyon and what types of artifacts would be found in that particular layer. In effect, the fireplace in the Lodge represents 1.2 billion years in the making of the Grand Canyon. Ranger Stan also provides tours of the Lodge on certain days of the week, but these occured at 9:00am so I never took one as I was always in one of the theme or water parks with my wife and son. And now on to check in. I'm a Dave Ramsey fan and therefore had this vacation paid for in full months before we ever packed up the car to leave! Since we arrived so early, our room wasn't ready yet, but Haley was able to give us a business card with a phone number on it for us to call to check on the readiness of the room. We got our room cards, resort information and everything else in about 10 minutes. Check in was fabulous! I was given plenty of information about the parks and about the dining plan and restaurants. No sooner than we got there, we were off to the front of the resort to the bus area and on a bus to Epcot. The bus area was located conveniently a short stroll away from the front entrance and was better accessed through the lobby by the Mercantile store. We waited about ten minutes before the bus arrived and that was pretty much the case for every other bus we took. Perhaps the longest we ever waited for a bus was 20 minutes for one to MGM Studios. However, most buses seemed to be showing up every ten minutes or so. Before I continue...a quick note about the Disney Dining Plan.... DO IT! We saved a TON of money by dining this way and it was more food than we were able to eat at times. We almost never needed to eat breakfast because we were still so full from the day before! I'm not kidding! My wife and I packed chewy granola bars for ourselves and go-tarts for my son and that was all we ever needed in the way of breakfast. With the dining plan, you get a snack, a counter service meal with a drink and a dessert, a table service meal which includes drink, appetizer, entree, and a dessert for each evening you stay. In our case, we each got 10 of each because we stayed 10 nights. Each time you use one of your entitlements, you receive a receipt with the remaining balance left. For instance, I got each of us an ice-cold frozen Coke in Epcot on our first day. That counted as a snack for each of us, so my receipt said 27 snacks remaining. You will really save tons on this option - plus the gratuity is included with this plan and Disney gives the servers 18% gratuity. Just in case you're wondering, the servers treat Disney Dining Plan guests with great hospitality! I think we paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 to add the this option to our park tickets, but in more than paid for itself! Each snack runs about $3.50; our counter service meals for three were about $38.00 and table service meals for my family averaged about $85-$100. Considering we used the plan to dine at Artist Point twice, we racked up about $400 right there! More on Artist Point later, though. After spending several hours in Epcot, we called to check on our room at about 1:30pm and found it was ready. We were given a room on the 6th floor. When I got to our room, we were astonished! We'd paid for a standard view room, but opened the door to an upgraded courtyard view luxurious room! I immediately called down to the lobby to check and see if our room was a courtyard view and was told it was. I thanked the front desk clerk and my wife, son and I took a quick elevator ride down to meet with the manager. Adam was the front desk manager we met with and he was just as nice and polite as he could be. He explained that they \"upgraded\" our room and that they do that from time to time whenever possible. What was amazing was that I didn't ask for an upgraded room. I never thought to and probably wouldn't have because I would have thought it somewhat rude. My whole family thanked him deeply for the lovely room and told him how deeply we appreciated what he'd done. We went back to our room to put away our belongings and within an hour there was a knock at our door. In strode a cast member with an enormous basket of fresh fruit (grapes, apples, oranges and pears), gourmet crackers, cheese and summer sausage! Along with basket was a card wishing us a magical vacation from the entire staff at Disney's Wilderness Lodge! We were just stunned with this treatment, but not long after that, it was time to hit the park again, so we went back to Epcot for the evening. When we returned to our room that night, we found that our room had been \"turned down\" for us. Our beds had been turned down, a towel angel and lamb had been placed on the bed and mints had been left on our pillows. This was a concierge level service that was just amazing. We began referring to this as \"the BEST vacation ever!\" from that day on. From the moment we arrived and were greeted with \"Welcome Home!\" to the last day we left when we had a word of prayer during our Flag Family ceremony with Ranger Stan, everything was simply wonderful....simply Disney! The resort is just amazing. The main pool had a water slide that seemed a bit underwhelming after staying at the Boardwalk and riding the Keister Coaster. However, that didn't seem to matter too much to my son or to any of the other kids that rode it endlessly! The pool was free-form and was very family friendly. There were lots of parents and kids splashing about and having a great time. We never had a problem finding a lounge chair or clean towels. Even though we were there in July during one of the busiest times, the pool never seemed crowded. Lifeguards were vigilant and closed the pool at the first sign of bad weather (i.e. lightning), but were always quick to re-open once inclement weather passed. Aside from the main pool, there was a quiet pool around the side of the main lodge and near the Vacation Villas. It was a nice sized pool complete with bubbling \"underwater springs\". These were quite neat and refreshing to swim in and amongst. Both pools had nice jacuzzis - the main pool has two, as well as a kiddie splash pool for infants. The main pool also has a great view of Firerock Geyser which erupts every hour on the hour from 7am until 10pm. The resort also has a beach area from which you can watch the Electric Water Parade nightly at 9:35pm. The resort also conducts other activites down on the beach, like a water balloon toss! The marina is right by the beach. From there, guests can rent Sea-Racers, pontoon boats, Boston Whalers and also take fishing trips in Bay Lake. The fishing trip for bass, by the way, is catch and release, but we saw several anglers catching some huge fish almost daily! So, if you're a Bass Pro Shop enthusiast, check out booking a morning fishing trip and you'll have a great time. Speaking of docks, the boat launches to the Magic Kingdom came about every 5 minutes. Seriously! We never waited more than 5 minutes for a boat to arrive. One note, however, is that the buses and the boats also serve Fort Wilderness, so many times they stop there next before travelling on to their destination. Since Fort Wilderness is within walking distance of the Lodge, this doesn't add too much time to any given trip. Just be aware for those times when you need to be meeting a deadline (like dinner reservations!). The Wilderness Lodge has lots of activities for little rangers scheduled in the Cub's Den. Our son was too busy in the pool to ever get over there, but we had a list of several activities they offered. Buttons and Bells is the name of the Lodge's game room and, while not huge, it was certainly larger than the gameroom at the Boardwalk. There was a Jurassic Park III game that my son loved to play as well as air hockey. There were several racing games there as well. No real worries with inappropriate games for the kiddies here. The games operate on a card basis, too. You can purchase points that will be put on the card for your child (or yourself!) to swipe. Once the points run down, you can add more at the machine. Pretty neat and it keeps you from having to deal with quarters! For dining, the Lodge offers a few options. Roaring Forks is the counter service restaurant for the Wilderness. They serve a continental breakfast beginning at 6:00am. Regular breakfast is available at 7:00am. Whispering Canyon is a table service restaraunt that also serves breakfast beginning at 7:30am. Both of these serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Roaring Forks has some fantastic ham and cheese, turkey and tuna sandwiches on hearty seven grain bread, with pasta salad as a side dish that I recommend. Of course, they also offer burgers and fries and pizza which they refer to as flatbread. After a few days, the menu will get limited there, but with all the counter service available in the parks, it's not a problem. Of course, you can purchase your refillable drink mugs at Roaring Forks and then use them throughout the duration of your stay. I recommend this highly! My family ate lunch at Whispering Canyon twice. Once was fantastic and once was horrible. The first time, our waitress was a lot of fun. She threw drink napkins and straws up in the air when she brought our drinks. I finished my iced tea (served in a mason jar) in about minute when she first brought it, so instead of refilling my glass, she brought out a 2 liter mason jar of iced tea and put it down on my drink napkin. I'm not kidding! It was 2 liters! It took like five lemons and twelve Splenda to get it just right, but my glass never got empty! The food was great and our waitress continued to whoop it up with us for the duration. From start to finish, we were in and out in about forty-five minutes tops. The second time we ate there, our waiter (Jeffro) was so unbelievably slow. It took over twenty minutes for him to bring our drinks and then another thirty for the appetizer to arrive. All my wife had ordered was nachos!!! From that point on we never saw Jeffro for another 30 minutes until our food arrived. Our glasses had long since been in need of a refill and once the food arrived, not all of my entree was there. I actually had to flag down a bus boy to get some help because it seemed Jeffro kept disappearing to somewhere in the back. He was about as much fun as a wet dish towel and his service was horrible. The food was still good, but it took two hours for us to eat lunch. Our reservation was for 12:10 and we left at 2:05pm. That was the only blemish during our entire vacation and we were determined not to let Jeffro ruin a perfect vacation. After all, it was just one experience of poor service from this waiter. I will most definitely go to the Whispering Canyon again the next time we stay at the Wilderness Lodge, but if Jeffro is my waiter, I'm asking for somebody else! However, the premiere dining experience at the Wilderness Lodge is to be had at Artist Point. DO NOT pass up the chance to dine here. My wife had the Copper River Salmon and it was absolutely heavenly. I'm not much of a fan of salmon, but her fish was so unbelievable, that I cancelled our reservations for the California Grill just so I could book another reservation at Artist Point and order the salmon for myself. Just a note, the Copper River Salmon is not always on the menu. This special type of salmon is usually only available from May to June but they lucked out and had it still in early July. My first meal at Artist Point consisted of the crispy venison spring rolls (fantastic!) and the grilled buffalo sirloin with sweet potato gratin. This was absolutely the best steak I've ever eaten. For desert, I highly recommend the Artist Point cobbler. It is magnificent. The second night we dined there, I chose the Penn Cove mussels for an appetizer and the Copper River salmon for an entree. Again, another magnificent meal! For desert, I had the Coffee Two Ways - Mochaccino bread pudding and vanilla latte creme brulee. It was heavenly. Even though the salmon was out-of-this world, the next time I dine at Artist Point, I'm having the spring rolls, buffalo and cobbler. That was my favorite meal there. Our room was cleaned and ready for us usually around noon. We never came back and found it unprepared. The maid service was excellent! I don't know whether it matters or not, but I did leave a tip daily. We were constantly being restocked with shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soaps. The mousekeeper also never failed to leave a towel animal in our room. This was something we began to look forward to. It was nice to be able to return from melting in the parks around mid-day to find the room ready for us to relax or nap in. The air conditioning was also spot on and kept the room cool enough to create condensation on the balcony door in the morning! Our room came with a small fridge which we kept stocked with gatorades and water. There was also an iron, ironing board, coffee maker and safe. All in all, our stay at the Wilderness Lodge was beyond wonderful. We have decided to make it our Disney home away from home every time we visit Walt Disney World.

We reserved a queen/ bunk bed room configuration with a woods view and were pleasantly upgraded to a pool/ lake view facing the Magic Kingdom. The 3 things we appreciated the most about this resort: 1) Direct boat transportation to/from the Magic Kingdom was speedy and efficient. We never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a boat. The ride was less than 15 minutes to the Kingdom, so if you're down at the dock by 8:30 you arrive with plenty of time to spare before the Park opens at 9. 2) Great private balcony view of the nightly fireworks if you get a room facing the Kingdom and the Electric Boat parade if you have a lake view. 3) Nice pool with fun water slide for the 5 year old. We visited every afternoon when it was hottest and the parks the most crowded. The grounds were well-maintained and interesting with abundant wildlife- rabbits, armadillos, water fowl. 3 minor things which could use improvement: 1) Bus transportation to the other Parks is relatively infrequent (3 times/hr) and SLOW compared to driving yourself. 2) Food quality at the Whispering Canyon was okay, but not impressive. The snack bar sandwiches/ salads on the other hand were surprisingly good. 3) Yes, the rooms are on the smaller side and rather dark with no overhead lighting. And the bathroom sink height is extraordinarily high for a smaller child. But the spot lighting above the beds,sitting table, sinks is perfectly adequate. And we brought a rolling cooler which came in handy as a stepping stool for the little ones to use at the sinks. Overall the room was comfortable and well-maintained. Maid service was good and the room was always cleaned before our return at 1 pm.

Overall, the resort was terrific. The theming of a national park lodge a la Yellowstone was stunning. The pool was a major highlight - each afternoon after a long hot day at the parks, we and our two girls (ages 8 and 11) cooled off in the pool and waterslide. The pool is very large and has an interesting shape with lots of \"areas\" to hang out in, plus two hot tubs and a kiddie pool nearby. We experienced many \"Disney just does things right\" moments. The pool has several huge cabinets with fresh towels - always ready, you don't even need to ask for them. There is plenty of seating throughout the lobby where you can relax and enjoy the atmosphere. The \"Mercantile\" gift shop was huge. The room was always made up perfectly every afternoon. The geysers and mudpots really looked like Yellowstone, minus the smell! We enjoyed the boat rides to the Magic Kingdom and to the Contemporary Resort (we had 2 dinners at restaurants there). The location nearby MK is great. We had a few minor beefs: after checking in via car, our bags were placed on a luggage cart by the valet. After 90 minutes, and no sign of them in the room, the valets were confused and couldn't find them - we were told they were \"delivered.\" Finally 15 minutes later they showed up in the room. The Whispering Canyon Cafe is a blast to eat in and the kids enjoyed our waiter's antics, but honestly the service was terrible. We were seated 40 minutes after our reservation time, after being told the wait would be 20 minutes. The waiter was u-n-b-e-l-i-e-v-a-b-l-y slow - we didn't even get drinks or glasses of water for 35 minutes after being seated. Appetizers were another 30 minutes. When dinner was served, one dinner was inexplicably missing, as was our waiter. After 5 minutes we asked a busboy to track down the missing plate. Still, the kids loved it, so I put on the \"nothing is going to ruin our vacation\" attitude. A warning about boat service. It's impossible to get a straight answer on when service begins and ends, so don't count on early or late rides. One morning we showed up at 7:30am for an early boat ride to the MK. A boat showed up, and the captain said the MK boat wouldn't start running until 8:30 (on an early magic hours park opening day, when MK opened at 8am!). So we rode to the Contemporary and took the monorail to the MK. Another evening, we finished a late dinner at the Contemporary, having been told the last boat left for Wilderness Lodge at 12am. We showed up at 11:40pm on the dock. No boat. We backtracked to the monorail and, on the operator's suggestion, took it to the TTC for a bus ride to Wilderness Lodge. Guess what - at the TTC, we were told bus service was discontinued at this hour. Great. Finally we flagged down a bus bound for Disney-MGM and he agreed to drop us at the lodge. All that said, we'd highly recommend Wildness Lodge. Our vacation was a great getaway and, despite a few \"vacation wrinkles,\" we felt Disney does things first-class.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corona del Mar, CA", "Title": "\u201cOne of WDW's Best Experiences\u201d", "Author": "scottca075", "ReviewID": "UR8040884", "Content": "While I tend to prefer the Yacht Club for a variety of reasons, one of which is it's proximity to Epcot, the Wilderness Lodge is my number 2 pick by a long shot.

The fast food court really needs a menu make over all they served for lunch and dinner were burgers, chicken strips, pizza and stale premade sandwiches and a very small variety of salads. Whispering Canjon is ok, but after a few nights it like eating left overs day after day. A feature daily menu item each evening may help to take away from the regular hum drum selections especially on a 15 day stay. As after day three we make reservations for any table service dining other the Wilderness Lodge. I have been to Disney each year for the last 4 always staying within the community. The only difference from a value resort (pop century 2005) and moderate (Port Orleans Riverside 2006) are a fridge in your room, full service dining and a few entertainment perks. From a moderate to a deluxe ( Wilderness Lodge 2007) are the size of bed from a double to a queen and a patio or balcony. So all in all if you are not spending a lot of time in the resort your best option is a value resort. If you want those couple extra perks than choose moderate as the deluxe really is not woth the huge price. Yes the size of value resorts may call for alot of walking but it is well worth the savings.

It's been YEARS since I've stayed on property, but decided to do so with the addition of the three year old to the mix. The location was GREAT! The hotel is set back, lodged on a lake, a few clicks away from the Contemporary Resort. There are boats that run to the Magic Kingdom (5 minute ride) and Contemporary Resort (3 minute ride). From the Contemporary, you can catch the monorail to various locations. From the Magic Kingdom, you can catch the monorail as well. All Walt Disney World buses run from the resort to everywhere. The hotel has a great, efficient check in service. The room key acts as your room key (obviously), charge card for EVERYTHING in the park, access to the fitness club, etc. The hotel features several pools, one with water slide, two hot tubs, a beach with boat rentals, and a geyser. The three restaurants are VERY different - there is one that is \"family style\" which features the BBQ/Ribs thing at night, the crazy country breakfast in the morning, and a la carte features to go along with the all-you-can-stuff-in-your-mouth fare. Whatever you do, don't ask for Ketchup! The little cafe' down below (Roaring Fork) has the pizza, cheeseburgers, sandwiches, cookies, fruit, etc., and is open from 6am to midnight. The ARTIST restaurant is the upscale white tablecloth restaurant with the $30-$40/head type meal. Note - CASUAL BUSINESS ATTIRE is required for this restaurant. The food, while expensive, is a few knotches above the typical park food. We were there for a long weekend, so it was bearable - I'd hate to eat it for 7 days. There is a Cub's Den where you can drop the 4-11 years off for $11/hour. There's an arcade with video games.. Yes, you play them and charge the credits to your room key - how nice! The fitness center is VERY nice.. All Life Fitness Equipment and Cybex equipment. VERY NICE and VERY INCLUDED. The Merchantile store (gift shop) is very nice and very stocked. NOTE: There is a \"pantry\" in the back with medicines, snacks, grocery items, and toiletry type things. When I say BACK, I mean BACK. The staff was VERY nice and the rooms were VERY clean. I felt the rooms were a bit too small (2 Queens, Bathroom), but I wasn't really in there too much to really care. All the rooms have great flat screen LG televisions with RCA ports on the front.

Below expectations: Our exhaust vent in the bathroom was covered in a thick layer of dust bunnies. The kind that would take a year of neglect to develop. I wiped it down myself with several washcloths and called housekeeping to clean the pile of dirt off the bathroom floor. This did not ruin my stay or even 10 minutes of my day.

Our room was spacious, and the beds were very comfortable. The Health Club was well equipped. The pool area was our favorite. There was one bartender at the pool bar that went above and beyond. Her pool side cocktails were the best! Ask for Johanna if you can! The only 'problems' I could write about would be the funny smell in the halls. I could never identify it, it wasn't bad, just funny. The hotel has 2 sit down restaurants, and 1 'food court'. The food in the restaurant was just ok, and it was pricey. For what we paid, the food should have been better. The atmosphere was great, especially in the Whispering Canyon Cafe. Our kids had a blast. Their food court offered quick food for families trying to get to the theme parks. They need a little more variety, after a while the chicken strips, cheese burgers, and pizzas were tiresome. They should also have more than 2 cashiers working at a time. Sometimes the lines at the registers were longer than the rides in the parks! Transportation from a 'Deluxe' resort is considerably better than at a 'value' resort. The boats to the Magic Kingom were timely, and the walks to the bus stop in the parks were considerably shorter, and the buses came more frequent.

This is a great place for families. My kids love the \"Lincoln Log\" look of the place, the stream flowing through the lobby, etc. It was completely booked with families on spring break while we were there, but it never seemed too crazy or overrun with people. We had a family group of 5 and stayed in a 2-bedroom villa. This was plenty of space for all of us. Master bedroom has a nice 2-person whirlpool tub. Please note (we found this out just the day before our stay!) that the main pool will be closed through the end of March. The smaller pool is still open; we enjoyed it, but it was pretty crowded. Drinks are still available at the main pool's little bar, but you have to walk over and fetch stuff and bring it back. In terms of the Disney transportation system from the Wilderness Lodge, a few things: 1. Magical Express worked great for us -- no complaints or glitches. 2. The ferries to Magic Kingdom and the other resorts took a long time. Allow yourself plenty of time to get places ! Including waiting time, it took us 30 minutes to get to the Contemporary Resort for dinner one night, and it's right next door and the ferry's first stop. 3. With the buses to the other parks (Epcot, Animal Kingdom, etc.) -- again, allow yourself plenty of time! We got there, but it always took us longer than we thought! My husband and I had a drink in the Territory Lounge one night -- pretty mellow, nice selection of single malt Scotches (according to my husband). We used the food court for breakfast -- they have some healthier options available, which was nice (cereal, fruit, skim milk, bagels). My kids went the pancakes & bacon route and enjoyed that, also. There's a few tables outside where we loved eating every morning (newspapers, including the NY Times, are available in the gift shop). I've eaten at the other moderate restaurant in the hotel (not Artist Point, the very nice restaurant), and let's just say that I chose not to return on this trip. Room was always very clean, plenty of towels & nice h20 plus toiletires, and always made up pretty early in the day.

Altogether there were 4 adults and 4 children, ages infant-4 years. The Wilderness Lodge & villas are perfect for families with young children. The Lodge lobby has a stream running through it with a footbridge over the stream. Our 2 year old's favorite part of the vacation, by far, was running back and forth over this bridge. If you have kids and want a little privacy the villa set up is key. Nothing like having a door that closes between 2 sleeping areas...kid(s)can nap in one room and life can go on for the rest of the family. The villas are very quiet, as well. We never heard room noise from our neighbors or even the other family when the room's internal doors were closed. Iv'e stayed in rooms right off the lobby at the Wilderness Lodge proper, and the lobby noise is impressive and will wake up all but the heaviest sleeper starting as early as 0630! Not cool at the time, as I was on a romantic getaway with husband only. It's very nice at the villas to have a full kitchen to store milk, juice etc... or just do a night of Kraft mac-n-cheese. Also utilized room service on several ocassions which was prompt and professional. As always, room service is expensive, but the cost was worth the convenience of not having to convince 3 toddlers to behave for one more sit down meal. A one bedroom villa is perfect for a family of 4 if you have 2 children willing to share a queen sleeper sofa. A one-bedroom villa is significantly less expensive than 2 adjoining rooms at the lodge with more space and more amenities. Bad things? \"magical express\" luggage arrived well after 1 am--although this was within 3 hours, as we had arrived in our room about 11pm. Had to call THREE times to have crib delivered despite requesting in advance and confirming request by phone on the day prior to my arrival. It also took some doing to split the hotel bill (down the middle) between the 2 families' credit cards, but it was worked out before we left.

I'm sad that I can't do that. We were at the Wilderness Lodge from Jan 28 to Feb 4, 2007. I had always wanted to stay at a Disney property but hadn't done so previously due to financial constraints, so this was our big family treat. When we checked in they had no idea that we were travelling with my parents and weren't in adjoining rooms. We have two small children, 2 and 6 months. They gave us an upgrade but it wasn't much help, we were still down a long hall and around the corner from my parents despite the booking for all six of us having been paid for with one credit card (mine). Also, the Magic Express from the airport was confusing, we almost picked up our luggage ourselves until I spotted a Disney agent lounging by a pillar and asked her. We then had to trek back across the airport and wait half an hour for a bus. Our luggage arrived at the hotel four hours later. The day after we got there, they closed the main pool with the slide, and the geyser didn't work. We did swim at the Polynesian instead one day. The bed sheets were cheap and ill fitting, the bottom sheet always comes off. The rooms are VERY small, especially with children. There was also no chair with arms so that I could breastfeed in comfort. The Roaring Forks snack bar is way too small for the daily crowds, particularly in the morning. The food is overpriced and you invariably have to stand in line to pay. Chaos. I thought there would be some perks to paying premium dollar to stay at a Disney resort, but there weren't any. Not even a single Disney character ever appeared in the lobby, and my main impression of the Wilderness Lodge is a crowded noisy lobby. To be fair, we had a very fun trip, but only because of the quick access to the parks. On the positive side, the boat to Magic Kingdom is perfect. We never had to wait more than a few minutes and it's an 8 minute ride. We didn't have to fold the stroller and my toddler loved it. True convenience, and the lake is lovely. The one and only reason I would ever return to the Wilderness Lodge is for the boat access to Magic Kingdom - particularly if my kids are still young. I'd rather stay in a high quality hotel with a great pool, nice sheets, and better access to food, and shuttle in to the parks. How disappointing to be leaving this review. I hope it helps other families with their decisions. The review reflects my true experience.

The Wilderness Lodge, however, was a bit disappointing. The lobby is beautiful, & I guess the pool area is nice, but it was sectioned off for repair work. The beach & pool bar were closed as well. Not a huge deal, but our 5 year old was so upset, & we weren't informed of the closings until about 3 weeks before our stay. We tried to get switched to another hotel, but could not. The rooms were not great, & very small. We had a junior suite, & even it was small. The couch in the extra room (more like a large closet with a small fridge & sink) was made out of some kind of \"pleather\". We found the furnishings to be dark & dreary, & they must not buy any light bulbs with wattage over 60. It felt like everything was cheap. I have stayed in worse hotels, but not for that price. You could stay at a Four Seasons for what we paid. Our suite also came with concierge level benefits (new), meaning we could go to the top floor for snacks, breakfast, etc. It was not worth the money. Every day in the morning they had bland oatmeal, some unsweet fruit, a few bread type items, & very watered down juices. The afternoon snacks were worse, with bowls of gummy bears & crackers. The drinks you could get were only put out at certain times, so if we wanted to get our son a juice box we had to wait until one time a day to find them. They would be taken away the rest of the day. It was almost as if the folks there didn't want you to eat much or were afraid you would take too much with you. Small plates, cups, etc. Problem is you are paying a very high price for all this. They can & should do better. The boats to Magic Kingdom were fine, no problems. Taking shuttles to other parks varied. Sometimes good, other times too long. The Roaring Forks snack bar on the lobby level was not good either. We did enjoy Whispering Canyon Cafe, though. Overall we felt like we were paying a premium just to be on a Disney property, but the hotel is not what you would get elswhere for the price. Problem is, after talking to others who have stayed at other Disney properties, it's all pretty much the same elsewhere. I don't know if I would stay at a Disney hotel again or not. It was nice to be able to buy things at the parks & have them sent to your hotel, & to have the dining plan (mediocre food, but hey, you're stuck with it at the parks).

Our main complaint was with the boat transportation. The buses were fine, but the boats were mediocre at best, and outright awful on two nights. Our main complaint was the boat to get from the Contemporary back to the WL in the evening. One night we waited over 45 minutes for a boat-another night it took us well over 1 1/2 hours to get a boat.

We had a Queen bed and the two bunk beds. We got a pool view room which was great! We got to see fireworks from the Magic Kingdom every night and the lake light show at 9:30pm nightly. The pool was great and it was in the 80's so we were able to use the pool and not freeze. The hot tub was VERY HOT and great to soak your feet in after a long day at the parks. Magic Kingdom was great - we were able to take the boat to it and beat the crowds and parking. A bit long to get home at the end of the night but it was a nice ride. The fun every night was to come back to the room to see the different animal shapes the maids created everyday. One night, we came in and were so disappointed because we didn't see an animal until about a hour later, we spotted a towel animal amongst my daughter's stuffed animals! How creative. The cafe/main restaurant at the Wilderness is great. The waitresses have \"attitudes\" and were lots of fun. We had straws thrown at us, complaints about getting us seconds and they were hysterical when singing happy birthday to a family next to us. It's a must but make sure to make reservations in advance, we didn't and only got to breakfast on our last night. The snack shop is a quick alternative but crowded in the morning when everyone is trying to get to the parks. Prices - expensive but what else would you expect from Disney.

She disappeared in the back (for about 10 minutes), and came back out and gave us a key to our room, presumably with no bunk beds. We got to the room. The bunk beds took up about half of it. Back to the front desk. The same clerk apologized, disappeared in back for about 15 minutes this time, and then told us we had been \"upgraded\" to the \"concierge floor\" and that she was sure we would like our room. We were a little hesitant, but were assured the room would still had the more expensive courtyard view we had reserved. The room was small and about the size of a room in a budget motel. I believe that all the rooms in the Wilderness Lodge are this size, as I've read that their rooms are the smallest of the Disney \"deluxe\" resorts. There was virtually no view from the balcony. Due to a high wall instead of a see-through railing on the concierge floor, the only way you can really see over the balcony is if you are tall or stand on tiptoe or something. So much for the view we expected and reserved. Our special elevator key to the concierge floor would never work in the elevator, which necessitated many trips waiting at the front desk to be rekeyed (unsuccessfully) or escorted to the elevator. There was mold under the toilet seat that housekeeping had missed. The lounge in this resort is dull, for those who are looking for a little fun with their nightcap. We did get a complimentary breakfast in the morning on the concierge floor. There was some other free food at various times during the day, but who is in their resort that much while at Disney? Yes, the lobby was grand, but I suggest you take your money to a different Disney resort. We have enjoyed both the Boardwalk and Port Orleans Riverside. I would like to add that this is a good resort for guests who don't walk to walk far to their rooms, as it is not as spread out like some of the others.

The first room we had was on the ground floor, and was very dark. We asked for a better location, and the following day were moved to a room on the second floor, which was much brighter and overlooked the pool. The rooms are on the small side, but with a queen bed and bunks it was workable for our family. The rooms all have a small refrigerator and a new LCD TV (great for the kids to watch Disney 24/7!) The main casual restaurant, Whispering Canyon Cafe, is good (although a bit pricey, as to be expected) but we found that the constant \"antics\" became irritating (example: at lunchtime, they had a couple celebrating their anniversary see how long they could kiss - in the middle of the restaurant - and they fully obliged. It became truly distasteful. Be prepared for a very corny environment (but kids like it.)) The food court, Roaring Fork, is great for breakfast /lunch and very reasonable. It stays open late for snacks (11 p.m.) and beverages (including beer, which may be a necessity after a day at the park with whining kids) until midnight. It also has an abundant selection of packaged fresh fruit (fruit salad, grapes, etc.) that you can take back to your room (to try to offset your kids' chicken nugget consumption!) The kids meals come with a drink, the entree and apple sauce - mine would not eat apple sauce, and they kindly/repeatedly allowed us to trade it out for jello. The staff at Roaring Fork was very courteous. As for recreation at the hotel, our kids loved the slide/heated pool. But most of all, they enjoyed playing around on the sandy beach (you can't swim in the lake, but they have tetherball and some playground equipment out there) and renting the \"Sea Raycer\" boats, which don't go as fast as a jet ski but are safe and very fun. On the topic of boats, the Wilderness Lodge is definitely the way to go if you will be at the Magic Kingdom for more than one day. The ride over takes about 10 minutes, and is so peaceful/relaxing. The lake is really pretty, and the whole experience is stress-free (compared to the buses and the monorail - where people are clamoring to board.) The buses can take FOREVER if you have more than one wheelchair (which is common.) Also, one of the bus drivers closed the door before my 3 year old was off the bus - and his leg was trapped in the door! You have to take the buses to MGM, Animal Kingdom Kingdom and Epcot, but on Magic Kingdom day the boats are a delight. We had an early (7:20) breakfast at Chef Mickey's (Contemporary) and we caught the 6:45 boat over to the Contemporary Hotel, as the sun was rising. It made our morning (despite the early hour!) Also, the hotel has a nice game room for kids, and the lobby is simply amazing.

Buses to Animal Kingdom, Epcot, MGM, and Downtown Disney were great too; the wait was never too long. We had dinner at Roaring Forks a few times; it has a great selection of sandwiches & burgers. My daughter usually got the chicken nuggets. Free condiments available are: peanut butter, jellies, honey, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and lettuce & tomatoes during lunch & dinner for burgers, etc. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a microwave and toaster available for use.

First, I paid extra for the \"courtyard view\" which they know darn well means that everyone expects to be overlooking the waterfalls, pool, and lake. Instead they had us staring, in disbelief, at a sidewalk and the side of a building. You also had to navigate a bizarre maze just to get to the elevator that takes you down to the room!!! I said \"no way\", and promptly asked for a new room. They obliged me, but the new room wreaked of tobacco and smelled really funky. My second beef is that EVERYTHING was being refurbished. There was literally construction everywhere inside and outside the hotel. An entire section of the hotel's \"courtyard view\" had a tower of scaffolding going all the way to the top. The bubbling spring inside the lobby that flows down to the pool was also entirely boxed off for construction. To not mention all of this to customers purchasing packages is inexusable and is, lets face it, a total misrepresentation of what you are purchasing.

The terrific ambience and reception at the resort is exactly as many have already mentioned.First, when booking through Disney when you arrive at the airport you are greeted by Disney reps who hustle you fairly quickly onto the Disney bus. Thats where the \"experience\" begins. There is a continous video running on the bus for the 30 short minutes it takes to get to the resort--Wilderness lodge was first stop, yes! Checked in early at about 2.pm and stayed on the 5th floor Courtyard view. Rooms and view were just fine. Flat screen T.V was a bonus and had plenty of Disney stations to view. The location of the resort is excellent. You can use a combination of boat, monorail, bus to get anywhere in the kingdom in an efficient manner. In terms of food, we ate at Artist Point which is both expensive but very good. Roaring Forks had a cafeteria style menu that was suitable for light lunches, breakfasts and snacks. Off site we dined at Californias which is at the top of the Contemporary and a must do. They provide expensive delicious food that when combined with a late sitting provides unparalled views of the Fireworks at night. The atmosphere is loud and gregariuos/fun. If quiet is your thing, do Artist Point. Ate at Bomas, a buffet at Animal Kingdom lodge. Great feast to be had. Good unique foods but enough of the same old, same old to keep the kids happy. Other fine restaurants are located at Epcot so make a point of having your dinner there that day. Back to the lodge, Very good fitness center and also a store in the lobby where you can buy beer/cigs if necessary. 6 packs of Bud were $11.99. For smokers, while smokes are not displayed they are in a drawer under the counter at most resort stores. I dont think you will find any in the parks, so prepare. The pool was excellent and Poolbar had a good selection of fancy drinks and beer/soft drinks. The beach is nicely groomed but you cant swim in the Lake. Rented the little speedboats which thrilled the kids. Sat them on my lap to let them \"drive\" for a bit. As for the Parks, you know the drill, drink lots of water and be patient. Use the fastpass and you cant lose. Disney Quest was very good for my computer savvy kids. Top notch technology. Ate at Bongos a Cuban restaurant there as well which was fun and had good food. Another themed event to attend is the Luau at the Polynesian. The show is terrific and is all you can drink of wine and beer. My fears of the waiter not making his rounds disappeared as I sat and watched him drop another, then another drink in front of me. Therefore, if desired you can get your monies worth. If you go to the Luau, make sure that everyone has there bathing suits so when you do the monorail loop to visit the Poly, Contemporary or Grand Floridian the kids can try all the different pools and of course, slides. Boardwalk is another fine stop. You might go there after visiting MGM...it is only a short boatride. A lot of action and another chance to check resorts in that area. Ate at the ESPN bar. Dont worry, it is not only for jocks. It is well themed for family. They had video games on T.V,s to play at the booths. TV,s everywhere including bathroom stalls and the best darned wings outside of Buffalo. Overall, our decision to stay at W.L was excellent. Great location, atmosphere and as compared the rest of the deluxe resorts it was the best value. Remember, days at the Parks can be long so at the end of the day you are just not at the hotel enough to justify spending more in other spots.

They upgraded our room as soon as we got there. The only warning I can give you is that to not expect your bags within 2-3 hours like they say. We arrived at 3 pm and utilized Disney's Magical Express. Our bags did not arrive until 11:00 that evening. so what ever clothes you need bring them with you. Except for all the liquids, like my contacts, was stuck on my check bags. Overall we had a great time at Disneyworld. We bought the bride and groom mouse ears and it seemed like everywhere we turned someone was yelling \"Congratulations!\" and giving us free fast passes or letting us cut in the long ride lines. It was really wonderful. Everyday we would come back to the hotel in the afternoon and have cute little towel animals. It was so cool. and then in the evening they would turn down our beds and leave us chocolates on our pillow. Oh yeah, and the first day we arrived, we received a knock at the door and in came balloons and a lovely card and picture from mickey and minnie congradulating us and it also had their autographs! Our overall stay at the wilderness lodge was a great one. The whispering canyon cafe was great we had so much fun! We are definetly going to return to the wilderness lodge next year. The food was wonderful and i definetly recommed the dining package it saved us probably 300 dollars. Hope everyone's stay was as wonderful and magical as ours!", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Home Away from Home\u201d", "Author": "Madborred", "ReviewID": "UR5767250", "Content": "The Wilderness Lodge is a great Hotel because of how comfortable it makes you feel. This is the most welcoming of all the Disney accommodations after a long day at the parks. My wife and I stayed at the Wilderness Lodge from Aug 17-25 in a courtyard view room on the 6th floor. The room had been recently renovated. The bed posts are new and updated and there is a new widescreen tv in each room. I was really happy to see this because if Disney wants to call these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotels they need to keep up with the times and it is good to see that they are doing so. The hotel is beautiful. This was my third time there and it is still just great to sit out on the balcony and lose yourself in the surroundings. The pool area and Bay Lake is set up so picturesque, and the abundance of trees can actually fool you into thinking you are in the wilderness. Unless you go in August when it is 95 degrees. The people who work at the Lodge really do seem to go out of their way to help you. After the first day, whenever I returned for valet parking the attendants always referred to me by name. When my mother in law and brother in law checked in they both received a free upgrade from woods view to courtyard view rooms without even asking. We ate at the Whispering Canyon three nights and the Waiters and Waitresses were always friendly and very attentive. The downsides are as follows though: 1)There is no room service from 12pm-4pm. That is a huge gap in time. And if you go in the summer you might want to seek refuge in the middle of the day. 2)The pool is too small for all the people at the lodge. 3)The bus transportation is set up really bad. Sometimes they go to the campground first and the bus comes packed already. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we rented a car. All in all this is a great hotel. There is only one Disney Hotel I would prefer and that is the Dolphin. I say this because my wife and I are in our late 20s without kids and the Dolphin is more adult oriented. The Wilderness is great though if you want a comfortable place to stay that still wraps you in all that Disney.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cHome Away form Home\u201d", "Author": "cshelkin", "ReviewID": "UR5766087", "Content": "Okay - I have a lot to say.... We haven't been to Disney for over 20 years and decided to take our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter for her fist trip. Wilderness Lodge was a perfect spot for us. We got a great hotel deal through Expedia & great flights through United/US AIR. It was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153VALUE\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd season. I compared prices to stay at Disney through the discounted broker (Expedia) with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Package\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you have to buy through Disney. It was a better deal for us with a largely discounted room price without having to purchase the meal deal they offer when you buy the package. We were there eight days and did not use the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meal deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at all and saved money. You have to purchase the meal deal for all the days you are there. We were there 8/26 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 9/3. We got to the resort at 7:00pm (after dinner and left at 8am after breakfast.) We would have had to buy the meals for the TWO days we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even there all day = $160.00. Just do your math to see if it works better for your family???? The atmosphere is incredibly serene, unlike the frenzied and chaotic Animal Kingdom where we had dinner reservations one night at Boma and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until we left. I must say that buffet was so disorganized! Food at Boma was good quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but very frenzied. There are boat rentals, bike/paths, walking/running paths, and is also close to Fort Wilderness by ferry with more entertainment like the Hoop-dee-do Review Restaurant , the famous evening bbq and the lil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 petting zoo. We had room 1168 (considered a lake view) and we were close to the ferry & bus transportation, pools, pool bar, and caf\u00c3\u00a9. We easily walked through the pool area from the caf\u00c3\u00a9 and the short-cut was welcomed rather than taking the elevator and walking through the halls. It was a peaceful environment for a toddler that was out-of-routine, off of her napping schedule and in a strange place. This is a typical Disney atmosphere where happiness and helpfulness is contagious. The grounds were characteristically Disney, well thought out, spotless and really seemed like you were in the west with appropriate landscaping. 1.It has an expansive split-log lobby-lounge area that is warm and friendly and had soothing water trickling through to the outdoor pool ending with a geyser that shot up every hour that represented Old Faithful. This was actually helpful to know how long we were at the pool! The lobby has to be at least 7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 8 stories high with more than enough seating areas, including a cluster of extremely comfortable rockers in front of a significant fireplace. 2.Restaurants: Artist Point (dining) I would say this has unique, high quality, extraordinary food. I had a portabella mushroom soup, to die for, and an incredible vegetarian dish that was unique and tasty, unlike the usual pasta & marinara dishes that I would be offered for a veggie meal. It was filled with vegetarian pot stickers, lentils and an assortment of other leafy vegetables and beans. My husband, being a carnivore, ate a filet that melted in his mouth. Whispering Canyon was a fun filled breakfast/lunch and dinner experience for the family that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking for a bit more excitement, fun and games. The guests are the entertainment, so if you want to be unnoticed don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there. They do have and all-you-can-eat option. There was so much food served that our grandaughter always ate from our portions that were more than enough for one person. Roaring Forks was our daily stop. This was a low key serve yourself, family-type environment. They have a microwave for popcorn, (we brought some from home having read a review earlier) a cupboard full of fresh fruit for sale and single serving cheerios and other breakfast treats. They serve, burgers, chicken, pizza, breakfast croissant sandwiches, bacon & eggs platters and great biscuits. I actually ordered a child size breakfast platter for myself every morning and it was more than enough. ($3.99) They also have a re-fillable mug you can purchase for $10.00 & have all the coffee, soda and fruit juice you want during your stay. This clearly paid for itself the second day! This caf\u00c3\u00a9 is next to the pool, so we would fill-up often. Also, they have free peanut butter, jelly, honey & crackers which made breakfast, snacks and lunches easy for us some days. We all love peanut butter! We purchased bagels, whole wheat bread, (but you can easily bring a loaf of bread) some fruit and enjoyed some inexpensive meals. They also have a wonderful yogurt bar with fresh fruit to make your own yogurt parfait. They have food crafts as well. One day, my granddaughter decorating cookies with the other children. 3.Pools: They have three pools and three spas. The kiddy pool (0ne foot deep) was large and was never crowded, the larger pool (5ft.) had a bit more people, but still never felt crowded with lifeguards walking the edge and incredibly attentive. It also had a water slide with a lovely constant mist filling the area. Our favorite pool was the Hidden Springs Pool that had at the most six people at a time! It had spa like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bubbles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in three areas. It was woodsy and very private, close to the villas. They also had great crafts for the kids and were always helpful and patient with the little ones. The pool bar was located about 30 yards from our room and I must say, I think that location was ideal for my husband. The lifeguards left at dusk but the pool was open 24 hours\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 my favorite! I was a bit concerned, but, I never heard people in the pool or at the bar when I was in our room ...on the first floor. 4.Rooms / Room Service & Housekeeping: The room we had was ...not so big, but we did have a small balcony with two chairs & a table that we could see through the trees to the evening light & music show every night. The room was kept clean and an adorable towel-sculpted animal was left for my granddaughter every other day. They do provide many pillows in the room and extra blankets and a porta-crib. We had two Q beds. Room service trays need to picked up more frequently from the hallway. They were often overlooked for hours. 5.Transportation: Location is everything! The ferry to the MK, Contemporary, Fort Wilderness & Polynesian were wonderful. It took about 8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 15 minutes and a lovely ride on the lake. The ferries were always there within 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 minutes. The buses to the other parks were another story. The Animal Kingdom, water parks & Downtown Disney bus took at least 35-50 minutes to get there. There were so many stops along the way! One thing to know: if a bus isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coming within about 15 minutes, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a phone that is at the stop that you can call the transportation center to find out when one will be there. I must say, however, once we got to where we were going, we forgot about the long bus ride\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6quickly. 6.Disney Magical Express\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I always take a change of clothes & bathing suit, medications and toothbrush in a carry-on when I travel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I did it this time as well -our luggage took about 3 hours, to get to our room. Having a stroller with us and other toddler needs\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was a pleasure not to worry about the suitcases. We had a good experience. 7.Character meals: This is well worth it for lil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ones - especially Cinderella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Table. Not only was the food great, but my granddaughter saw Cinderella, Snow White, Belle, The Fairy Godmother and Princess Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)! This is much better than waiting in a line for an hour to see one character. Chef Mickey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Buffet was paramount. The food, again, for a buffet was adequate\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. along with Micky, Minnie, Pluto, Chip, Dale, Goofy, and Donald D visiting every table, it was well worth the smile on my g-daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face. Desserts to die for! 8.Laundry facilities: They do have many washers and dryers for those who would like to freshin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 up. They have a change machine ($1 & $5) and soap machine. I put some powder detergent in a plastic bottle before I left and had more than enough for three washes. I threw three loads in before I went to sleep, changed it before breakfast and had it done after breakfast. 9.Sea World from Wilderness Lodge: I hired a driver for a round trip from W.L. to Sea World from Sunray Limos 1-800-204-4355. They never came. When the owner heard, he personally picked us up at the lodge and took us. We called him an hour before we were ready to leave the park and Bob, the owner, personally picked us up again and would not let us pay. I insisted he let us pay and he was just adamant about giving us this FREE service as his company made a mistake and he wanted to be sure we were satisfied and had a nice vacation. I would say that he had the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disney Spirit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd also! Okay, so overall, I would definitely return to W.L. \u00e2\u20ac\u201cour new home away from home!", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Place to Stay at Disney\u201d", "Author": "kkinne", "ReviewID": "UR5711699", "Content": "From the minute that you enter the impressive lobby at Disney's Wilderness Lodge, you realize that you are in a very special place. My wife and I traveled with our young children for a quick get-away to Disney's Magic Kingdom and are so happy that we chose Wilderness Lodge for our hotel - even at the $210/night price tag. We highly recommend it. The front desk staff, decked out in traditional western outfits, greeted us with smiles and said \"welcome home\" and the hotel certainly makes you feel that you are home in a grand Rocky Mountain Lodge. We then heard the dinner bell at the Whispering Canyon restaurant (that overlooks the lobby) and got a real kick out of the waitress shouting (for everyone to hear) \"Come and Get It\" so we decided to try it. We were not disappointed. In fact, our kids rated their dinner at the Whispering Canyon as one of their highlights of the Disney trip. The wait staff is friendly and lively. The western BBQ food was incredible. We ordered the all you can eat special and they kept coming back to give us as much food as we could eat. We were the first to ask for ketchup and sat there amazed as they delivered 20 bottles of ketchup to our table. We then had to deliver the 20 bottles of ketchup to the next table who asked for it. The kids rode toy ponies around the restaurant as the adults waved their napkins in the air. Everyone was smiling and having a good time as the kids became actors in the restaurant's unique interactive dining experience. In addition to the great feeling that the hotel creates, you cannot beat the hotel's proximity to Magic Kingdom. In less than 10 minutes, you can get from the hotel's boat dock to the Magic Kingdom via a very nice ferry ride. The ferry runs frequently, so you don't have to wait long to catch it. That gave us ability to spend several hours at the Magic Kingdom in the morning, return on the boat to give the kids a chance to cool off in the pool during the hottest part of the day and then return to the Magic Kingdom at night via ferry. In addition to Whispering Canyon, the huge lobby and proximity to Magic Kingdom, the best parts of this hotel are, as follows: (a) rooms are clean and comfortable; (b) the pool area is amazing with a fun water slide; (c) the beach is beautiful with white sand and the feel of a tropical paradise; (d) staying at a Disney hotel gave us the option of early park hours so we got to a number of the attractions without any lines in the morning. If you are looking to save money during your stay at the Wilderness Lodge, you should: (a) park in the free self-park area instead of spending money on valet parking since both lots are the same distance from the hotel and it is a very quick walk to the parking lot; (b) with the heat in August, our kids were thirsty all of the time, so we repeatedly filled up our water bottles for free at the Roaring Forks Snack bar using the self-serve soda fountain; (c) we resisted the temptation to purchase Disney t-shirts and other souvenirs on Disney property. Instead, we found a nearby Wal-Mart that had a large section with Disney licensed products and paid half the price. Perhaps the best recommendation about the Wilderness Lodge came from numerous people that we met there who had stayed at other (more expensive) Disney hotels and told us that the Wilderness Lodge was the best of any of them.

We were again given an ugraded room from the standard view. This time to a woodsview, last time we had a waterview of the Villas pool and in the distance through the trees, Bay Lake. They have recently been remodeling the rooms and this was needed, as the previous decor was original to the hotel. Therefore, the rooms are fresh, new, and impeccably clean. The staff leaves cute towel animals nightly for the kids and and maintain the room to exceptional standards, but are only average in terms of responding to requests (i.e. we never recieved a response from our mousekeeper after leaving notes and asking in person to get us the bedrail we requested upon check-in). Our kids throughly enjoyed the bunk beds and I loved the new flat screen tvs as part of the rehab. The rooms here are average sized, you can certainly find a larger room off grounds for less than the $220 a night, but you are paying her for the serene surrondings both in and around the lodge, not to mention the boat service to Magic Kingdom, beach front property, kids playground, awesome swimming pool w/ slide, hot tub, spraying geyser, nature trails, bikes, Watermouse personal boats, restaurants, store, arcade, firework views acroos Bay Lake, and the Cubs Den kids area. Whispering Canyon is a hoot of a restaurant, especially if you have kids in the 4-13 age bracket (or if you're still are young at heart and you know you are or you wouldn't be a Disney now would you?). For a romantic/upscale dining experience, Artist Point is not to be missed. Drop the kids off at the Cubs Den for an hour or two and have a nice dinner or at least one of their exceptional desserts with your spouse, you won't regret it. I highly recommend advance reservations for both restaurants. Roaring Forks snacks is ok, but nothing to write about. Nachos, pizza, sandwich, etc...Refillable mugs for soda for around $12, great if you drink a ton of pop otherwise skip it. The lobby here has got to be the most impressive of all in the Orlando area running neck and neck with Gaylord Palms Resort (Animal Kingdom is a close 2nd) at five stories. Tipi chandeliers, floor to ceiling totem poles, floor to ceiling fireplace, cozy rockers, and couches, even a river flowing out of the lobby out of the back of the building waterfalling toward the pool. Bus service from here is mediocre at best, but the ferry boat to Magic Kingdom is top notch. Also, hop the boat to the campground and catch the Hoop Dee Do dinner show (but call way in advance for this as it sells out quickly). While I've never used it, they do offer valet parking, as well as concierage services for guests on the 7th floor.

The resort is immaculate. Pictures do not do the lobby justice - it truly is amazing! We stayed on the 7th floor (concierge level).

Room - just renovated - very clean. There are refrigerators in all of the rooms. Cool flat screen televisions. Pool and outdoor areas are pretty. The \"ok\" stuff: Rooms are small - we were expecting this - but nonetheless - they are small! The tub & toilet area - REALLY small - room to stand in and dry off. Rooms and bathrooms are dark - there just isn't enough lighting. Plumbing - there seems to be issues with drainage and hot & cold water. The pool water was cloudy - and in the mornings there were lots of ducks swimming in the water - yeuch. Concierge level - this would have been great except they close at 10:00 pm (before most guests return from the park). When we really would have liked to have sat down for a snack and drink they were closed. Because we spent most of our time at the parks I don't feel that the concierge upgrade was worth the $100+ per night as on most days it was only available to us for breakfast. Disney Dining Plan - now that was a deal! We ate our table service meals at Boma (the best meal we had at Disney), Coral Reef, Ohana's, The Grand Floridian Cafe, and Hollywood & Vine. I highly recommend Boma and Ohana's. Coral Reef was good and geat with the aquarium view but the service wasn't up to par. Hollywood & Vine was nice because the meal came with reserved seating to see \"Fantasmic\" at MGM. Overall - we would visit the Wilderness Lodge again - no concierge and definitely would purchase the Dining Plan as we feel we got our $$'s worth (and it was nice not digging into our pocket's all day)!

My complaint was the bathroom of our room. It had obvious mold and very thick dust on the vent over the tub. With 2 small children I would get up about 5am to shower and get ready for the day.

I would like to add it always had been prior to this visit. An elderly wheelchair bound relative was with us as we waiting for the bus in line and the bus driver curtly commented..are you getting on this bus?..which we clearly were and proceeded to state that we should have told him right away. He mumble something and just made this relative feel bad. The cafe was great for a fast breakfast or afternoon lunch and Artist Point restaurant was fantastic. The final straw was a maintance man yell at my 3 year old son not to chase the ducks as they are a protected wildlife animal. My son was 3 and I was not allowing him to run wild or leaving him unattended but this was uncalled for.

We trekked back, got new keys, hiked up to the room, still did not work.

All that aside, I loved the location of this lodge. We took the boat to Magic Kingdom and the bus service to and from the other parks was pretty rapid. You need patience for Disney World ... there are always lines. The bus wait was the least of our issues. The lodge is beautiful inside and we enjoyed the pool one night. Although I didn't get to physically visit the inside of the other resorts, I liked the location of this one; close to the heart of everything. The rooms were fairly clean (I found a few items on the floors near the bedside table that mousekeeping had not removed from previous guests) and we had a refrigerator which we used for the water and juices we brought with us, plus takeout desserts on nights we couldn't eat ours at table.

We all loved the Wilderness Lodge. We had a deluxe room on the first floor. It had two queen size beds, a pull out bed in a couch in another room, twin sinks outside of the toilet, shower area , a wet bar with a refrigerator under it, a small private porch through sliding doors. We had two T. V's, one in the bedroom and one in the second room. We could close doors between the rooms, even sliding doors to close off the bathroom area. We could all have our privacy when needed. There was a table big enough for four to eat on. The beds were very comfortable, the staff was very friendly and tried to make our stay as pleasant as possible. I ordered groceries on-line from Goodings grocery and they delivered them the day of our arrival. We ate all of our breakfasts and snacks and also some lunches in the room. Since the food in the parks and the hotel is pricey, that helped our budget quiet a bit. We ate at the Whispering Canyon restaurant and Roaring Forks counter service in the hotel. They both served good food, but a little on the pricey side. We found that to be true throughout the Disney World properties. The Whispering Canyon had a fun atmosphere that the kids enjoyed. They got to ride stick horses around the restaurant and sing with the staff. The staff also would joke with the customers quite a bit. My daughter asked for some mayonaise and they brought out a five gallon container full of mayonaise. Don't eat there if you are looking for a quiet meal, it's not for you! The lobby was breathtaking, be sure to spend time looking at it closely, the details are great. You can find places to sit on the upper floors surrounding the Lobby. I found a quiet place to sit by a fireplace one early morning while the rest of the family slep in. The kids loved the pool. The water slide was attractively done, going around boulders. There were two hot tubs side by side that my husband and I enjoyed one evening. The water was not too hot, which we have found to be the case at other hotels. My daughter loved the smaller quiet pool around the corner from the big pool, it was surrounded by trees and had one hot tub, but no slide. The transportation worked out very well. The buses were easy to figure out and ran every few minutes. I think the longest that we waited for a bus was about 15 minutes. We enjoyed the boat transportation to the Magic Kingdom. It was a short ride and relaxing. The boats ran pretty regularly too. We only waited a few minutes for a boat most trips that we made on them. The only down side to our trip was the credit card like keys to our room that also acted as our tickets to the parks. We had trouble using them in the fast pass machines to get a special time for the rides. Out of 5 cards, we had trouble with all of them. We had to turn them in at the front desk each day of our trip to get new cards issued when they quit working. At one park, my husband's and my card would not work to get in. We had to step out of line and have them make new cards for us right there. The problems with the cards were very time consuming and I plan to write a letter to customer relations concerning our problems with the passes.

I had done months of researching on the internet as well as making calls to disney to find a quiet hotel to stay at that wasnt going to be under major refurbishment or construction. Before I made reserv. , I spoke directly to wilderness staff on phone as well as disney and they assured me no construction going on. Staff told me I needed to book the more expensive room (courtyard) instead of standard or woodsview to ensure a more peaceful room(away from service entrances,e tc. When we checked in, something was already not right. (took 45 minutes to check me in - also had problems getting my dining plan and park tickets to me) Before I made my request known again theywanted to send me to animal kingdom lodge(overbooked here) I said no that I had 4 year old and most of our time would be spend at MK and that why we booked here. I also reminded staff that I wanted as quiet a room possible, and was there any construct going on. They said no and put us on 5th floor far right wing over pool area. A few days into our stay we started coming back to room for a much needed nap, only to find drilling, jackhammering,, buzz sawing, etc right above us. called front desk and they seemed nonchalant about situation. the elevator wouldnt go up to 6th floor for some reason so i decided to walk up the stairs to see what was going on. THE WHOLE FLOOR WAS BEING STRIPPED AND RENOVATED (MAJOR CONSTRUCTION) Needless to say i was beyond LIVID after spending a total of $4,000 for our vacation to be on a construction site. I spoke with a manager who said he would take 10% off. at first i agreed to this but when the last morning came, the one day we didnt have to get up ata 6:15 to get to park early and wanted to sleep in, we were rudely awakened at 7:20 am by electric saws and hammering. I complained again and they took 25% off. I'm still really upset bc many of the disney staff directly lied to us and apparently by the looks of things the renovations had been going on for awhile. ON a different note, pillows and beds were great (but shins were banged up from bed corners) room was a bit run down but adequate quality for what little time we spent there. 4 year old liked vintage disney shorts on tv adn he loved the pool area and watching the bunnies eat in the gardens. whispering canyon had good service and great food(super cornbread) 5 minutes or less on bus to MK- about 25 minutes by boat. Using bus to epcot was about 20 minutes bc of stop at fort wilderness and 25 minutes to MGM and AK. Had to time buses right in morning - sometimes had to wait 15 minutes, sometimes 5-10 for a bus. Longer wait when waiting for bus at the parks to return back to lodge. ROom walls were kind of thin bc we could hear baby crying next door to us and people talking. Housekeeping pretty decent-when I called and said the housekeeper didnt replinish the coffee, the sent up a whole bag instead of just one. They also left my son animal washcloths each day (and we tipped a couple of bucks each day for this). Went during grad night weekend-dont really recommend this bc we could hear fireworks at 12:00 and 3:00 am at MK. Roaring forks cafe was pretty good and mercantile was a really neat place to shop but food was pricey there. (might want to bring your own cereal or bagels and keep in room for breakfast. ) Airport check in from hotel was very swift and convenient. OVerall, if you want a quiet place to stay I don't recommend it, or if you expect better quality than a holiday or days inn I don't recommend it.

We stayed for a long weekend at the WL on the Concierge floor and were lucky enough to be upgraded to a honeymoon suite. The Concierge floor was great - essentially there were snacks and drinks available throughout the day, which was a great treat in between comings/goings. It should be noted that some guests treat this privilege as if it is a restaurant, which is NOT meant to be. The floor was large with many areas set up for eating, resting or tv viewing. Our room was not huge, but it was clean and comfortable. One night there was a roach inside the bathroom drain trying to climb up from the drainpipe, but we flushed it back with water and had no further problem. We had a small balcony from which we could see the fireworks at the Magic Kingdom each night. The openness of the lobby can really carry up all of the noise below, so we were pleasantly surprised at how quiet our room was. The bed was comfortable enough and there were plenty of pillows for a change. Also included in the room were a small wall safe, refrigerator, its own temperature control (NOT motion detected), and a ceiling fan. The hotel itself is beautiful, very large and well done. Although the hotel was crowded, it never seemed overly so. The pool was warm and again, though crowded, not unbearably so. There is a small soft sand beach with chairs overlooking the waterway, which is near where you can catch a boat to the Magic Kingdom. We ate at the Artist Point restaurant on our last night. The food was really good, though our waiter was incredibly unattentive. Our dining experience would have been nearly 45 minutes less had he actually we remembered we existed. Hopefully you will have better luck because the food is worth checking out. As always, the best perk about staying on Disney property is the use of Disney transportation and not having to worry about driving/parking. The most we waited at the hotel was 5 minutes for a bus and 15 minutes at the park for a return bus. If you are interested in a deluxe resort, definitely give Fort Wildnerness a try. Our last experience at a deluxe resort was at the Contemporary and it was so awful we vowed not to waste our money.

We usually go for weekends and stay in different hotels. This last weekend, we wanted to go to the Epcot Flower & Garden Festival, so we stayed at the Wilderness Lodge. First, let me say that if you have the opportunity to be at Disney for the Flower & Garden Festival, you should not miss it. I don't have a green thumb myself, but I can live vicariously through those who do. The park is filled with beautiful flower towers, floating gardens, character topiaries and gorgeous flower \"carpet\" designs. It really is a sight to see. The Wilderness Lodge is jaw dropping as soon as it comes into view. I am originally from the Pacific Northwest so I think that log cabin architecture is wonderful. The Lodge itself looks like a huge log cabin with a green tin roof. When we pulled up to the front, a very helpful bellhop opened our car door, invited us into the lodge and whisked us away in the elevator while telling us all about the Lodge. Great customer service. We were lucky enough to stay in the concierge level this time and it was fun to be pampered. The rooms of the lodge are all similar, but the concierge level has a lounge that serves food and beverages pretty much all day. That was a treat. The room itself was fairly small but we never stay in our room anyway. The beds were comfortable, and the drawer and sink space was enough for our things. The best thing about the hotel is the lobby. You can stand in the middle and look straight up, 7 floors. The balconies look down to the main level and it feels like you could sit inside at one of the cozy nooks and watch the snow fall (except it's Florida!). The staff at the Lodge are very friendly and helpful. The pool is amazing, though a little crowded. It was fine for our family, and it wasn't like you were running into people, but if you want a pool to yourself or you really intend to swim, this is not the place for you. We had a sandwich at the Roaring Fork and it was the best sandwich I have had in a long time. My husband had a ham with Tillamook cheese and I had a turkey and brie. They were about 4 inches high! We got to take a boat every day to the parks which was a fun option and at about 9:35 pm, there is a light show on the lake that we could watch from our room. The landscaping on the property is beautiful, with wildflowers and pine trees, plus a river and waterfall that go right through the center. There were even rabbits eating grass on the lawns. I would not have been surprised to see a moose! Overall, this is the best Disney hotel we've stayed in and we will definitely go back. The rooms at the Disney resorts are all pretty much the same (2 beds, a shower, a television), so it's the theming and options that you pay extra for. We have paid extra for a few hotels (savannah view at the AKL, river view at the POR, but this was the only hotel that we didn't feel like what we paid for was totally above what we received). This is a great place to stay and it's the lowest priced resort in the deluxe category. If you have the money to pay for the concierge option, you should do it...it is a fun treat. We usually don't splurge for accomodations when we go on vacation, prefering only the basics (a good bed, a private shower, a place to put our clothes), so we don't go to these hotels with huge expectations. I have read reviews from other readers who play dumb games with the housekeeping staff, leaving something to see if they clean it. There are also those who expect Four Seasons treatment and are upset when Disney doesn't provide it. Disney goes to great lengths to provide a fun, safe place for families to vacation. If you look for something to complain about, you will find it, but I can't imagine why you would bother. If you have a bare-bones budget, you can stay at one of their basic hotels, if you have money to burn, you can stay at the Grand Floridian. For those of us in the middle who just want a good place to stay with a little extra theming and convenience, The Wilderness Lodge is the place for you. Yes, it's expensive if you compare it to hotels outside of the Disney property, but to save a little money, you will have to find your own way to the park, find a place to park, remember that you parked in the Bambi section, and then fight the crowds all the way out of the parks at the end of the day. We took a relaxing boat ride to and from the Lodge whenever we wanted. When we got to our room, there was a towel animal on the bed.

The hotel and grounds are amazingly well designed and the attention to detail is fantastic. The grounds and pool are truely beautiful, with lovely views onto the lake, giving the setting a really relaxing feel. The lobby is amazing to look at and really hits the mark is envoking a genuine lodge feel. While it was little corny, the geyser which erupts every hour was fun and seemed to be a hit with the kids. We had no problems with noise which I've read some people comment on. Our room overlooked the lobby and we had no problems in sleeping and didnt pick up any noise at all. I found the staff at the Wilderness Lodge to be very friendly and helpful. We received a complimentary room upgrade when we checked in (without even asking for it!!). Staff at the store and also the restraunts were also very friendly and were lovely to deal with. The room we stayed in was a little smallish given the hotel's tag as one of Disney's 'deluxe' hotel's (note we also stayed at Pop Century over the course of our stay and we believe our room at Pop Century was bigger than the one we had at Wilderness Lodge), however we were able to see the 'Wishes' fireworks display at the Magic Kingdom from our balcony which was sensational. The room was nicely appointed and housekeeping did a great job each day in cleaning and tidying the room. The hotel has three eating areas: the 'Roaring Forks' snack bar which has take-away style food, 'Whispering Canyon' cafe, and the 'Artist Point' restraunt. Most of the time we ate at the Whispering Canyon which had generally good food at fairly reasonable prices (for Disney!). The Whispering Canyon was great however the staff were sometimes very boistrous in entertaining the guests which at times became a little tiresome. After some (very) long days at the theme parks there were times when we really just wanted to have a quiet dinner and relax, and the rowdy entertainment of the serving staff was sometimes a little unwelcome. From the looks of a few of the other guests I'd say we werent the only ones who felt this way, and I think that the hotel would be well advised to tone it down a bit after say 9pm when most of the people we saw were couples who had popped the kids to bed and were looking for some quiet time... The Wilderness Lodge is very close to the Magic Kingdom, which can be accessed by either boat (our preferred way) or by bus. The Animal Kingdom, Epcot and Disney/MGM studio theme parks are all a little further away however at the most we found the bus trip took no longer than say 15 minutes. Buses run frequently and we waited at most no more than 10-15 minutes for a bus to arrive and usually 5-7 minutes. All the transportation options were really convenient and the drivers very friendly and helpful. On a spare day I took some time out to get away from the theme parks and had a look at some of the other hotels. In my opinion the Wilderness Lodge, the Animal Lodge and the Grand Floridian were the best looking of the hotels I saw.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "walworth ny", "Title": "\u201cMy Favorite Disney Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "julie88", "ReviewID": "UR4624631", "Content": "I've stayed at the majority of the Disney Hotels, and a few of the Delux resorts.

Last year I stayed at the Poly and I will say that it is a better hotel. However, the Wilderness Lodge was about $125 less per night this time around, so I thought we'd give it a try. I called ahead with specific room requests based on a tour book. When my husband checked in late one evening he was told we got a room upgrade which sounded good, but the walk to the room was very far. The balcony was too high for my kids (5 and 3) to see over it unless they stood on a chair. The partial lake view was very distant and to the side. We should have asked to move but by the time we unpacked and walked out the balcony it seemed like more trouble than it was worth. As the week went on though the walk to the lobby and pool aggravated me more and more. The room was quiet, smaller than the Poly, but reasonably attractive. The lobby is very nice and the restaurants seem good although we never ate there. My major complaint is the people that work at the Wilderness Lodge. At the poly they greeted us with leis and everyone seemed very nice and went out of there way to say hello. At the Wilderness Lodge they didn't seem as friendly and the concierge at the front desk was especially disappointing. I asked for a print out of my dinner reservations and I noticed the one for a certain day was missing. I inquired about that and was flatly told I don't have any. When I explained I had the reservation number he told me that would help, come back downstairs. Well, I already told you about the walk, so I asked if I could call Disney Dining instead. Well, I did and waited on hold forever (that is sometimes a problem when you call on weekends) so frustrated I called the front desk. I explained the concierge told me he could help with the reservation # and to connect me, but instead I got an attitude. The person told me they can't help and I should call Disney Dining, which I explained had already put me on hold forever. A couple other times I called concierge. One time in response to a message asking if I got everything I needed from my visit to their desk. When I tried to call then, and another time, I felt like I was getting the 3rd degree trying to explain why I should speak to concierge when I wasn't on a concierge level. I think they didn't understand I wanted the front desk concierge and not the \"special service\" but who feels like explaining yourself this much? Throughout the stay, I felt I was getting Holiday Inn service and not Disney, and my husband said he felt the same way during his conversations. I think the attractiveness of the lobby, the convenience of the boat to MK, and the pool all make this place worth considering. But, carefully study the map of the complex before agreeing to check in and try to check in early. That way, if you have a distant room closer ones are available. Also make sure you ask for a balcony you can see through, like the ones overlooking the pool.

I had looked at all the pictures of the Lodge beforehand, but they just don't do the lobby justice. It was breathtaking. We had to wait in line for about 5-10 minutes to get checked-in. We asked when we checked in for a room with bunk beds. Not only were they able to accomadate our request, they also had a room available right away. We were very surprised since it was 10:30 in the morning! Our room was on the 4th floor all the way in the back. We had a great view of the pool as well as the lake.

We were very pleased with the transportation that was provided by Disney. The boats were great and we never waited more than 10 minutes for a boat. However, if you are going to any of the parks other than the MK, your best bet is to take a bus. We tried taking the boat one day to the Contemporary and then getting the Monarail to Epcot.

There are boat rentals, bike/walking/running paths, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situated by Fort Wilderness (several ways to entertain yourself over there), a great pool and pool bar\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 oh, and there are those Walt Disney World parks located close by\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 No, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no monorail stop that will get you to the Magic Kingdom here, but, there is a boat and bus that will take you to it.

If you fear being in the spot light, do NOT go here. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a GREAT time. Artist Point, delicious and elegant). So, I thought it was time that I pass a long the things I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned. \u00c2\u00b7 There are TWO courtyards at the Wilderness Lodge, main pool courtyard and villa view courtyard. Make sure you are aware of this if you book a court yard view because you could get either. Both are nice, I would recommend REQUESTING a higher floor\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Do not be upset if you go to your room and it is a view not of the main pool, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a first floor villa view. This is still considered court yard. \u00c2\u00b7 Disney Magical Express\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 sometimes, not so magical\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I recommend taking the shuttle service, but if arriving in the evening, grab your luggage at the airport on your way to the hotel. Wait time for your luggage as of now, 2-3 hours, give or take. During the day, who cares, let someone else get it to your room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming in late, very inconvenient. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grab your luggage, make sure you have a separate bag to take to the hotel with PJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, toiletries, medications, and what not. Other than that, this is a great service to get you and your luggage to and from the airport and hotel. \u00c2\u00b7 Bunk Beds\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 ok, you request bunk beds, you check in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a room with bunk beds\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened to me once. All I can recommend, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell the kids about the bunk beds. If your request is met at check in, let this remain a surprise. \u00c2\u00b7 Connecting vs. Adjoining Rooms: If you make a request for either room type make sure you understand the difference, connecting rooms are the rooms with the door in between, adjoining rooms mean that there is no door in between, but the rooms are next to each other. \u00c2\u00b7 Dining Reservations: If you make dining reservations at other resorts or theme parks give yourself lots of time to get there if you are depending on Disney transportation, at least 45 minutes to an hour. No resort buses go directly to another resort, so you will have to catch a connecting bus at one of the parks or Down Town Disney to get to another Disney resort. \u00c2\u00b7 Disney Dining Plan: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GREAT\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 if you like lots of food. The plan is based on a coupon type system connected to your reservation which includes one snack, one counter service, and one table service per day (more expensive places will cost you two of your coupons, but, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it if you look at the receipts). This plan goes by how many nights you will be staying at the resort. Very, very good. Ok, in conclusion, I believe the most important thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned while staying at WDW resorts: NOTHING IS GURANTEED. Even though you may say it a billion times when making reservations, it is NOT GUARANTEED (bed types, smoking/non, connecting, adjoining, floor, anything, NOT GUARANTEED. Unless it is something for medical purposes, just make this obvious when making reservation). However, still make the requests for the room you want and they will do their best to meet those requests with what is available. Trust me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned from experience. Once all of this stuff is out of the way, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have an absolutely wonderful time eating and playing in the parks\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 like I said, AMAZING resort\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I will always, always return to the Wilderness Lodge.

The trash was not picked up off our floor and our room was not even remotely straightened. I was also less than impressed with our room location.

This is a \"deluxe\" resort and as such you would expect clear and fast rules on booking and accommodation types.

It was late so we settled for that arrangement. The ground floor turned ut to be below the lobby level, the courtyard view was of a path leading from the villas to the pool and the disabled bathroom was little more that a tiled space with a plastic seat and a hose!.

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is truly a magnificent place. We had booked two standard rooms but were upgraded to two Woods view rooms on the 6th floor. We had a terrific view of the lake and the beautiful grounds below. The hotel employees were exceptional as was the housekeeping staff. The guest rooms are spotless. The beds were the most comforatable queen size beds that I have ever slept in in any hotel as were the pillows. All linens were sparkling clean. The housekeepers made us little animals out of washcloths complete with eyes, nose and tails and left them on our beds.We always were given plenty of fresh towels. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere is very serene so it is a nice place to return after a day of park hopping. We ate at Roaring forks every morning for breakfast. It is a counter service restaurant but they manage to pack so much food into a small place that there is a wide variety for everyone. Artist Point is absolutely superb for fine dining. Try the frisee salad and the salmon. The pool area is beautiful --- you will find a duck or two swimming with you from time to time. We saw rabbits on the grounds and even an eagle flying overhead. The hot tubs are great. The only disappointment was that Silver Creek Falls were being repaired so the water falls were not runnng and the creek that runs through the lobby was not filled with water. The bus service was excellent. We never waited longer than 5 minutes for a bus from our hotel or from the parks for that matter. The Mercantile gift shop is great--they sell very nice merchandise and they also sell food and toiletries. There is a nice game room for the kids. They do have laundry facilities with 6 or 8 washers and 10 or so dryers. The change machine and soap machine is right there too. The best thing about this hotel is that everything is conveniently located. We went from 6th floor to the lobby (elevators ran extemely fast) and everything we needed was right there. Unlike some of the moderate resorts we have stayed in like Port Orleans and Carribean beach where we had to walk to many different buildings to buy food or find a bus stop. There is also boat service to Magic Kingdom. We went over to the Yachtclub for dinner at the Yachtsman Steakhouse (which was also superb!!!) but I wasn't very impressed with the Yachtclub.

Our problem was finally solved when we contacted a guest relations \"expert\" at the general Disney reservations number. We had connecting rooms which were clean and on the small side (but I was already expecting that from reading previous reviews). The rooms didn't seem particularily dark like I had read before, but the hallways sure were. It's like walking along the hallways of a dungeon! The housekeeping staff was great!

Yes, it's kind of expensive for the food that you get but we appreciated the quick dining---especially at breakfast. We also went to Whispering Canyon for lunch and while my husband and I enjoyed our food, our kids certainly did not like eating here. They couldn't understand why the waitress kept yelling, threw their straws at them and tried to take their sweaters. We kept saying, \"It's like a show--it's just a joke\" but everyday after that they kept asking \"We don't have to go back there again, do we?\" We also ate at Artist's Point for dinner which again was quite pricey but the food quality was superb and the atmosphere was quiet but not stuffy---the kids enjoyed their meals there, too. Just some extra things that we did that you may want to consider: I took my two daughters to the My Disney Girl Princess Tea at the Grand Floridian---it was just truly wonderful! Very expensive---prepare for a sticker shock---but it was the ultimate Disney Princess experience----everything about it was top-notch. We also happened to stumble upon a great way to see the Fantasmic show at MGM. We called Disney dining reservations looking for somewhere to eat at MGM and the agent suggested eating at Hollywood and Vine using the \"voucher package\". Basically, you end up eating at a weird time (our lunch/dinner was at 3:30 p.m.) and then the restaurant gives you a voucher that you use to get into a special entrance to see Fantasmic. We arrived about 45 minutes before the show started and we sat five rows from the front. We eliminated getting to the outdoor auditorium 1 1/2 to 2 hours early (as the guide books suggest to get a seat) and we ended up with really great seats in addition.

We arrived late at night and were very tired. Checking in was somewhat slow considering we were the only ones there at that time. Our room was on the sixth floor, which was great, but it was a very LONG walk from the elevator everytime we went out and back. The hotel main floor is beautiful and the corridors are nicely decorated, but the room was very disappointing! Granted you don't expect to spend alot of time in your room at Disney, but it was very crowded with just four of us in there. The bathroom was very small and dark, and the sink area was done in black so it also was very dark and small. Everything looked very dated and worn. The balcony had a nice view, but was also very small, and you had to stand to see off of it. The pool area was beautiful, but very small, crowded, and obviously designed just for small children, so we used the pool at the Villas which was another longer walk, very plain, plus there is no amenities there for food or drinks! The Whispering Canyon Restaurant was \"cute\" the first couple of times you were there, but then got on our nerves that you couldn't enjoy your meal without wondering when you were going to be singled out by the wait staff to be made a spectacle of in front of everyone. Early mornings or after a long day out is not the time to be harrassed by waiters who want to poke fun at customers. Didn't like that at all!!! Not a good variety of food either. Roaring Falls offered food that was just ok, and it was crowded, dark, and expensive for burger-type food or cold cereal. The best deal there was the refillable mugs! The travel to the Magice Kingdom, etc. was convienent. We never had to wait very long for a bus, and the boat rides were timely and relaxing. We had to find out from someone at the pool about getting the special passes for the two teens to stay at the MK after hours. This was the best $12 apiece we spent on the trip! They loved it! The park at night is pretty neat and they got to ride the best rides without waiting in long lines!! Really good deal!! Overall we weren't very impressed with the hotel other than it really is a beautiful place to look at. Because we had two teens, we really wished that the pool area was larger and more fun for them.

I was a little worried that I had not called ahead, because of some previous reviews (i.e. Whispering Canyon Cafe's noise levels) but it was not a problem, because the restaurant was muted at best...we only heard it as we passed through the lobby. I guess if you are in a room adjacent to the lobby it could be an issue. The room was also large and clean, and the mini-fridge was delivered promptly with a quick call to housekeeping. Now only one complaint...housekeeping. We left a nice tip on our first and second days in hopes of receiving the famed \"little creatures made out of handtowels\" and got nada. Very disappointed about that, but otherwise, housekeeping was very conscientious of our \"do not disturb\" sign when it was up, amd even left a message telling us to call for a special cleaning if needed when we were ready. Nice. Another favorite part of the Wilderness Lodge was the boat ride over to the Magic Kingdom or the Contemporary (depends on where you are going). It was very relaxing and a great touch.

We've been visiting the WDW resort consecutively for the last 4 years and tried different resorts. The one thing that stands out of this hotel is that it's a HOTEL. Not a MOTEL. We've stayed at the Caribbean Beach and didn't like the walk to the main building just to get beverages, or go to the pool. At the Wilderness Lodge you are staying in a hotel. You take the elevator up & down to your room. The grounds are beautiful! We had a woods view room with a balcony which was very refreshing after a long day in the park. In the evening we could see the Castle from our room along with the fireworks which my daughter loved. As far as tranportation we had no problems. There is the boat launch that can take you to the Magic Kingdom which is very relaxing and I believe the boats come every 20 minutes. There are buses that take you to Epcot, MGM and Downtown. Its not a far walk to the boat or to the buses. Dining is great as well, especially for kids you have to visit the Whispering Canyon. The staff interacts with the kids which is quite amusing. My daughter really enjoyed it, its not over priced probably average. Artist point is more pricey and there is also a cafe for fast food. Cleanliness: Our room was clean, no complaints whatsover. Activites: Plenty of things to do. Boat rentals, bike rentals, arcade, walking trails, etc. We rented a bike and rode to the Ft. Wilderness Campground. We also rented a boat. I would most definately recommend staying in this hotel especially if you want everything under one roof and not have to leave your \"motel room\" to go to the main building for something to eat. The other resorts are nice but don't compare to the Wilderness Lodge. Every other resort is similiar to a motel. We've enjoyed it so much that we are going agin in Feb. 2006.

It is pricey, but at off season times and with a AAA discount we could splurge for a night. Given the price you would expect something more upscale, but that is not found in Disney - resorts are pricey based on their convenience to the parks. So a \"deluxe\" resort is simply one with a few extras and easier ability to get to a park. If you want fancy/upscale check out the Ritz Carlton or Peabody outside of Disney. I have heard that the Dolphin and Swan are slightly nicer than the typical Disney resorts and are still on Disney property, but I don't think they're that upscale, either. Disney's focus is on families and children, so don't expect luxury. That said, the Wilderness Lodge is a nice place to stay regardless of whether or not you have kids. It is good for people who want to have the sense that they are staying inside the Magic Kingdom. Yes, it is a hokey Disney theme, but Disney is good at making fun, hokey themes. The rooms are solidly 3 star - beds are reasonably comfortable, and bathrooms well-maintained and conveniently set up (i.e., 2 sinks located outside the toilet/shower room so that several family members can get ready at one time), and rooms are not big but adequate for short stays. Despite overlooking the pool area, our room was quite quiet, and I believe that is due to the soundproofing used for the outside door (there was some outer hallway noise, so that door is not that soundproofed). One of the best features of this resort is that it is an easy and quick boat trip to the Magic Kingdom, which makes life so much less stressful if you intend to go to that park. There is also an electric light parade out on the water at night in front of the hotel. We took a (free) boat out to the Wilderness campground to check out the petting zoo and horses, which might be something fun to do with kids. There is a small beachfront on the lake, children's playground, and watersport rentals. The pool area looked nice, and included a children's pool separate from the main pool (but they were in close proximity), however it was smaller than I would have expected of a resort of this size. I did like that the resort was not as sprawling as some of the other resorts. Our room was pretty distant from the lobby, but it never took more than 5 minutes to get there, and other than the villas the rooms are all contained within one building - in some of the resorts the separate buildings are so spread out that it is either a 15-20 minute walk or a tram ride to get to the main lobby. There are a lot of nice public areas in which to hang out, and we spent some time lounging by a fireplace in a 3rd floor nook. We did not try the restaurants, but did go to the gift shop which had some reasonably (for Disney) priced provisions (cereal, snacks, sodas, etc.) if you need to stock up.

I am writing the review about the Lodge itself, along with the Villas, since we mostly utilized the amenities of the main Lodge. Surroundings: First, to be fair, I knew going into this that Disney is pretty much a \"manufactured\" environment. In some cases, this can lend to the \"magic\" of the experience. But in the case of the Lodge, it was too much, and bordered on creepy. Everywhere you go at WL you are subjected to man-made and orchestrated environment. From the canned \"adventurous\" music playing continually poolside, to the recorded sounds of crickets at night. I suppose I am more of a naturalist..I grew up in upstate NY in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains. I love nature, but not necessarily the manufactured kind. Everything from the \"geyser\" to the \"spring\" that feeds the pool is faux. And looks it. I can, however, see how young children could find the esthetics appealing. Our children, ages 14, 12 and 3 found it intriguing. The lobby of the Lodge is beautiful with towering timber columns, totem poles and grand arts and crafts style chandeliers/seating. The Lodge was consistently cool and refreshing temperature wise. Staff: The staff at WL was essentially hit or miss. We found the valets to be friendly and very helpful. The concierge was unavailable on numerous occasions, so the desk clerks filled in. On one occasion, a female clerk looked at me like I was from Mars when I inquired if there was a place to shop like Kohls or Target nearby. (Off Disney property.) She finally begrudgingly tossed directions to an outlet mall my way. Perhaps she never ventures away from the Lodge? The other irritating moment was at the Whispering Canyon Cafe when at breakfast the staff shrieks at the top of their lungs \"KETCHUUUP!!!!\" if you should happen to ask for that particular condiment. They are attempting to rouse their captive audience in a down-home \"YEE-HAWW!\" manner, but it comes across as loud and obnoxious during times when the restaurant is nearly empty. Dinner was a whole other experience. Bring your valium. Now, don't get me wrong, I love to have fun...But after a long day in 96 degree heat and humidity at the parks, the last thing I wanted was to be subjected to loud, crass \"shows\" but the restauraunt staff that implored us to stand up and do the hokey pokey, form a train, etc. numerous times during our meal \"or else.\" Add to that waiters who slam their tray tables on the ground as they walk by (to mimic horse's hooves?) and more shrieks of KETTCHUUPP!!, etc. (Annoying to the point where other diners were \"sneaking\" condiments to other tables in order to avoid the yelling.) and you have a recipe for a splitting headache. Heh. And bring your wallet. Entrees average about $20/pp. Pool/Beach: The pools were crowded, but nice. The water temp probably hovered around 90 or more. Not too refreshing. But there was an outdoor shower with cool water available. (It was a lifesaver.) The beach is a strip of sand with lounges, but there is no swimming allowed in the lake. Bacteria counts too high? I had no idea the lake would be off limits. Pity. The boat rides to the Magic Kingdom were slow enough to see the sights along shore (other resorts, etc.) but quick enough to get you to the MK in a timely fashion. Villas: We found the 2 bedroom villa to be spacious and quiet. However, there was a layer of dust on everything and the carpet was dingy/dirty. The tap water smells strongly of sulfur, and was even BROWN when I turned on the jacuzzi jets. ICK. Taking a shower, it was evident Disney resorts do not have soft water. Nor do they have decent water pressure. The water flow from the shower was little more than a drizzle. The kitchen was well equipped with dishes, utensils, even a dishwasher. But bring your bottled water fro drinking/making coffee. There are also washer/dryer units in each 2 br Villa. Bathtowels are small, so consider bringing a beach towel or 2. Adequate? Yes. Worth $500 a night? NO. I can't help but wonder if the economy and moderate resorts might present a better value. This is the gist of my review. Our experience was not \"bad\" per se..But I expected more from an alleged \"high end\" resort, and for the price we paid. I suppose being so close to the Magic Kingdom was our payoff.

The Wilderness Lodge overly exceeded my expectations. My family of 6 just returned from the Disney Wilderness Lodge last week and had one of our most memorable vacations at Disney. We decided to try a 2 bedroom villa and we could not have been more pleased with our decision. We have been going to Disney for years and have stayed at the Contemporary, Grand Floridian, Port Orleans-French Quarter, Old Key West and Coronado Springs but the Villas at the Wilderness Lodge outshines them all. The lobby is breathtaking and amenities are outstanding. Upon check in we were greeted by a very friendly valet (\"Welcome Home\") who took all 13 of our oversized bags happily from us and placed them in storage as our room was not available when we checked in. At check in, the front desk person was very pleasant, smiling and helpful to us. As we arrived early, our room was not ready but we were given a number to call to find out when it would be ready and that we could keep our luggage in storage while we were in the parks. The front desk attendant went over our complete package for us in great detail and offered lots of information about the parks and activities and even wanted to re-print my husband's room card as his name was spelled incorrectly. This was no problem to us at all but she wanted to make sure everything was just right for us. We wanted to go out into the parks after check in but needed some items from our luggage and the valet could not have been more helpful in getting our luggage out of storage for us. At 3:00 pm we called to check on our room and it was ready and we were able to go ahead and have items we purchased sent over to the hotel. The only problem we encountered was when we returned to the hotel late that evening from the parks we needed to have our luggage brought up to the room. There was only one valet working at that hour (11:30 pm) so it did take a little longer than we would have liked to get our bags as we were ready for bed. But we completely understood as there was only one person to do the job. We called again and our bags were brought up and the valet was very apologetic for the delay. Our room, where do I start. It was fabulous! We had more than enough room for my husband and I and our four children. There was a very cozy kitchen with dining bar and table, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, toaster and nice dinnerware. All that we could want. We also had a washer and dryer (with detergent included) that came in very handy. The master bedroom was huge with a very comfortable kingsize bed, armoire with tv, balcony overlooking the woods with a bathroom that was wonderful. A jacuzzi tub with a window that opened up to the bedroom with seperate vanity and huge closet, the shower (big enough for 2) and toilet and seperate sink were connected to the other part of the bathroom by a door which came in handy while one of our children wanted to take a shower or use the restroom while I was getting ready at the other sink. The living area had another balcony, a comfy pullout queen sofa with an armoire and tv that connected to another bedroom with two very comfortable queen size beds with another tv armoire and large bathroom with seperate vanity from tub/shower and large closet. It was like being at home. The decor of the room was very tasteful, new and cozy. We loved staying in the room as much as going to the parks. We spent a day at Blizzard Beach and decided that our pool resort was better because there were no lines or crowds and we decided to leave and go to the resort pool. Ended up wishing we had spent the entire day there. The restaurants at the resort are wonderful to. Had an incredible dinner at the Whispering Canyon Cafe and good lunches and breakfast in the Raging Fork near the pool area. We could have spent an entire day just enjoying the Wilderness Lodge and all of the amenities there. There are loads of hidden Mickey's to look for in the lobby, a huge store with great stuff, a warm spring that runs from the lobby to a waterfall that flows into the pool. We checked out and then stayed at the parks until late and came back for our luggage. When we left late that night there were crews with cherry pickers dusting the huge totem poles in the lobby and cleaning crews cleaning everywhere. You will not find a cleaner resort anywhere. Our room was also very clean each day and well stocked with towels and soaps. Our maid even took the time to make Mickey and Minnie out of towels dressed in our bathing suits we had laid out. The kids loved it, even our older kids (15 and 12). If I had to say it has a downside it would be that the boatride to Magic Kingdom can take longer than the monorail and there is one stop for Fort Wilderness on the way. But I have stayed at both the Contemporary and the Grand Floridian with the monorail and I can say that I would be willing to take a longer boat ride for a stay at the Wilderness Lodge.

When we first arrived on the property of this resort, we were amazed at how large it was. The lobby in itself is massive and beautiful too. But, my first complaint was on the service at the front desk. The gentlemen who checked us in was rather unfriendly and seemed to not even want to be there. He informed us our room wasn't ready and gave us a number to call to check to see if it was ready. We spent some time looking around inside and outside. Both being wonderful I might add. Everything is beautiful, the landscaping, the lake, the pool, etc. When we finished we decided to check the number and they said our room was ready. It was close to the store that is by the lobby. We weren't happy at all with the location. It wasn't at all what we requested 2 or 3 times before we left home. Also, we walked into this room and it hadn't even been cleaned.

There is a boat to Magic Kingdom (which drops you off right at the entrance, not the Trans. and ticket center like the buses do) and the Contemporary and buses everywhere else. We never waited long for a bus either. Artist Point is excellent. The Duck Confit salad was possibly the best thing I ate all week, and we went to many restaurants. The food at Roaring Forks is also good as is the room service. I have never stayed on Disney property before but after staying here I would never stay off-property again.

We've stayed at the WL the 4 times in the last 6 years. I thought it would be a great idea to post a comment from a young adults point of view. The hotel is great for not only children but teens too. If you are considering the WL and have 2 teens, a boy and girl especially, the hotel offers rooms with a queen bed and bunk beds so there are no sleeping arguments. You have to ask for the bunk bed rooms when you arrive. The hotel may not place you in that room the first day you are there but normally will the second day. The main pool with the water slide is typically filled with children but the pool by the villas is more quiet alternative. The main pool offers free towels, bar, and hair wraps-$1.50 per inch plus the cost of beads. Another great teen attraction are the small speed boats that you can rent at the docks. The great thing about the boats is you have to be 16 with a drivers licence to drive the boats so kids arent out on the lake doing irresponsible things You can also drive the boats near the Magic Kingdom and the surrounding hotels. The boats for an hr are about $35 but they also offer a family pkg for your week stay for around $230. Whispering Canyon is a great restaurant for children of all ages. I had fun there at age 20, but my cousins also did at 10 and 13. The unlimited skillet meals-breakfast and dinner are wonderful and fulfilling and milkshakes have free refills!! Our server made all of us hats out of bandana napkins and was very out spoken/going. Some of the servers are more outgoing than others just to let you know. For teens and older teens the boats to the magic kindom and the buses are great forms of transportation if you want to leave the park early while the rest of the family stay at the park. Needless to say, this hotel is a wonderful place to stay. The four times we've stayed there we have never had a problem. It's a great hotel if its sunny and if its raining because its all inclosed so you don't have to walk outside like you would at other resorts.

We arrive early or stayed late at each to try and get the feel of these other resorts for future reference. Nothing truly compared. The Contemporary came closest to being as open, well groomed and will proably get one visit from us in December as a test. The Grand Floridian seemed way too stuffy, including the staff who seemed to be doing us a favor by answering our questions. The Polynesian, while apparently having the best beach at WDW just seemed old. I can't really put into words the entire experience. My wife and I are 42 and we traveled with a 7 year old and a 2 year old. Every person at the WL treated us as if they had been waiting just for us.

The pool at the resort was really nice- the water was comfortably warm so you didn't get that stinging freezing feeling you usually get when you first step into the water. check-in/out fast super speedy - It was very convenient that we could check in for our American Airlines flight AND check in our luggage right there at the hotel.

Secondly, the rooms are somewhat small, but the balcony adds enough room so that you can get some needed alone space or send the kids out there to eat. Overall, the room condition was okay/good, about the level of a Marriott Courtyard, but the lobby and pool and grounds AWESOME, and make up for lack of luxury. We didn't eat much at the WL, but the snack bar was convenient and not very pricey at all, plus you can take your food and eat at the nice tables right outside. The one place we did stop in for dinner one night at the lounge/bar outside Artist Point, and it was a really good idea. They have a big TV, couches and lots of tables, was kid friendly and EMPTY! the food chioces were minimal, but we the Wings were great, and the boys loved the cheese pizzas. Also, take advantage of the food section in the back of the Lobby gift shop--their selection was excellent and all the rooms have refrigerators, so we were able to get 1/2 gallon of milk, some adult bevs and a gallon of water to use throughout the week. I was surprised that the tap water in the hotel was as bad as it was (and i am not a water snob)--sulfur city man! The boat service to the Magic Kingdon was OUTSTANDING. We maybe waited 5 mins at the most on either end. It really made our trip! It enabled us to \"pop over\" most nights for a few hours, which was great because it wasn't crowded then. The ride operators were calling us to come and ride b/c they had no one on, and then let you ride as many times as you wanted! Imagine sitting on thunder Mountain Railroad 4 times straight! Also, come back during the Wishes show and you will enjoy the fireworks over the water--really beautiful! However, as good as the boats were (and take advantage of the boat to the Contemporary to the Monorail--also very easy fast and convenient) I was really disappointed in the shuttle bus service--it was horrible! After hustling your family to get up and out to make it out of the room and go to MGM, Blizzard beach or Animal Kingdom early, it really stunk to wait between 35-45 minutes for a bus. And coming back was even worse! Forget making any early morning Magic Hours unless you plan to be at the bus stop at 7:30! By the end, I was ready to just pay for a taxi, and would have if we wanted to go back to MGM our last day. My only last tip is if you have kids and they love to swim like mine, plan to have a day of just hotel and swim time.

A courtyard view on the 3rd floor looked out over the pool area. It was very quiet in the evenings. We had a queen bed and bunkbeds for the kids. It was nice to not have them fight over who slept where, they alternated the top and bottom bunks each night. The kids also loved the fact that the pool was open until midnight so they could swim after spending all day in the sun at the parks. We ate quite a bit at the Roaring Fork Cafe. The food is about the same price as any of your chain type restaraunts for pricing. The snacks are rather spendy, but what isn't spendy at Disney. I would recommend buying a water bottle and filling it rather than purchasing a new one for $2.00 every time you need water. The transportation to the parks was pretty quick. No longer than 1/2 hour to get on the bus and make the one stop at the Wilderness Campground just a mile away on the way to the parks. The ferry ride to Magic Kingdom was a plus as it only takes about 20 minutes and you very rarely have to wait. You might be able to save some time by driving to the parks, but the busses drop you off right at the doors and you do not have to hunt for your vehicle late in the evenings when there are thousands of people leaving the park at the same time. Our last day we ate at the Whispering Canyon restaurant and my kids thought it was the best day of food we had. We ordered the all you can eat breakfast skillet which includes scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuts and gravy and homestyle waffles. All for only $10.00 per adult and $6.00 for the kids. It was a blast. Make sure to ask for the ketchup. You will be surprised at the service you get. All in all it was a very positive stay at the Wilderness Lodge.

Suffice to say, all of the reviews heralding or lamenting the lodge's feature are well deserved: It's a beautiful property with a wonderful theme, the pool, restaurants and amenities are first class and the well appointed rooms are spotless. On the down side: The rooms are small compared to other deluxe Disney resorts, it's not a particularly good value, transportation is confounding for a resort so centrally located and there isn't enough seating poolside. Save tables, chairs and chaise loungers by the pool early in the morning because they're all taken by 10AM and there's not enough of them to go around for a resort that typically has over 2000 guests at a time registered. We went down at 8AM and left items of little importance on the furniture: several pool towels folded into a Disney Marketplace bag, a few soda bottles filled with tap water, the USA Today delivered outside our room and a couple of T-Shirts we travel with for just this purpose. So while everybody else was sitting three to a lounger and waiting to vulture abandoned chairs by 1PM; we sauntered up and made ourselves at home in the best location. Watch out for the wooden bed frames. The queen beds are about a foot higher from the floor than typical home bedding and the sturdy frames are an appealing target for shins and feet. With confined quarters, dim lighting and oversided bedspreads camouflaging the frame corners; we banged against the frames at least four times a day. Don't settle for the first room available or what the front desk wants to assign; it doesn't hurt to get picky and that pays off at Wilderness Lodge. My family made reservations and handled check-in; I said request the highest floor available with a room as far from the lobby as possible and was rewarded with a quiet room and spectacular view from the private balcony. The majority of rooms at the lodge are Courtyard view with very few Woods view and even fewer Standard view rooms. The north wing has Woods view rooms along it's left corridor; the right corridor and entire South wing are considered Courtyard view. Beware of the South wing lower floors close to or overlooking the lobby and Standard view rooms; they've got poor balconies and an uninspiring view. The fourth and fifth floor public areas are a treasure chest of hidden delights: At the front of the lodge overlooking the lobby is a great lounge on the fourth floor with a fireplace, sofas and large card tables. Towards the parking lot above the main entrance is another small lounge and walkout to a rooftop patio. The fifth floor has an outdoor balcony with a commanding view of the lake and property just above the fourth floor card lounge. At the corner of the North wing near the elevators are big picture windows with a good view of the nightly Magic Kingdom fireworks. You can't walk around the entire lobby above the fourth floor, the sixth floor is concierge level and a special card is required to access the limited number of rooms on the seventh floor. Take boat transportation whenever available. It's not only a relaxing, pleasant journey with some interesting sites; but the bus transportation takes a long time, the arrivals are frequently few and far between and there's other resorts involved. Getting to the Magic Kingdom by boat is direct and might even be a quicker transfer by monorail to the TTC and points beyond depending on the time of day. But the trip from Downtown Disney late at night is aggravating and there's no alternate route available from alot of Disney World locations.", "Date": "April 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cWilderness Lodge is that... \"a lodge\"\u201d", "Author": "needavacation2005", "ReviewID": "UR3330879", "Content": "We booked the Wilderness Lodge three months prior to our trip.

Not only was our room not available until late-late, we were given a room with two queen beds, no rails. The beds are higher than average which made it unsafe for the toddlers to sleep.

She didnt even care that the Cookies and Milk I ordered for the children never arrived. On day two, although we were promised our room to be ready, the front desk promised late checkout for the prior guests. At 4pm, our room was still not ready. It took two cleaning persons, with us standing in the room to get it right. The only service friendly person I care to mention at this resort was our Housekeeper who was amazing understanding with our troubles, and charmed our children.

You can take a boat directly to Magic Kingdom (never waited more than 10 minutes), or over to the Contemporary, where you can get the monorail to just about anywhere. Or, there are buses outside. Our room was nice, not the Ritz, but clean. I had asked about a refrigerator when I booked, and they said all of the rooms have them-not true, so be sure to ask again upon check in. The food was good at the everyday restaurant. We did splurge one night at Artist Pointe, the more upscale restaurant and the food and service was FABULOUS. (Ask for Sylvia, she is just charming!) The quick serve restaurant gets very bogged down 1/2 hour before the first boat leaves, so try to get there a little earlier. My mother had a sandwich there and said it was blah.

Since we only had a single day there, we flew around like the Griswolds, soaking up everything we could. (We probably annoyed the more \"sophisticated\" guests who had been there all week.) All in all, we had a fabulous time and would go back. Here's a breakdown of our experience: 1. The entrance is spectacular. Friendly bellboys gave us a warm welcome outside, and the lobby was breathtaking. While I was checking in, the girls were looking for the \"hidden Mickeys\" in the lobby. We arrived at 10:30 a.m. (way before check-in), but they let us have our room early. 2. The room itself is the only average thing about WL. It's clean but small and didn't include a fridge or microwave. The view on floors 3 to 5 seems to the best. On 2 you can't see much, and on 6 your balcony has a wall instead of metal bars. We would recommend the fifth floor overlooking either the woods or the courtyard. (We got a free upgrade to the courtyard just by asking.) 3. The pool and geyser area is beautiful and wonderful. The twisting slide was a big hit with our girls, and the hot tubs were very pleasant. It's a great themed setting, even better than more expensive hotels like the Contemporary in our opinion. 4. The transportion was just fine. We could catch a ferry to the Magic Kingdom or Fort Wilderness easily. In the evening, we went to Fort Wilderness for the free Chip n Dale campfire (at 8 p.m.). Then we returned in time to see the boat parade from the beach at WL. (The girls fell asleep, however, so we watched from the balcony.) 5. The dining was fine. Whispering Canyon wasn't quite as fun as we had imagined, but the servers were pleasant and the food was very good, just expensive. We enjoyed a full day at WL and checked out the next morning before going to the Magic Kingdom. Since we were going to be at the Kingdom all day, we didn't see the use in spending another $300/night, so we made the easy move to the $100/night All-Star Movies instead.

One word of advice: We loved our room and it fit our family of 4 perfectly -but the bunk beds did not rest against the wall. If you have a small child sleeping on the lower bunk, request 2 siderails upon check-in so that your child won't fall out of bed. Our 3 year old fell out of bed at 12:30 at night - and we had to wait for at least 30 minutes for the siderails to arrive.

In my opinion, its ok but doesn't live up to the hype. Our two main problems were the transportation around the parks, and the noise levels inside the hotel. I guess it depends on where your room is. We requested a Woods View, which is one upgrade from a standard. Our room was in the main building, on the sixth floor. The floors open to the lobby below. There's a restaurant located off one side of the lobby called Whispering Canyon. Well, it was anything but Whispering. The restaurant is open from about 7:30 am 'till 11 pm. There's a constant din from there. They have childrens' games, singing, etc., and the noise carried right up to our sixth floor room. I know it sounds incredible, but believe me, its true! The restaurant itself is not enclosed by windows, walls, etc., so its essentially a part of the lobby. I mean, the noise was incredible! We wanted to sleep in to about 9-10 am (we were on vacation), but were awakened every morning by the clamor from that place. I've read excellent things about this hotel and was very disappointed in our experience. I suppose if we were located in another section it would have been better, however, they were filled up and couldn't transfer us. The room itself was so small as to be a joke. There was barely enough room for 2 queen beds, and just a small tv amoire with three small drawers and a tiny three drawer chest, plus a hobbit-hole closet. All that for four people. The transportation from this hotel was inadequate, to say the least. They have a system of busses and boats, but it seemed we always needed to take at least two busses or bus/boat to get to where we were going. Coming back was worse--it took 1.5 hours to get from MGM back to the Wilderness Lodge! We got so frustrated with the transportation system we ended up using (and paying!) for taxis just to get around without spending all day to do it. I found the service and attitude of the hotel to be indifferent and lacking. It took 50 minutes to check us in, and there was no line, no one in front or behind us. Not even an apology for the excessive wait. If it took 50 minutes to check everyone in, and there was a line, some people would spend their entire vacation waiting in line.

It was our first trip to Mickey's world so before going I poured over this web site and books to decide where to stay. Despite what previous reviewers have said about their favorite hotels, WDW uses formulas, they are basically very similar. The key to happiness in Mickey's world is to remember that all of the hotels are illusions-the Grand Floridian is a pretend upscale hotel, the Wilderness lodge is a pretend woodsy lodge, etc-so there are not huge differences across the hotels within category-base the decision on where you (or your kids) think it would be most fun to pretend to be-tropics, africa, etc. None, for instance, are as upscale as you might expect given the cost-none triple sheet, for instance-- if you want the real upscale hotel simulated by the Grand Floridian you should try the JW Marriott a few miles away-For theme-ing though, the onsite hotels are great-- the Wilderness, Animal, Polynesian, etc. . We stayed for half the trip here and half off site. We visited almost all the on site hotels. On site advantages include wonderfully themed lobbies (rooms tend to be ho hum) earlier openings to the parks, free delivery service of purchases to the hotel, easy mobility between parks and hotels (none of the buses. boats, monorails take much time), high kid-friendliness, wonderful pools. Also, if you purchase a plastic drink cup at the start of your visit in the hotel, you can have free (soft drinks/coffee/cocoa) refills (at your particular lodge-not others) for the duration. On the minus side, the WDW is designed to ensure that all your money stays with Disney-you are sort of trapped-staff do not happily inform you about resources/stores/services outside WDW (bring your own liquor). And, if you are used to the JW or Ritz, this is not that. At the Wilderness, the food selection was limited and, except for the cafe, was hardy. We found that the delux hotels tended to have a cafe, an expensive restaurant and a more relaxed restaurant specializing in food matched to theme one price \"all you can eat\" sort of fare (not great if you tend to split entres, as we do). The pool was wonderful but we also pool hopped (not endorsed by WDW) and found some of the others to be even better. Some of the moderately priced hotels (not deluxe) had better food selection and food courts-better for small eaters. Another key is to BARTER ALWAYS-when you make the reservation and once you arrive (do you have anything nicer for that price?)-even later if you want to move up (we'd like to move to the court yard pool view?). Look at a guide book for hints about the best rooms in a given hotel. When you arrive, ask if they can move you up (or over) Depending upon who you get and how patient they are, you can end up with a highly desirable view at a lower price. We ended up with a nice view but, in reality, we only looked at the view a few times the entire week-how much was that worth? Also, try to book tickets before you go-once you are on property they've gottha and discounts are scarce.-unless you are computer equipped.", "Date": "September 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "oldham, england, united kingdom", "Title": "\u201cloved it went back got married there\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2515671", "Content": "Me and my now wife went to the wilderness lodge back in 1999 and then we went back and got married there in 2003.We have been going to Disney for the past nine years and have stayed in quite a few of the disney hotels,we can say without a doubt this is by far the best.From the time you walk into the lobby and have your breath taken away to the way you are treated like royalty by the staff there is nothing you can fault about the lodge,and if you ever stay in any of the value or moderate hotels you see the diference in the service.Me and my wife loved it so much we went there in 2003 and got married they couldn't have treated us better we will defintely be going back there again.", "Date": "September 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWilderness Lodge - a slight disappointment\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2504485", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the resort for three nights in late August.

The Whispering Canyon is the best value for your money for breakfast. You get more than you can eat, great entertainment, immediate service. OK, so if I have to have one complaint, I will make it a minor one. The parking lot is too large, with many of the close spaces reserved for valet.

The kids loved the water slide at the pool and the hourly geyser eruption, I think they had as much fun at the hotel swimming, boating (water mouse), and biking (surrey bikes), as they did at the Magic Kingdom.

No other hotel can match the true theme of a northern lodge as well as the excellent quality you get from a Disney hotel. Everything was super clean, the grounds were immaculate, service excellent, food (although pricey) was consistently great, and the beds were super comfortable. Stayed in many on and off property hotels and this one has always been #1 for our family.

I loved that you could hope on a boat and be at Magic Kingdom's gates.. no other transportation to take but your own two feet.. that was great. We also visted Fort Wilderness which was only a boat ride away. I have to say that this hotel has been one of the best that I have visited... there was only a couple things wrong.. there was just a bit of wall paper coming off (hardly noticeable) and one of the sinks were not working, but was fixed upon request.

Boat transportation to and from the Magic Kingdom was very difficult and took FOREVER. Luckily we had a rental car! I found this hotel to be too remote. They need a walking path to the Contemporary so people don't have to line up for the slow ferries.

It was good to see that another guest experienced the leaking roof - it really was good to walk under an internal watrfall!. The wet floors were like an ice rink if caught at the wrong time - and battling with the closed doors from the outside was worse than sitting in the barge on splash mountain. Also during my stay I attempted to do some laundry in the laundry room. I was amazed that there were only four usable washing machines to cope with a hotel that had over 728 rooms (not counting the people who came in from the Wilderness Villas to use the amenities). The confrontations between guests fighting for the machines was amusing, but I could understand the frustration. I too experienced dusty rooms - I do not blame the house keeping staff, but rather the cut backs that were noticed both in the hotel and in the Parks. The staff in the hotel were very polite, and did all they could to ensure that everyone had a good holiday, and despite all of the above, I will be back.", "Date": "December 23, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent England", "Title": "\u201cLeaking Roofs & Peeling Wall Paper\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1521262", "Content": "We arrived 4th dec 2003 for 14 nights & what a start.

But the best was still to come when it rained not only was the waterfall impresive on the outside the one coming through the roof was just about as good & the doors tied together with towels,plastic tape &other means along with towels around the doors to stop water from gaining entry as well as the guests was a really nice touch !

This was our first trip in 20 years to WDW, and our first with our children (8 & 9). From the moment we walked into the lobby of the Lodge, we were all overwhelmed by the atmosphere and beauty of this resort. The lobby itself is simply incredible - soaring ceilings with tall log supports, totem poles, comfortable & cozy furniture, one of a kind fireplace - I could go on and on. Of course, Disney's service was superior; the staff seemed to know how not to intrude on your experience, yet be available for any need to be met.The accomodations were typical Disney - small and functional. But the decor fit in with the lodge feel of the resort, and the balcony view over Otter Pond was pleasant. The rooms could have been a little larger for my taste, but we spent so little time there that it was not inconvenient. I really would like to try a suite, next time.The special charm of Wilderness Lodge is what really sells the resort. I've never enjoyed myself in a hotel as much as I did there. Hanging out in the lobby, shopping at the Mercantile, or having a rowdy time in the Canyon (don't pass up the shakes!), all made the experience captivating.
