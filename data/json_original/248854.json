Location is great, I didn't need to use the underground at all, it was only about 10 ins walk to Potsdamer platz and about 20 mins to Brandenburg gate. If you don't like walking there are plenty of buses and trains to all locations. A taxi to the main station was only 9 euros I had a great stay here, I agree with other reviewers about area but there are a couple of good bars and restaurants fairly close, stresseman cafe was excellent also mexican restaurant both only 5 mins from Hotel.As a single female traveller I did feel a little bit scared when walking back late one night to the Hotel because the area isn't too well lit and feels deserted at night, however I had no problems at all and I think its just the perception you get of the area. Work at the station during the day did not disturb me at all. . Wifi is available but you do pay extra for it, I did have to ask every day for a breakfast menu for ordering in rooIm. In Berling I really reccommend the Jewish Museum and the city bus tour.

Yet when I got there, I knew it'd be perfect. Yes. it is situated in an unusually 'deserted' location but all the better for it. After a day spent in the Berlin buzz, going back to the little island of peace and quiet that is the Gleisdreick Station and around was very welcome. The hotel is located nearly opposite to the station, and is an ideal base to navigate quickly in any direction, being totally central. Ok as with another Mercure I stayed in (Bremen) I can see that there is two sides to the hotel : the bad side, overlooking the station and probably suffering from the trains' racket. The good side, where I was, where you still hear them go by in the distance, but nothing bad at all. In fact, my rating of hotels is always in term of the quiet at night and this one definitely comes at a brilliant First ! I had not slept so well in a long time. Maybe there was low occupancy or the soundproofing is perfect. I also very much appreciated that I had asked for a quiet room and got one. The Accor chain is great for the excellent service it offers yet gives you the option of total anonymity if you wish so. The staff at this Mercure was lovely and extremely helpful. The breakfast, I did not have, as a little too pricey for my apetite in the morning. There is an express version at 5.99 euros. The breakfast room is very nice and there is a pond with fish in the courtyard. All very pleasant. My room was large, great bathroom, all very comfortable with all the little extras that make a difference : complimentary water bottle, tv program etc...There is online access in the hall.. I have stayed in Four stars that did not offer so much (Venice). So there is in my view only one reason this hotel has not got 4 stars but three : the awful orange colour of the carpet everywhere. Change the carpet and it'll be another world ! One last little thing : the cleaning staff should really Not knock on the door at 9 am. as if you'd overslept !

In other words, this is actually a decent hotel with small but tastefully decorated rooms, comfortable albeit firm beds and good pillows. Apparently it has been completely renovated fairly recently and for the most part it is still in a perfect condition. This was particularly true for the really luxurious bath of my room. For subway users this hotel is ideally situated less than 100 m away from the Gleisdreieck station of U1 and U2. If the room is located on the court-side of the building, the noise of the subway trains, which in fact pass high above the ground here, is nonetheless almost inaudible. However, this might be different for rooms at the exterior front at Luckenwalder Strasse. The buffet breakfast is excellent so that one is always tempted to eat too much. All members of staff I was in contact with were really friendly. The \"Keys to Europe\" promotion rate is attractively priced for Berlin standards. So are there no drawbacks at all? In my opinion there is one, about which, however, the hotel cannot do anything. It consists in the surroundings of the hotel. They comprise residential buildings, small workshops, office blocks and alike on the one side and an urban wasteland on the other. Thus, it is virtually impossible to find a nice restaurant in walking distance or to buy at least a snack there. The best thing to do in this respect is to flee the area, e.g. by subway.

It was well connected and on the whole a comfortable budget hotel. We did not have any meals there as it was easy to go to either Potsdamer Platz or any other central location. It is right next to the Technical Museum too.

The hotel is situated a few meters from the U-ban that take you to Potsdamer Platz in 7-10 min. Great location to explore the city. We had a day-card that gave us access to all public transport inside Berlin, and used this every day. But we also used bike to get around to the most popular places. Recomend this way to get around, but stay away from rush-hour! Many popular places such as Potsdamer Platz, Brandenburger Tor, Checpoint Carlie are easy to reach from this hotel. The hotels nearest sourroundings are not much, but since the hotel itself is new and cosy, and it is easy to reach all you need by public transport or walking, we diden`t se this as a problem.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "rotterdam", "Title": "\u201cCheckpoint Charlie and upgrade shopping\u201d", "Author": "ekievit", "ReviewID": "UR8492638", "Content": "great hotel next to shopping and \"Checkpoint Charlie\" service is very good and the rooms are spacious A bit of a side street but near to everything walking distance to \"Unter den Linden\" 15 min We were delighted about Berlin,great food and a very nice short stay.

Having used Accor hotels before I didn't expect any issues but mine started when I arrived. Apparently my booking had been changed so that I arrived a day earlier. Just as well I had my email from them which showed that I hadn't! So after much huffing and puffing and a swear word, I got my key. The room was tiny - considering I had booked a room for 1 or 2 people, I was surprised when it only had a single bed! But no problem. To be fair to the hotel, the room was clean and comfortable, bathroom was fine and the range of TV channels was excellent - it includes BBC World which is a better alternative for me than CNN. The room did get very warm and given the current hot weather that Berlin is suffering, I struggled to get a good night's sleep. The double glazing kept out most noise but as the courtyard gets busy first thing in the morning, you couldn't keep the window open overnight for ventilation. No air-con is provided and in the summer it's needed. Breakfast was excellent as were the staff serving here - very friendly and helpful. Gleisdreick U-Bahn has good connections though getting to the main railway station is a bit of a long winded journey.

It's conveniently located in some aspects- it's just about 60 seconds from a subway stop, and it's only a 10-15 minute walk from Potsdamer Platz. But the amenities leave something to be desired. My room was ok, but very small, and the bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The wireless internet was a disaster, and since I was there on business, I wound up spending a lot of the evening in the lobby, as that was the only place to get a signal. Once 9pm hits, there is nowhere around to get any food- even the gas station on the corner is closed. You're either in a cab or the U-bahn, but if you're going for tourism and not for business, you're probably not going to be sitting at the hotel anyway. The on-premises bistro isn't very good, and only has three options for dinner. The breakfast buffet is OK, but there are generally only three hot items- mildly stale eggs, sausage, and some sort of fried potato or meat dish. There's a good swath of meats and cheeses, though, so you'll be ok. In the end the place is clean, quiet, and generally nice. The staff is helpful, and the rooms are great for the price.
