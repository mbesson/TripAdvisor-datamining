It is quite a distance to walk, especially if you have luggage. I was given a ticket for a free drink at the pub nearby. Since I was alone, I was hesitant to go get a drink, even if it was for a soda. I don't think a woman traveling by herself should be in a pub drinking alone. This place is a basic motel. The pool was nice to swim in and enjoyed the country feel of the area. I doubt if I will come back to this place. The employees were pleasant, and everything was neat and clean. There are restaurants, a large Walmart, and entertainment walking distance from the motel. It was more basic than I preferred and being so far from the road was odd.

If you're looking for a good, fair-priced, clean place to sleep, shower, and relax after a long day on the town, this is your best bet. When you go to Branson, there's too much to do in one week's visit, and you're not going to waste your time lounging at the hotel. But this place is right on the strip, yet set back off the road and traffic. However, the Outback Pub is a few hundred feet from the front of the building with live music nightly outside in warmer weather and unless you are into late nightly nightlife, you'll want to request a room on the backside of the building. They have an outdoor pool, hot tub, and SAUna to relax in after a long day on your feet or to take in after one of the many local shows. The owner is very nice, knows the area, and can provide good information on where to take a ride to see the best views of the countryside. One of his best recommendations was a loop that included Eureka Springs, AR. What a cool town!

The outrageous claims made by travelers puzzle me. What do you expect for $60.00 a night? How about $45.00? My trip to Branson this year was a great pleasure. I arrived at the Outback hotel a week before prime season. During my visit I paid $45.00 a night for a A/C large room w/ 2 comfortable queen beds. We had a standard bathroom. However, the water pressure, as well as the temp was perfect. After my morning walk on their premises(15 acres of wooded grounds), my family and myself had access to continental style breakfast.(Which was adequate enough to get your morning going.) Most of the staff was friendly, especially Shannon and Noel. (Please Keep in mind these locals are recovering from a Tornado, and have a lot of extra duties to take care of.) After taking in a day of shopping, shows, and other tourist attractions. My family and I would return to a clean room, a wonderful heated pool, hot tub, sauna and covered pavilion. This hotel is definitely worth checking out, if you are looking for convenience, privacy, a nice pool, and a comfortable temporary living quarters. If you have any additional questions call before your stay. The staff is more than happy to accommodate you.****The price I paid was through priceline, and also pre- holiday season.*********", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LeBlanc, LA", "Title": "\u201cGreat affordable place to stay in Branson\u201d", "Author": "Sandra D", "ReviewID": "UR119255722", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights at the Outback Roadhouse motel and it was a wonderful stay.

The room was very affordable (under $60 a night) for us with our discounts. A free hot breakfast in the morning hit the spot. The property that the motel is on is set right of the 76 strip, but it is alot of acreage, so the motel is away from all the noise and traffic of the strip.

It is hard to find an affordable place for a large family to stay, without having to get two rooms. Our room had a full kitchen, dining and living room. There were two pull out couches and a king size bed. It was only $90 or so. That is $40-60 less than most family suites, and it is much nicer than the other family suite at a comparable price. There is not any dishes, utensils, cookware, etc. The sheets were clean, however, part of them had stains. That was really the only turn off. We didn't visit he pool, but it is a standar small pool with a nice covered dining/sitting area. Checkout is not until 11:00. That was nice, since we spent a late night at the ER for some stitches. Consequently, we did not get a chance to try the breakfast. They do give a 10% discount on dining at the Outback restaurant next door. It is back from the strip a little bit, so it is quiet. It is right in the middle of town, which means easy access to shows, the Landing, or he alternate routes around town. Staff was great.

The rooms were a typical old style motel, nothing rustic or cool just a regular all in one complex with the doors outside and a window. Inside our suite it had a very musty smell, our first reaction was it stinks in here. There were hairs on the floor of the bathroom, in the drawers, and between the sheets. Dirt in corners, just rather unclean. But that's just housekeeping. Maybe that was a fluke. But the real issue is how outdated, dark, and dreary it was. The dark colors just added to the feeling of it being unclean. I guess this place is just really getting old. And when the air was on it blew the curtains so we could see people pulling up in their cars and walking to their room. We fixed it with some careful situating but not before one man waved in at us.
