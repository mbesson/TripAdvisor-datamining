I came with my wife to spend just 2 nights. To me cleanliness is a priority in selecting an accomodation. Location is also a factor when the time to spend in a city is limited. Price enter into the formula of satisfaction when the other two criterias are met. I found the Adriatico Hotel to be very clean, conveniently located and with its breeze of freshly renovated look to be appealing to enjoy the nights in a old city standing for centuries on water. I would reccomend it because this Hotel is a premium 2 stars. The staff is very polite and professional. The breakfast area is a little bit small, but what to expect from a 12 rooms Hotel?

If you take the shuttle bus from Marco Polo airport into Venice, it's less than a 10 minute walk to the hotel, or one stop on the water bus if you have a lot of luggage that you don't want to carry. It's on a main road right next to a ton of restaurants, stores, bakeries, gelato places etc. and it's really easy to find your way back to the hotel after wandering the winding, skinny streets of Venice- just follow the signs to Ferrovia and you'll find your way easily. The staff was extremely friendly and everything went smoothly. The breakfast was satisfying enough, and included croissants, breakfast rolls, cereal, yogurt, and a variety of hot beverages/juice. The room and bathroom were clean, but not immaculate. If they just replaced the somewhat outdated bedding/curtains it would make a world of difference. There was also a little bit of street noise, but it didn't bother me too much. I was a little bit disappointed because the website photos make the place look bright and newly updated, which it was not, but as it was clean and in a good location for a good price, I was satisfied.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, ON", "Title": "\u201cExceeded my expectations!\u201d", "Author": "Barbara D", "ReviewID": "UR127389895", "Content": "I have to admit, I was a little apprehensive about staying here - I worried about cleanliness, comfort level, etc. My boyfriend and I were in Venice for the weekend and were looking for a well-located, cheap(er) option for accommodation in this mostly overpriced city. However, the minute we walked into Hotel Adriatico, my fears were put to rest instantly. First, despite its 2* rating, this hotel is very, VERY clean. The hallways are spotless, and the room (though ordinary-looking) was very comfortable. You don't need to worry about tidiness at all! Second, we received great service. The minute we checked in, the man at the reception desk (I believe he was the manager or owner?) pulled out a map, advised us on tourist sites, and noted which restaurants to avoid. He was quite adamant about avoiding tourist traps and told us everything we needed to know. He basically gave us a briefing on Venice within a span of 10 minutes. Very friendly, very warm staff. Breakfast was average - don't expect a hot breakfast, as you only get bread, cereals, oatmeal, crackers, etc. Third, be warned that this hotel is but of a walk from St. Marks Square - about 20 minutes at a leisurely pace and about 15 minute walk from Rialto Bridge. However, it is the perfect location for getting to and from the bus terminal and/or the train station. You won't need to push your luggage all around the island to get to this hotel - it is literally a 5 minute walk.

Having arrived at the railway station and getting out of there we found ourselves in front of the Canal Grande. We turned left and walked a little to try to find any cheap hotel as the prices for that week were really very high. Thanks to my friend's intuition we were here, at the Hotel ADRIATICO - we were shocked in a good meaning - it wa clean, white, comfortable hotel with a nice lady at the reception, there was a cozy room with air conditioning and a bathroom with a hair dryer (!) as well as everything you may need to wash and dry :)) At the end of getting surprised so much we woke up the next morning and had a very nice breakfast - not only croissant and tea or coffee but also corn flakes with milk and orange juice.

The rooms are small ditto the bathroom. We had a room directly to the busy street below and there was no noise. The room has air-condition and central heating.

We haven't got reservation, anyway we found the hotel immadiatly, and there was a free room for us. The place of the hotel is very comfortable. It is near by parking, and also you can walk everywhere in the city from it. The room was very clear, well suited. The price is reasonable, it is relevant to the service. The best think about the hotel, that the personal is very very kind, helpful and polite. So all together Hotel Adriatico is a best choice, if you want to live in Venice for a reasonable price with convenient conditions.
