There were two wash clothes, 2 hand towels and 3 bath towels. I could have called for more but I should not have to. With 2 queens they should know in Housekeeping that type of room usually has more than 2 people in it. Next was the dust we could write our names on the desk.

I wanted to order dinner from in room dining there was no menu in the room I checked the on screen on the phone all I could get it to do was call room service. Yes I can call and ask for this but I do not want to I want it there. The beds were ok not the most comfortable in the city mattress wise but the comforter was great. The heating system was loud in our room and that made it hard to sleep. When taking a shower the hand held kept moving and spraying out to the floor. The only other thing I did not like about the room is the bathroom door is not easy to open and close. Would I stay again? I have to say I enjoy the city North of the river.

There was also a $6 bottle of Fiji water in my room (in addition to mini-bar offerings - which, it is important to note - the mini-bar is sensored, so if you move something, you are charged for it). I never touched the $6 bottle of water, but did drink one of my complimentary bottles of water during my stay. At check-out, my hotel folio showed no charges outside of room and tax... but when I checked my credit card statement, I was charged - TWICE - for the $6 bottle of water. I called the hotel and they have credited my card... but since this was a business trip, it will now create additional expense reporting hassles and delays me in completing my paperwork.

I will say that I did a lot of home work before selecting the hotel I wanted. I wanted a hotel great for couples, a great bathroom and and a great view! I found The Wit provided the best opportunity for our needs and price range. We had a King River view Spa room. Upon arrival, I noticed the room we had did not have a shower as I was told it did. I wasn't very happy however I was moved to the same type of a room but with a shower and tub within 5 minutes and it was no problem. We were on the 15th floor facing the river so we were not anywhere near the train. You have your fair sounds of the city though. The beds were not bad. I would probably say a 7. I did not get the feeling this hotel had any attitude as others have mentioned on TripAdvisor. I was very VERY impressed with the service and how very friendly everyone was. The Wit even went out of their way and gave us Champagne and strawberries on the house as we were celebrating our Mini-Moon. Two people stuck out in my mind as Joe and Alex who I mostly worked with. They were wonderful and very helpful. The Wit offers complimentary mini refrigerators. If you move anything from the one you have that is stocked... you will get charged. Those prices are standard as you will see. Elevators I had no issue getting one and I was there for New Years Eve. I used the parking deck right around the corner which was safe and probably $60.00 less after 3 nights and 4 days. NOTE: No in and out privileges in that deck. THE ROOF was very trendy and did have an amazing view as said. A Coors Light is 7 dollars. That is what you need to expect from The Roof. STATE AND LAKE (the restaurant downstairs) is also a little pricey but I thought VERY VERY GOOD! Getting breakfast? You are probably going to pay for two people around $25-30. However, it is not your in and out type breakfast. It was gourmet and sooo delicious. Get the Red Velvet Pancakes! We also had dinner at State and Lake and found the dinner to be just as good. Very well done if you don't mind spending a little extra, but I recommend trying! LOCATION: Perfect Central Location to both sides of Chicago!

The receptionist was our first hotel representative that we encountered and she was wonderful. We were on the 24th floor and our view was fun! The room was very clean and very comfortable. I am all about a good nights sleep and I found the king bed to be great (not too firm!). We asked for a roll-away and it was delivered soon after we arrived to our room. He needed to get us a pillow and sheets as we were using the pillow and sheets supplied in the room for the pull-out couch. He practically ran down the hall to return with the pillow and sheets. We gave him a tip for his very prompt service! We have waited in other hotels for requests, so we really appreciated his service! We loved the location because of it being within walking distance of shopping and in the theater district. We shopped during the day and ran our packages up to the room before going out for pizza. Macy's was a must see all decorated for Christmas. We saw a show at the Goodman Theater and I was thankful to just walk back to our room at 10:30pm in a matter of 5 minutes. We would definitely stay here again. On a side note, we arrived at the Museum of Science and Industry around 11:30am on a weekday between Christmas and New Years. We love to see their Christmas Around the World (Museum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 45-foot Grand Tree with more than 30,000 lights and ornaments and 50 smaller trees decorated by volunteers from Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ethnic communities to represent their cultures and holiday traditions.) It was absolutely packed! Most special exhibits and omnimax movies were sold out. We opted to just become members of the museum because the line was much shorter. If we go one other time during the year then we will come out even. We really just wanted to see the Christmas trees and decorations, so lines weren't an issue with us. My one daughter wanted to see the coal mine exhibit, but the wait was 1 hour. (thought we might be at Disney for a minute!)

The good: i stayed in a king suite-1202 (intrinsically tied to the bad described below). the room was nice (nothing spectacular) and the bathroom was beautiful and moder-nice tub, great shower, awesome view, large, etc. The toiletries were beyond the quality of other Hilton brand toiletries. The tv was large and (thankfully!) wasn't controlled using lodge net (those who travel know how annoying/slow lodge net is). The iPod doc would have been great had it been functional (missing electrical plug). Unlike other reviewers, I found the elevators very fast and efficient. Finally, the fitness center was large (for a boutique-like hotel) and had good, new equipment. The bad/ugly: There are better hotels in Chicago for a lower price, and all that I've stayed in have a more professional staff. The staff was inconsistent, inattentive and unprofessional. Examples: 1. I had numerous large holes in my fitted bed sheet (thereby exposing the mattress) and had pillows that smelled like feces. In spite of notifying the hotel concierge and housekeeping, the bedding wasn't changed and neither were the pillows. I woke up with a terrible rash on my face and need to see a doctor (on Chritmas, no less!). 2. The staff was particularly crass late at night...cursing in the lobby, discussing inappropriate and insulting topics, not greeting guests, etc. 3. I was yelled at by staff for trying to use the side lobby door at night. 4 Check in was annoying and slightly degrading. Although the hotel was rather empty, I had to practically beg to get an upgrade to a nicer room (as a Hilton gold member, this was disappoingting considering Marriott and Starwood readily upgrade me based on my gold statuses, and theWit had plenty of upgrades available for the night). The manager (I'm assuming) came to the front desk and allowed for the upgrade, but it was like pulling teeth with them (at one point I had to mention the it is Hilton policy to upgrade if available...concierge floor or not). So much for hhonors!!! I'm 2 stays away from diamond..this solidified my decision to focus on other chains that actually care about loyalty). Overall, I wanted to love this hotel, but didn't because of the staff (and i NEVER have complained about the staff in any of my other reviews).

As such, my standards for guest service and quality are probably higher than many other people who do not work in hospitality. My stay at this hotel over Thanksgiving 2011 was nothing short of ideal. Every member of the front desk staff, rooftop bar, and restaurant were completely outstanding and friendly, as well as the staff flagging taxis and greeting guests out front who were all very pleasant and friendly. Alex Savory, Michelle, and Andrea at the front desk; as well as Beatrice in the rooftop bar were all exceptional and deserve to be recognized for making the trip particularly memorable. For my family (there were ten of us ranging in age from 4 months to 60yrs) the service and accomodation made everything extremely easy. The restaurant had no problem accomodating our group, which was somewhat \"special needs\" with a 4-month old baby, and his 2 year old sister. There was never a wait for any of our groups many requests. Sherri and Matthew, as well as a man with dark hair in a suit who was probably the restaurant manager were particularly attentive, patient, and responsive (as well as good with the children). The decor of the hotel is very hip and vibrant. The rooftop bar was especially fun, has great views of Chigao, fantastic drinks (I'd reccomend the CG2-a cucumber mojito) as well as a very fun atmosphere with glass fire pits and outside roofdecks with plasma televisions that is probably great during warmer weather. The room should also not be overlooked as it was very comfortable with impressive views. The suite I stayed in was particularly clean and well appointed. My only complaint is with the design of the bathroom doors, which as far as I can tell do not lock? The door is also on a slider, which is a nice concept. The handle on my bathroom door was a bit loose, and the door in my uncle's room was slightly off of its track, but neither of these very minor issues were reported to any staff. If they had been I am sure that the issues would have been promptly fixed. Lastly, the location could not be more ideal as it is literally steps from the El, and a very short walk to Millenium Park. The staff and GM of this property clearly have the right idea of how hopitality should be done.

I do wonder about the artwork in the bathroom that was a replica of a cover of Esquire magazine. All that aside, it was an okay place to stay - but for a Doubletree, I was surprised that there were no bathrobes in the room, no turn-down service, etc. Perhaps I was considered a \"sub customer\" due to the fact that I booked my room through a popular on-line travel service? Even the cookie that I was offered at check-in was not warmed. Come on, Doubletree - I know you can do better than this. I've stayed at other Doubletrees that offered all the above and more. Would I stay here again? Probably not - there are too many other choices in downtown Chicago that would probably be a bit more attentive to me as a customer, even on a busy weekend.

Overall, I was impressed with the hotel. The service was very good from check-in until check-out with only two minor issues. First, I had two FedEx packaged delviered to the hotel from my office and it was not until I went down to the concierge desk to pick them up that I was able to get there. While not a big deal, had I not known these packages were coming, I am not sure if and when I would have received them. As it turns out, when I asked for them they were delivered right away and so it is not that big deal. The second concern is the high price of the internet. The hotel offers three pricing tiers based on how much bandwidth you intend to use-the rates start at $10/day and go up to about $20/day. Hotels of this quality and costing in excess of $300/night should include free WiFi service--TheWit is certainly not alone in chargiung for WiFi service but I hope all hotels will realize that that this should be included. Another minor irritation was the fact that room service stops at 6:30 in the evening for everything but omlettes and eggs. While the hotel has a few restaurants, it would be nice to have a room service option for those who do not want to eat in the restaurant--especially since there are not too many casual choices in the immediate neighborhood. These quibbles did not detract from the fact that everyone I encountered was very friendly and professional. The staff are clearly well trained and take pride in their hotel and the service they provide. The room itself is quite large and is very comfortable. The room had a full sofa, desk, king bed, and a large tv with very nice views down State St. The bathroom was very nice with Gilchrist & Soames toiletries, nice robes, decent towels and very good water pressure--again, not your typical Doubletree. The location of the hotel is good if you have plans to be in the Loop or plan to spend time in Millenium Park. If your goal is to shop and dine, I think there are better located hotels north of the river. Overall, however, I was very impressed with TheWit and enjoyed my stay.

The staff is friendly, yet they miss too many marks when it comes to paying attention to details and/or the lack of service awareness towards the guest. We found interruptions by maids as soon as we checked into our room, but I think this is how the protocol is with this kind of hotel. Their version of knock on the door routine is very poor as they practically walked into our room not once but twice, unanswered! We also had someone scratching at our door early in the morning, but it definitely wasn't preventive maintenance as a \"No\" sign was outside our door alerting them to keep quite. Again, the \"No\" sign is the hotel's version of \"Do Not Disturb\". Funny! Room service is prompt, yet missing silverware items for appropriate food groups was common. The restaurant had descent food, the server was friendly and knowledgeable, yet dirty silverware was obvious. As for the 27th Floor Rooftop, the bartenders would handle and give you the incorrect money back and some went as far as keeping your change. The dropping of the hotel room charge(s) underneath the door of our room at around 4am and a knock on our door was totally inappropriate and inconsiderate as well. As good as the valet was in getting your car they were not as good as giving you your keys back! All of this for 2 small complimentary waters I would rather they take a little bit more pride in their job, but I imagine this would have to start with the people at the top who dismiss teaching their staff a certain level of attentive service.

From the moment we arrived and were met by a member of staff with an umbrella as we got out of our taxi, till we were checked out by the very professional-yet-friendly Andrea, our stay was almost flawless. We were upgraded to a King Spa corner room (#1702) which had one of the best bathtubs I have ever had to privilege of soaking in! What made the bathroom even more appealing were the floor-to-ceiling windows, offering some fantastic views of the city. Certainly, it might not be appropriate to leave the shades up whilst bathing, but it is sooo nice to be in a bathroom that has so much natural light. Bliss!! The bedroom was nicely appointed and also had floor-to-ceiling windows from which we could see the lake, the city and the river. Housekeeping were impressively quick, but thorough. They attended to our requests for extra coffee and pillows immediately and were thoughtful enough to bring extra cups too. The only problem we had was with the noise from the 'L'. Actually, I should clarify that the noise did not bother me at all, but it did wake up my husband, so if you are a light sleeper then you might consider requesting a room on a higher floor, or one that is on the other side of the hotel. I was so happy to see the 'Wolfgang Puck' coffee and coffee maker in the room, especially since it seems to be a growing trend in other hotels to no longer provide them unless specifically requested. There was also a great selection of 'Gilchrist and Soames' bathroom amenities, including those extremely handy little vanity kits (cotton balls, emery board, q-tips). It is thoughtful little details like these that, as a female traveler, I truly appreciate. We ate breakfast each morning at 'State and Lake' . On the first day I had the Red Velvet pancakes, which I thought were just okay, but the next day I had the banana stuffed french toast and those were excellent. We had the same waiter each morning who was great (sorry, I didn't get his name). He even remembered us from the previous day, which seldom happens at a hotel of this size. We also went to 'Roof', the bar which, perhaps unsurprisingly, is on the roof of the hotel. The view was great, the food was actually pretty good and was reasonably priced, but the drinks were kind of pricey. Oh, and as far as we could tell, there were about 5 busboys working, but only one waitress, so service was a bit slow. There is no doubt in my mind that I will stay at the Wit again.

The service was also quite good - we arrived super early (around 10:30am) expecting to be told we needed to just leave our bags and check in later. Nope, got checked right in, given delicious cookies, and brought up to our room. The room was great - comfy bed, everything you need. The only thing lacking was a fan/vent in the bathroom so it got quite steamy when you showered. The concierge was also very helpful - gave us quick and easy directions to Wrigley Field. For anyone doing their wedding here, thought I'd briefly mention my experience with this hotel as a guest at the wedding. We were told that the wedding cocktail hour would be on the roof - and based on the website, that seemed really exciting. Unfortunately, it was only a partial section of the roof and it was indoors, which I thought was somewhat disappointing. It was also much too loud and too crowded. The rest of the wedding - ceremony and reception in one of the ballrooms - was great, we had a blast. The crowds going up to the Roof in the evenings were a bit of a turn-off. Really scene-y and totally not where I'd want to hang out. But you only really interact with them in the lobby and potentially the elevator. I just ignored them and was fine.

Everyone, and I mean everyone, that we encountered here were friendly and professional. We arrived many hours before check in and both rooms I had booked were ready. I think it was Alex who checked us in? He was very nice and had us checked in quickly. I asked about fridges and they were sent right up after we got to our rooms. We were given rooms on the 15th floor facing State St. The rooms are a good size and updated. I love modern decor so the bathrooms made me especially happy, the trough sink and glass shower I would put in my house if I had the space.... the amenities are also very nice. There was no bathtub which I thought would bug me but the shower was so nice I didn't even notice.... We headed out for brunch and to explore a bit and when we returned to relax for a while the onslaught of sirens from the nearby fire station began... this may not be an issue at all for many people but I am a light sleeper in hotels. I always sleep with earplugs when I travel anyway but this was clearly not going to help. I had been worried about the trains below being noisy but they were not even remotely an issue. They sound like a gust of wind when they go by. I went down to front desk to ask about wifi and things to do in the area and in the course of conversation I mentioned to Brittany my concerns about the sirens... She was extremely helpful with all of my questions and when I mentioned the siren noise she immediately offered to move our rooms. I was so grateful to be dealing with someone who obviously cares about customer service. I thought I might just see how the first night went, but she said that the hotel was sold out the next night and they would not have rooms available to move the next day. We ended up moving rooms to the 17th floor on the back of the hotel and had a view of some of the beautiful Chicago architecture. I slept like a baby every night.... the beds are soooo comfy!!! Some observations... I know everyone complains about not having free wifi here, but most people have phones nowadays that have wifi built in so just use it in the lobby where it is free. Or go to the business center where you get the first ten minutes free. Really, how much time do you need on a computer when you are on vacation? And if you are on business does your company not pay for you? Another complaint everyone has is how busy it is because of the rooftop bar. The only night I even noticed anything was the Wednesday there were people lined up outside to go up. But inside they had a separate elevator designated to go straight up to the roof so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even affect us. We had to laugh at all the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Been a long time since I have seen a man in a tight blazer with no shirt underneath lol!!! The Wit is in a fantastic location, we walked or jumped on the subway to get everywhere we wanted to go. Tons of shopping, dining, and the riverfront are steps away.

There are several pillows with varying degrees of softness to guarantee a good night's rest. And, the windows open so you can have fresh air. That's good because the air conditioning was quite noisy and we could never seem to get it to work adequately. The only downside of opening the windows: street noise. (We were on the 10th floor.) Also, there is only one large chair for sitting. If there are two of you, the other person has to use the desk chair or sit on the bed. There are no closets here - just large armoires. While the rooms were clean, we had some issues, such as the shower head wasn't stable and flopped over, It was fixed quickly, but it isn't something you want to find out as you step into the shower.

It has a sensor on it that will charge you if you open it and take out something just to look at it.

When I booked my reservation through them directly, I was told I would get the wedding rate since the block of rooms was full, and they are usually very flexible with honoring the group rate. I didn't think twice about it- I booked the room and figured it would be settled upon our arrival. When we got there, the receptionist saw the note regarding the wedding block on the computer that the reservationist had left and went to seek a manager. Not only did the manager never come to talk to us him/herself, the receptionist plainly said the manager could not honor it. I'm sure I could have made a big deal at that point, but it was probably a $40 difference and I didn't want to make a scene in a crowded lobby.

One draw back was the shallow square sink, while I appreciate its modern and clean look, but it's not practical, water splashed everywhere. I also enjoyed the wall art in my room as well. Very nice touch. Restaurants I had breakfast at the lobby restaurant State & Lake, very attentive service and they put a refreshing twist to boring American hotel breakfast. Transport: Close enough to Clark&Lake Blue Line CTA station (walkable), good alternative to Taxi to O'Hare. Train Noise: The property is situated next to the Blue Line tracks. So lower floors may be bothered by the occasional train noise. Roof Top Bar The hotel has a very cool roof top bar. All my Chicago friends told me that this is one of Chicago's best roof top bars. Final Thought What a great addition to the Hilton property collection. Finally! a Hilton property that's catered to the younger design conscious crowd.

Location: First off, we thought it was a very good location. We took the blue line from O'Hare and had little trouble finding the hotel. (The train station it's self was a little confusing, but the hotel was easy to find from the Clark/Lake station.) It was an easy walk to Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute, Trader Joes (home of cheap snacks and wine), etc. Check in and out: We arrived about 2:00 only to be told the room wasn't yet ready, but the receptionist completed the check in process for us and they stored our luggage while we went and had some lunch. I liked the overall look of the hotel; it was very clean, modern and more than a little \"hip\". The front desk called us within the hour to notify us that the room was ready. Halls and Elevators: The sound piped into the hallways of birds chirping during daytime was very nice. We like the sounds of crickets at night too. Such a small thing, it was a very nice touch. As others have stated, the bar on the top floor (the \"Roof\") has lots of activity and seems to draw a lot of young people to the hotel. Although we did note that the elevators were a little slow at times, we didn't notice it so much at night and therefore we didn't attribute it to activity on the Roof. We didn't have any issues with the Roof party goers, but I see how, if it was a different group, it could be a little trying. Room: The room was equally hip and a little retro in its furnishings. The best features were the comfy bed and pillows, very comfortable. The televisions located in the bedroom and living room were also very good. The bathtub, large enough to lay down in, great. The kitchenette was well equipped and the few bowls, glasses, etc we used were clean and a step up from what you might expect. Toiletries were Gilchrist and Soames, all very nice. Our view from the room was spectacular, I could not have hoped for better view. View, bed, pillows, bathtub and shower, all great. I'd read where some people complained of room noise from the Roof. We were on the 25th floor and my husband's a really light sleeper, we didn't have any complaints. There was some street noise, sirens and such; we chalked that up to it being in the center of a large city. Some is to be expected. Granted, it was a little worn. (My husband said it's to be expected of any hotel.) The bedroom door scraped up, a couple of the chairs at the dining room table a little dirty, the bed skirt looked dingy and a little beat. (I'd suspect the cleaning staff the culprit in 2 of the 3 of those issues.) Yet, the room the space offered was good for the price, the location, etc and I was happy with it for just under $300 a night considering that it included breakfast. But, if I'd paid much more than that, I would not have been happy about the little flaws. The only other issues I noted with the room, and I think it's been mentioned here before, was the lack of hooks in the bathroom. We had one hook in the bathroom for towels. A little odd, even with just two people in the room, we had to resort to draping towels over the shower door. It was a huge, clean, stylish bathroom; I'd rather not spoiled the look of the room by draping towels over the shower door. Too, the furniture in the living room seemed very uncomfortable (or maybe the comfy bed slanted my perspective?). I tried the sofa and the wing backed chair with and without pillows, but still felt a little like the Princess and the Pea. Could not seem to get comfortable for some reason. The front desk staff and the wait staff we encountered at the State and Lake Restaurant were very good. They were attentive, helpful and prompt with service and help as needed. We had to check out a day early due to the impending hurricane (thanks, Irene!) and the clerk at the front desk really encouraged us to contact Travelocity about having the hotel rate refunded. Much to our surprise, she was right. Travelocity refunded the last night r/t the travel problems. We appreciated her help and guidance; the concierge's help in securing phone numbers to the airline, all their assistance was great.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot bad but not great\u201d", "Author": "TravelinGalCda", "ReviewID": "UR117834798", "Content": "We stayed at TheWit in late August for 4 nights. The one thing I will give this hotel is location. My boyfriend and I were able to walk everywhere, even to the aquarium which is a good 40 minute walk. Its very centrally located close to restaurants, the magnificent mile and the subway if you choose to take it. Here were some of the challenges we faced with this hotel. First off concierge was terrible, the girl we dealt with was extremely rude not only to us but to people around us as well. Her directions to various places were awful and wrong. My boyfriend and i ended up getting better directions from a stranger on the street who saw us with a map out, including a description of the restaurant we were headed too of how the food was and very specific location. Also, in order to access your floor you must use your keycard in the elevator. I understand this from a security point of view, great idea as there is a bar on the 27th floor. However, when people check in please tell them this, its just a courtesy. We found that many guests had the same issues that we did that they could not access their floor. This should be told to people upon check -in. Also, I ordered up room service for breakfast one morning as a treat and charged it to the credit card which I gave for incidentals to get my keys. On the Friday i went downstairs to ask concierge to check us in for our flight my boyfriend stayed in the room. The concierge did check us in however, when i went back to the room i was locked out and our keys were void. When I had to go back downstairs i was told i did not pay the room service bill and therefore was not able to have access to my room. I explained that I had already given my credit card so i did not feel it was acceptable to be locked out. The morning we were checking out our fire alarm went off in our room although inconvenient I can understand that this was not at the fault of the hotel, it happens. The front desk called our room and said that she would send someone up to check on things. The fire alarm stopped and they came up to check said things were fine. My boyfriend and I continued packing and the alarm went off again, this time for about 15 solid minutes (its loud and extremely annoying to say the least) I received a second call from the front and here is my issue, the girl was extremely rude to me on the phone. She asked \"what i was doing to cause this\"? not once but twice. I'm not sure what one does to cause a fire alarm (neither my boyfriend or myself smoke) but a quick apology for the inconvenience would have been appreciated not a blame for something i have NO control over. This hotel overall is fine. I would not be paying top dollar by any means for this hotel. I would rate it as average but nothing more and in terms of customer service, not so great.

The bed was so comfortable I could hardly get out of bed in the morning. The amenities in the room are top notch: the touch screen phone, the silver ware in the drawers, the stainless steel refrigerator and microwave. I also had a sink to wash dishes, if needed.

Everything was simply wonderful. We received a great rate from a special on travelzoo.com ($150/night), and stayed Wed - Fri night. We were worried that the hotel would be too \"trendy\" (snobby) or we would feel out of place, but that never happened, the staff was incredibly polite and wonderful. Some of the highlights: ~Excellent location, there is an L stop right at the entrance to the hotel, and many attractions are walking distance. View was wonderful. We arrive at 10:30am, and although official check-in was not until 4:00pm, they called our cell phone to tell us they had a room ready around noon. ~We had no noise problems like others mentioned, we were on the 25th floor, so we were high enough from the L stop to not hear train noise, but we were 2 floors below the ROOF bar, so couldn't hear noise from there either. ~ROOF bar was fun, but a bit trendy for our taste. We enjoyed the view and two drinks and then called it a night. We went on a Thursday night, and it was crowded, so it would probably be insane on a weekend night. We didn't have issues with crowds waiting for the elevators, but again, we were at the hotel during the week. ~We started out in the regular king room, which was very nice. We loved how the room was decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable, as were the pillows (sometimes I have a hard time sleeping on pillows I am not used to, did not have that problem). Great bed clothes as well. ~On the second day, we came back to our room to find a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries with a very thoughtful card congratulating us on our marriage. What a very nice touch! ~For our last night, a king spa suite was available, so we asked to be upgraded. They told us it would cost an additional $40 for the upgrade which we were fine with, but when we got our final bill, they did not change us any additional. We double checked to make sure everything was as it should be, and they told us to that the upgrade was complimentary. We thought that was very kind of them. ~The king spa suite blew us away! There was a kitchenette, living room area, and additional bedroom (that was the size of our original room). The bathroom was HUGE, and had a large tub and glass enclosed shower. Also two very nice robes to use. We loved that room, and was very happy that we were able to enjoy it for the last night. Definitely book a king spa suite if you can! ~The clock radio also had an iphone dock, and a USB port to change an additional iphone, very handy. In our first room, there was also a special \"bedtime beats\" button, which played soothing quiet piano music. My husband loved that feature, and used it all night. The radio in the king spa suite did not have the button though. ~There is a wonderful fast food type asian restaurant right across the street called Wow Bao. Baos are small meat filled steamed buns. We ate there several times, it was so good! They have breakfast ones with egg, cheese, and bacon. For $1.59 each, the price could not be beat for a quick breakfast. Overall, the hotel was absolutely outstanding and we are definitely going to try to stay here again the next time we visit Chicago. Location, view, style, and comfort amenities were all excellent.

Why it is branded as one is really beyond me, as it is much more upscale than your run-of-the-mill DoubleTree. The staff is probably the youngest I have ever seen in an Hilton chain and there are plenty of them everywhere. Do not confuse young with bad service - they were attentive, present, and very helpful when needed. The hotel has a different vibe, from the music piping at the entrance, through the restaurant to the rood top lounge (more on that latter). It had reminded me some hip hotels, and that is probably my main problem with it. It is centrally located. Yes, you can hear the L, but it did not bother me, as it was more of a white noise. The rooms are large and well appointed. HD TV (which took about 5 minutes to come to live every time, but once it did, it worked great), nice big bathroom (yes, the sliding door is very heavy, but workable). As HHnonor I've received my free Internet which worked without a problem. What did not work very well was the reception on my ATT 3G phone which seems to lose the network every couple of minutes. As HHnonor you'll get breakfast voucher worth 17$. It will not go very far and if you go for anything above continental (which is what they are suppose to provide to elites) it would not cover the charges. The infamous roof top lounge is a very nice space indeed, but when you have to wait in line for an elevator every afternoon because everyone (non-guests) are going to the lounge it is kind of bothersome. At least at the weekends they block one elevator just for the lounge. It is also annoying when a guest goes up there the chances of finding a place to sit are slim to none as it is packed. One wonders what is the connection of the lounge to the hotel. So in summary, I'm ambivalent. Will I return? I do not know. The hotel is hip, but probably too hip for me.

We opted to spend the night at The Wit hotel. A Doubletree hotel, it has a lot of the staples of all Doubletrees: comfy bed, spacious room, delicious chocolate chip cookie.

Not a big deal but enough to say something about. Finally the door opening issue. I travel alot and have stayed in decent hotels to top rated hotels all over the world. Wit has literally 2-3 \"doormen\" at all times (at least during my stay) and all weekend they hadn't opened a door more than once and we were in and out all day/night.

Even when out in the city and had a question, we could call and they would give us useful information about where to eat or what to do. The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious (especially for downtown Chicago standards). While we didn't spend much time in the room, a cramped room would have been a real negative considering my wife and I were travelling with our 17-year old and 12-year old sons. The decor is interesting but still functional (with one exception I'll mention below). A small touch was the nature sounds piped into the hallways (which you could not hear from the rooms) that changed depending on the time of day - very clever. The location is outstanding as well. At the corner of State and Lake and right at an L station, you can't ask for much more for getting around the city. We always felt safe around the hotel even late at night. Two areas to improve for the hotel: (1) The bathroom doors in the rooms are completely impractical. They use a sliding door that basically blocks the doorway to the bathroom. It doesn't really provide much privacy and came off the tracks for us a couple of times during our stay. (2) Wireless internet should be free in the rooms. It is free in the lobby, but staggering fees apply if you need wireless in your guest room. Other than those two things - which did not detract from the enjoyment of our trip - The Wit really has their act together and can be a ideal place to stay whether for business or pleasure.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingsland, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a girls' weekend!\u201d", "Author": "meghna1850", "ReviewID": "UR115105001", "Content": "My girlfriends and I went in June 2011.

With that said I booked this hotel for the weekend and part of the week while in town for a house hunting weekend /work week.

HOWEVER the room left alot to be desired! In fact in reading the reviews I wondered if I got put in the worst room in the hotel. First the room was booked automatically through my company. They booked a standard king. When we got to the hotel we requested a change to a double and the staff gladly accommodated, however apparently we missed out. The room was clean, but trendy or chic it was not. I agree with the comment that it was a \"poor man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s W\". The room was small and had no closet, instead a wardrobe. A wardrobe!?! Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s me but it had been sometime since I'd seen a wardrobe in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd city hotel room! Our bathroom was small. At check out I asked the front desk staff how my room compared to others in order to have an accurate view of the hotel for possible future visits, and they remarked it was a pretty \"standard size\" . They did share that the spa king included an upgraded bathroom. (Needless to say I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upgraded and after reading the reviews apparently was the only one.)

The room was spotless without a speck of dust anywhere and the bathroom was literally surgical clean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I was blown away. It had a massive deep soaking tub with a separate shower overlooking the Chicago Theater. There was more than enough room in this tub for two people to soak up to your necks and we definitely took advantage of it. I loved the tub so much I want one for my house. This hotel thought of everything, we even found a lovers kit under the flat screen tv by the mini bar with lube and condoms in it. Really???? I just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it. My kind bed was divine with super luxurious linens and lots of feather pillows\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..just amazing.

I think this is a fantastic hotel for your stay in Chicago. But it has the feel of a \"W\" but lacks some of the finer details that makes the \"W\" the \"W.\" We drove in from the burbs, arrived at the hotel and valeted or car for $45 a night. Which by Chicago standards is actually no a bad price. Not great, but not terrible. The lobby was small but clean, upbeat with clean-line modern decor. The staff greeted us with smiles and a \"can do\" attitude. The overall staff appeared to be young and ready to serve it's guests. Which quite honestly is not always the case in Chicago (and I'm a 41yr Chgo native). Once we checked in to our upgraded 2 room suite on the 25th floor, we headed up on one of 6 speedy elevators. I would recommend asking for a \"higher floor\" when checking in. The hotel is situated just inside the NE end of the \"L\" loop and has the potential for being noisy at lower floors. Our room was clean, spacious and with the same clean line modern decor. Two 55\" Flat panels in both rooms, a small kitchenette, large bath with soaker tub and stand up shower (a finer detail upgrade would be a large Rain-can showerhead). The views from the State Street side are not great. Rooms that face east are sure to feature a view of the lake or Millennium Park. My overall review of the room was very good. Spacious, comfortable bed, upscale accoutrements, quiet. The Roof Bar is definitely a draw for this hotel. Both roof top decks have fabulous views with a vibrant night life scene. Upgrade opportunity: Glass drink ware instead of plastic. Kind of juvenile in my opinion, but maybe I'm just old. Finally, the location of this hotel is superb! You are on State across the street from the Chicago Theatre and Channel 7 street side studio. You have the best of both worlds by being situated at the North end of the loop close to river taxis, Millennium Park, Michigan Ave, Chicago Theatre, State Street Shopping and a short taxi to any of the Museums and Water Tower. Not to mention the endless cuisine choices right out your door step. Great location!! My overall opinion is Great hotel, great location, great staff, great value.

However it is about an exceptional experience in where Hilton finally gets some cool factor! Shaking off much of its once stodgy image. What can be said about the Wit that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already passionately be said by others? It is part W meets Andaz perhaps somewhere in the middle. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Doubletree brand but probably more an experiment at this point with the brand name as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too special of property to really be considered a Doubletree. The Wit is more than just an exceptional unique boutique hotel that will certainly not appeal to all guests. It is so popular its can get crowded especially on weekends. Yet for many of us that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the excitement being where everybody wants to be. Perhaps for some pure torture. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the whole point the Wit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for everybody nor should it try to be! However what most guests might not realize is the Wit is the future of all hotels going forward.It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a game changer of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next. The prototype of what hotels want to be when they grow up for the next generation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the start of great out of the box thinking that may have no boundaries.

Over the years I have learned as a premium traveler that lifestyle hotels will tend to have quirks. The Wit is no exceptionWhat some see as different and breaking tradition others see as exciting .In a nut shell just like with W Hotels and Andaz not everyone will capture the magic here and instead choose to pick on the areas of needed improvement of which there is a 10 to 15 per cent factor. Having said that the positive way overshadows the negative and the 90% score here on Trip Advisor easily demonstrates its percentage of highly satisfied customers Having just written a terribly negative review on another hotel it is an honor and pleasure to sing the praises of the Wit and its passionate management Mr.Shouger who personally responds to guest comments. In house most of the team in house goes even further with numerous random acts of kindness. It was the responding to those reviews that brought me to the hotel as a customer. I applaud this hotels dedication to listening and responding to their customers praise as well as their concerns. The Hilton folks couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have picked a more fantastic visionary manager for a great new hotel concept. It was one of those rare moments in all my years of travel where I picked up the phone after check out and thanked them for letting me be a guest in their hotel. I left inspired refreshed in good spirits wanting to come back again in the future even though I have a number of other luxury favorites in the Chicago area In closing the Wit was a game changer for me personally and it made me want to be a Hilton customer all over again. If this is what we can expect from Hilton and the brand I def want to be their customer. I can only hope there are many more of these properties to look forward to in other cities and rumors are there will be. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer the Doubletree your mom and dad stayed in its Doubletree gets totally/really cool!!!

Smiles and hello's all around. At checkout, asked that a charge be taken off, due to quality of the service provided, and this was done immediately, and without hesitation or questioning - Kudos to the front desk staff. But at check-in, was grilled as to \"if the address on my license was current\" for no immediate reason, and felt as if I were back in a TSA line at the airport. (deduct points) 2) Room - Booked a 'Classic' room online, politely asked for an upgrade (as a HHonors member), but was denied, even though upgrades were available. Room I was assigned to was decent, but was in the middle of being cleaned with sheets all over the floor, so went back down to desk to point this out, and again asked for an upgrade for this error, and was given a 'Spa' room on the 11th floor. Spa room had sweeping views of the river and awesome wrap around glass walls. Average sized, but very nicely appointed and impressive room none the less. One cool feature was the automated drape controls, but they only operated on one side of the glass wall - You had to manually close the other side, which was twice as long as the controlled side, and that killed the novelty of this feature rather quickly. They should motorized both sides to make this work. The TV had many HD channels (more than most rooms have) and the picture quality and remote was excellent. A cool hi-tech phone was also provided en-suite, with a Touchscreen LCD display listing the various services that are yours with the touch of the finger, along with the ability to automatically program your wake-up calls with the 'celebrity voice' of your choosing. Room also came with a iPod/iPhone clock alarm with charger, which is fast becoming a standard amenity in boutique hotels. Bathroom was stocked with good toiletries (and a note saying that anything else you need or are missing could be provided), and was of good modern design - But did not care for the shower curtains (odd looking, considering the modern design - they should have gone with a glass enclosure instead) The problem encountered here was not the room, but the elevated railway station and underground subway lines situated *directly* below the hotel. Although the rail lines near the hotel makes this a very convenient hotel to stay in if traveling by rail, the one thing not clearly pointed out in handful of the reviews I read on TheWit on TripAdvisor was the *extremely* constant and annoying sounds of trains running throughout the night, and the numerous railcar and station / railcar announcements that can be CLEARLY heard on the 11th floor, and I suspect, on much higher floors as well, for rooms facing the streets surrounding the hotel. For the record, I am not a person who normally complaints about minor issues, and I only write reviews when experiencing either very excellent or sub-par stays - And all things considered, my stay at TheWit was a good one - But be warned that it will be practically IMPOSSIBLE for almost all travelers to get a good nights sleep without the use of earplugs for rooms facing the river or State Street (And for the record, I am a very sound sleeper who also enjoys high-decibel rock music on occasion). Be warned. 3) Restaurants / Bars - Had dinner at CiboMatto at TheWit - Again, excellent, friendly and professional service. Room was spacious with good ambiance and nice street views from the windows, but the food (tried a few of their 'signature' dishes) was passable at best. Too many other choices near the hotel to eat here unless you are pressed for time. Did not have a chance to eat at their casual restaurant, State & Lake, but it look inviting for a quick bite. Room service menu also looked good, but again, did not have time to sample. After dinner, met with friends for drinks at 'Roof', their cool and popular rooftop bar with nice views of nearby buildings, and both a indoor and spacious outdoor section to party in. Music in the outside section was a bit loud for 'normal' conversation, at least at night. Cigar and cigarette smokers should be aware that unlike most other rooftop bars, this one does not allow smoking outside. Service was just ok. Also, on this night, the Roof was closed until 10:30pm, due to a private party being held there, which I believe might be standard due to the many conventions and corporate functions held in Chicago, so if you are staying or going because of the rooftop bar, it would be good to check in advance if it will be open the night you will be attending to avoid sudden surprises. 4) Other Services / Technology - Internet access was a bit weird; they offer 3 'tiers' of paid service, tied to the bandwidth you might be using, which for all but the most techie of us, might be a bit unclear to most; they should do away with this confusing practice and offer one price for service, like almost every other hotel in North America does. A/V connections in the room were awesome, with a jack panel offering HDMI, composite, video, audio, Ethernet and power outlets all contained in a convenient wall plate next to the large 42\" HDTV screen. Did not have time to checkout their on-site Spa, but did glance at the in-room Spa menu, with many services for both men and women offered, and the prices listed seemed very reasonable. Gym was modern and functional, and as a bonus, open 24/7. Also offers a very cool and state-of-the-art 40 seat media room/theater ('Screen') available to rent for business events and private viewing parties. Elevators were generally quick, efficient and quiet, but room keycards needed to be inserted everytime you went back to your room, which is fine for security reasons, but was really a pain in the butt, due to the card reader slots being very small and situated very low on the elevator control panel, which required most people observed (including me) to insert their cards several times to get it in correctly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c New, more ergonomically designed and higher-placed keycard readers should be installed in the elevators ASAP. 5) Conclusion - Fun and hip boutique hotel overall, that offers friendly service, attractive rooms, great rooftop bar, a variety of services and features, busy lobby with lots of hipsters and young professionals hanging about, and of course, one awesome location which is situated next door to the Chicago Theater (especially good if you will be using mass transit while in town), but certainly not for those who have issues with louder-than-normal city noises or those needing a good nights sleep - if noise will be a issue for you, better to look at the Hotel Monaco or Hotel 71 (both of which I have stayed in) which are both a couple blocks away with better views and a much quieter environment, compared to theWit. ps : Also received an unsolicited phone call on my cell from the hotel management after checkout to inquire about my stay, and if I had any issues they might correct (Which was refreshing to say the least, since I did not register a formal complaint at all, except to politely mention to the front desk in passing at checkout that I was a bit surprised with the noise level of trains running throughout the night) - At the least, this shows they care...", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rooms, Great Service, Great Location - Couldn't be happier!\u201d", "Author": "luvs_trvl_and_dogs", "ReviewID": "UR105892624", "Content": "The Wit is a great hotel with a wonderful location and a top notch staff. We came for slightly less than a week to visit friends, see the sights, and just relax and the hotel was an excellent choice for all of these activities. All of the sights of downtown Chicago are within an easy walk from the front door, and if comming in from O'Hare you couldn't ask for an easier, or cheaper, commute into the city. Beside the cookie given to you at check in is the only clue that this is a Doubletree - otherwise, you would think you were in a trendy botique hotel and not one that was part of the Hilton chain. The package we booked was for a Spa Room with Internet and Breakfast, all of which was included in the rate and clearly explained by helpful check in staff. The room was amazing - we had a corner room with windows on two sides, affording a small view of the lake, but amazing views of the city. The bathroom was incredible with floor to ceiling windows, a stand alone shower, and a deep, luxurious soaking tub. Breakfast was a credit for $20 per person at State and Lake. The first day or so of our staff, State and Lake was closed for kitchen remodling and the breakfast was buffet style in Cibo Mato. Once State and Lake reopened, you could order off the menu that you can see on the Wit's web site. Everything was very good. Staff was extremely helpful and always willing to make recommendations, provide directions. And there were always staff available in the lobby. My one minor beef about the hotel - the Roof bar is extremely popular. In the late afternoon/early evening you had to fight for elevators with people who were not guests of the hotel, but going up to the Roof. It would be nice to have two of the elevators for guests (maybe with no access to the Roof?) and two that could take bar patrons on up. Overall, a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone - you can stay in a big chain, but feel like you're staying in a unique botique.

The room was a good size with moderately nice furnishings.

So the floor in front of the mirror and sink got soaked. My room had no clocks, not on the wall, on the phone, nothing, a small annoyance, but annoying nonetheless. There were 4 slow elevators. And I mean slow. The longest instance I waited for the elevator, I pushed the button, got impatient, put on my earphones, listened to 2 complete songs, and finally the elevator appeared. At night, there were a small crowds in the lobby waiting to go up to the Roof. Which meant one of the elevators was set aside specifically for that purpose. So be prepared to walk through that, and then to wait for the slow elevators -one less elevator at that. The valet was expensive @ $46/night, but it does have in & out privileges and parking in the public garages was $34/overnight with NO in & out. The location, however, was great. In the heart of downtown and very convenient to restaurants, museums, parks, train stations, etc. Additionally I arrived on an early flight and they were very accommodating with early check-in. I will, however, NOT be staying at The Wit again for one BIG reason. I slept completely covered, sweats, long sleeve shirt, socks, the first couple of nights. But the last night, I slept with a short sleeve and the next morning I immediately noticed a rash on my arm from the sheets. I used hydrocortisone and it was gone a couple of days later.

The location of the hotel simply could not be better. We parked the car and took public transportation to Michigan Ave, Museums, Willis Tower and restaurants. The hotel is located one block off of the river and a few blocks from Millennium park and is near the best coffee shop ever, Intelligentsia. The Gilchrist and Soames bathroom amenities were a nice surprise and we opted for the Spa Bathroom with the extra large modern tub. It was so worth it and the most unexpected detail. The beds were very comfortable and we both slept well. As an extra bonus, hotel guests receive free cover to the exclusive club, ROOF - located, yes, on the roof of the hotel. It provided spectacular views and even though it was a little young and showy, but the view makes it worth a visit, even if you are under-dressed! In the warmer months, they have a outdoor area that looked stunning. The restaurant in the hotel was okay - breakfast was the better of the meals. The staff, in all areas, were stellar.

Some fabulous, some good and some pretty bad. Our experience for our 20th wedding anniversary was lovely. We booked the bed and breakfast package online. It was pricey, but we wanted a nice place. The location is truly great. We had a request for an upgrade for a certain price and it was granted. So we had a suite. It was nice. A living room with big screen TV and nice decor. However, I will say the furniture seemed a little cheap, like it came from IKEA or something. The kitchen was equipped with dining necessities, but only a microwave, toaster and coffee maker. (They used \"MIghty Leaf Tea\", which is one of my favorite tea that comes in bags). It was quiet (we were on the 23rd floor, right above the EL and it was only a dull noise in the city, I can imagine it would be loud if you were lower down. I thought the bed and bedding was lovely but my husband said it was too soft. And it really is a stupid sink in the bathroom, even though it looks cool. My husband enjoyed the robe, and there were lots of towels and more than the usual amenities. Very limited cable on TV, in my opinion. No Bravo, no HI, no lots of things. No rentable videos on TV. DIdn't mess with mini-bar when we finally found it in the bedroom. Weird. Young staff, very friendly. We called for an extra blanket and got it in less than 5 minutes. I swear. Pricey valet parking..but for Chicago, not too bad. Both my husband and I were bothered by panhandlers when we stepped for a smoke. I truly try to be sympathetic, but it really got annoying after awhile. Four people one time and 3 the next. We had breakfast at State and Lake. Meh. I ordered the Irish Cut Oatmeal. It was NOT good. I sent it back after I tasted it. The waiter hadn't even left our table yet. We were charged for it. Our B&B was an extra $98.00, Our tab at breakfast came to $30.00 (plus tip). So they made well over $60.00 on that deal. How stupid was that. Also, that was for a bagel, some bacon, tea, coffee, a \"sunrise quesadilla\" with beans and potatoes for $30.00. Oh yes, and oatmeal. Valet parking attendants were nice and efficient. So was all the staff. The cookies were a nice touch (and they were good). All in all. I liked the hotel, but would not spend the money again. I would, if it wasn't for the complete rip-off of the breakfast part. DO NOT BOOK THAT PACKAGE. It is cheaper to stay over night and eat there in the morning. Also, the little card they gave me for the breakfast part said we could only spend up to $20.00 a person, so it's not like we could have gone and drank ourselves silly on Bloody Marys or something. Not that we would. I would definitely go back if not for that. Don't get me wrong. It is cute, trendy (but cheap trendy, I think) and we had a lovely night, but that breakfast thing left me with a bad taste in my mouth,,,literally and figuratively. I forgot one thing. When I read my bill, it didn't come up to as much as was charged from my account (or is pending). I called them and they said they always charge $50.00 for incidentals and that the amount set to go through would be adjusted. I guess I have to wait and see.

First impression is great because of the convinient location of the hotel, the overall image it portrays and the fact that this was a great way to start off a weekend of exploring Chicago. The front desk staff that checked us in was helpful and friendly. We went to the Roof before going to the room and dropping our belongings. The 27th floor had a great view, was obviously quiet since it was lunch and the staff again was friendly. From there, we just dropped things off and went out sight-seeing. We came back around 6:30 pm to rest and get ready for the evening. We put on the T.V. and an hour later got a noise complaint. This was surprising because nor was there any disturbing noises nor was the T.V. on too loud. This was in a \"connecting\" room. The beds, the bathroom and the overall ambiance of the room was great. Around 10:30 we went to the Roof. Obviously the party had started, people seemed in a good mood and the music was good. We ordered drinks from Johnny the bartender who was very upbeat and attentive. Security was nice but seemed to be all over the place. We met Jim Meyers who was a pleasure to talk to and very insightful. Javier, one of the food runners, was beyond hospitable and extremely friendly to us which is very much appreciated. When the evening ended, we went back to the room. Obviously, being late, we were careful not to make noise or talk loud. However, about 10 mins after going back to the room and started to get ready for bed, we got banging on the door from the room next to us. Then 15 mins later, we got a phone call from a rather rude male employee telling us to keep it down and that if necessary, they would come and kick us out of our room in the middle of the night. This to me was very unprofessional and plain rude. I have paid for my room like all the other guests, and expect to be able to talk in it, the whole night if I want to. Nor was there any T.V noise, no banging or screaming, so I do not understand what the problem was (because that's exactly how the gentleman on the phone made it sound like, a big problem). If there are people who need complete silence, then you should not check them in this type of \"connected\" room. I do not think this was a pleasnt thing to be told in the middle of the night and to have to feel threatened that I might be thrown out and left on the street. The gentleman on the phone made it very clear that we basically needed to shut up completely. Again, I do not recall having read any rules about talking in your own unit. This for me was the downfall to the whole day and night of fun we had. Very unprofessional and not appreciated at all. Check out was at 12 and they started banging on our door at 11:15 am. Again, this was very pressuring and made us feel unwelcomed and rushed to leave. We wanted to have breakfast at the hotel, but all of this pressuring lead us to just want to leave. Downstairs, checking out at the front desk, I asked for a comment card. The woman at the front desk seemed to be disturbed and annoyed by the fact that I needed assistance. Once again we felt were were being pressured to leave. I asked if I needed to sign something or if any other procedure was necessary and her response was \"No, you just leave now.\" After we asked for the comment card, she never inquired if there was a problem, or what was nice about our stay, etc. which would have been a professional thing to do and a recovery for the hotel. Again, the beginning of the stay seemed to start off nicely, but then again, we spent only 5 mins in the hotel before going out to the city and therefore had no real contact with the staff and the service. I felt like the hotel got what they wanted from me and when they got it, they no longer cared about maintaining a good customer service. Point is, I will not come back here and I will not recommed the hotel to anyone of my friends or family. It is a beautiful hotel and at a great location. However, for someone who wants to have a good overall experience that includes friendly staff members and good customer service, it is not the place to go. As a guest I want to feel appreciated and taken care of from start to end, not harassed in the middle of the night because the neighboring door has someone staying that can't sleep or has problems with me talking in my own room. It is the hotel's responsibility to make sure that both I and that person remain happy, not to call and harass me. Again, good location, bad experience.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cLuv it, Luv it....\u201d", "Author": "NoKaOi34", "ReviewID": "UR94072202", "Content": "A great Christime time getaway for shopping and theatre.

We had a Spa Suite on the 24th floor which was immaculately clean, had loads of space (important for a 5 night stay), felt warm and inviting, and had lovely city views. The decor was not my style, but I can appreciate the aesthetic they have gone for and think they did a nice job. The televisions were fabulous (2 huge flatscreens), although I do agree with a previous reviewer that it is a shame they don't have pay per view. We don't have a tv in our bedroom at home, and it is always a treat for us to wake up and watch a movie in a super comfy bed while staying at a hotel. The staff were fantastic - the lady (girl) at the check in counter was incredibly helpful and friendly, and we loved the heated cookies on arrival. The coupon for a free bottle of wine at Cibo Matto was also great, although we didn't use it during our stay. The concierge was wonderful on Christmas Eve in helping us find a good deep pan pizza joint - even going so far as to call all his favorites to make sure they were open given the date (as it turned out only one was open, and it was great). Even the service staff were exceptionally friendly, chatting to us in the lifts and overall making us feel very welcome. The hotel is in a fabulous location as it is right in the theatre district, while still easy walking distance (3 blocks) to Miracle Mile. We didn't use public transport on this occasion, but it was very near by. We used the spa (we each had a massage), which was lovely, but I have had nicer experiences elsewhere for comparable rates. We thought that the services of the spa were very limited - no steam room, sauna, spa etc - considering the pricing. The gym was amazing, although on this occasion we didn't use it. As far as cons go - yes, you can hear the El, but on the 24th floor it isn't loud enough to keep you awake or to wake you up. The basin in the bathroom sucks (poor design by Kohler), but I don't really think this is a deal breaker. On one occasion (out of at least 20) we smelt a somewhat chemical odor in the lifts (nothing in the lobby as noted by previous reviewers), but this is fine with me as I know that the housekeeping are doing a good job keeping the place clean. There were two things that could be improved upon - the mattress had roll-together and wasn't as comfortable as I had hoped, and there was no towel rail in the bathroom which meant we have to hang the towels over the bath or shower door to prevent them being changed every day. Becuase it was FREEZING we didn't get a chance to visit the roof top bar, but we will be back in May and look forward to checking it out then.

This was not my experience at all. I am a well traveled person who has stayed at hotels all around the world. The following was my experience of \"The Wit Hotel\" Train ran all night creating constant PA system announcements and the train noise heard in the room. Neighbors yelled at football game well into the night, call to front desk had them warned but the apparently thin walls were not much help. They also were trying to get into our room through the shared door at 3AM. $47/night car parking ($30 around the corner if parking yourself) BUT...On 3rd night I reset cars hour meter because of something that happened on 2nd night, valet parking took my car asking if I were finished with it for the night (weird question) Next morning I called and went to lobby. Car was there and already warm despite it being 12 degrees outside. Got in, car seat was way back and changed in height, mirrors were changed, XM radio AND FM radio both changed to different channels..okay I thought, maybe he adjusted it to park it but then my wife climbed in and was shocked to find HER seat changed too!!! I then looked at hour meter (which very few cars have) and noticed it had 1 hour 36 minutes tagged onto the car since I used it!~ I called the manager, was put in voice mail. left msg. every time I called back I was forwarded to voice mail. No return reply! CHECK YOUR BILL. When I checked out, the bill was way off! the 35 minute wait for my car on the second day of my stay was said to be on the house because of the wait. I was told \"I will remove the charge and it will be \"comped off\", I'm sorry your car wasn't ready, we really have no excuse for that\" but no explanation of why it took that long to get my car (I wish I would of reset the hour meter on that day too!)The charge was not removed. They also charged me for use of a dvd media thing that is in the room which was broke and didn't work to play our DVD despite maintenances best efforts to get it to work. To give them credit, they did not argue any about removal of charge, but I shouldn't of had to \"discover\" and dispute anything that was told to me was already removed. Kids found skittles, M&M's along with a pill of some sort under the bed, just imagine if some younger child had found it and munched down! The bathroom is a travesty of design! No exhaust fan,a sliding door that people see thru coming in entry door! Sheets not changed just remade whole time there. read tips section TIPS: Don't drink the bottled water unless you like overpaying. Dont pick up anything from the bar under the TV or you will be charged for it even if you dont open it. If you have kids, they will want to look at the bottles and things and will get you quite a tab built up quickly. Dont plan to share a room with someone you are not intimate with as the sliding door to the bathroom, which does not seal, can be seen through the side and anyone walking into the room and looking at the bathroom will be able to see you sitting on your throne in royal glory! They will also be able to smell you as there is no exhaust fan to turn on. If you want fresh sheets, ask for them otherwise they just make your bed with the same sheets. (I tested this). dont hang towels up or they wont change them out nor give you fresh ones, it seemed that we had to leave them in a pile on the floor to get new ones. I asked the spiky haired young man who brought our bags up how much he usually gets tipped, he told me $100 was normal for him. I told him he was about to be disappointed. Front desk was very helpful and bent over backwards to help quickly and efficiently. Bar upstairs was very intimate so it can get crowded fast, if you want to spend time there, get there early. I was not impressed by the decor, it was brown...and more brown. not plush or anything and not imaginative at all so I dont understand why so many call it \"trendy\". The smells in the elevators at night were gross! \" kids described it as \"poopy smelling\" and I had to agree. The elevators were fast and efficient however and I was glad for them. The sink is mismatched with the faucet and if you wash your hands you cannot rinse them without getting water behind the sink and soaking anything you put on the counter there, even if you try to be careful. Its just not deep enough to allow rinsing properly without doing so from the stream of water that shoots out at the angle it does. Expect to have to pay somewhere around 15 dollars for use of internet ( Come on Wit, at those prices, its time to free up what everyone else already has) I expected a lot from a hotel with this star rating and reviews.

The lobby really DOES have an awfully weird scent being pumped in or sprayed...it's migraine inducing, truthfully. There are some cool accents as far as decor, but I just don't get how this place wound up on any list of trendiest hotels. I didn't see anything particularly trendy. Staff was huddled in a group chatting behind the front desk until we actually walked over and made them aware that we were there. That's a pet peeve of mind.

It was also SPOTLESSLY clean, and I had checked to make sure in advance that this hotel was NOT listed on the dreaded b.bug report. Our room was completely clean. Linens were spotless. Beds were really cozy, no complaints about that at ALL. 1. touch screen Phone system in our room didn't work properly...touch screen only worked part of the time.

Lack of amenities for that price and location...amenities found elsewhere. I know that I'm used to the best of the best, but they could at least throw in a bottle of water gratis. I just did not see any reason to spend this much for a \"Meh\" experience. 4. EXPENSIVE INTERNET. At 400.00 a night? Please. I have high standards, but hey, after reading the reviews, I HAD high expectations for this hotel. Staff just seemed inexperienced, everything was just very average.

Amazing built-ins in the closet that are functional--wish I had them in my own home, omg. Dark smooth wood, chrome, stone tile, tactile fabrics and upholstery, pops of color, oh my.

The lobby was very chic, but didn't come off pretentious. The girls at the desk were extremely friendly and got us checked in quickly. They quickly explained some basics of the hotel amenities and informed us that though the roof bar was open to the public and had become a very popular night spot, as guests of the hotel we were entitled to immediate entry (the line for the elevator to the club was around the corner) and if we had any problems getting to the front, to just check at the front and they would escort us there. We asked them if a late checkout would be possible and the girl quickly answered \"not a problem\" and upped our time until 2pm. We left the lobby to go to our room and the well decorated hallway on our floor was filled with serene outdoor sounds. A nice juxtaposition when compared with the chaos of State street on the other side of the window. Our room was the basic King room but we were so excited with how modern, yet comfortable, the room was. Nice amount of space for a city hotel room and all the amenities were well placed so the room felt full of features but never cluttered. We enjoyed our room for a while and decided to go and check out the roof bar. We got up there around 10pm and it was definitely a popular place. There was plenty of room to walk around, but seating was obviously a scarce commodity. We decided to each have a drink and take in the ambiance before roaming the streets. Drink prices were about average (glass of wine + Jack and coke = $20) but the bartenders were friendly even with the daunting crowd. The hotel is located a block from the river and for non-city types, we never felt security was a big issue when walking around the immediate area.

Though you can't help everyone, the ones you do seem thankful and the ones you don't never made a big deal out of it. We returned to the hotel around 1am and there was still a huge line in the lobby to get up to the roof bar. They rope off a single elevator for that line and hotel guests have the other three to use (need your room key to get elevator to work).

Those things give me a blinding headache and make me feel sick. Not a great start. Upstairs the corridors have continous animal sounds (frogs, birds, cockerals...) and running water sounds 24 hours a day. Not amusing after the first half hour (you can hear it in your room). Also the hotel is right next to an elevated railway so you get train noise all night as well.

Very nice rooms, with great views of the park and State Street. Good on-site restaurants. Cons: the hotel had let the folks who were staying in our reserved suite extend their reservation into our time, thus kicking us out of the suite. They did offer us adjoining rooms on our 1st night and a suite upgrade on our 2nd. Very nice accommodations, but they did involve a room change, which was a bit of a hassle. The other con is not at all the hotel's fault, just a statement on who they are. This is a hip spot ideal for couples' getaways, mancations, and girls' getaways -- that definitely seemed like the population that was there at the same time as us. The downside of this, for us, was that our hallway was loud at night. There was a fair amount of traffic throughout our 1st night, and then the folks in the 2 rooms across from us returned from partying at 3:30 a.m. and camped out in the hallway, waking all of us up. I probably wouldn't have minded as much if I were off on a carefree weekend as well, but it was tough to have kids up in the middle of the night.

I was very excited to be able to stay there for a night after the wedding. I attempted to add another night to my stay, but the group rate was not available and the woman on the phone made that very clear, I understood that so i reserved a room for the normal price. Then i decided to cancel just one night where i would pay the original fee. Later when the reservation email was checked it said i would get the group rate both nights, but in a note it said that i would get the room for the original price. I was confused and called the wit. When he asked how my call should be directed I said Billing, when i finished tell my story to the woman from billing she told me that she did not know who connected me to her but she was not the person to talk to. She told me that with a very harsh tone and i did not appreciate it. As i told her to connect me to someone who could help she was saying \"hello? hello?\" and i said \"hi?\" and in a more nasty and harsh tone she said \"I am trying to ask you a question here\" I was so offended by this. Then she connected me to someone else and i told her my story and all i wanted to do was figure out why this difference of charges on the \"bill\" was showing up. I admit, I am 18 and i was handling this like an adult and anyone i talked to spoke to me like i was a child and didn't understand that I couldn't get the group rate. I understood that, all i wanted to know was why it showed up different. The woman i talked to said that since I cancel my stay for one of the nights i could not get the rate that showed on my bill. So that made me think. If i was to have kept my reservation, would I have been charged for the group rate both nights?? which is unfair to tell me I couldn't get it and then now i could. Another problem was my mom tried calling to talk to them about adding a night and they connected her to a manager so she could talk to her, but she had to leave a message. A second time she called about the differences in charge on the reservation confirmation and was connected to the same manager to speak with her, she had to leave another message. It has been a week and there has been no call back. I am not impressed at all by this, i am actually very upset that they did not have the courtesy to call her back.

It had a separate glass-enclosed shower and a deep soaking tub. Others had commented it was to \"chic\" for their taste, but I can't see how anyone would think that unless their accustomed to Motel 6. The multimedia was fantastic. The desk was connected to the entertainment center and they had connections which allowed you to hook up anything with S-Video and play it on the TV. The room was spacious, ultra-clean, and highly comfortable bed. People complained about the noise, and granted, you do get \"some\" street noise such as sirens, etc, but this is a downtown hotel, so in my opinion that is to be expected. The bottom line is I did not find the noise level to be distracting. Others complained about the birds, owls, soundtrack they play lightly in the hallways. I absolutely could not hear this at all from inside the room. It was very light and subtle even when in the hallways. The hallways were spotless. The lobby was busy, but I never had to wait much for anything. I arrived at 1pm, 2 hours before check-in time, and that was not an issue.

In the end, the hotel was fine, but I was not really wowed and left feeling a little disappointed with our experience. We stayed in a Riverview Spa Room. The room was nice, but I am not sure what exactly was \"Spa\" about it. There was a big tub, yes, but if you wanted any Spa amenities for the tub, such as bubbles, etc. you had to pay for them (starting at $25!). I called the morning of our stay to let the hotel know that this was our first anniversary and that it was a special stay. I spoke with the concierge who offered nothing special and only told me that I could buy a bottle of champagne for $35.00. While this seemed sort of lack luster, I went ahead of got the champagne asking that it please be set up in the room when we arrived as a nice surprise for my husband. He agreed and though I did not feel confident that this would happen, I had hoped that it would be a nice arrival for us. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a very nice associate at the front desk. She checked us in promptly and we went up to our room with cookies in hand. When we got in the room, I noticed the nice decor, and that there was a really nice view...but something was missing. No champagne. Disappointed, I told my husband what I had planned and I decided to call downstairs to see what happened. When I told the concierge (a different person than I spoke to in the morning) she just said she would send it up. I told her that I wanted to cancel the bottle because the point was to be a surprise and something special. She said she'd take it off the bill and that was that. No offer of anything to make up for it, just that they'd take it off my bill. So we walked down to the wine shop down the street and bought our own bottle to toast with. As for the rest of the stay, I wouldn't say it was anything to rave about. It rained at night so we didn't really get to enjoy the roof top portion of the top floor bar. Later in the evening I approached the front desk to ask where we could get desert and the girl at the desk was texting on her phone, which I find a bit of a turn off. If you are going to use your phone, you should probably not be holding it up for everyone to see--especially when approached by a guest. She was nice but wasn't very knowledgeable about where we could go. She didn't have a menu for the rooftop bar but said we should have one in our room--which we didn't. Like I said, she was nice, but just not what I expect from hotel staff at an almost $300 a night hotel stay. We did have desert in the State and Lake restaurant and our waitress was very nice and that was a positive experience. I guess I would just say it was an overall average experience. Not terrible, but nothing great. Other than the decor I wouldn't really say it stands out as a place to stay. I don't think the room is worth the cost you pay for it and I think there are probably better hotels in the area with more experienced staff for the same cost.

Overall, this was an impressive stay, and the property has a lot going for it. That said, it's not a hotel designed to appeal to every type of guest, so choose carefully. Generic does not describe theWit! The property has great design. It's modern, but NOT in an understated way -- theWit screams its design from every surface: loud prints, bright colors, funky elements, bird sounds in the hallways, showy in-room technology. It wants its design to get noticed. That didn't bother me, as I liked most of the design choices and was able to see humor in those things I didn't love, but it's not for everyone. Overall, the design of this hotel is in itself an experience, and that makes for a fun visit. The name of the hotel is fitting -- there's witty stuff, from choosing which Second City actor you want to make your wake-up call (and setting it on a touch-screen phone in your room) to little \"gifts\" that are put on your bed every day. We got a Slinky one night; one of those jar-opener pads another night; and, to celebrate July 4th, an American flag on the third night. Upon check-in to our room, we also had a nice handwritten note from the hotel's general manager and some homemade lollipops that were not only fun, but delicious! The room had some spectacular elements. Thanks to my Hilton HHonors status, we were graciously upgraded to a \"spa king\" on a high floor. It featured a deep-soaking spa tub and separate shower and, most impressively, floor-to-ceiling windows (including in the bathroom!) that offered a corner view that was almost 180 degrees. We could see the lakefront, State Street, and Lake Street. It was gorgeous -- very urban, very chic -- the perfect room for an urban weekend getaway. As impressive as the room was, there were some things I didn't love. Most importantly, the bed. For a hotel that's fantastic in so many ways, the bed was a real disappointment -- we found it uncomfortable. The bedding was very basic and not very soft. I've stayed in other DoubleTrees with much more comfortable beds. While the floor-to-ceiling windows offered incredible views, they made temperature control in the room a challenge, and throughout our stay the room was often too warm for our comfort (admittedly, it unseasonably hot in Chicago, so this would not be an issue during most times of the year). Lastly, the in-room entertainment. Although the system itself is very impressive with its various capabilities, you had to buy the $14.95 package before seeing what movies were available, and the list of movies was less impressive/interesting collection than I've seen at many other hotels with far less showy (and less expensive!) technology. [The good news is that the system includes a DVD player -- so, if you want to relax in your room and watch a movie after a long day of exploring Chicago, bring your own DVD.] While the other elements on the system, such as arcade games, were fun in concept, the controls were hard to use. All in all, though, with the possible exception of the bed, the room's funky design and spectacular views made up for these issues. Service-wise, the hotel was a mixed bag. While at the hotel, service was prompt and very polite; my check-in experience was particularly good. The staff seemed knowledgeable about the local area. Other properties in Chicago have had more nuanced and personalized concierge service, but the concierge staff answered general questions well. The only service misfire was that my partner had contacted the hotel in advance to ask them to work with a florist to place flowers in the room. The concierge was not on duty at the time my partner made the request, but the clerk promised the request would be forwarded to the concierge and taken care of for arrival. No flowers ever got added to the room. While my partner's credit card never got charged, this was a promise unfulfilled, and no follow-up by the hotel staff was ever conducted. The hotel is VERY busy -- bustling lobby and, thanks to the rooftop bar, VERY busy elevators. The sort of elevators where you stop at every floor on the way down to pick up more people and wait for a long time to arrive at your floor. That got old by the 3rd night. The rooftop bar is its own story. It is clearly a very popular destination -- and not just for tourists, but for locals. From a pure design standpoint, the rooftop space is spectacular -- amazing views, cool modern design, a great mix of indoor and outdoor seating. It really does look as good as the website portrays. The scene, however, is quite a different story. While it was (very) clearly for some, it was NOT for us: on Friday and Saturday night, the hotel has velvet ropes out in the lobby, a bouncer, and a long line down the street of people waiting to get in (hotel guests can cut the line, but have to get special passes from the front desk to do so). I just find that velvet rope kind of experience annoying -- I hate places that can't get over themselves...after standing in roped-off lines at the airport, why would you want to do it at a bar? The music was VERY LOUD (as in, had to shout to be heard by the person right next to you loud) hip-hop, the waitstaff was dressed in almost nothing and more interested in making sure you noticed they were wearing almost nothing than actually serving you something, the cocktails were extremely expensive, and the crowd...well, let's just say there were a lot of enhanced body parts, micro-minis, Ed Hardy shirts, etc. I found the vibe of the space disappointing: what could have been a very cool bar with a loungy, low-key, urban-sophisticated feel was in essence turned into a trashy Vegas nightclub. Blech.

We chose this hotel after we found out Sofitel didn't have anymore double bed rooms. So, we wanted something we considered equivalent. The Room: Very nice. Chic and contemporary. I was fascinated by the touch screen phone and the TV was a great size. We figured out without even having to read that if we moved anything in the mini bar, we would be charged, so we didn't touch it. The bathroom was not huge, but it wasn't small either. It was a comfortable size. I do wish the tub was bigger though. The sink was different...chic and nice to look at. Some reviews found it to be a major issue but for a stay in a hotel it didn't bother me. The room was very clean. I tend to find any flaw that the average person can't see, and I was fine with this room. It was very clean so I had a comfortable stay. The Location: The hotel was in a reasonable walking distance to most things. Millenium Park was not too far of a walk and neither was Michigan Ave. or even the \"Sears\" Tower...you would just have to be in the mood to walk. If you weren't, the \"L\" or the bus were right outside the door so public transportation was very easy. We purchased a 3 day CTA pass for unlimited train and bus rides for $14 and it was a great buy. We even used that to get to and from MDW airport because the train stopped right in front of the hotel for the airport. The Staff: The treatment of the staff was fine. Not the warmest, but I felt respected and was attended to whenever I needed something. There was an issue with our room not getting cleaned the last night...we asked several times via the high-tech phone and even calling in person, but I room was never attended to. When my friend and I went to talk to the front desk, they immediately asked what they could do to make it right without us even having to ask. I was very pleased to see how willing they were to fix the issue. Considering the amount of money we paid to stay there, I was not pleased my room was not attended to. But I will say they were accommodating in making it right. The Roof: we never made it to the roof top bar/club because I never felt I was dressed properly for it and reading in previous reviews, I assumed I would have been turned away even as a guest of the hotel. I would like to experience it one day when in my \"club\" attire. All in all, I would have nothing against returning to theWit or recommending it to others.

Since we arrived we received an average treatment. Nothing special. They werent rude but they didnt make any difference like in some other 4 or 5 star hotels in which we have stayed at. No smiles, not even when they gave us our doubletree cookie. Our room were very spacious and had a nice view of the city. We could see the Chicago Theatre, the River and even the Bean! Our room had flat tv in the living room and main room, touch screen phones, kitchen (but you cant really cook in there, nice trick to consume their food**) microwave, mini fridge, 2 full bathroom (1st bathroom w/rain shower and tub, 2nd bathroom is fancier w/rain shower and jacuzzi with city view) In my opinion this is the best room spot :) Could sleep pretty well considering this hotel is located in the Loop Area and is not a very tall building. Hotel has also a top roof bar, but couldnt really enjoy it since it seems to be a club and we wanted something more romantic, but is up to you in whether to go up there or not. Is definitely nice though. The location is perfect! Chicago Theater is right around the corner. Walking distance to the Chicago River, Wrigley Building and Michigan Ave. **Cons Im wondering if theWit have food quality standards because believe me, it doesnt look like it. We had breakfast there every single day and i can tell their food is really greasy and when i mean really, is REEEALLY greasy. So greasy that you can even see the oil drops all over your plate. Every single day i expected my food to be better but i always got the same, a greasy meal. So there was no mistake on how they cook. People with high cholesterol be aware or they might kill you!. But the worst part is yet to come. I found a black hair in my food which of course made me lost my appetite. So why would you pay for this when they dont even have variety of meals. I'd strongly recomend you to go eat somewhere else. There are a bunch of restaurants around the corner for less. Also be aware to not grab anything thats in your mini bar or they will automatically charge it to your credit card, even if your intention was never to consume it. The same with the spa amenities. They charged everything we put out of their place. They have a tiny little message wich advises you but if you dont read it you might get caught by surprise like us.

The location is incredible and buzzes with that gritty city vibe! Like I was in Gotham City (I guess I was:^) ) The staff was truly wonderful, door men exceptional. The Spa personnel were very pleasant and professional. I was thinking 5 star for a while. Alas, there are 6 things that bothered me enough to prevent the coveted 5th Star. Mind you, all are correctable 1.) I ate the same thing for breakfast every day, yet my bill varied by $1.10 to $2.35 over the course of 7 days. 2.) Only one waiter / cook got my omelet order correct. One or two ingredients missing each time. Food quality was very good otherwise. 3.) for a beautiful hotel, I was surprised that the room doors were dirty, or wiped down with a dirty towel leaving visible streaks. Easy to correct, but it looked awful. 5.) I paid daily for internet service which was very expensive for basic service, and if I needed to print documents, I had to go to the business center and use a credit card to access a computer, pay an additional $25 for 32 minutes and 6 printed pages. That was a little insulting after I was spending nearly $15 per day for internet service. 6.) The last kick in the tummy was $46 per night for parking. I know it is Chicago, I know I had in / out access, and fantastic doormen, but really...$46 / night! I walked everywhere because the location is so awesome. That seemed about $14 too much.

We found a special online so we snagged a pretty good rate. The overall service was great throughout our stay. The front desk staff was able to offer us an early check in (by 4 hrs). Plus they offered us warm cookies upon arrival. During my last night I noticed that my shampoo/conditioner weren't restocked. I called housekeeping and 5 minutes later they delivered me a basket LOADED with goodies.....deodorant, lotion, hair products, sewing kit, etc. Totally exceeded my expectations. We also got a chance to check out the Roof. I've heard a lot of good things. Apparently it gets pretty hoppin in the summertime! The views, layout and vibe were fabulous. Drinks prices were what you'd expect for a hotel bar (albeit much less than crazy NY prices). Having lived in Chicago for a while, the Roof is a much needed sleek downtown bar with great cocktails. It takes it up a notch without being pretentious. If I still worked down the block, I would totally go there for an afterwork cocktail. The other great thing was the yoga room in the gym! I was actually in town for a fitness event, so it was a given that I'd have a mini practice at some point. The room had a bunch of mats, a few props, light switch dimmer, good mirrors and a wall jack for your iPod. Again...just taking it to the next level. State & Lake is a great downtown location. It's near ALL of the trains, plus a ton of buses. Also, State St. is becoming more a shopping destination so The Wit is really well positioned. Argo Tea, one of my fav coffee/tea shops, is nearby along with a bunch of other places to go grab a quick bite. And finally, the rooms were very spacious and comfortable.

The shower was also great, with good pressure, adjustable shower head, and warm. I believe someone mentioned the noise of the trains, we did not hear any noise from the trains. However, our room was on the corner, facing the river so we were as far away as you could get from the trains. We were only on the 16th floor (there are 27) On another note, our room rate, booked through their website, came with free breakfast which we were more than happy to use. In fact, we had scrumptious meals at State and Lake. Each voucher was equal to $14pp which was more than adequate for the pricing on the menu. I would highly recommend the custard laced french toast with a mimosa! My spouse recommends the eggs Benedict with a flight of beer (we were eating breakfast at ~12) My husband would also like to note that this hotel serves great beer!

First of all, we used Hotwire to pick our location and 4star hotel... and got a great deal on The Wit. Come to find out this hotel is in a fantastic location and is only a few months old. So everything was beautiful and new. The rooms were large with firm but plush beds, beautiful bathrooms with modern fixtures, the whole hotel had modern funky decor. And a few fun details like in the morning they piped in the sound of birds tweeting in the hallway (almost inaudible, but very quirky and memorable.) And at night if you listen carefully you can hear them piping in the sound of crickets. I'm not joking! The Wit has wit! The hotel itself has two restaurants and a rooftop bar, Spa, fitness center, and more. The only downside was you had to pay $10/day to hook up to their internet. That's honestly the only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 stars. Other than that, I loved the location. It's right next to 3 or 4 train lines and multiple places you can grab cheap breakfast before heading out tour the Windy City. Or the Wit has room service which didn't seem too over-priced to me. We tried to visit the Sears tower but it was cloudy and in the lobby of the Sears tower they warned us that visibility was only a mile so we decided not to pay the $16 ticket price this time. Instead we spent the day taking the Greenline to Oak Park (very quaint town by the way) and toured architect Frank Lloyd Wright's home & studio. Very cool! He also designed many of the surrounding towns so just walk down the street to admire more of his ingenuity. We went to the Lyric Opera House on Sat. night and loved the decor - because in New England many of the Theatres have ornate, gold decorations lining the walls and ceilings. A very European feel. However, in Chicago everything boomed between late 1800's and early 1900's so its very Art Deco. Including the Opera House - different than what I'm used to but very cool and beautiful. Also, across the street is a restaurant called Lloyds where we grabbed dessert and talked to the bartender to find the best Blues and place to grab pizza the next day. You must try Giordano's deep dish pizza if you visit Chicago. It's easy to get to via the redline. And you can take the orange line to Kingston Mines blues club - which was amazing!

Bathroom nice and clean (though a large, flat and square sink would not be my design choice as it has trouble washing anything down the drain). I asked for a humidifier when I checked in and it was brought up to my room within minutes. Room service was tasty and relatively quick. The concierge had an umbrella to loan me as I ventured out. Check in and out was quick and easy. The business center has computers that you can pay to use, but to just print out my boarding pass was free.

While I agree with that description, there are a few critical items those considering the Wit should know. First, the rooms are TINY. Two of us could not move around at the same time comfortably. The bathroom is small and NOT functional. The sink is \"modern\" and absolutely ridiculous. Also, there was a charge for use of the Internet in the room, even for Platinum Hilton Honors members. Second, as a first time visitor to Chicago, I found the hotel to be in an undesirable location. Yes, it is near the El, but Chicago is not that big and is quite walkable (on a warm day). I would have much preferred to be on the other side of the river, closer to Lake Michigan and the Gold Coast shopping. Taxis are not expensive, so if you wish to visit sights in the Loop area, my recommendation is to stay elsewhere and make the quick trip over. The only plus of being near the El was being able to easily travel to Wicker Park, which was a great place to walk around and spend a day. But a taxi from Michigan Avenue to the center of Wicker Park cost less than $10. Finally, while the rooftop was fun and a nice place to get a drink, it is not reason to stay in the hotel. A hotel key grants you immediate access to the roof, but it did not appear that non-guests had to wait (and this was Friday night). Because we were there on points (this is a Hilton), we ended up checking out and walking across the river to the Conrad (also a Hilton) for a GREAT stay.

My experience was havoc and I expressed the issues via e-mail and was provided a comp return stay with the expressions that it would be better this time around. That comp stay came along with $100 in restaurant certificates. I was very skeptical about returning to The Wit considering my previous experience and all of the reviews on facebook of others who have visited as well as the reviews online regarding the situation that is very typical at The Wit since you guys opened. I put my thoughts to the side and decided to return for my husband 39th birthday this past Friday November 6, 2009. I checked into the hotel at 4:15pm cst and upon check \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the hostess did not 1) provide me with a cookie 2) share the literature about The Roof and offer a pass to attend The Roof in case of a rush. I say this because right next to me a couple was checking in and they received a 1) a cookie and 2) The hostess expressed to them that there was a rooftop lounge and offered them a pass to attend. I asked my hostess \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What about The Roof\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? She said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ooh it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not typically crowded now since we slowed down so you really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a pass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I insisted that I receive a pass and a cookie and she gave me a pass for two. I told her that I had a couple people having dinner with us at Cibomatto and I would like to take them to The Roof afterwards as well so she supplied me with another card with the number 6. The evening was set and we started with dinner at Cibomatto with a party of 8 at 7:00pm cst. We were seated at the chef table and dinner began, the food was AWESOME and our waitress Hyatt was equally AWESOME. The check arrived and it totaled $456.13 (I was a math major so I am swift with math) each of my 3 couples paid a portion on their credit cards. Couple#1 $191.50 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Couple #2 $90.00 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Couple #3 $129.63 & my husband and I supplied $100 in gift cards and asked that the balance be taken from the gift cards which was expressed to the server to use first. The waitress returned with all three credit card copies and stated that she left off gratuity which is fine because we know how to tip, but the question was rose by myself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where is the $45 that is left over after charging all 3 cards and taking the $100 in gift cards. She couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain so she sent her lovely manager who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain either so I explained to him to take $15 from each credit card total (which equals $45) and each individual who used cards can add it to the tip line ($45 tip = 10% of check). I went on to provide him with a $100 bill and asked for change so that I can add to the tip to make it 18%. Without listening to why I wanted change he looked at each receipt and saw that so far the tip was $45 and stated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 You guys are ONLY going to leave $45, was she that bad of a waitress?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We all were in shock because first of all we were not only going to leave $45 I needed change to add the other $25 to make it a $70 tip and secondly because who asks something like that to people spending money in your restaurant. The change arrived and I placed an additional $25 on the table and left because I was just very outdone. My husband went to the suite before the bill came to freshen up so he was not there for this initial profiling situation. However when we were getting on the elevator there was a hostess putting bracelets on people to allow them to go to the roof and each of the dinner guest received bracelets except the 3 people who left out of the restaurant before the bill was closed. Once we made it to the suite my husband saw the bracelets and insisted on going to get one for himself. He did so and low and behold the manager of Cibomatto pulled him into his office to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What did my waitress do wrong? Because the tip was inappropriate and was not even 10% of the check\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My husband had no clue what he was talking about because he knows that we tip all the time so he came back to the suite and expressed what happened and I was taken back even more that this manager again insulted our intelligence and professionalism.\\ We just decided to ignore it and stay in the suite and have fun so we did and a lot of friends from NY, ATL and LA were in town for my hubby birthday and at least 70% of the people stood in line to receive a bracelet before coming up to our suite. However there were 3 people who stopped at the front desk to just come to the suite and since I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer the phone the hostess gave them a KEY TO MY SUITE and a pass for the ROOF with my name on it (which I still have all the passes given out with my name on them at the front desk). I find that disturbing because if I was not in the suite when people arrived they had all access to my belongings and all and I made a complaint immediately. My guest began to disburse from the suite and head to The Roof with bracelets, passes they were given, etc.. My husband and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave the suite to head up until later and once we got there with the pass I was given at check-in we were told that there were too many people from my suite # on the Roof (WHICH BY THE WAY WAS NOT CROWDED BY NO MEANS) and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attend. I immediately asked them to point these people out and they pointed out some and I said look at their arm (A Bracelet), the others I said show him you pass and they did, the others were not even with us (about 30ppl) and I asked how did you associate them to be with my group and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a straight answer however I know the answer, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because we are of the AFRICAN AMERICAN descent and we were profiled as all being together because of that and all of my CAUCASIAN friends who came out and PHILLIPIAN friends that came out didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t 1) have to obtain a bracelet, 2) were not stopped at the elevator when entering the roof or even asked to present a card or bracelet. This to me was not a surprise because this same thing happened in August for my Birthday so I was just hoping that some change went into effect and that the RACISM would have ended due to the numerous reviews that express RACISM toward African Americans. The Wit doesn't cater to African Americans BY NO MEANS and I feel that they trian thier staff that way. All the positive reviews should be checked according to the nationality of the individuals because I posted a OPEN LETTER TO THE PUBLIC on FB and I recieved 900 comments and ALL WERE NEGATIVE about thier experience and those that responded negative were African American because that is who recieves the BAD TREATMENT.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cStill working out the kinks\u201d", "Author": "NAH108", "ReviewID": "UR48504462", "Content": "We stayed at the Wit for the city Marathon in October and mostly concur with the previous reviewers' comments.

The people at the front were incredibly sweet and accomadating. Although someone else checked us in, BRITTANY was absolutely amazing at setting everything up for Jeff and I this weekend..She put us in the Paramount Suite..and was so gracious to have champagne and chocolate covered strawberries set up in our room. Needless to say, Brittany was extremley helpful and went above and beyond to make our experience unforgetable. I could not have asked for a better night (out and in) for my birthday. I honestly didn't want to leave the room when we first arrived. We were FLOORED once we walked into our beautiful suite. There was a bouquet of roses setting OH SO perfectly on the counter with birthday balloons..So as soon as we walked in, they were right in plain view. We could not get over how big and beautiful the room was. And the Champaigne and chocolate covered strawberries were a perfect touch to the beginning of a beautiful night. And not to mention the hand written letter and birthday card that Brittany was so kind to write for us. I just can't get over how amazing our experience was at the Wit. Jeff and I sipped on the champaigne as we were getting ready for the big night out. We went to dinner, to a comedy show, and back to the bar at the top of the hotel..The Roof..That was the type of ultra lounge that Jeff and I will definately come back to....The drinks were great..and the decore was definately our style. That was a night to remember. When we checked out, we had the opportunity to talk to Brittany a lot more. She is definately a great asset to the Wit Hotel. If it weren't for her incredibly generous service..I don't know if our stay would have been as amazing as it was..OH and we also recieved this \"TO GO\" cookie..It was delicious. Jeff and I wanted to mention that the valet service was unheard of..We had four gentlemen helping us carry our belongings out to our car..Everyone at the Wit Hotel had a smile on their face like they actually enjoyed being apart of the hotel..and that is extremely refreshing to see.

The rooms were great - decor excellent and a good value. Enjoyed our stay immensely until we received our bill and questioned the front desk about a restaurant charge that was not ours. Not only did the front desk attendant never apologize, but her overall attitude of guilty until proven innocent did not go over well. When asked what we would be billed, given the charges were incorrect her comment was \"I will e-mail you\". It was like pulling teeth to get the final amount being billed to our card (in fairness they did not charge us for the restaurant charges), and her overall demeanor was so full of attitude that it really soured the overall experience for us.

First off, the hotel itself. Brand new, still sparkling and clean. The finishes in the room were top notch. We were fortunate enough to have a lake view, corner room, meaning we had windows on two different walls. Not only that, but a third huge window in the bathroom, with a view of the theater district. Comfy bed, huge flat screen TV, and warm cookies available in the lobby all day long. Top it all off with one of the most popular night spots in the area, the rooftop bar. You get to avoid the huge line by showing your room key. The hotel staff was more than accommodating as well. We arrived at about 5:30am the day we were set to check in. Since check in isn't until 4pm, our exact room wasn't ready. Rather than make us wait, the staff got us into an alternate, clean room so we could shower and nap. When our room was ready, the staff moved us to the correct room without any hassle at all. It was a great service experience. The location was also amazing. The hotel is right on the corner of one of the transportation hubs of the city. Whether you were looking to take the elevated train or subway, you were steps away from every line you would need to take you anywhere throughout the city. Quick and easy food options were steps from the door (Dunkin Donuts, Potbelly sandwiches, etc), and within a couple of blocks, you've got Chicago classics including Pizzaria Uno, The Chicago Chop House, and Rick Bayless' two awesome restaurants. You're also in the heart of the theater district and are very close to shops, museums and Millennium Park. All in all, the Wit played a key role in making sure we had an amazing Labor Day trip to Chicago.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL, USA", "Title": "\u201cBeen here twice, always nice\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoAlli", "ReviewID": "UR45362783", "Content": "I've had the pleasure of staying at the new Wit twice since its opening in May of 2009. Overall, the hotel is a welcome addtion to Chicago's Loop, both in terms of additional hotel rooms as well as the fantastic Roof and great restaurants. I live in Chicago so I have a pretty good sense of what works in this fabulous city. The Wit is perfectly located for people in town on business, who want to be close to Millenium Park and the Art Institute or people wanting to be in the heart of the theater district. Shopping on North Michigan Avenue is an easy walk, as is both the Sears...I mean Willis...Tower and the Hancock Building/Water Tower (ahem, American Girl). One can also get to Navy Pier on foot or by a very short cab ride. Rooms are on the modern side. Many will have a bright neon stripe running diagonally across the windows, which can be blocked using the drapes. Beds are very comfortable and the TV is quite nice. Amenities are good. My only complaint on the room is the oversized, shallow sink which creates a challenge for someone trying to wash their face. Definitely an example of form over function. The rooftop bar \"Roof\" is not to be missed. It has quickly become one of the most desired spots on the nightlife scene as evidenced from the long lines down Lake Street on several nights per week. There is a large outdoor space with good views of downtown Chicago as well as enclosed space to protect against the elements. You can also have a small group occupy a private area which extends out from the building--not for the faint of heart. There are fire pits in the outside area to warm the bodies in non-summer months. Drinks are not cheap, but the wine list is nicely diversified and the cucumber mojitos are quite yummy. Both restaurants are excellent. I had breakfast only twice at State and Lake--both times the food was great. This venue also does a pretty good later bar and grill business. The second floor creative Italian restaurant Cibo Matto, takes a very unique view of Italian cuisine and is a great pre or post theater choice. My only other complaint is the lack of on site self parking. Valet is available, however it is less expensive (at least by a little) to park in one of the many self park garages located within 1-2 blocks of the hotel. The hotel is also easily accessible from both O'Hare and Midway via the El. The Blue Line from O'Hare stops about 4 blocks from the property; the Orange Line from Midway stops almost on top of the hotel. Make sure upon check in you get a VIP pass for Roof if you are there on the weekend. The place is so popular that they have restricted access quite considerably--if its very crowded, a room key may not suffice. Last note, if you are Hilton Gold/Diamond, make sure you get free breakfast coupons for State and Lake. I noticed that they weren't automatically given out.

I'm a lifetime Advantage Gold card member, so I've traveled quite a bit and this hotel rates as one of my favorites.

For our family, it was a nice place to look at but it was best left for the young singles. The staff is wonderfull and so gracious their guests. You will notice the birds chirping in the hallways during the day and the quiet sounds of crickets at night. These sounds are piped in through the speakers located in the hall.

We had an absolutely fantastic experience, and we would recommend theWit to anyone. We will certainly be back ourselves. The hotel is in a great spot. It is within walking distance of Millenium Park and Michigan Ave. shopping. Navy Pier, the John Hancock building and the Sears (excuse me, Willis) Tower are all within a 15 or 20 minute walk. There are lots of nearby restaurants, from fast food to elegant dining. It is also within a block or two of an L stop, so public transportation around town or to the airports is an easy option. The customer service was fantastic. The front desk staff was great. I mentioned at check in that we were celebrating our anniversary. They gave us a room with a nice view. About 20 minutes after we got in to our room, there was a knock on the door. They had sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne for our celebration. That was a nice, expected surprise. We didn't need to use the concierge because we live in the suburbs and I work in Chicago, so we knew the types of things that were available and what we wanted to do. That, several times when we left the hotel, there were no customers at the concierge desk. Every time that happened, concierge asked whether there was anything he could do to help us. There was a doorman on the inside of the front door who was able to help start the revolving door, particularly for patrons with luggage. The doorman outside were constantly asking if we needed a cab or directions. Everyone we encountered provided excellent customer service. The room wasn't huge, but it was bigger than I thought it might be. In addition to the king bed, there was a couch, a large flatscreen tv, a cabinet that provided space to hang clothes and had 3 drawers. The wall unit that had the tv also extended into a desk area. It wasn't huge, but it certainly was big enough for a laptop and a work space. Even with the furniture, there was plenty of walking space, and it didn't feel cramped. On top of the nice rooms and the outstanding customer service, theWit is a good value. It is relatively inexpensive for a hotel in the area. Our stay was excellent, and we will certainly return. There are a few things that I would say to keep in mind. At 27 stories, it is not the tallest building around. As a result, the views are somewhat limited. If you are looking for a hotel with stunning views of Lake Michigan or the Chicago Skyline, theWit is probably not the place for you. Additionally, the L tracks run along the south side of the building. While the first 5 floors are lobby, restaurants, conference rooms, the fitness center, etc., I am sure that there are at least some rooms on the south side of the lower floors (say 6-10) that have some noise issues from the L. You should be able to avoid that simply by asking for a higher room or one that faces a different direction. There has also been some discussion about the Roof, the hotel bar. As I write this is Aug. 09, Roof is currently one of the trendy bars on the Chicago singles scene. It is a place to see and be seen, and many of the customers come dressed in their club clothes. Additionally, visiting professional athletes and celebrities have been spotted there. The line to get in can be long, although hotel guests get a VIP card that allows them to bypass the line. The line also uses a side door rather than the main hotel entrance. Where there is a line to get in, you will need to show your room key to get to the elevators, because it is the same elevators that access the room floors and Roof. Which bar is currently trendy is something that can change quickly, so who knows how long this situation will last. It wasn't a problem for my wife and I, but I can understand why it might be for some people. To me, the potential problems I mentioned here were not an issue, but are things I think people should be able to take into consideration when deciding where to stay. With these things in mind, and assuming that none of these are deal breakers for you, I give the Wit my highest possible recommendation.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cHIP,CHIC, and Affortable\u201d", "Author": "NieNie03", "ReviewID": "UR38873001", "Content": "The Wit is a hip, chic, and affortable hotel right in the heart of Chicago!

Hope you all find it useful. My husband and I stayed here August 7 through 10, while we were in Chicago to meet our brand new baby niece. The hotel is incredibly easy to access via the el. If you're flying into midway, it's especially easy b/c the orange line runs all the way out! Check-in was a breeze and the ladies behind the desk were very polite and friendly, and I absolutely did not find them 'shallow' as the other poster did (how does one determine that a hotel staff member is shallow anyway, are you having deep conversation?). They even endured my constant babbling about going to visit my new niece with patience!!! Anyway, I was pleased with the process and headed up to my room on the 21st floor with cookie in hand (by the way, prior to opening the sheers in your room to check out the view, wash the chocolate off your hands! I hear they are having a problem with that!) The room was very nice and modern, with a decent 'partial lake view'. We had a handicapped room so the shower was a bit difficult to manage, but those are building regulations so there's nothing the Wit could do to change that. The room had a kitchenette that we didnt' use, but I liked that we had an option. The room is truly a techie's dream, but we didn't make use of the wireless b/c of the extra cost (and we were on holiday, not spending much time in the room!). Bed was very comfortable. The lounge (ROOF) on the 27th floor has probably gotten a little 'bigger' than the hotel planned for, so the atmosphere at night is a bit strange. The crowd at Roof is very young and very 'single and ready to mingle'. They are dressed to the nines! We checked it out one night but we found that it wasn't what we were looking for (not looking to hook up as we are, in fact, married!) so we went to the lobby bar which we found to be very nice with friendly bartenders and wait staff. $12 cocktail, but then this is Chicago! While the 'Roof' crowd wasn't what we were looking for, nothing about being in the lobby or riding the elevator with the roof patrons made me feel incredibly uncomfortable, and honestly I can't imagine why it would? I didn't find anyone to be pretentious or snobby, I simply enjoyed conversing with different people and people watching. The staff never made me feel like a second class citizen, in fact it was quite the opposite, i sensed they were happy to assist my husband and I in whatever we needed, even if it was just pointing us in the direction of the lake!

This is a brand new hotel (five weeks old) and they definitely have their act together. I travel extensively for work and play and this is the nicest all around hotel I have stayed at in some time. A few things the previous reviews haven't mentioned. When you are in the hallways on your floor their is the faint sounds of basically a forest or jungle coming from the speakers. It is very cool, and is like the warbling of birds, crickets, etc. The workout room is state of the art. I am not a huge fan of Precor equipment (I prefer the Stepmill), but all of the equipment is new and plentiful. There are free weights as well. If you take the train from O'Hare the blue line stops less then three blocks from the hotel or you can change to the red line which stops at the hotel. The only negative review in this forum discusses the fact that the hotel is right on the train tracks. My room was on the 15th floor indirectly facing the tracks. I am a light sleeper and didn't hear a thing. Also the workout room is on the fifth floor and faces down on the tracks and you could barely hear the trains. The room was fantastic, especially the bathroom with a glass shower, and a cool modern square sink. Also the large TV with high def was cool as well. In room computer access was free (though I understand they are eventually going to have a three tiered charging system) and the restaurant for breakfast was excellent. The best thing hands down were the employees from the front desk personnel to the bellmen and valets. Everyone said hello, is there anything you need? Hayli (correct spelling) and Patrick were especially nice. I tracked down the manager, Russ, to compliment him on his excellent staff.

This is honestly one of my top two stays in Chicago. What a phenomenal hotel! We loved every second of it!!! Location: The location is amazing. It is about a five minute walk from Millennium Park, about two to three blocks, so is great for those who are parking there or arriving on the South Shore Train. It's on State street right by the Chicago Theater and is an easy walk across the river to Michigan Ave. shopping or Rush St. excitement. We were there for a Cubs game and the red line to Wrigley is literally steps away from the front door. Great location. Service: The service we received could not have been more friendly and helpful. We arrived at 11:00 a.m. prepared to simply leave our bags - far earlier than the 3:00 check-in time - but they had rooms ready for us and checked us in immediately. Everyone was exceedingly friendly, from the doormen to the bellhops to the front desk staff. Not only were they friendly but also there seemed to be a fun-loving spirit and joy about what they were doing. And then there were the delicious warm cookies that the front desk handed out... The Room: Our room was on the 18th floor and was fabulous! We were on the west side of the hotel with views of downtown Chicago and the River. All the details in the room were great, very modern and fashionable details from the sink to the shower to the chaise lounge in the room. The bathroom was large with a terrific walk-in shower. The water pressure was nice, the shower was watertight, and the towels were HUGE and plush. The view from the room was great as were the artistic touches. The flat screen TV was large and premium channels in HD were provided. The air conditioning was comfortable and quiet. And the bed...the bed was amazing!! So comfortable, from the mattress to the sheets and pillows to the blankets. The whole room felt so luxurious for the price (which was $150 including the taxes.) I loved every single thing about this room. It felt roomy even though it wasn't huge, and it was extremely quiet even though we were next to the elevators. The Hotel: The hotel has a fun modern appearance. There are two restaurants and one happening bar. We poked our heads in \"Roof\" the 27th floor bar but it wasn't open yet. I can see why it is the place to hang out in the city for tourists and locals alike. Very cool. State and Lake has a great selection of microbrewery beers as well as a great looking menu. (We just had a beer so can't speak for the food.) And the Italian place was slated to open up later in the summer. The elevators are very fast. We simply couldn't find anything to complain about at this hotel. I was a bit nervous because I booked it before there were any reviews on it and after booking there were two very mixed reviews. If you are here as a tourist or for leisure you could not do any better than this hotel.

I visited June 4-6, a week after the hotel opened. The lobby, all modern minimalism, is small and very busy. The front-desk staff was friendly, but clearly don't have the operation down-pat just yet. It's a new hotel, and you expect things not to be quite perfect, and they seemed a bit overwhelmed at times when guests called down with problems. The rooms are dark, elegantly modern and comfortable. They're about average in size, but the minimalist furnishings make them seem bigger. The desk, wardrobe and dressers are very handsome, and the big 45-inch flat screen TV rocks. (Lots of cable channels, but there were no in-room movies available to order on my visit). My king sized bed was plush and comfortable, kind of like sleeping on a cloud. The bathrooms have walk-in showers only (which I much prefer) with the very European removable hand nozzle. Water pressure was great. I agree with a previous reviewer about the flat sinks - cool to look at but the standing water gets marooned on them - which can be kinda gross. I ordered room service the first night - very, very good. And the Roof, the popular rooftop nightclub - rules! The location is great. Yes, the Loop is kinda dead at night and on weekends, but it's at the north end of it, with easy access to N. Michigan Avenue and the River North area. As far as mass-transit access, it doesn't get any better. The State/Lake El station (Brown/Orange/Pink/Green lines) is right outside the front door, and the Lake red line stop is just past it. My only gripes were with issues which I'm sure are related to the hotel's newness. The front desk staff were all friendly and went out of their way to help, but are still a bit clueless. Check-in was a little more chaotic than it needed to be. Also, housekeeping was abysmally slow. I returned to my room at 3 p.m. and it still hadn't been made up. And when they did come, they didn't replenish the Neutrogena toiletries. Also, the in-room coffeemakers included good Wolfgang Puck coffees, but no creamer. (The front desk staff had some cream sent right up to me, tho). And the bird sounds piped through the hallways really didn't do anything for me. Despite these minor gripes, I had a great weekend at the Wit. I liked it much better than the W Hotel on the other side of the loop - it's far less self-consciously hip. Once the new-hotel issues are resolved, this place will be a real gem.

According to their website it was before they officially opened at June 1, so we must have been some of the very first guests. That said, the official opening might have been moved up since the entire hotel looked to be open and fully functional during our stay. theWit, for those who don't know, is the newest hotel in the Chicago Loop area, actually it's a few feet officially outside the El tracks (\"Loop\") but within what is generally referred to as that area.. It is located at Lake and State St. just south of the Chicago River. The architecture of facade of this hotel includes a dramatic yellow lightning bolt, which makes for a signature look, but the signature scene of this hotel has to be fantastic roof top deck/bar/restaurant, the ROOF. It has taken restaurants and hotels in Chicago a LONG time to catch on to the fact that Chicagoans LOVE to be outside any chance they get and theWit has the biggest and best rooftop around for just this purpose. With dramatic views in 3 directions and the kind of space and amenities you would only think you'd find in Vegas or LA, the ROOF at TheWit will become THE outside destinations for those in the know. The drinks were good, if expensive $12 per, but it's really about the scene and the view. There is an outdoor part with both booths and counter bar space, as well as couches and lounge chairs. Then there is a roofed area with an outdoor fireplace and more tables, lounges, etc. In the back of this section is another outdoor space with a table that sits about 8, which extends from the roof out in space, making a very unique dining/drinking vantage point. I can't say enough great things about this whole space. We had their regular, \"Classic\", room, which was @$173 per night (with AAA discount, which they never checked) coming to about $200 with taxes. The room was decent size with nice warm yet contemporary furnishings, a large flat screen, roomy enough bathroom (one sink, shower only). My only complaints were that the AC was focused on the head of the bed so that you head was cold but the rest of you was hot. The Kohler sink was all design and no functionality, being large, square and very shallow so nothing went down the drain without help--strange and gross. Plus, the water pressure was a little low for my taste. Otherwise, it was very comfortable, great views and quiet. The beds were firm, but again, comfortable. Ask for a high floor. We were on the 20th floor and we could only barely hear the El below but if you were significantly lower down you probably would. With the decent views form our room and the ROOF bar, I don't think the rooms with a \"better view\" would be worth it, though the suites would be larger so that has appeal. Overall, a great stay and we will make The Roof our new downtown destination and recommendation for out of town or in-town guests. It's worth it for the views along.
