We even had a birdseye view of the marathon from our balcony! The major winning feature is the roof terrace. Once we had got our bearings we realised that not only could we see the Roman Forum and the Colloseum but also St Peters and the Vatican City. An unbeatable spot to sip wine and take in the views and the sunset. On the downside the interior of the hotel was more 'faded glory' than 'shabby chic' but we were travelling with friends who shared the same opinion as us, which was that at least it had a bit of character and didn't have the blandness of a 'chain' hotel. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast choice was generous, and I think that if the place had a facelift it would be even more popular.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.

The location of the hotel is excellent, but that's about it really. The hotel lacks any soul - there are no flowers, no pictures, but there are plenty of mosquitoes!! The guest lounge is full of them. There are some old plants in each corner of the hotel and some pots in the windows. I shook one of the plants and sure enough out flew the mosquitoes!! The plants are just breeding grounds. The rooms were adequate and the air conditioning worked very well and kept us comfortable at night. Breakfast was adequate, but only a tea/coffee machine so the hot drinks were pretty lousy. I would not choose to stay in this hotel again - the energy is not great because no one cares for it or loves it - it is just a money making machine.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cA nice hotel close to the some of the important sites of Rome.\u201d", "Author": "Rome2010_10", "ReviewID": "UR82898642", "Content": "My husband and I and two friends stayed at the Pace Elvezia in April of this year. The rooms were fairly roomy by Rome standards and clean. There was a rooftop terrace with fabulous views and it was convenient to some of the main attractions. We were there when the volcano was erupting and causing severe flight cancellations. The hotel personnel were most gracious and helpful with our extended reservations as we were three days late getting out of Rome. They kept us updated on the conditions at the airport. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonable price, cleanliness and as I said - a convenient location. The only negative comment would be that we were there in May before air-conditioners are turned on in Italy and were somewhat aware of street noise outside of our open balcony room. We remedied this with earplugs.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location.\u201d", "Author": "Nicole49", "ReviewID": "UR65871373", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from 5 days in Rome and if I was going toRome again, I would pick this hotel.

There's a lovely little roof garden that we went to every afternoon after a hard days sight seeing and had a glass of wine.. There is a mini market just round the corner where we bought a bottle of chilled wine everyday. Breakfast in the hotel wasn't great by British standards but par for the course for this standard of hotel. There was a good selection of cold meats and cheeses, fruit, and freshly baked bread.

The rooms are very old and simple, but spacious (we were a couple and a child ) and clean. The beds were not comfortable. The bathroom was spacious also, but the shower looked like the ones in a cruise ship, very very small. The breakfast was simple also, but with different options to choose. The staff was friendly and helpful. Despite the negative aspects, we recommend it because of the location, that is excellent. You can do everything walking and we only caught a bus (close to the hotel) to go to Vatican. You can also find places to eat close to the hotel and to Fontana di Trevi (mainly pizzas in slices and ice creams).

From outside Pace Elvezia looks grand and pretty, even the foyer and reception desk area is pleasant. There is a nice sitting area off to the left of the entrance and a computer room with comfy chairs if you need to wait to use the sole computer, available for a fee. The lifts are tiny and also took forever so we usually had to walk up/down four flights of stairs many times a day. The staff were mostly helpful and spoke english well. Our room on the 4th floor was of fairly poor quality. We had a 'family room' which consisted of one normal sized room with double bed, fold out bed and sofa bed squeezed in. The decor was old enough to be classified as ancient relics and the heavy drapes and old carpet made the room very dark and dusty. The bathroom was in fair condition, although the shower/bath tub leaked water. Breakfast consisted of powdered juices, pastries, an automated instant cafe machine, rolls and breads for toasting, sliced cold meat and cheeses, seasonal fruits (usually over ripe and bruised) and boiled eggs. We had minimal traffic noise as our windows were double glazed. There is also a pretty roof top garden that overlooks Rome, worth a look. The hotel is in a fantastic position, you can walk to all the local sites, Trevi 5 min, Pantheon 7 min, Colosseum 10 min, everything is so close. The metro is only an 8 min walk which we used to get to the Vatican. Great position, too bad rooms are daggy and old.

We were very pleased to discover that it was more than we had hoped for. Our room on the 5th floor had a lovely little balcony. We booked a double room and this consisted of two singles pushed together which from previous trips to Europe seems to be pretty common. We loved the (little advertised and pretty much un-signposted) roof terrace for pre and post dinner drinks. Breakfast was satisfactory. Nice hams, cheese, cold hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, bread and pastries, yoghurts, fruit and cereals, but a shame about the machine coffee and orange juice, and the very slow grill for toast. One older guy on reception was a little abrupt but everyone else was really helpful and friendly. The location was excellent. Won't say we didn't have sore feet but from here we did Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Colosseum, Castle, \"Wedding Cake\", and many other places along the way. Only two very minor annoyances - one was that the beds did not have any kind of mattress protector and the bottom sheet was not fitted so being an active sleeper I kept waking up to find I was sleeping on a bare mattress. The shower tray was very slow to drain and at one point I was a little frightened it may overflow, but this probably could have been easily rectified had I bothered to mention it.
