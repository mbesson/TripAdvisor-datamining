{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice hotel not overly far from the station Nice hotel not overly far from the station.... but on the other hand, if you want to be in the thick of things in Tokyo, there are better places.That aside, this is a good quality hotel. It sits next door to Tokyo's famous Waseda University, and so is very useful for academics or those visiting friends or family at that university.Being a Rihga Royal, the standard of service is high, as is the cuisine. I found the rooms not to be massive, but perhaps more spacious than your typical Tokyo room. Well appointed and a good bathroom (with a decent-sized bath).It's may a ten or so minute walk to the nearest station, that being Takadanobaba. If walking's not your thing, the hotel does operate a complimentary shuttle bus, or failing that, taxis are safe and relatively cheap.Like I said, it's not in the thick of things, but is in a pleasant enough area. Getting into the busy areas of Shinjuku and the like won't take long on the train, but there are other hotels which don't seem as out of the way.", "Date": "Sep 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR560329635", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Naniwa"}, {"Content": "A lot of space in Tokyo       Our room", "Date": "Apr 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR516948338", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "chiccobean"}, {"Content": "A gem only waiting to be discovered I stayed at the Rhiga Royal Hotel for 5 nights and can only recommend this hotel. The location might not be perfect (the hotel is located next to Waseda University), but in Tokyo location is not an issue: taxi fares are cheap, there is a metro stop nearby and the hotel offers a shuttle to one of the major train stations.This hotel is not very popular with tourists and the 99% of the client base is Japanese which makes it even more interesting.I have stayed in Hyatts, Sheratons and Hiltons in many different countries and can honestly say this hotel is up there with the best. The service is impeccable, the rooms spacious and the hotel offers a wide range of services (including a wedding chapel, photo studio and dental clinic :-)).If you considering this hotel book online and select the super saver rate: 24.000 yen (excl. taxes) for a 50m\u864f suite with a great view is pretty much unbeatable in Tokyo.The hotel staff is very helpful but do take into account that is not a very international hotel so don't expect international TV channels.In a nutshell, this hotel is gem to be discovered. The fact that this is the first comment on tripadvisor is the living proof.", "Date": "Nov 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR623530698", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "traveller973"}, {"Content": "Bestes Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u76f2ltnis   showReview(15570310, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR859227628", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bon h\u4e48tel   showReview(15570309, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR676761877", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d302401-r20095840-RIHGA_Royal_Hotel_Tokyo-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "302401", "Price": "$307"}}
