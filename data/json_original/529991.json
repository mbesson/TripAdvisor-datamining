All the attractions are within walking distance,if you don't like walking you can catch the metro or Tram anywhere its very cheap to do so . We walked and found the map the hotel receptionist gave us was really useful and we never got lost. Stop off at any Cafe for a Latte or Cappuccino cost 1 or 2 Euro's, also there are so many Restaurants or little Cafe's that you are spoilt for choice on what to eat ,Ice Creams are to Die for OMG a must, there are lots and lots of Macdonalds dotted around if you need to get WiFi that is the only Down fall I found in Rome,. ,If you need a taxi ask the hotel to pre-book you one, There are rouge taxi drivers out there who will rip you off ( As We Found out) A taxi from Roma Central Train Station will only cost you 10 Euro's to the Hotel. On each taxi is a number unique to that taxi you will fined it on the back of the Boot 3 or 4 digit if in doubt get a written receipt. There are lots of Begger's and Romany Gypsies who will ask for money keep your money hidden especially in crowded areas ( Don't be put off by this as in Every Capital City you will come across people like this) there are lots of Visible Police around at the tourist attractions this usually will deter thief's and it makes you more at ease knowing the police are there. Rome is a very safe city day and night Weather was mixed raining one minute then sun shine the next whilst there it snowed ( lol Not something you expect to see ) We got told it hasn't snowed that bad for 27yrs in Rome. Shopping: there are Expensive and Cheap shops depending what you want to buy, i shopped by the tourist area's and Haggled to get my bargains English people don't Haggle enough you can get bargains EG; Pictures, Marble Cherubs, T/shirts,Leather hand bags Belts, Purses Etc. A Shoppers Paradise . All in all yes i would go back and We would deffinitely Stay at Hotel Harmony again.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Great Western, Australia", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "AdeleL885", "ReviewID": "UR122941006", "Content": "This hotel is a 10 minute walk from Termini Stazione.

He refused to allow my son to keep a hotel room key stating \"this is the way it is in Italy\". Naturally my son was concerned regarding not only his safety but his possessions. When voicing his concerns, the idiot front desk person proceeded to ask my son if he had a lot of money in his backpack. My son wanted no part in staying at this hostel ( Not a Hotel ). He subsequently left. I immediately contacted the manager to cancel the 3 night stay and requested a refund. He was loud and very rude. Told me there were no cancellations or refunds and laughingly said there's nothing I can do because \" We have your money \". After reading this review and the other reviews you would have to be out of your mind to even consider staying at this place no matter the price. Additionally, no AC or Internet.

Forget the fact that the elevator is beyond small and that reception is on the 4th floor - no big deal. There is a horrible smell that is all throughout the hotel. The owner (possibly simply the head manager) was rude and off putting from the moment we entered the reception area. We were given a room on the 5th floor. There was no air conditioning. The room had been closed up in the heat all day long and had to be in the 90s in there as well. The owner suggested we leave the window open and turn a tiny desk fan on to cool the room (that did not work). Meanwhile, there is air conditioning in the reception area, but that is only while the main boss is there! The other workers are not allowed to have it on either. The bathroom is possibly the size of an airplane bathroom - including the shower, which was COVERED in mold. There was no tv, no internet access in the room (you could only use it in the reception area until 1:00), so you better be ready to simply pass out when you get to your room or have a good book. The rooms are so small, there is no where to put down your suitcase. The photos on their website have been altered. They are very deceptive. There is basically no where to walk. We told the owner/manager that we could not sleep there and wanted to cancel at the minimum, the last day of our trip (we booked 3 nights). He said this was impossible because we prepaid and would not give any refund. There was a HUGE soccer game happening in Rome and every hotel was booked, he could have easily rebooked the room, but was simply being difficult. The hotel was so bad, we decided to take a $300 loss and book a room elsewhere. If you stay here - you must be crazy. There are hotels that are just as cheaper, or more so, in the immediate area and MUCH nicer. My wife and I walked around for 2 hours going into every hotel to find a new place to stay. Trust me - do NOT stay here.
