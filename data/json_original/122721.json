On the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located in a city in which car is king (\"lonelier than a pedestrian in Dallas\" should become a new expression). Staff are very helpful and friendly, for example, a room was not ready when I arrived early and I received a cellphone call just as soon as one was. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfortable, the free WiFi speedy, the included breakfast buffet a nice touch. On the minus side, there are signs of wear and tear everywhere. In room 114 the upholstery on the arms of the desk chair is frayed and torn. The plastic bathtub surround has a large, crudely repaired crack around the faucet, which is loose. The public hallway carpet has so many stains it's beginning to look like a leopard print. In sum, come with a \"you-get-what-you-pay-for\" state of mind and you'll be fine here.

While the hotel is pretty nice looking from a distance and even though some aspects are quite nice; the overall feel is that of a re-branded lower scale hotel. I was disappointed with the professionalism of the front desk staff, despite their friendliness. If management/ownership took some extra time to form a solid front desk team they could really positively alter the overall appeal of this hotel. The carpets were filthy throughout the guest hallways. Every door was heavily marked by dirt and scuffs. There was a general unpleasant smell throughout the guest hallways.

Pros; The rooms were extremely nice for the deal we got on hotwire. Cons: The service was terrible! They had us booked for 3 to a room but then tried to tell us it was illegal to have that many people in a king size room. They tried to charge us $10 per room per night when they knew the number booked from the very beginning. The manager okayed us getting the double beds without charge. Then after 2 mornings of getting breakfast the front desk guy tried to say that we couldn't get 3 continental breakfasts and that we would have to talk to the manager. Both issues they tried to blame on hotwire, saying that hotwire will tell you anything to get you booked and that we payed too low so they would be losing money to give us the free breakfast they clearly advertised on their website when they knew the number of guests from the time of booking. Later in the week we asked the front desk girl if we could eat our sandwiches in the lobby. She said it would be fine but if we used the tables too close to the restaurant then we needed to ask them. Even though we didn't use the wrong tables, the restaurant people began yelling at one of my students for having food. Since we thought we were infringing on the restaurant we moved to a side room. The same people came in there yelling at us saying that we didn't rent that room, we only rented a hotel room, and that they owned the hotel. They even threatened to call the cops when we were clearly trying to leave the room. When I told them we were sorry and that we didn't realize that we couldn't use that conference room but that they didn't need to be so rude, their only response was \"yea, you are sorry\".
