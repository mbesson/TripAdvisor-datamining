{"Reviews": [{"Content": "not recommended i read some good reviews of this place on trip advisor and i have to say, i was very disappointed. i would maybe recommend it to a japanese businessman who's looking for a slightly bigger room on a business trip to tokyo. but this hotel is really not set up for foreign guests. the basics are just lacking.the rooms are big, but they all seem to reek of smoke or mold or something. i asked to change rooms and the second one they offered me was even worse. the front desk staff has really limited english. they do their best, but it can still be frustrating. the hotel has very few of the amenities you'd expect. this is not somewhere i'd recommend unless you are fluent in japanese or are japanese.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR127192383", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "rojo07"}, {"Content": "A lovely hotel The hotel is really lovely. We stayed in the Zen Suite (Suite II), which was exceptionally spacious for a Tokyo hotel. It is located in Akasaka; very close to the Chiyoda subway line and walking distance (~ 10-15 minute walk) to stations for the Maronouchi and Ginza lines. The neighborhood has lots of restaurants and clubs and not much happening in the mornings. Most of the hotel staff have only limited English speaking ability, but they are very gracious. We didn't love the neighborhood, but will probably stay there again the next time we're in Tokyo because we liked the hotel so much. The hotel has a laundry service, but it is very expensive. (The service charges by the item, so you could easily spend several hundred dollars to launder a washerful of underwar.) There is a laundromat five or six blocks away, off Akasaka-dori.", "Date": "Jun 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR918755207", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TokyoVisitor"}, {"Content": "My favourite Tokyo Hotel       twin room, 8th floor", "Date": "May 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR235597993", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GayGuyFromBerlin"}, {"Content": "Good location and enormous rooms Stayed here while on a business trip to Japan. Its in a good location in Akasaka and there are good restaurants and convenience stores on the same road. The tube is just behind the hotel.The hotel itself was a standard western style business hotel. I stayed in the hotel at the beginning and end of my stay and on both occassions I got enormous rooms with a lounge area, kitchenette and kingsize bed. We had asked for non-smoking, however it turned out that only a few of the rooms in the hotel were non-smoking so I ended up with a smoking room that did smell a bit stale. It was very clean and there was everything you could want.Staff were very helpful and spoke English. The hotel is let down a little by its facilities, there isn't a business centre and the breakfast was pretty basic. There's a nice bar at the entrance which is a great place for a beer - they sell belgian beers as well as Japanese.All in all it was more than adequate for me, but if you need decent business facilities you might want to look elsewhere.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR815053336", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "emmalm"}, {"Content": "Loved the large rooms       Balcony View", "Date": "Dec 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR582786566", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jake_Bones"}, {"Content": "Avenshell is a hidden treasure Hidden 100 yards from the Akasaka station, this hotel has large rooms, reasonable rates and outstanding service.The staff here will go out of their way to help you with all your needs.I stayed here because my son was returning home from a semester in Tokyo and I went to help.The staff helped with bus tours, walking tours, airport bus reservations, restaurants and even found a storage facility for my son's things till he returns for next semester.I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone staying in the Akasaka area.
