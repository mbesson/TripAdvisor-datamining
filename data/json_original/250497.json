The Rooms appear very clean and tidy, With free TV and a subsidised fridge that had enough drinks in, although we never used it I would assume its topped up everytime you take something from it. The shower room was clean and although the vanity Mirror was broken on its hinge I would not hold it against them. the bad sides are not really that bad but only stuck out to me, the Key card that has to be input inside the room has 3 bright LED lights inside that when the main rooms lights are off, iluminate the whole room making it hard to face that way of a night time almost impossible to sleep with (I don't think you get this on floors 2 and up). Also the air conditioning seems to be lit up too inside which has the same problem but not so bad. The Bed's are very hard and they come with the thinnest of pillow's with only one extra pillow in the room between two. the bed sheet's are not quite warm enough for the evenings at this time of year also. the Breakfast's arn't great, the variety wasn't that extensive as some people claim. its ok if you are happy with Scramlbed egg and the rindiest of bacon for the only hot food in the morning, The Bread Rolls needed a blow torch to cut open they were that hard. The pastries were nice though. aside from all that I WOULD stay here again. the light problem was resolved by using an old reciept wrapped around the card to block out the light, the single pillow issue was not a problem as it gave me an excuse to get close to my Girlfriend every night. and as for the food we was never out of bed in time to take advantage", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Emwa90", "ReviewID": "UR119418440", "Content": "While I wouldn't say the facilities were exceptional, the hotel was clean and comfortable.

Rome is certainly worth seeing. It is spectacular. But buy a good guide & a map as the information in the streets is sparse & it can be difficult to navigate the city without a good map. HM is a small, quiet hotel & most of the residents were 40 & older. I saw no kids while we were there. Location: The best thing about Hotel Milani is its location, a 3 minute walk to Termini Central Station. At Termini, you can easily access any bus or metro lines. (Bus # 40 or # 64 will take you from Termini to Vatican City.) The public transportation service of Rome is efficient, inexpensive (1 Euro for a ticket) & will take you anywhere. There is also a bus that goes to the Airport. Many of the sightseeing places are close enough to just walk there. Piazza della Repubblica is a 10 minutes walk. We walked from the hotel to the Piazza Navona & it took us about 50 minutes. Room: The rooms are small, but very clean. However, there was only a shower & no bathtub in our room. After walking all day in the streets of Rome, a nice relaxing bath would have been nice. If you are planning to buy food at a grocery store (Despar, located also at Termini station, on the Marsala street side), know that there are no little fridge in the room. There are also no safe, but free safety boxes are available at the reception if you want to leave your passport there. If you have mobility problems, be sure to inform the hotel before you get there because some of the room are located on the 5th floor & the elevator stops at the 4th floor. There is a small TV in the room, but only Italian channels. Food: Breakfast at the hotel is also very basic. It is exactly the same thing every morning: some fruits, yogurts, cereals, jams & bread, some croissants & a coffee machine. It is a self-service. You could easily have breakfast somewhere else but just be aware that eating in Rome is expensive, and that the prices can vary considerably from one lace to another. I saw cappuccino prices varying from 1 to 5 Euros.

We looked for a hotel near the Termini station, where you can go straight by train from the airport. There was a lot of hotels to choose from, and the Milani hotel got some good reviews, and some not so good. And we are not picky people.. We know that we get a 3 star hotel when we pay for 3 stars At the airport, Leonardo da Vinci, we were looking for the train to Termini station, but ended up in a shuttle bus instead, which dropped us off at the hotel. It cost 45 euro. The old man in the front desk wasn\u00b4t very service minded. Sometimes he didn\u00b4t even bother to look up when spoken to. He wasn\u00b4t very keen on talking either, just answering Yes or No if we asked him something. Boring man!! He did NOTHING to make us feel welcome in his country. We had a bedroom for 3 persons. It had 2 rooms with a connecting door, that was nice for our teenage son. But the beds were hard, especially our sons. The room was spacious and clean and they changed towels every day, even if we didn\u00b4t put them on the floor for cleaning. Yes, the best thing was the room, except for the beds. Breakfast was included. Nothing to write home about. It was american buffe type of breakfast with yoghurt, bread, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon and so on. The only GOOD thing was the yoghurt. Different flavour every day. The boiled eggs were green inside, same with the scambled eggs, and the bacon didn\u00b4t seem to have been near the frying pan. The bread was of the harder kind, been too long and too hot in the micro vawe. The cappucino was also good. I think there is more to expect from a 3-star hotel than this. Yes, I forget to mention the complimentary coffee they serve in the afternoon. It tastes nothing. Don\u00b4t drink it. The location was good, near the Termini station, where you can also find buses, metro, and a lot of sightseeing tours, hop on and hof off- tours. We picked the Green Line Tours, and got off at the Vatican. There are no long distances in Rome, you can actually walk to all the famous buildings. But bring comfortable shoes! You don\u00b4t have to go hungry in this city, there are a lot of restarurants for food and ice-cream. We loved the city of Rome, with all its interesting history.

We knew we would not be able to check in until noon, even though we got there at 10:30 a.m. after an overnight flight. We stored our bags at the hotel and went for a walk. The reception area is small and the baggage room, just off the reception area, is not locked or secure. We walked in and out twice. There were other bags there too, so if you have valuables don't leave them. They will not let you check in one minute early - even though the room is ready, so just be ready to wait. My husband slept in the chair in the lobby from 11:30 until noon when they let us to our room. Then, boy was I disappointed. The room is okay if all you want is a place to sleep. I travel quite frequently and was expecting something above a Motel 6 type hotel. The positives - the room is clean except for the mold growing all over the shower. The shower was huge and, until the heat came on, had great hot water. We think the heater also heats the water so when the heat was on (very little) the water wasn't as hot. We had a window in the shower that wouldn't close all the way, so the cold air came in while we took showers. The bath towels were great - bath sheets. Not super thick but they were nice. The sheets were changed every two to three days. We were there 8 nights and they were changed three times. The wake up calls were always on time - never late. The breakfast was decent, but basic. We aren't big breakfast eaters, so a roll and tea were fine. They had the same thing every day - fruit, eggs, rolls, yogurt. The hotel is convenient because it's two blocks from the Termini. But this is not a nice side of town. There were homeless people and drunks laying on the sidewalks. One guy, every night, was peeing on the wall and drinking his beer. It smells like urine and the streets and sidewalks are full of trash. Be aware, everyone in Rome smokes, so if this bothers you, rethink your trip. Negatives - the entire staff, except for one bellman, were very rude. No please's or thank you's for anything. The bed was awful - think of the bunkbeds you had as a kid. The spring with the mattress sitting on it? That's what this hotel has. No box spring, just a mattress on a metal base that has springs hooked to the frame. My back killed me every day! The pillows are aweful! How can a pillow be hard? I don't know, but they are here. I asked for a feather pillow or something softer, but as with most things they didn't know what I was asking about or chose not to understand. Bring your own soap, shampoo, etc. The soap bars are 1 inch by 2 inches - good for hands but nothing else. I had packed a bar of soap and that worked out. I also packed our own shampoo. They give you little packets, if you want to use them but they don't lather much at all. There is no dresser or chest of drawers. There is a wardrobe with about 8 hangers and two small drawers at the bottom. That is all the storage space. We had to stack our clothes in the bottom of the wardrobe. When you go to Italy for 10 days, you need some room to unpack. This was a pain. The place is really old. The wall paper is tearing from the walls in places and it needs to be redone. I understand some rooms have been renovated but though we asked, we weren't given one of those rooms. It's VERY noisy. The walls are super thin and you can hear everything (I mean everything) from the room next door. All of the TV is in Italian. The only English channel is MTV. Most other hotels seemed to also have CNN in English, but we didn't. We also traveled to Florence, Naples (Pompeii), and Venice. Rome and Naples are by far the dirtiest. I urge people to stay in Florence.

After scrambling a bit, we \"settled\" on the Milani. After reading a few reviews, I was a bit apprehensive. We arrived on 4/13/07 for a two night stay, and once we were able to check in, we were pleasantly surprised. You could tell the rooms we had were newly renovated... there is still work going on in the hotel on some of the floors. My big thing is whether rooms are clean, and yes, the bedroom area and the bathroom were clean and new. Plush towels in bathroom. Only 'complaint' was that pillows were flat but that seemed the norm in other hotels I stayed in while in Italy. My room faced the street. Even though we were in Rome in early April, the weather was on the warm side during the day. The air conditioning was not functional in April so that meant sleeping with the windows open. Thay was fine from a comfort factor, but from a noise factor, it was loud. The street is narrow and sound just bounces off buildings. I was so exhausted that although some sounds were startling during the night, it wasn't totally unbearable. Breakfast was ok... it was my first time in Europe & I soon became aware that European breakfasts aren't similar to what we used to in the U.S. The \"bar\" is basically a room with tables and a counter area where you can order drinks. Again, something that seems to be the norm so you just adjust. You make your own fun, which we did. Some misc. points: - Location was great if you wanted to be close to the termini (train station). - There were a couple of places to eat within walking distance, and a supermarket and taxi stand a couple of blocks away but really no nightlife within walking distance. - The staff was ok, not overly friendly but certainly not rude. They would call taxis when we asked. - One key per room... when you are sharing with someone and one wants to stay in and the other doesn't, it's tough getting another key from the hotel. You need to have the key in the room if you want to keep electricity running. - Internet access (PC) in lobby available for a fee. - Small elevator... no more than a couple of people can fit and baggage.

The reception clerks were pleasant and helpful. They went to great lengths to help me print a tour voucher that was emailed to my yahoo account instead of faxed to the hotel. Breakfast was better than I expected. Cereal, yogurt, fruit, cold cuts, rolls, croissants, generic nutella, hot eggs (though not my thing) and bacon. The location was fine. No one really enjoys hanging out at a train station, but it was fine to walk around and the hotel is a two streets away and the \"seediness\" does not carry over. There are a lot of people around at all hours at the Termini (yes, it includes some homeless at night) so I never felt unsafe. Moreover, if you come out of the side of the Termini, you can avoid the buses and people out front. The location from a touring perspective was fine. We walked everywhere and occassionally rode the metro, though it closes early at night. The hotel is a 15-20 minute walk from the Trevi Fountain and Ancient Rome. We walked the whole way to Trastevere.

I will start by saying that the location is great for getting around Rome by bus or Metro and if you want it is walkable we walked to the Colosseum. The hotel itself was clean enough the staff weren't exactly friendly apart from the cleaners. We went with another couple and each booked a double room b & b when we checked in they agreed it was two double rooms and in the new part of the hotel, but when we got to our room ours was a Twin Room. The beds were small for my husband who is 6' 2\" this was not very comfortable so we asked whether we could change rooms straight away. Unfortunately we couldn't and it took them 3 days to change us after meeting with the Manager who wasn't helpful at all. They moved us into a smoking room which of course is OK if you smoke but we put up with it. The room was OK apart from the toilet not working probably , the shower head attachment didn't stay up so you had to shower whilst holding the attachment and ending up with only a couple of light bulbs working at the end of the week. (and this is the \"New\" part of the hotel). Also, ladies take your own hairdryers they are not what you will be used to. The hotel is pretty noisy this might not be the fault of the hotel I don't know there was a few loud bangs during the night but we never found out what they were from. The Breakfasts in the hotel were pretty poor we had it on the first day and then decided to go out for breakfast after that. The coffee is especially not very Italian!! When we came to check out the reception wanted another 20 Euro's a night per couple for an upgrade (probably the double rooms) which of course neither of the four of us were told about when we checked in, and we had already paid in full to the Travel Agent we had booked the hotel through when we booked 2 months earlier.
