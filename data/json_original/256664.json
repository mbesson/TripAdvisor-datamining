There is a Coles supermarket just across the road to purchase bread, cereal, milk etc. and the Waldorf provide tea and coffee in the kitchen.

We were in a two bedroom apartment at a very reasonable rate for the centre of the city. The apartment was spacious, but, although it had been cleaned, dull and grubby-looking. The carpets were heavily stained although obviously vacuumed, the net curtains were black with dirt (can't tell about the heavy curtains as they were dark green anyway), the bathrooms a bit mouldy in places, several lights did not work, one of the wardrobes smelled musty and could not be used and had to be kept closed, the washing machine missing was missing a couple of knobs (therefore it was not possible to use it) and the air conditioning/heating did not work on the winter setting and constantly blew cold air. We had to turn it off altogether as the apartment was very chilly - it was very cool in Sydney anyway. This is the first accommodation where we have actually had to use the extra blankets. No advance warning was given that the pool area was closed for maintenance. Also, we had to remove our car from the hotel car park for most of one day whilst the car park was pressure-cleaned. One reason we chose this hotel was for the parking as we did not intend to drive around Sydney for the two days we were there and we ended up having to use public parking which cost us the best part of AUD50 for a few hours and interrupted our plans for our very short visit to the city. We only found out about the pool closing and the car park problem by way of signs in the lift. The staff gave us no indication of this when we checked in considering they must have known about the arrangements for the pool and car park. Liverpool Street and the surrounding area is also very grubby although on the edge of Chinatown which is much vaunted as a tourist attraction. The hotel website looks impressive, but, this was one of the most disappointing bookings we have ever made anywhere in the world. As we were only there for two days we did not wish to take up any more of our time advising reception of our concerns and these problems should be obvious to the management anyway.
