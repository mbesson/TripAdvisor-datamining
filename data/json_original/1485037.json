However, once we had worked out how to get around this, we had a very comfortable stay here. The bed was large and comfortable, the room was very nicely decorated, well cleaned every day, and the bathroom was good.

Our only issue was that we booked our trip through a 'latedeals' agency and we got the room (156) which turned out to be the smallest in the hotel and located by the kitchen so guaranteed to get an early wakeup. Although having a nice decor, like all the rooms, there is no view and you will have to live out of your suitcase.

Now the rooms, the Paruta suite is narrow but looks expensive , the murano chandelier is gorgeous but bathroom is tiny, NOT impressed. Junior Suite with the Canal view is a much better choice as the room is very well spaced out and it does not look like a narrow lane like the Paruta suite, although the bathroom is smaller in this one but still very happy with the room. the staff is always ready to help and as there not many people working in the hotel they are constantly working hard to make their guests happy.

I could not be happier with my hotel choices, one of which was the stunningly beautiful Palazzo Paruta. My brother stayed in a standard room, my sister and her boyfriend in the superior room and my boyfriend and I splurged on the Junior Suite with a canal view. All of the rooms were gorgeous, but walking into my room was like walking through a time portal to old Venice. The room was huge and elegant, decorated with marble, gold and red so that you feel like royalty. In the center hung a huge Murano chandelier that I think I could have looked at for hours. The very large windows open wide so you can view the canal and the small bridge leading into the hotel. Venice is a quiet city, so we left them open at night to let the breeze lull us into sleep... Palazzo Paruta was our first hotel, so we arrived tired and disheveled from the airport. We were too early for check-in, but they let us do the paperwork and stored our bags for later. They were cleaning up breakfast and kindly made us all espressos and some delicious chocolate mousse which gave us enough of a sugar kick to press on until check in. That was above and beyond and it made us feel very welcome and at home. We left for lunch and, by the time we came back, our rooms were ready. Breakfast in the morning was delicious, the staff was very friendly and the check-out was a breeze. The location of the hotel is perfect - far enough away from San Marco to retire away from throngs of tourists, but close enough to get everywhere (Rialto, San Marco, Dorsoduro) quickly. If I return to Venice, I will surely stay here again. Thank you Palazzo Paruta for a truly lovely experience. P.S. Before we arrived in Venice, the hotel helped us make a much coveted dinner reservation at La Zucca in Canareggio. It was nice to have their help and it really speaks to the level of service that they provide to their guests.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cTruly amazing experience\u201d", "Author": "speedrail", "ReviewID": "UR119370513", "Content": "Recently spent three nights at the Palazzo Paruta with my girlfriend, and we were absolutely amazed by the hotel.

After seeing the beautiful Paruta suite advertised in the Palazzo's website, I was drawn to it immediately, thinking would I be lucky enough to own this suite during Carnevale, 2011? Yes, I was, after cancelling another Grande Canal facing new Palazzo which uses modern day furniture for their rooms (yucks, but pardon me). Admittedly, I only stay at easily located Venetian hotels during past visits - either on Riva degli Schiavoni (Londra Palace, Metropole, Savoia e Jolanda for great Lagoon views) or next to Vaporetto stops (Palazzo Stern, Foscari Palace, Ca Sagredo, Luna Baglioni for easy accessibilty ). So this is the very first Venetian hotel that is harder to locate. But I have done enough research and found this Palazzo within 5-6 minutes of walking from the Sant Angelo vaporetto stop. So, it is not that difficult to find if you do enough home work. Check in was cordial and prompt by Ms Alessandra. My first impression on seeing the Paruta Suite (room 157) was - Wow, it was worth it just for the Murano chandelier alone! Second impression was - the suite sure looks much smaller and older than in the advertised pictures. But still, I really enjoyed our two nights stay in this huge, 50sqm suite, and we slept like babies (very comfy beds and pillows - hard to find in Italy!). I kept looking up at the gorgeous stuccoed ceiling and colourful stuccoed walls - really amazed and impressed by the Venetian artists of bygone years! The suite has 3 very tall windows, facing two internal courtyards, looking either at the Hotel's other rooms or at someone elses ' apartments. The long and narrow balcony that comes with the suite was not to be used as it was rather dirty and there are no chairs nor tables to sit on it. Bathroom wise, it was certainly less than 50 sq feet in overall size. With two persons in it at the same time, you can't help but to feel quite cramp. There was no shower nor jacuzzi here. You would have to shower in the tub but there is a screen to block off water. The tub was rather narrow, in my honest opinion and I am only medium built. But almost everything in the bathroom was covered in white marble though. A small minibar was in the suite that offers biscuits, chips, chocolates, wine, beer and drinking water, all at very reasonable prices (say 3-5 euros each). This is surely a good gesture indeed as I could not locate any supermarket in close promixity. And needless to say, the Hotel's common areas are indeed beautiful, quite palatial, charming and very well kept. Lastly, the often mentioned breakfast was indeed really very good! It was much better than some 5 star Italian hotels that we had stayed at. Surprisingly, we could find items that are not seen at other hotels' breakfasts here - beans with ham, cheese baked with prawns and mushrooms, grilled vegetables - YUM! OK, now for the not so goods - only plastic cups are to be found in the suite, no glass cups, so if you are travelling with a small travel kettle like us, good luck! The TV was only 26 inches flat screen, deemed to small for such a large suite. And don't know if we were unlucky, we could not locate a single English TV channel while there? And the free Wi fi was also very spotty, only managed a 2-3 hours during a 3 days stay. Toiletries given was the kind of bath foam combined with shampoo type, so go figure ... But the worst complaint has to be having to walk on 'ICE', yes, imagine terrazzo floors at 0-8 degree C during early March and when we asked for slippers, their answers was a NO - we don't provide them. Not really 4 stars after staying all the 3-5 star hotels in Venice and all over Italy! Overall, we have had a great stay at this bella Palazzo. At their highest Carnevale peak, this suite was going for 300 euros a night. So if you could get it for say 200-250 euros, I would say it is still pretty good value. Go for it, you shouldn't be disappointed (though my husband was as he is a technology guy - no English TV channels and no internet connection is a big turn off for him!). To the owners of this new Palazzo - Bravo for a job well done but don't be penny wise and pound foolish. Don't save on that few euros as I seriously felt that your Palazzo has great potential, really!

The place is just great, and we would return there in a heartbeat.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTouch of class\u201d", "Author": "SL51", "ReviewID": "UR93711907", "Content": "This is an excellent hotel within easy walking distance of St. Marks and Rialto.

When I asked her about internet access, she instantly printed me a code that we would use to login from our laptop. It worked seamlessly. Our room was clearly recently rennovated - wow! It had beautiful wood floors and these purple and silver wall coverings. It felt very posh and modern. The bathroom was a great size with a bidet, toilet, and shower. Given a bad experience at a hotel in Florence, we were thrilled to see that the shower actually had a door! Breakfast the next morning (complimentary) was amazing.

The staff was very knowledge and helpful when making recommendations on directions, sights to see, restaurants and other small facts about the city. The room was a good size. We stayed in a standard room and a junior suite and both had plenty of room. The breakfast was a gourmet breakfast. The location of the hotel was great for sightseeing. If you stay at this hotel you have to eat at a restaurant that is very close to the hotel the food is amazing. Rosa Rossa has truly wonderful food and great service! The hotels staff can tell you were the restaurant is since it is so close to the hotel! Things that are not ideal: Although it is a very nice hotel, there are very few employees. All the employees work very hard but with only a few employees it can be challenging to provide the service that a hotel with many employees can provide. Also, the location can be challenging when arriving to and departing from the hotel. It is not on the Grand Cannel, so depending on the water level they have to drop you at a water taxi station about 3 min from the hotel and you then have to pull your luggage to or from the hotel. If the water level is low though a personal water taxi can drop you or pick you up right at the hotel dock.
