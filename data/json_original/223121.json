The receptionist was a young lady name Shantell who answered my call. She had a very welcoming voice and made the reservation for me. As I was asked questions from the school (Lincoln), I called Shantell to get the answer. I called her several times and her pleasant voice was the same as it was the first time, so much so that she was able to say, Hello Ms. Acoff and we laughed about that. I thanked her for her pleasant attitude and hoped that she was going to be there when we arrived. Because she was so nice, when hurricane Issac went through New Orleans, I felt a great concern for them at the Holiday Inn that I called to find out if she was safe. When we arrived I left a package for Shantell because had been extremely helpful to me to get the information back to the school. Thanks again Shantell for ALL that you do and your kind spirit. Upon my stay I met a young lady name Juanita who was just as helpful as Shantell.

Hotwire got me a pretty good deal again for this year's iteration of the convention, and I was pleased to find that I knew the hotel from my previous stay. Since my last stay, though, the hotel has undergone a comprehensive renovation. Hallways are newly carpeted and I think painted, while guest rooms are much nicer with stylish decor and furniture (dark gray and red walls with Warhol prints!) and feel bigger. Lots of counter/desktop space, lots of electrical outlets (which most hotels don't seem to have), big flatscreen TV. There was construction outside (I believe they're putting in a new streetcar line on Loyola Street), but we didn't hear a thing. The blackout curtains certainly do darken the room: a couple times I got up and dressed in the dark because my travel companions were still asleep...and then was shocked by how bright it was when I got outside! My travel companions enjoyed the guest laundry facilities and the swimming pool, though I didn't get a chance to use either. We parked a car for our stay, and though expensive ($26.75 I believe), the convenience of not parking someplace cheaper (and having full 24/7 in & out access) was worth it. We extended our Hotwire reservation by a day because we found ourselves near the hotel earlier than we expected. That worked fine, except we had to check out and check back into the same hotel (though that took literally about thirty seconds to receive new key cards; not bad at all.) The front desk blocked off the room for the entire duration of the stay when I mentioned this, so we wouldn't have to change rooms, which we appreciated. All the staff was incredibly helpful, especially Brad at the front desk (who broke $20 bills for me a couple of times so I could take the bus/streetcar) and Oswald at the bell desk, who cheerfully helped us with our many heavy bags and gave us good restaurant recommendations besides. But I feel like I shouldn't single anyone out, since everyone was so very friendly. We had no problems during the stay, with the possible exception of needing more towels a couple times, but our requests were instantly filled. (Also, the previous occupants had left a plastic wand of soap bubbles in the room, which was left alone by the housekeepers.) The shuttle service to the cruise port would be useful if it went more places, but if you're going there I can see how it'd be very helpful. It's about a ten-minute walk to the Quarter, and while the terrain can be very quiet -- downright deserted on some blocks -- I never felt unsafe. There are 24-hour drugstores and convenience stores close to the hotel, and I was glad that our room had a fridge for storing the drinks I brought along, which were very nice to have after a long day of imbibing. At any rate, I'd unquestioningly recommend this hotel as a great value in downtown New Orleans, and one of the most consistent places I've stayed there.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jupiter, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel.

I went to NOLA to celebrate my 21st birthday, and stayed two nights with a group of friends. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to Bourbon street, but it wasn't bad. I walked both during the day and at 3am and nobody bothered us. I would not recommend walking alone anywhere in NOLA, but that is just me... with my friends it was fine, and even if I had to walk it alone, I doubt anything would have happened. I didn't even see any suspicious activity. Pros: comfortable beds, clean, spacious rooms, close to canal street-yet away from the noise, good price, modern look, in-room refrigerator/microwave, price (I booked on Hotwire and it was about half the cost of everything else near that area) Cons: elevators are VERY slow and there are not enough of them to service 18 floors worth of people, difficult to get special requests, pool was always filled with kids, expensive parking-$25/day (but it IS NOLA, so parking isn't going to be cheap anyhow) The only issue I had was when I first checked in and they wouldn't give me two rooms next to each other. I booked 2 rooms when I made the reservation and I had called twice before the trip and made the request for the rooms to be next to each other. They said, \"sorry, we are too full to get two rooms even close together\" (and they were full, but I had called several weeks and even that morning to confirm my request had been entered). Once I asked the manager, however, she was able to get my two rooms next to each other-so if you have any special requests, be prepared to stand your ground and talk to a manager.

This hotel was selling for about $60 on Hotwire. For that price, it was an absolute bargain. It's a solid three star hotel, near the Superdome and within walking distance of the Quarter. It's older, or at least it feels that way. As I recall the hallways had carpeted walls. The room was decent but had an old style wall unit air conditioner and there was no happy medium on climate. If you were within a three or four foot radius of the unit, it was blasting cold, but even still the rest of the room was warm and muggy. Of course, that's more to do with the city than the AC, but it would have been somewhat unpleasant for more than a night. The bottom line is that if New Orleans is a dream destination for you, aim higher in your choice of hotel, and if you are there on business with the client paying, there are better options.

This is not five star by any means, but if you're looking for a decent place to spend the night, I would highly recommend this hotel, especially if you're a family on a budget. There are Louisiana sight-seeing books that are filled with coupons and the concierge is very knowledgeable about available tours and things to do in the city. However, be forewarned about a couple of things that have NOTHING to do with the hotel. First, they are doing a lot of construction outside the hotel, so don't be surprised if you wake up to jackhammers around 9:00 a.m. Second, the hotel concierge takes a fee for booking tours you can book on your own. Third, taxis here have a very odd pricing scheme. For example, a family of four can get from here to the French Quarter/French Market (about 4 miles away) for about $11; however, the two-minute 1.2 mile cab ride from the cruise ship dock cost $33. Wanna go to the airport from here? $15 per person, or $33 for one. As I said, taxi fares are wacky so you need to be prepared to cough up more $$ if you don't get your fare ahead of time. This hotel is a little off the beaten path, which can be a positive or negative depending on your needs. The only close store that we could find here was Walgreens. Everything else was back in the French Quarter which is about 1.5 miles away if you want to walk it (which is totally doable). I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone coming to New Orleans for the first time or if you are bookending your cruise with a night or two in New Orleans.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "redding, CA", "Title": "\u201cA mediocre hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "traveladdict2", "ReviewID": "UR132686719", "Content": "We stayed here for a week at a reunion in June.

After trying the breakfast buffet the first morning, we knew we wouldn't return. Very meager selection of \"packaged\" eggs, bacon, tough sausage, fruit. But after looking at other guest's plates in the restaurant who had ordered off the menu, their food actually looked delicious. So I'd say if you're eating in the hotel, skip the buffet and order off the menu. To get to the French Quarter, I'd suggest taking a cab (about $7 - $10 for 4 people), especially at night. But if you want to go to Harrahs, or anywhere down Poydras Street, you can easily walk. It's not far. I never felt unsafe, but there is a lot around the hotel that's under construction.

Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful as were the shuttle bus drivers (particularly Emmitt who was fantastic). Being a Priority Club member they threw us a voucher for a free breakfast buffet, which made eating there affordable. If you are going to NOLA primarily for the French Quarter scene, it's not really very far to walk (five or six blocks to Bourbon and Canal) but it can be a little taxing if you are going to continue on down to Jackson Square, Cafe DuMonde, the French Market, etc. Consider the free hotel shuttle at the point (drops you off at Peters and Conti not far from Jackson Square). Also, while we walked back to the hotel room twice - once during the day and once in the early evening - I'd probably do the shuttle (or taxi) next time in the evening as there weren't a lot of other folks out and about the last few blocks near the hotel (a little too quiet for me - safety in numbers you know).

The hotel itself is older, but has newly renovated rooms. Our room was renovated with two full-size beds, very nice. However the sliding glass door to the balcony (facing the Superdome side) was the original door, and was terribly beat-up to the point where it would no longer close and lock; the locking mechanism was smashed, and the door rollers had come off their tracks. This would not be cause for concern for adults or crime, rather for the safety of young children; additionally the slight gap in the door allowed slight wind and sound inside, luckily we were on a high floor, so sound was muffled. The layout of the hotel has 5-6 levels of parking garage at the base of the building. There are only four elevators, so we had heavy traffic during the day of the Bowl Game between the Ragin' Cajuns and SDSU; lack of elevators is the main drawback of this hotel; everyone has to use the same elevators, staff and guests. The Ragin' Cajun fans were awesome, all over our hotel and the surrounding areas, having fun before and after the NO Bowl. We were on a very loud floor with unsupervised children running and screaming at night, so the next morning we got breakfast for our family, which was nice; the hotel was full so we could not switch rooms. The public restroom downstairs by the breakfast buffet was kind of gross; rooms were clean and most renovated floors, but some public areas were worn out. The business center computers barely worked. Our child got lost on one of the elevators while loading the bags onto a luggage cart, and if you go to this hotel you will realize that there are tons of places where those elevators could go with the parking decks especially. Lucky for us, a kind construction worker saw him on the 15th floor (which was being renovated), and brought him down to the lobby for us; to that man, THANKS again, Brother! We took the free hotel shuttle to the Cruise Ship port of NO, and went to the Caribbean for a week. Walking distance to the French Quarter, we ate at Bourbon House (Deanie's and Acme were packed), the baked oyster trio was excellent, per usual, though the fried seafood platter was just okay. Cafe du Monde for fresh beignets, superb! Overall, a nice stay, once the renovations are all complete, and sliding doors replaced this place will be even better.

The room furnishings were old and tired, thread bare chairs and a chest with drawers that tended to want to fall out. The closet was large, but the strange thing was one of the sliding doors was so wide that you had maybe an eighteen inch opening on either end of an eight foot closet, making it awkward to use.

They placed me in a smoking rm the first time despite my request for non-smoking; moved me to another rm which was already occupied after that; third time's a charm I suppose. I had to lug my heavy bags back and forth to get this rectified each time. The accommodations themselves are meager to say the least. Although I never expect much from a 3-star hotel like Holiday Inn, I have stayed at better ones. The beds were comfy but the rooms are dated: old, smelly carpet, loud and dated A/C, \"new\" bath towels were musty, and heavy cigarette/marijuana smell on non-smoking floors. I'd swear the vanity mirror was going to fall off the bathroom wall, it kept making a heavy creaking noise. The shuttle was never on time, and did not drop off at all listed locations, which forced us to have to walk in the extreme humidity. Big deal but if you're going to have a shuttle service please accommodate your passengers and stop at the posted shuttle stops! All of these things could have been overlooked if not for the issue with my room charges. I reserved this room for $169/night through a conference special. Despite this, my account was charged $189/night, and they debited the full amount of the room from my card at check-in even though I had paid a night's deposit several months in advance. They have yet to credit back my deposit or the additional $20 per night that I was charged, and upon check-out they had the audacity to have an additional $700 balance due on my room! The desk agent wasn't helpful at all; he simply apologized and asked that I call back to have it \"taken care of\" after 9am. I never got a receipt, nor an explanation as to why my acct was overcharged TWICE. This is totally unacceptable and I will definitely be reporting them to the BBB.

However! During my most recent stay (March 7-8) during Mardi Gras 2011 I was absolutely appalled at the treatment by the staff, condition of the room, and a general lack of interest in providing guest services. I understand it's towards the end of Mardi Gras and you're tired, but the treatment I received as a repeat customer was unacceptable. I called early on March 7th to find out if I could check in early, first I was hung up on by a an extremely rude and confrontational employee named Luscious (sp?). Then on my second call I had to convince the employee to take my phone number just in case the room opened early (seriously?). I booked a King suite which by no means should be a 5 star palace, but it shouldn't be of worse quality than the standard rooms I'd stayed in previously. The wallpaper was peeling off, the sliding door to the balcony didn't close all the way, and there was LESS space in the king suite than in a standard room (for over double the price!). Since I was going to a concert a few blocks away I called the front desk for assistance in hailing a cab for my travels (a reasonable request since they advertise in their handbook that they will call a cab for you) and twice I was told to just \"Go hail one outside, they won't answer our call\" (Keeping in mind that I did not witness them pick up a phone when I asked in person the second time and you would think a hotel would have more than one option of cab service). The next morning at breakfest we could not even get a refill on water from our obviously hostile waitress. I'm not a cheap guy, as evidenced by my gratuitous nature at Drago's and other fine New Orleans establishments, but this is the first time in my life I left a restaurant without tipping.

This room looked like something you would get for $20 a night. There were 3 of us and they only left 3 towels. No wash cloths. The toilets sit very closely the floor and the bathroom is very small. The shower was stopped up the whole time which made showering gross. I couldn't even shower on the day we checked out because it was full of water from wife showering. If you get a double room, the beds are between a full and twin which again made it hard for 2 people to get a good nights rest. The tvs are old, the room stunk, actually the whole hotel stunk. We went to eat lunch at their restauraunt. They were out of just about everything, turkey, fries, muffaletta sandwiches and a few other things I can't remember. The food we did receive wasn't that bad but couldn't believe that on Sugar Bowl weekend they could be out of that much stuff and this was just the first day we were there. The location is close to the superdome but also close to Tulane hospital, which all you hear all night is sirens. It seemed like every 5 minutes an ambulance was leaving. If you walk to Boubon st, you have to pass a bus stop full of bums which beg for money or make comments about your wife. The parking is terrible also. I drive a GMC crew cab and couldn't get into most parking spots. They only let you park on 3-6 deck so parking during big venues is tough.

I was surprised by this property. I am a gold priority club member ( which means nothing to this hotel ). I get there around noon and being a member I hoped to check in early or earlier than normal. The guy at the desk told me my room was not quite ready to check back in an hour ( the manager yells from the other end of the desk -NOT UNTIL 3 o'clock. I then ask if there were towels and a restroom at the pool. I was told yes. I go up to the pool and of course no towels. I go back to the desk, stand in line again and this time get the front desk manager. I ask for a towel and am told \" You are not allowed to use the pool until you check in\" I was shocked. I told her I had never heard of such a thing and she shrugged her shoulders. I then asked to speak to the general manager. She replied \" Sorry they are not on property\". I then told her I was calling Holiday Inn Corporate and a room then seemed to appear out of nowhere. The room was ok. Minor renovations. The hairs in the bathroom were a bit gross. Not what I am seeing from this chain anymore. Then I leave that night and realize my door is not locking. I call down and they move me to another room at the end of the hall. I get there and it is very hot. An hour later it has not cooled a bit. The maintenance guy tells me that it is a corner room and never cools down. So they then move me back to the original room as the lock is now fixed. My final complaint is the parking fees. It was not as quoted. They say they can raise it for special events, but my car was about the only one in the garage so can not see what the special event would be. Also if you want to lay by the pool for sun, you lose it by about 1:30 in the afternoon due the position of the hotel. Finally the area. I did walk, but it is a bit scarey.

The beds were comfortable, and clean and we didn't have any problems at all with the hotel or it's staff. Our television remote wasn't working, and they brought a new one up right away, and we called to order more towels & they were timely in bringing them.

We were a little concerned after seeing some of the reviews here, but decided to take the risk. We're very glad we did. The room was not palatial, but was certainly large enough for the two of us. It was clean, comfortable, and *quiet*. We were on the 10th floor of the hotel and had a view of the patio and pool, which is on the eighth floor. The National Guard is still helping police New Orleans at this time, and the Guardsmen are billeted at this hotel. We saw quite a few Guardsmen in the halls, elevators and lobby. Made us feel quite secure. One of the employees quipped that we were staying at \"the safest hotel in New Orleans\". :-) The staff was cheerful and helpful. Most everyone has a Katrina story to tell. Their stories are amazing, inspirational, and heartbreaking. We asked if it was wise to walk from the hotel to the riverfront, and were told that its safe to walk around most anywhere downtown. We did a lot of walking between the hotel and the riverfront and didn't have any problems at all. This was my first ever trip to New Orleans, and I hope that I may someday get to go back. What a great place to visit!

They are very friendly and will do whatever it takes to make your stay great. I had booked a non-smoking room, but when I entered it, it reeked of stale smoke! I caught a maid servicing the room next door and she came over and gave a quick spritz of air freshner before I had to leave for a meeting. I then reported it to the front desk, who asked if I wanted moved. Since I had already unpacked, I did not, but Patrice and Brian at the front desk said they would take care of it and wash the walls. When I returned a few hours later, the room smelled fresh as a daisy! And it stayed that way the rest of my stay, so they didn't do just a quick fix. It appears they changed the bedspread, shampooed the carpets, as well as washed the walls to rid the room of the smoke. The shuttle drivers, Emmett and David, are just as nice and provide the only free shuttle service of any hotel in New Orleans. As a female travelling alone on this trip, they provided a valuable service so I could got out for the evening and not worry about feeling safe or having to wait for a cab.

We arrivied back to the hotel at around 4:30pm. The check in was smooth. Room # 1129, which had a view of the front of the hotel(Loyoal Ave.). I must say I found the room to be bigger than what I had imagined and it was very clean. The next morning while showering, the water in the tub wasn't draining. I called the front desk and the immeiately sent up a maintenance person and the problem was fixed within a half hour. There is a bar in the hotel which stays open until 11pm. I was told from hotel staff that the flood waters were only within the lobby area but there were no signs of water damage anywhere. This was my 8th trip to New Orleans and first since the flood. I expected to see a city in total disarray. What I saw was the complete opposite. There was no change in the quarter/downtown area. However the Mardi Gras crowd was a bit smaller than past celebrations. In my opinion many people were frightened away because of all the negative attention given by the media. There was a heavy police presence which made me feel much safer than my prior visits to New Orleans. The people of New Orleans were friendly as usual.
