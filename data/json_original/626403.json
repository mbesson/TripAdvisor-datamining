Due to airlines delays i was not able to arrive on the scheduled day of arrival, though i informed by mail of my arrival the next morning. Upon arrival you will need to pay your entire stay and they charged the 5 nights. even though i actually did not stay 5 but only 4 nights. There was no way of getting them to pay 4 nights. The requested superiour double room turned out to be a twin room. But after asking we could change into double bed room. The hotel is clean and very central located in Little India. Staff was friendly and helpful. There are 2 pc's in the lobby area, but they cannot be used. (for some reason) Free wi-fi is offered if you bring your own portable device, there is a lift in the building. Singapore is not a cheap please but the this is quite a good value. Basement rooms have no windows. room 103 has a window which is located directly on street level, keep your curtains closed if you do not like having spectators", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cBest budget class hotel in Little India\u201d", "Author": "Raj S", "ReviewID": "UR124762435", "Content": "It's newly renovated budget class hotel of fragrance hotel group.

The TV in the media room didn't work when I was there and the couch was ripped apart for some reason, but there is a very decent computer room and laundry room. The bathroom has very good shower heads and you can choose to stay in a room with all girls (if you're a girl that is) which is more comfortable for some travelers.
