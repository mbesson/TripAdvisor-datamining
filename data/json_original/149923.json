The staff clearly put effort into making the rooms comfortable - the room smelled very clean upon arrival, the air conditioning had been turned on to cool the room down, towels were replaced and beds were made each day, and they even folded some of our laundry. Unfortunately this did not make up for the poor physical condition of the room. The tiles were stained, the mirror was corroded, and most annoyingly the water took 10-15 minutes to get \"hot\".

Unfortunately this was not the case at Hotel Iberia. The staff was exceptionally nice. The owner Christopher was a complete gentleman. He was kind, helpful, and spent a significant amount of time giving me directions to get around and helping me plan my itinerary. I really liked the location as well. It was surrounded by nice houses in Condado, and not a terribly far walk to the beach (roughly 10 minutes). The 24hr grocery store next door was nice too. Also we left something in the hotel and the staff called me and left me a message as soon as it was discovered. Unfortunately, the hotel was a very budget hotel for not a very budget price. If I were paying half the price, I would not mind the old outdated furniture, the dankness, and the cheap linens. However, at over $120 for a double for a US hotel, you except at least a little quality. I know Condado is not cheap, and I know $100 isn't tons of money for a hotel, but there are a few basics that should be provided. We never had hot water during the stay, the water pressure was horrible, and it would take 45 minutes for the toilet tank to get refilled before you could flush again. Again, not stuff I would mind if I was staying in a hostel or paying budget prices.

All the hotels were solid booked and the hotel Mgr who helped me found one room left at this Iberia Hotel.The outside looks pretty attractive with his spanish \"casa\" style and its little garden. The only room left was a 2 queen bedroom and the Manager (from Spain)priced it $132 because it was supposed to fit 4 people...Since my only other option to sleep in San Juan that night was the airport lounge...I paid and could see that the credit card receipt was untitled \" garden supplies \" ! So first thought = there is something strange about this hotel !! Room 307 has indeed 2 queen beds but of a terrible quality and then I found that there was no phone next to the phone directory !! + no shower head in the shower meaning that you cannot use it (great way to save water !) + no soap, no shampoo, no tooth cups, no washclothes...I could find one maid who brought 2 tiny soap bars and 2 plastic cups but that was it..The most unbeleivable is that there are metallic shades and a piece of vinyl as a window meaning that you are like sleeping outside and you get all the noise from the street, the parking lot and the building near the hotel. Of course I could not sleep more than a few hours and when I made my comments to the Mgr the next morning, he said that there were 150 guests in the hotel and that I was the only one to be complaining ...that to get a shower, we just need \"water and soap\" (his words !) + the phone line was down but no big deal etc...etc...I requested a partial refund but he said that even if I would have left the hotel the night before, he would have charged me because cancellation must be made 48hrs in advance !!!! Well, I don't think that I need to add anything to make the readers understand that you should NEVER pick up this hotel in San Juan even in the worse situations ! I would have accepted some conditions if I would have paid $50 but for $132 I felt totally exploited. So my recommendation is to stay away from this hotel and hopefully the Manager could know about all those bad feedbacks found in Tripadvisor.

My stay in San Juan was from Wednesday, March 24 through Monday, March 28, 2005. I stayed the first three nights at: Hotel Iberia I arrived at Hotel Iberia, on Wednesday, March 23rd at about 1:30 pm. I was shown to my room #206 by Israel. Later that day at about 3:30 pm I discovered that room #206 shower was only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trickle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of water. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough water to shower. I contacted Israel and he came to the room #206 to inspect and observe the trickle of water coming out of the showerhead. I requested a room change. Israel said all rooms were occupied. I requested any means of showering possible. He said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any alternatives. I requested to speak to the manager/ owner. He said there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any way of contacting him. He said Christopher the manager / owner will be here tomorrow (Thursday) and I could speak to him tomorrow evening. Israel also stated that tomorrow morning he would look into a room change. The next morning (Thursday, March 24th) at approximately 11:00 am I moved from room #206 to room #204. Room #204 shower barely had an adequate water pressure to shower. Late that evening at about 7:00 pm I spoke to Christopher the manager/owner of Hotel Iberia. (Israel had already made Christopher aware that I wanted to speak to him and the nature of the appointment to speak to him). I requested Christopher credit my account $80.00 for the first night because there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adequate water pressure to bathe. He said no credit would be issued and that he was aware of the nature of each room. Evidently Israel was also aware of the nature of room #206 shower not having enough shower water pressure to bathe. Israel and Christopher deliberately rented out room #206 that does not have adequate water pressure to shower.

We made the reservation by phone and considered ourselves very fortunate because of the long weekend involved. Our home is 3 hours away from the San Juan area so we were looking forward to our stay in the Condado area. You can imagine our outrage and disbelief when upon arriving we found that the hotel had rented our room to someone else! when I made the reservation, I indicated that I would be at my son's wedding in Isla Verde and that we would check in in the evening. Not only were the employees indifferent to our predicament, but they did not offer any consolation or solution to our situation. I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone. They obviously do not honor reservations nor do they care what happens to guests who have counted on fair practices. My weekend was ruined.

Booked 3 nights but stayed only 2 b/c I could only cancel & get a full refund for 1 night- and for that I had to endure the arrogance & mysoginism of the front desk Mgr. The lame& un-helpful clerk for the 2 nights completed the experience. Early that night the elec. went out-there were no flashlights to pass around& the only response from the clerk was a blank,don't care stare. This is a subpar place that misrepresents itself as a \"hotel\". Their exterior& small reception area is charming very Old World Spanish-this MUST be their bait. The Mgr pointed out that their customers are mostly traveling students-ie, the strapped for cash w/ no hostels nearby crowd. Room was dark w/very worn furniture,had an acrid smell that would not go away even though I left the pane windows open w/the a/c running, vynil shower curtains were coated w/soap scum, & a tiny awkward bathroom u had to step up to to get into (per Mgr all bathrooms were like this). It had an armoire instead of a closet & b/c of the lack of space TV was propped on a ceiling corner. I asked to see a larger room-it was worse- w/ the bedspreads threadbare.There is no elevator. It was $79 per night & this was NOT a good value as there ARE much better places for that price range-for example, the EL PRADO INN- so please check around.
