If not for Matt and his awesome customer service, my stay would have been ruined, as well as some VERY important plans I had arranged around my stay. My boyfriend and I chose to stay at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa in early April 2012 after we stayed in late March 2012 for a mini vacay. We both absolutely loved the room! And the staff! The hotel staff was awesome and very helpful whenever called upon. No issues with parking here.. The parking was a breeze! (TIP: Park on the street for free! Each time I\u2019ve stayed at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa there has always been street parking. You may still pull your car into the hotel entrance, near the lobby initially for registration, and the bell hops will Gladly help you with your luggage ~ ensuring the full hotel/resort experience. After you check-in, go park your car on the street and come back to the entrance to meet your bell hop, who will bring/show you to your room.) Back to the room! The room was very modern with beautiful decor. The carpet had a very cool chic look to it (and felt great! by the way). I like the lighting! Lamps could be turned lighter or dimmer and during the day there\u2019s no light needed as the huge sliding glass patio door let\u2019s in the most amazingly gorgeous sunlight. It almost seems as if the room was decorated with the idea of the sunlight hitting each piece of decor just right, especially in the morning and at sundown! I actually took pictures of items from the room that I wanted to purchase when I returned home! I never had to call for maintnence once and everything worked perfectly in the room. The room was pretty big and I really enjoyed the extra space and feel it always makes a difference for my stays. The view was fantastic too! Beautiful San Diego beaches right outside! I REALLY loved the room & the patio! It was nice to stay in a hotel and actually utilize the patio. The patio had two large lounge chairs which my boyfriend and I both made use of and thoroughly enjoyed. The bathroom was very large, esp when compared to other similar hotels and resorts in the area. The lighting on the bathroom is perfect! Also, love the little swing out magnifying mirror, very useful. We went out that night to a rather important event and I was able to do my make-up & hair so well in that lighting, I looked like I\u2019d been at the salon half the day! As you can probably tell by now, I REALLY loved the room. I loved the room so much that I made sure to request the same, or similar, room, in advance with a front desk rep over the phone a day in advance and then again on the morning of my arrival. I also requested an early check-in (their normal check-in is 4p and I was going to arrive at 3p) and the front desk rep informed me that would be fine. She looked up my history and saw what room I had last time I stayed and told me, \"Yes, there will be another room just like it available today\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t be the exact same room number but the same room as the one I stayed in most recently. I was extremely happy (as you could imagine, knowing my liking of the room!) I went ahead and planned my entire stay around being in this room. We were going out to a formal event that evening and I was so glad to have bathroom with the great lighting and mirrors. No need to have my make-up or hair done! Also, since this room was one of the Villas and the entrance was private, I invited a few co-workers to come over for drinks at my hotel room. I had even made plans with my boyfriend to have a special breakfast with him on the beautiful patio the next morning! However, my day took a turn for the worse when I came into the Lobby at about 3:15p and was assisted by Ramzi. This gentleman was unlike the other staff I\u2019d encountered at this Hotel, or any Hilton for that matter. He didn\u2019t look me in the eye once. When I came up to the desk and said I had a reservation for today Ramzi didn\u2019t respond at all, he just looked down. I repeated myself (maybe he didn\u2019t hear me??) and this time added my first and last name and requested to be checked-in. He just said No, no. I\u2019m sorry Maam but we don\u2019t have any clean rooms available, you\u2019ll need to wait. He then walks away toward a co-worker and I tell him Excuse me, but I\u2019ve already verified with the front desk today that I would need an early check-in as I\u2019m arriving early and it was okayed. I asked him to look at the notes under my history, and he seemed to be looking but had no response. I then asked him how long I would need to wait and he said he\u2019ll take my cell number down and I can go look around and he\u2019ll call me when a room is ready. At this time I realized I\u2019m also going to need to verify with him the room I already requested and I\u2019d most recently stayed in and he agreed nodding yes, that is the type of room I\u2019ll be getting. I asked him how long and told him there will be no need to take down my cell number as I will wait here in the lobby. He seemed angry about that and walked away, without any response once more. I said loudly, 10.. 15 mins?? how long? he nodded yes again. Okay, so here I am waiting 10 mins.. 15 mins.. NOW 20 mins goes by and nothing! At about this time I started notcing other reps at the front desk calling other hotel guests to let them know their rooms were ready. Now 30 mins has gone by, and I go up to the counter and ask Ramzi what\u2019s going on?? He says he\u2019s getting my room right now. Okay, Finally! Can\u2019t wait to get to the room so I can start getting ready (I\u2019m already running 30 mins behind now). He\u2019s helping other guests too, so I take a seat up front and comes right over and hands me keys for a room numbered 119 ~ Now I know my room number was in the 400\u2019s last time so this can\u2019t be correct. I tell Ramzi that we already discussed this when I came in and this is why I\u2019m waiting, for one of the rooms like the one I stayed in the last time I was there! You know, the one you nodded your head and agreed too? Whether this hotel had one of the rooms similar, or the same room, I\u2019d stayed in before was my deciding factor on choosing the Hilton instead of another near-by hotel. So he takes back the keys and storms back to his position behind the front desk. 10 more mins go by and he comes back over to me with a new pamphlet and two new room keys and says okay here you go! Here\u2019s the one you\u2019ve been looking for. Hands me the brochure with key, closed, I open it and it says room 122.. I think to myself, I KNOW that doesn\u2019t sound right.. If he knows room 119 is not what I was looking for, then why would he give me room 122 and say \u201chere\u2019s the one you\u2019ve been looking for\u201d (and waiting for!) But, this is a very large hotel and I thought maybe even if the room numbers are in succession, they may not be the size or have the same amenities inside. So I go along with it and take the directions from the bell boy - I get to room 122 - Wow :( What a surprise! Just as I suspected, room 122 is just on the lower level of these villas, right next to 119, which Ramzi knew WAS NOT my initial request and obviously if I didn\u2019t want a room in the villas in the 100\u2019s and he proceeded to give me keys letting me, an unsuspecting hotel guest get so exhausted from all the hoopla, I go ahead and take a look at the room Ramzi gives me and says is the same room I requested and waited about 45 mins for, only to be EXTREMELY disappointed...It was a tiny villa with a door you go through and a hallway you walk down to get to your room - open a few seconds of inspection it is obvious to me that this is not the room, or even a similar one! One of the phones was not working, the patio was set up totally different! The clock was 1 1/2 hrs ahead of time and after careful inspection, I found there to be no way to change the time. The bathroom was different. Most everything I had liked was different in this \u201cnew\u201d room. I called the front desk and asked to speak with the manager. By now I was flaming PISSED! Not only did I have to wait a really long time for a room (which was confirmed earlier that day, that in fact, Yes! I could check-in early at 3p and Yes! The exact same room type was available). Now I was given the wrong room, and not just the wrong room, but in a completely different area with no corridors or hallways. The manager was on another call at the time so I waited about 5 mins and he called me back at the room. Matt instantly put me at ease! He realized I was quite upset, let me know he would get me into the correct room pronto and he was very apologetic for the mishaps. Matt was very calm and reassuring. He said he would send someone right away to help with my bags and get me over to the correct room. The bell hop arrived within a few minutes and was very helpful and we even cracked a few jokes onto the way to my correct room. Niice..finally..back with the customer service I remember and have grown to expect from Hilton. Before I knew it I was at my correct villa, in the 400 block with just a single door (no hallways) all decor was perfect, just as I\u2019d remembered! Since the actual room I\u2019d stayed in was already occupied, Matt suggested another room, very similar - AND IT WAS! All my plans were back on track and everything turned out wonderfully, and that is because Front Desk Manager, Matt Bickel went out of his way to help a Hilton Hotel & Resort Guest! I am truly grateful that Matt was working that day! After my experience with Matt Bickel, I will continue to refer my friends & family to this same Hilton.. and I will be back any chance I get! THANK YOU MATT!! As for the rest of the Hotel & Resort ~ The grounds are amazing! Beautiful lush gardens, pathways intertwined throughout and little nooks with chairs and benches to hang out with friends, rally up the kids or have that perfect moonlight kiss under the stars (PERFECT scene for the last of the three! i know from experience). The pools are all just beautiful, as others on this site have described. Also Love the tennis courts! They have 5 tennis courts, all in great condition. The Spa here is so luxurious and the fitness center is open 24hrs! The landscaping is always well taken care of attention to detail seems to be theme around this resort.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lake forest", "Title": "\u201cBeware of the Parking Charges\u201d", "Author": "michael d", "ReviewID": "UR127570309", "Content": "I was able to get a great rate on priceline for a last minute Friday night stay.

Umm...I don't think so. Not sure where you get off. If you expect me to pay for that, you better hand wash and wax my car, fill up the tank, and park it for me. Throw in breakfast for a family of four too. No f'ing way. I pay premium dollar to stay here and upon check-in I'm nonchalantly nickel and dimed. Oh but it's on our website you say? If the online travel website would have said that this property mistreats their customers and charges for parking I would have looked elsewhere. In this day and age of competitive business and companies raising the standard to win the hearts (and dollars) of loyal customers, Hilton doesn't even show up to play the game. Instead, they feel empowered and justified (yeah because other properties in the area rip off their customers) to resort to scam tactics and unbelievable fees. The property itself is grossly outdated and poorly maintained. Don't expect free wi-fi (or any wireless connectivity in the rooms whatsoever), complimentary breakfast, or free parking....everything that's offered at reasonable hotel chains that actually care for their customers and don't take them for granted. If you disagree and think that this practice is okay for Hilton, by all means continue to patronize them and enjoy being taken advantage of. If you're like me and my family, send a message that this behavior just doesn't cut it and never will.

We travelled with two young kids, mixing business and family stay. We chose a garden view twin room, in one of the villas. Very happy with the room - good size, very comfortable, had a fridge microwave and sink which was good for looking after the kids' needs. Our view was over the back garden which was basically a fence, so that was not so hot, but we didn't mind. The resort itself is very good. It's not Dubai, so don't expect a never ending buffet and marble pillars, but the resort does itself justice. The pool is heated, and the depth is 3 - 5 feet so the kids could touch the bottom in areas. There are two wonderful hot tubs just off the pool, a table tennis table and a giant draughts set. It's very picturesque and the sunset over the bay is an attractive sight. There's a motor boat, jetski kayak rental on the beach, which we didn't use as the weather was not great. The beach is a manmade looking one, but it's fine for the kids. Jogging or rollerblading along the bayfront is fun, and there are bikes to rent. There's a very good children's playground about 7-10 mins walk along the waterfront. We travelled downtown to the convention centre, to balboa park and the zoo, as well as to seaworld - all by taxi, very easy short trips. Fashion mall is much better the name sounds, and has some good toy shops as well as a wide range of clothing. Food choices in the hotel are good, for both adults and kids, and the room service choices are good too. it's fairly gourmet and the quality is quite high. As it's off season now, we didn't have the full choice of dining as some of the venues were not open. The best thing about the hotel is the staff - exceptionally friendly and happy to please - Larry in the restaurant and Ramon on the front desk were great, but all the staff create a happy, easy going and helpful environment. The only annoying thing about the hotel is the lack of in room wifi - we went to the onsite convention centre to login to free wifi. Amenities - a very good hotel shop, helpful reception and conceriege, business centre, fed ex package handling, hotel shuttle - very helpful and individualised service, great value on zoo and sea world tickets (prices similar but many additional perks included esp sea world multi entry) Why not 5 stars - well it's just a little old, the choices are just a little limited compared to modern resort hotels esp in the Middle East and Asia, but the staff make up for all of this - it deserves a 4.5 rating.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Udon Thani, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cA Very Mixed Bag....\u201d", "Author": "JAMESINTHAILAND", "ReviewID": "UR126467903", "Content": "I just returned from an overnight visit to San Diego, staying at the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa on Mission Bay. The hotel really is a mixed bag - there are wonderful things about it, and some real negatives as well. Overall, my opinion is that I wouldn't return here, or recommend it to a friend - there are too many other, nicer hotels to choose from in the San Diego area. WHAT I LIKED: *Nice location right on Mission Bay. Sandy beach out front and miles of walking trails right from your doorstep. *Large room, newly-redecorated and furnished. *Appointments and amenities are very nice. *Big, flat-screened HD TVs in the rooms. *Room rate is moderate for the location. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: *Despite the fact that the furnishings and appointments in the rooms and public areas are renovated, the infrastructure itself is not. EG, things like the door locks, light switches, air conditioning units look straight out of the 70s. The hallways were stark. This gives the impression that the hotel was renovated recently, but on the cheap, and gives parts of the hotel a very dated look and feel. *The $32 DAILY fee for parking is absolute robbery! This hotel is not located in Manhattan or downtown San Francisco, and the owners/management should be ashamed of this policy. This alone is a deal-breaker in terms of my ever returning here. *They advertise availability of free Wi-Fi, but it turns out it is only available in the reception area and conference rooms (I could not get it in the lounges outside of the restaurant or by the pool). There is no Wi-Fi available in the rooms; you have to pay for wired access. This is deal-breaker #2 for me. COME ON HILTON PEOPLE, THIS IS 2012! *Bathrooms are small and shower/tub was very dated looking. *Swimming pool/jacuzzi area was attractive, but too small for a resort with this many rooms. It was filled to the brim on a Tuesday in mid-March; I can only imagine how overcrowded it must get on a sunny, Summer day when the resort is full and everyone wants to swim! As other reviewers have suggested, this is a hotel with a lot of potential. If they spent a few extra dollars to complete the renovations, installed Wi-Fi, and reduced the rate of their parking fee by about 75%, I would give this hotel five stars....", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location.

Typically when I travel on business, or for a conference I stay at a Marriott and commute or walk to the other location. Because the Hilton is out on its own, and is a beautiful resort property we opted to stay onsite. After reading reviews about the price of parking we decided it'd be more cost effective to use a taxi to get from the airport, and to visit other areas. For our 3 night stay we ended up spending about $100 on taxi fares. This was to get to and from the airport, as well as round trip taxi service to and from Old Town, and Pacific Beach. I believe this was still much less expensive than the cost of a rental car, along with gas, and $32 a day parking which is highly excessive! Unfortunately San Diego is a driving town, and not having a car made us feel trapped. There are no restaurants, are markets even remotely close. You are pretty much required to only eat, drink, and buy any odds and ends you may need at the hotel. We needed sunscreen and paid $18 for it! Our room was located in the Tower on floor 4, and overlooked the lobby and driveway area, so we did not have a view. The rooms are decent, and the bed is pretty comfortable. However I think the rooms were designed by a man, as there was no full length mirror or decent lighting, something I desire when staying at a hotel. The room felt like a Vampires Liar. Another issue that did not affect us but did cause difficulty for other conference attendees was the cost of the internet, apparently not wireless in the room, and $15 a day. We had a 3G iPad, Thank Goodness! Now that my complaints are out of the way, I do think it's important to address the positives of this hotel. First and foremost is the service. The hotel staff is wonderful! Everyone is so nice and helpful. I did not run into one discourteous representative of this hotel, and I was there for almost four days straight so this says a lot. While I didn't get to use the pool area, it looked amazing! Luckily I was able to use the running path around the bay, which was great. The west side of the property was beautiful! I think this resort would be a great place to stay with your family, in one of the condo/suites on the bay side of the hotel. They appear to be fully equipped with kitchens, so you could prepare your own meals, pending you had a car to go to the market. I personally don't think I'd stay at this property again because of the parking. It's very expensive at $32 a day, and I just would never be willing to pay that along with a $200 plus per night room cost, and I'd never go to suburban San Diego again without a car. If they lowered their parking cost to say $15, I'd highly recommend this place for families. I'd also recommend it to you if money is no object.

Other than my check in expierience, it was fantastic. Let me explain, I'm a Hilton Honors member so I always stay at Hilton properties. My flight in was delayed and I knew I would be checking in late so I called the hotel to verify that a king bed room would still be available for me. They assured me it would. When i arrived i was unapologetically told by the front desk clerk \"2 beds is all that is available\". I explained that I called, Honors memeber, etc. Nothing. I even asked if I could pay for an upgrade. No response. Finally, I was just given a room key and bellman and was told they would take me to my room- didn't know what to expect or what I was getting. Fortunately, I was upgraded to a 2 bed \"villa\" at ground level so I was satisfied, but a little customer service and explanation would've gone a long way. All of the other staff\"s service was great. It's a beautiful property and you can tell it has been updated. Pool area is great, only complaint is that you can only get drink service by the pool during season. This is a resort that is not close to much at all, plan on staying on the grounds or have transportation!

The good news was the upgrade price; for $50 dollars more we were moved to a room right on the water, this made my wife very happy. The down side to that was the area leading to our room was kind of dark and looked more like an ally way than a resort and spa. Most of the guest service was wonderful. We ordered a late dinner and had it brought to the room and the next morning went to the restaurant for breakfast. The prices were a little high but that was to be expected. One downside is that my wife and I were forgotten at breakfast. People that came in after us were served before us and a separate waitress than the one assigned for us ended up taking care of us, this was frustrating but she was pleasant and redeemed the morning. One thing I did witness was a waiter drop some packets of jelly coming from the kitchen to set up tables and just throw them back in the basket to eventually end on someone's plate next to their food.

Nice location setting, the main staff including the valet/bus speak clear English, maid service is great and what a beautiful room (773)in the tower with 'bay view'. We came here for vacation and had great weather. That is the end (unfortunately) of the positives, and I'm a very well traveled 'older' professional and stay at many places. So here now for 4 days, I clearly see I spent too much money on a 5 day/night vacation stay considering what I'm experiencing for that money. Never mind $32.day for parking. The rooms are over priced...period. The add-ons, should you want some are priced beyond belief. Example: I thought the room had a microwave. When I learned at check in that the rooms don't include one, they offered to send one up to the room AT $30 PER DAY. Walmart up the road sells them for $38. Do you need to use a few \"business services\" like internet, printing, scanning a document or use of a small room? FORGET it. They'll tell you they have rooms specifically to do your work in, right before they admit \"but they don't have any furniture in them\". Though they boost a confernce center, they have NOTHING to support it except for a few big rooms and many chairs. So I asked the front desk (you HAVE to go there if you need to ask them something...they DON'T answer their phone but 1 out of 8 times so far). Their wireless system is ONE router for the whole complex so you have to find a place to sit close to the center of the resort. I frequently see people gathered in and outside the lobby with their laptops. Our room is on the 7th floor directly across from the main entrance and the signal strength is 10-20% when I am able to connect at all. There is only ONE restaurant which is way, way, overpriced with adjacent bar that has a separate menu. Since this was our family vacation away from Boston, we did Sea World. The gift shop here said they discounted tickets. Oh they do...normally the tickets are $73. they discount them $1, so we spent $72 per. There was a lot of walking that day, so we'd thought we'd relax and splash around after a late dinner and activities. Wrong!... the pool area closes at 10 so we couldn't unwind in the hot tub or float around in the pool like you can at most other resorts/hotels of much lesser class.

Our friends chose to work out in the fitness center. While I'm sure they enjoyed using all the equipment, I'm happy we went for relaxation instead!

We've stayed here before for a wedding, circa 2009 and we loved it. So, when we saw the awesome deal on Expedia we jumped. Well, here is our story: We checked in around 4:30pm, I was tired from driving 3hrs, so I settled in for a quick 30 min. cat nap. Fast forward 1 hr. and I wake up to my arm being literally \"glued\" to the comforter and the duvet style blanket. I was disgusted, my wife jetted down the hall to get ice as a means to get the gum off my fairly expensive shirt. Fifteen minutes past, and the final outcome was a RL shirt with remnants of pink bubble gum still stuck on the shoulder. My wife called the front desk, then was transferred to housekeeping. I spoke to housekeeping, and they said they would send someone up. Thirty minutes go by, nothing. Forty minutes... and then I called to remind them to pick up the items. A gentlemen finally did come, and he said he will redeliver the items with fresh ones. I understand things happen, so I tried to cut some slack to the housekeeping \"oversight\". The family went out to dinner, we returned at 9:45pm still nothing.I called and they said it was still be cleaned, what? no extras at a 300+ room hotel. My wife said she wasn't that cold, so we gave up and went to sleep with just the sheets. In the morning I spoke to the guy at the front desk, and all he said was \"sorry about that\". It was disingenuous at best. Pros: The pool was beautiful and it had a 1 ft pool for the kids The bay view was super nice. No charge for cabanas usage.

Staff helpful, courteous and friendly. I had a very positive encounter in every instance (except one in the \"ugly\" section). 2. Especially great was Fernando in the Acqua Restaurant. I ate there four evenings. He was exceptional in his service, friendliness and knowledge of the wines and menu (and sorely missed the last evening). Food was excellent, but I think a little overpriced. E.g. dinner for one with a glass of wine was b/w $60-75. 3. I had a nice room - ground floor, bay view which was great for the mornings, and watching sunsets. Since I am a Hilton Honors Gold Elite, I got a free upgraded room, free continental breakfasts, and free internet. That was a great value on this property, and it's why, in part, I have brand loyalty to Hilton properties. Bed was super comfortable. 4. I had two chaise lounges outside my sliding doors that were very comfortable and perfect for enjoying the sunshine and watching people walking/running/enjoying the bay. 5. The property was quiet, restful and well-designed. It was nearly empty when I was there, so if it is packed at other times of the year, maybe the serenity would be lost. 6. Great looking pool area (although cool weather made it unusable for me, not their fault obviously), but in different conditions, I would have used it much more (there are jacuzzis, a larger pool, table tennis, etc. 7. You can rent a bike and other water sport equipment right at the resort. I did that twice, and took a ride over to Fiesta Island or along Mission Bay. Very nice. 8. Room was clean and cleaned well each day. Again, I want to emphasize the staff were all first rate, professional and courteous. BAD: 1. No wireless in rooms (a hotel of this scale should have wireless in the rooms, being tethered to an 8 inch ethernet cord on the \"desk\" was a real hassle). 2. No business style desk. Very small surface space with an uncomfortable chair. They would do well to cater a little more to business travelers (wireless, a decent desk and comfortable desk chair would go a long way). A couple of other minus: 3. The door entering my building would never lock closed, so anyone could walk off the beach and into the building without a key card, didn't leave me feeling very secure. 4. Overnight parking for guests is $28 per night (pretty ridiculous for a location that isn't downtown), it effectively doubles your rental car costs. 5. Ducks were in the pool most of the time I was there (pretty gross), pool area unstaffed. 6. There is a Marketplace onsite for snacks, but be prepared to pay a lot, i.e. $2.50 for a Dr. Pepper, $9.00 for a bag of chips and a Naked Juice, $15 for a small bundle of wood for my fire pit. 7. Other charges to be aware of, wired internet access is $11.95 per day (unless it is comped b/c of your Hilton Honors status). That, plus paying for overnight parking adds $40 a night to your price, good to keep in mind if you are following a budget. BTW, $11.95 is per device. UGLY: My one negative experience with a staff decision was when I took the complimentary shuttle to SeaWorld when I had a free morning. It is advertised as leaving every morning at 10. I scheduled my short time at SeaWorld and the shows as exact as I could to maximize my time, knowing we were 5 minutes from SeaWorld. Once we were on the shuttle, the driver announced he was going to take someone to the airport and we would \"get a tour of San Diego\" So, once underway, instead of turning right for a 3 minute drive to the Sea World entrance (again, very close to the hotel), the driver decided to turn left and drove me and two other guests who also got on the shuttle to go to SeaWorld, all the way to the San Diego airport to drop off a fourth passenger who wasn't in any particular hurry to get to the airport. Instead of a 5 minute drive to SeaWorld we took a 35 minute drive to SD airport, missing the first morning show at the park. Very disrespectful of the three passengers going to Sea World and unnecessary, by the admission of the fourth passenger who was going to the airport, and hadn't requested a rush. OVERALL: If you have a family, its a nice central location to SeaWorld, LegoLand, Zoo, etc. and located on the beach. Potentially romantic location for a couple, esp. if you get a bayside with the two chaise lounges and fire pit. The rooms/overall space isn't really designed for business people, but could provide a wonderful respite for them, if the room design and amenities would cater more to business clients vs. just vacationing guests.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia, United States", "Title": "\u201cMy Third Visit to the Hilton Resort & Spa on Mission Bay\u201d", "Author": "Ed G", "ReviewID": "UR121520676", "Content": "I had a fun and relaxing stay this week, my third visit!

We were very disappointed with the hotel, having been impressed with the hotel website and photographs. Where to start.... location is poor as there is very little else nearby, aside from the bay. We did not have a car rental and had to rely solely on taxis. You could not go anywhere by foot. Every aspect of the hotel and it's operation is designed for you to spend your money within the hotel. The hotel shuttle bus is very expensive, and most times it was cheaper to use an ordinary taxi. The bus does not leave until 10am earliest therefore forcing you to pay for breakfast at either the restaurant (also very expensive) or the coffee shop (also expensive). The coffee shop bizarely closes at 1:00pm, obviously as a ploy to make sure you buy your lunch and drinks from the poolside (unsurprisingly, expensive). The reception and concierge staff (with the exception of william who was superb) were generally unhelpful and on one occasion I was completely ignored whilst waiting to speak to reception. I sat down with one female concierge for help with our holiday such as sight seeing etc and she just wasn't interested or helpful and didn't even bother giving us any information. We struggled until William helpfully gave us a restaurant list, leaflets for Seaworld etc which surely could have been given to us by the previous concierge- she basically just didn't want to help. The pool side staff were rude and on one occasion didn't bother bringing back our change having paid our bill- she just assumed we were leaving her an 11 dollar tip even though we only had one sandwich and two sodas. When we asked for our change she appeared shocked and then 15 minutes later(!!) finally brought over our change (all in 1 dollar notes to be sure we were able to leave her a tip of course). The hotel is old and looks dingy save for the fact that a small fortune appears to have been spent on modern furniture to spruce the place up. The room was nice but the bathrooms were outdated. The rooms were very dark with poor lighting. Hotel and pool cleanliness was poor, especially the hot tub in the adult area.

All they know is they love everything about the hotel, from the breakfast buffet in the morning, all the way through the Sea World fireworks before bed. Being the one responsible for the planning, this trip has become my favorite also, almost entirely due to the helpfulness and efforts of front desk supervisor William Matthews. On a previous trip he stepped in and handled a problem, and followed up during our entire stay. This time I called in advance. Although he was off the day we checked in, he had everything set up perfectly. With 4 small girls, something seems to come up every 15 minutes. Without exception, during the rest of our stay he handled everything. It makes the trip for me stress free.

It is presented as an upscale resort style hotel and we splurged for a garden villa, expecting a true Hilton experience. I am sorry to say, we were disppointed and felt misled by the resort presentation on the Hilton website. First of all, the hotel seemed to be trying to squeeze money out of its guests at every turn. The website says each room features high speed internet. Nowhere is a mention of this being not free. Only when you click on individual rooms' info, do they have a tiny notice saying there might be additional fees. By the way, the internet connection is per cable (no wireless) and costs $11.95 per 24 hours. The breakfast is not included in the price of the room and adds up quickly, as does the parking charge of $28 per night. There is an outdoor pool on the property, with a small paddling pool for toddlers next to it. There are lounge chairs around the pool, free of charge, and then shaded cabanas that need to be rented and reserved in advance. I didn't ask how much they were to rent, but considering that there was no mention of the actual price anywhere in the hotel add or the notice at the pool, AND the outrageous prices of poolside snacks, I can only imagine it was just as overpriced as everything else in this hotel. A small ice cream bar cost $5 by the pool. There were notices telling people no outside drinks or food were allowed by the pool, I guess to encourage people to spend ridiculous amounts of money on drinks and snacks. There is beach nearby and Hilton has its own boat dock there as well. You can rent a jetski for $99 PER HOUR, for example. The front desk staff were lukewarm at best. One night I found someone's lost room key card, took it to the front desk, waited almost 10 minutes in line to return it, saying I found it lying around near the pool bar. No thanks, nothing, just a very bored \"Oh yeah?\" and the woman took the card and that was that. I booked the room as a package which gave me a 50-dollar credit towards the spa services, which the front desk confirmed at check-in. Later on I had a manicure at the spa, the manicure was $45 but they add 20% gratuity automatically to each bill, and that plus tax meant my total was $63. I told the spa coordinator that I had a $50 spa credit, she called the front desk to confirm it, and then told me should couldn't deduct the credit from my bill, but the front desk would do that at check-out for me. No problem. Of course, when the bill came the day of our check-out, the spa charge was there, all $63 of it. So I had to go to the front desk to get it cleared up. I told the man they forgot to apply the $50 spa credit, expecting a sincere \"I'm so sorry\". He couldn't have been less interested. Looked into the computer, then said \"Yeah, there is a credit.\" He didn't say anything else, so I politely asked for an updated bill. He said yeah, all right, and I was still standing there and he finally realized that I wanted the correct bill, like, you know, NOW. He asked \"Do you want me to print it now?\" I said YES. He asked: \"I can just send it to you as an email.\" I said I'd prefer it printed out right then. He FINALLY did it and gave me the updated bill. This whole thing was like pulling teeth. Seriously, is it so hard to do your job? Now, there were POSITIVE aspects to the hotel resort as well. We ate at the Olive bar one evening and the food was very good and the service fast and accurate. Our room was clean and had a small balcony. There was a small fridge and a safe. The housekeeping ladies were all very friendly and our room was always nicely cleaned and tidied. The location of the Hilton resort was good, right in the Mission Bay, near the beach and a park with picnic areas and a playground. The nail tech at the spa was very nice and friendly. We had expected more from the Hilton and it speaks for itself when I say that you can getter better value for your money at the Hampton Inn (by Hilton) than a Hilton Resort.

She spent 20 or more minutes trying to find a combo of rooms that would work for us and bless her patience and perseverence she succeeded!

We were on the top floor of the tower, facing the bay. What a fantastic view! We even left the balcony door open the first night so we could feel the ocean breeze.

The beds had soft linens, feather pillows and were very comfortable. The bathroom had beautiful granite and tile, but a pretty typical bathtub/shower. Not quite ultra luxury bath like a Four Seasons, but really well done. Every hotel employee we encountered was gracious, genuine, and helpful.

The sunsets were great as well as the fireworks from SeaWorld every night (at least in summer). It was a convenient location with regard to getting around San Diego, right off I-5.

At dinner they wanted to seat us outside which I said would be fine as long as we had a heater and the hostess said no problem.

It was the breakfast staff that really blew our minds. Very inefficient. Our waiter would walk all the way out to the patio and only visit one table at a time so good luck getting any drink refills or asking for the check.

There was a newborn next door and it cried alot but was very faint and didn't disturb us. The pool area was lovely but the pool itself was cool. My kids didnt mind. We liked the big checkers board. Poolside food was good (the chicken quesadilla was excellent) but again, expensive and service there was fast and friendly. Great location to see the Sea World fireworks every night.

The negatives start with some noisy children running up and down the hallways, knocking on random doors at 11:00 PM. The worst part wasn't the noise so much as management's lack of concern after I and other guests complained. And we were in the villas which are supposedly an upgrade over the tower. I can only imagine what it is like in that building. In addition, the sauna, locker rooms and showers close at 8 PM which is ridiculous for those of us who wanted to end the day with a nice steam. When asked why they close so early, we were surprised to be told by management that the spa isn't owned by the hotel and they have no control over its operating hours. It seems misleading that this property rerpresents itself as a \"spa\" when they have little or nothing to do with its operation. There is a positive. We were so disappointed with this place that we did not want to spend a second night as planned so we checked out and were not charged for leaving early. Something tells me that this situation happens fairly frequently. If you are a seeking a hotel for relaxation, peace and quiet, romance or spa services, this is NOT the place for you. If you have a family or are with a group where you don't want to worry about keeping noise levels down or keeping your kids under wraps, then this might be a good fit if you can get a room for under $200 (and it's only that high because of it's location on Mission Bay), but be prepared to pay $25/day for unsecured parking and $11/day for internet.

I instantly new we had chosen the right place for our family vacation. The front desk staff was very knowledgeable about the area and answered all questions that I had.

The room was very clean, large and it had a huge sliding glass door. When that door was all the way open, it seemed as if the entire patio and outdoors were part of the room. We had a garden view room which allowed us to watch our children play in a large grass area while my wife and I had a glass of wine on the patio. When the kids were bored with the lawn area we were only steps from the pool and the beach. With this hotel being on the bay it allowed my two boys to play in the sand and water yet not have the fear of them being tackled by large waves or the crowd of Mission Beach. The pool and restaurants are top notch. The pool is large and has an awesome relaxing atmosphere...a real oasis (plus it has a kiddie pool for the little ones). The restaurant on site has spectacular views of the bay where my family and I were able to watch wind surfers from the patio and enjoy our meal. Because the resort is on the boardwalk we had the opportunity to explore all of Mission Bay by way of walking or by bike. We actually rented a four seater bike (through the Hilton) and cruised the boardwalk for an hour. What a great way to cover lots of ground yet still be able to appreciate your surroundings. Finally, what is a San Diego trip with the family without visiting the parks? This place is is practically on Sea World's grounds it's so close, it's around the corner from the San Diego Zoo, and a few miles from Old Town and Mission Beach. Perfect location!!

The room and bathroom was a nice size. The patio had 2 chaise loungers and grassy area. Kids enjoyed playing in the grassy area. This is when the trip got uncomfortable... As I was sitting in the patio watching the kids, in the corner of my eye, I saw something scurry next to my chair and then run away towards the trees. I didn't think anything of it because I thought it was a squirrel or chipmunk. The next day, I confirmed twice that indeed it was not a chipmunk but a 6-8 inch RAT!!!! I was laying on the lounger again, enjoying a cup of coffee. I happen to put my coffee cup on the ground next to me and the next thing I saw was a rat come towards the cup.

So 4 members of the staff (front desk, security, bell hop) walked with us to where the RAT was and it was still sitting there. They went looking for a stick or golf club to make it move.

Room service was quick. My main issue was the Front Desk staff was so rude and had no customer service skills. From the moment I checked in - I felt as if it was an inconvenince for them to assist me. I tried to check in early as I was coming from one San Diego Hilton to another from business to pleasure. The Staff member checked me in and then told me he would call the cleaning crew to see if they would get me into my room early. He took my suitcase and then said he would call me. I waited 3 hours and didnt hear anything. When I called back I got someone else that said they NEVER let anyone check in and I could wait 10 more minutes. I felt I had been lied to. When I went back at check in time - another person made me go through the full check in process again and when I said I already did all of it, he said my credit card was declined..which I knew was not true. When I asked for my luggage I was not even directly responded to...and stood and waited, and had to ask again. When the desk rep gave me my key cards - he didnt even tell me what room number or how to find the room. This is a hotel which is spread out in several buildings. He called a bellboy to help with luggage and as soon as we got outside of the check in area, thebellboy passed me my key and said I could find the room and pointed the way.I struggled with my luggage as he went after what he thought was a better tip.When I got to the room, the maid was just coming out. Seriously! 4 hours later... After leaving this hotel, I realized I left my Kindle in the bottom of the room safe which was ontop of a closet shelf. (I am short and couldnt see what was in it) I called and was forwarded to Security. It took them over 7 hours to call me back. They said the room was occupied and nothing was turned in. When I asked if they could call the room and ask them to take a quick look, I was ignored and told..we have your number if it shows up. Very very lazy...and poor service. My friend called the other Hilton as she lives in the area and misundersstood which hotel I had left my Kindle in..and they called her back in 10 min and actually called the rrom and asked the guests to take a quick look...and then called back again. They were top notch...so it isnt any Hilton..it is just that Hilton that has terrible service.

I do extensive traveling for business and am normally very easy to please, but this place compelled me to write this review. I was traveling with my wife and 1.5 year old twin boys. When we made the reservation (knowing we would be arriving late), we asked that two cribs be put in the room. While this was confirmed during our midnight check in, no cribs were in the room. We had to wait an eternity for cribs to be delivered because \"all the housekeeping people had gone home\". Not a good start. The next morning in the restaurant, we met up with family (who luckily for them were staying elsewhere). After we were seated in the restaurant NO ONE would wait on us. We waited and waited. After asking THREE times for some help, we were told by the only server present that it was not his table, that he had asked someone to help us, and to get any service, we would need to speak to the manager! After speaking with the manager, someone finally showed up, but by then it was beyond annoying. We were gone for most of the day and got back to the room at about 4 pm. The room had not been made up. Because the twins needed a nap, we put them down with the \"Do not Disturb\" sign on the door. Right after the kids fell asleep THE PHONE RINGS - waking up the kids- and the staff person asks when they can clean our room. They had ALL DAY to clean it but wait till the evening and then ignore the \"Do not disturb\" sign. Incredible. The $25 dollar parking fee is high, but it would be better if you actually got a space to park in. When we got back to the room at 10 pm the last night, there were no spaces in the entire resort. I drove around for 20 minutes looking for a place to park (with a bunch of other guests). I eventually had to park on the street and hoof it back to the room (a ten minute walk). There is much much more, but I have already wasted too much of my time on a place (like any other Hilton) that I will never stay at again.

You could stay at the hotel without going anywhere and have plenty of things to do. The hotel property is well maintained. There is a ton of outdoor seating throughout. There is a poolside bar but I couldn't figure out what their hours were, sometimes it was open sometimes it wasn't. The pool area was relaxing. We spent a lot of time there. They had a \"dive in movie\", popcorn and all. I saw some families ordered pizza for it and sat by the fire pit. Great idea. The coffee shop in the morning was good. We ate there several times. The Acqua restaurant was fantastic. I topped at the hotel shop nearly everyday, very convenient, a little overpriced, but worth it to not have to go elsewhere. We stayed in the tower, bay side, although we couldn't see the bay from our balcony. Not a problem though since we didn't spend much time in the room except for sleeping. The beds were very comfortable, the room and bathroom standard hotel size. Housekeeping did an excellent job taking care of us. The 25$ parking fee seems overpriced. You will want a car in San Diego and there is no where else to park near the hotel so they are taking advantage of you there.

For me, resort means offering everything you need on the property for a complete vacation. If you use that idea then this property is certainly a full service hotel but not a resort. So before I go too far and you think this is a terrible hotel let me say we would go back. It's just that you need to temper your expectations. This is not a luxury resort. It's a very nice hotel in a good location (near Sea World and on the bay) that fits well with families with young children. There is a small kiddie pool (1 foot deep) and the main pool only gets to 5 feet deep and is 3 feet deep in most places- so our 4 year old had a great time by just avoiding the middle of the pool. It also draws a family crowd so he had plenty of kids to mess around with whenever he was poolside. Their kids camp is only offered in the summer months (another reason they are not a resort in my opinion) so that was not available, making the poolside encounters that much more important. As we experienced with HIlton in Hawaii we do wish they would put a bit more heat in their heated pools- it was not ice cold as it was in Hawaii but it could have been a bit warmer to make staying in a bit easier. They also had a great food option for those not wanting the full service restaurant: a 7-day happy hour with half price starters and drinks. It made grabbing a quick meal each evening much more affordable and was certainly good enough for us on several occasions. The issue is there is only the 1 restaurant and the bar area so leaving the property was inevitable unless you are really a creature of habit or just there for a long-weekend. Where is the hotel lacking? First, they charge $25/day for self parking. This is essentialy a suburban hotel so that struck me as way too expensive. Second, our expectation of the beach was quite different than the reality- it's not a sit out and sun yourself beach- it's a narrow strip of sand separated from the hotel by the bay-side walking/biking trail (the trail was a nice feature for getting out of the hotel). The rooms are spacious enough and in good (but not great) shape. The TV was new but the signal sketchy if you touched it. The two reading lights besides the beds didn't work at all and the chain on the lamp by the window pulled off on Night 1 (thankfully in the 'off' position). They also went a bit too far with the cheap flourescent bulb in the can light near the doorway which gave a harsh light when it was turned on (and was the only light in the room besides 2 lamps) that made us prefer to leave it off- and we were down to 1 table lamp for the whole room. They would fix things as you called- but you had to call. The shower on/off handle clearly looked like it was added on when the original one broke as it simply didn't look like it belonged there. They also have the old, what I call atomic toilets whose sound resonates for several floors - you will know when your neighbors above have gone to the bathroom and only a sound sleeper can sleep through a toilet flush in the room. So a bit more attention to detail would be nice. But the rooms are comfortable (though with the usual glut of pillows on the beds) and spacious enough. They also have two other features I wish they highlighted more clearly: refrigerators and an in-room safe. Being able to stock the small fridge was great but we were not aware it was there when booking. The safe is always nice given how much we just seem to have that has some value. The food was fine- good not great. It met our needs but we headed for other places just for variety. The larger number of CPK and other food boxes/bags suggested others felt the same way. It was nice to have poolside bar service though we found it odd in this day and age that the female servers were blonde and in short-shorts and short-sleeved shirts while the men practically had no skin showing besides their hands and faces. It's not offensive to me but it is a bit too obvious to go overlooked. So for a good hotel in a great location consider this property. It's not a value option by any means but it was a nice, comfortable base for our 7 days in San Diego.

After thoroughly investigating the options in San Diego, I was pleased to find and contract the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa. While every square foot of this property is stunningly gorgeous, you actually feel like you have escaped to your own private island, and yet you are conveniently located less than ten miles from the trendy downtown Gaslamp location. Now, I work for a non-profit company which has extremely high standards, so I have a \"Champagne taste on a beer budget\" as the saying goes. Even with my tight budget guidelines, they were able to work with me to meet my budget on everything to include my room block, food and beverage, meeting space and audio visual needs at the minimum. They also worked to add numerous added values for my group to definitely encourage our attendees to stay at the hosted conference property. So, while they seemed to make everything look great and seem smoothless in the walk through and had lots of promises as to great customer service, what would happen once the event took place? Well, as they say, \"The proof is in the pudding.\" I could not have hoped for a better experience from an event planning prospective all the way to my conference attendees experience. They distinguish themselves through their customer service. Every single staff member from the Director to a front line food and beverage staff is attentive, a sense of urgency, and was never ONCE annoyed or put off my more than abundant requests. And I had a lot of them. I would also have to comment on the professionalism, welcoming nature, flexibility, great sense of genuineness and attention to detail my Conference Services Manager had. Every planning meeting I had with her was extremely enjoyable and put me at ease for my extremely important event. This experience was so great we not only had our event there in 2009, but in 2010 as well. I am extremely grateful. Thank you for helping to make our event one that our attendees will never forget.

Overall, there is nothing inherently wrong with the resort, but it just underwhelmed me. First, off the pictures on the website made it look as though this resort was on the ocean proper. Yeah, I guess if you look really closely and read very carefully you will be able to discern that the water in the pictures is from more of a river that is located behind the hotel. Just know---this is not the ocean. The water is dead still and the beach isn't that great. Yeah, they have boats and things to rent, but the water is pretty unimpressive, unless you have never been to a real ocean before. The Hilton is located in the middle of a large park, as well, so there are plenty of people around and the walkways are filled with people riding bikes--not very nice to walk on (good for riding bikes though). The grounds look pretty nice, so I can give that a plus. The pool seemed too small for the resort, and though it was nice, is guaranteed to be crowded, all the time. This is a pretty good area to check out some beach bodies, however. I am a Hilton Diamond VIP and though I wasn't treated poorly, I never felt as though I was being treated any different than the average Joe, despite the hundred plus nights I stay at Hilton properties yearly. This is ok for a Hampton Inn, but at a resort I feel as though this is a bit of an insult. The hotel check in time is 4pm, which is fine, but I tried to check in about 45 minutes early, and was told that the room wasn't ready and that it was a nice room and that i should wait and they will call me when it was ready. Other people were checking in and going to their rooms, so I thought \"this must be a really nice room and I am getting upgraded like I should be given my Diamond status\". I wait till 4pm and they call me to let me know my room is ready. I go to the room and it is just a regular room (#406 on 02/12/11-02/13/11)!!! No different than any other Hilton hotel in the U.S. No different than any other regular room in the hotel, except that the outside area, which are nice and have a couch/bed thing, is connected to another rooms outside area, because we are a corner room! The building we are in is shaped like an L, and our room and the room next to us are on opposing sides of the inside of the elbow. So our outside area is virtually unusable, unless you like being that close to your neighbor with no separating feature (the rest of the rooms have a wall). That was a disappointment, especially after I waited thinking I was getting an upgrade to a \"nice room\". The room wasn't bad, again standard Hilton, but wasn't \"special\", I expected more from a \"resort\" though. It was particularly noisy, however. It seemed to have a \"water running through pipes\" sound that never ceased, even at night. Anytime anyone walked by and was talking we heard the conversation loud and clear, because the front door had qaurted inch gaps on all sides between it and the jamb. Not a big deal in warm San Diego, but not a good sound dampening system. There is only one restaurant (that I found--the hotel info book is useless), which is the same as any other Hilton. We ate breakfast at the restaurant, \"Acqua\" (Diamond VIPs get free breakfast, which is nice), and it was really pretty good, so I can't complain there. You will need a car, though, if you plan on eating anything that isn't $30 a course. I wasn't charged for parking, but you are normally supposed to pay, and so I give them credit for not charging me, I guess that makes up for any other lack of VIP benefit. We also were given two bottles of water at check-in for being VIP members, so again they did give me some benefits. This hotel is nice for what it is---a hotel, but as far as being a resort, just know that it has that title predominantly because it has a spa. I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you got a great deal and you just need a place to stay,---like a regular Hilton.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, very relaxing accomodations.\u201d", "Author": "traveler0000043", "ReviewID": "UR96174006", "Content": "I would highly recommend this property.

Our package included two free nights per room, which turned out to be a great deal. I was completely satisfied with our room accomodations, and would highly recommend the Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa.

She gave us a key we could use to look around the hotel property, then we headed for Balboa Park. When we got back at 4:00 p.m., we had not received a call, so I just assumed they forgot to call. Actually, the room still wasn't ready, so they upgraded us to a better room! We got a very spacious room on the second floor of one of the wings with a great view of the ocean. We thought it might be noisy, because I-5 is very close to the hotel, but our room was exceptionally quiet. The boys had a room on the first floor which wasn't quite as spacious as ours, but still had a great ocean view. The beds were awesomely comfortable - I slept like a baby. We had one minor maintenance issue (the bathroom door squeaked which was annoying when we had to get up at night), but that was quickly resolved when I told the folks at the front desk. The property was lovely. Even though it was unseasonably cold in San Diego, the boys used the pool (which was heated nicely, according to them) and the hot tub, which they really enjoyed. I used the fitness center, which was nicely appointed with treadmills & ellipticals and weight equipment. I struck up a conversation with a local woman who was on another elliptical, and she told me that she had a membership to the fitness center there. It is pretty upscale. It even had a changing room with a sauna, lockers with digital locks and showers. There were plenty of towels. We did not eat at the hotel, but I did get coffee and danish at the coffee shop by the registration area. I waited in line for about 15-20 minutes to get my breakfast items - that was the only thing I would say could have been improved. There was only one gentleman working behind the counter, and although he was friendly, he seemed a bit overwhelmed. There was a steady stream of people waiting. There was a $25/day fee for parking, but since I knew about it and was expecting it, there was no surprise. Because the hotel was right by I-5, we were able to easily access all parts of the city with our rental car, so we explored from Coronado and points south to Torrey Pines State Reserve to Temeculah and the wine country north of San Diego. We had a wonderful trip to San Diego, and the hotel stay was part of it. I would certainly stay there again, and I would also go back to San Diego. It is a lovely town with friendly people and a more small-town feel to it than other major cities in California.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vacaville, California", "Title": "\u201cThey tried to make it newer but it didn't work.\u201d", "Author": "oualumni", "ReviewID": "UR92349081", "Content": "The room we stayed in was probably one of the best in the hotel (the villas on the waterfront with a firepit.)

Easy access to I-5 within minutes. (2) Nice Pool (3) Well manicured grounds (4) Friendly check-in hotel & maintenance staff (5) Parking in front of the room is very convenient (6) Starbucks on resort property is a plus (7) Maid service was first rate (leave a small tip each day, it is the right thing to do) CONS ===== (1) Not a true 4(four) star hotel, 3(three) at best as this is an older place that does show it's age. Bathroom are the worst, mold/grime is clearly visible on the caulking and ceiling; the need to be gutted. Upon room review, make sure to check the bathroom first and immediately request a different room at the first sign of disrepair! (2) Parking is ridiculous at $25 a night. Even if this place had a 24-hour security guard/gate it still would not be worth it. Hilton take note, Disneyland charges $15 dollars a day and they have FULL security with cameras, come on, get with it. Stop gouging us!!!! Had to budget around this cost all week, dissapointing! (3) Restaurant albeit good, WAY too expensive. NOTE: if parking were less, perhaps it could be justified. (4) Extra cost for the exercise room, nonsense for a supposed 4(four) star hotel this should be included. (5) Bay is not that pretty at all; very murky resembles more of a retention pond. Having a bay view just is not worth it....don't pay for it. NOTE: this place is not near the OCEAN, don't be fooled! (6) There were bugs in the rooms, several small spider bugs and pinchers were present. FINAL THOUGHTS =============== (1) Hotel staff during my entire 8(eight) day stay never bothered to call to check in and see if everything was ok. Very poor customer service. Four(4) star hotels are concerned with their guests comfort.....didn't seem like they were interested. (2) If you can get room for $70/80 a night, it is ok, otherwise pass on this place as there are much better places to stay in the San Diego area (Imperial (Cornado), Mission and Solana beaches, LaJolla, Carsbad, Del Mar and or Oceanside.

He didn\u2019t need to do this as the beach was right there and he rather spend his time playing in the sand. The beach looked like it was racked every morning and there was a pathway that went up and down the beach and many people used for running. The pools were wonderful too. There was a kiddie pool and bigger pool with a zero entry. There was a also a spa, with a wonderful view of the beach. Some areas of the hotel could have used a better cleaning (i.e. the waterfall and pools and wine glasses sat by room for 2 days), but they were not that bad. The room was an average room, with a refrig. The room had some areas that were worn as the other reviewers had stated, but I found them good enough. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was updated with granite countertops. We were not in the room that much as we utilized the beach a lot. We used the refrig to store milk and drinks for breakfast. The front desk attendant also mentioned that if we needed a microwave that we could rent one for $20 a day or I could just ask the restaurant to heat up my sons toddler meals. There was free wifi in the courtyard area and happy hour from the bar is everyday from 5-7pm. They will even give you a drink in a plastic cup so you could sit outside by the pool. The parking was the only outrageous thing at the resort ($25 a day) and to be honest we are not even sure they went around to look for the ticket hanging in the window. I had left it off most of the time and we didn\u2019t have one problem. All and all, I would highly recommend this resort for anyone with little ones (our son is 2 1/2), looking for a hotel on the beach (although I wouldn\u2019t swim in the water-too cold), a wonderful pool area, especially with the zero entry and a kiddie pool. I would also like to mention that EVERY staff member at this resort had a smile and their face and were so pleasant. I find that refreshing these days as it is hard to come by. My only regret is that we didnt have more time to stay at the resort.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poway, California", "Title": "\u201cExceeded our Expectations!\u201d", "Author": "resortlover99", "ReviewID": "UR80645628", "Content": "From the staff, to the service, to the location directly on Mission bay, to the pool, grounds and our suite, THIS RESORT EXCEEDED ALL OUR EXPECTATIONS ON OUR ANNIVERSARY WEEKEND.

Perfect location on the bay and located to so many great destinations in San Diego. I have stayed here easily half a dozen times over the last 10 years. It has been a few years since i was last here and i was glad to see the growth. When I lived in Vegas, we had brought family and friends down on a couple of occasions. Now that i live in Carlsbad, I still bring the family down there for an escape from NC. There is now a bar (on the boardwalk) and an expanded recreational rentals store front on the water. Our room was fresh and clean. The refurbished decorations were comfortable and sophisticated and solid. Not sure how long ago these changes were made, but definitely nice. The beds were comfortable and the pillows were great. Nice large flat screen TV. $11.95 for the internet. We went and rode our bikes along the great bike / walking path. Had a great relaxing time. We ate at Aqua and sat outside in the teardrop pods. We had the prosciutto and goat cheese appetizers. The ham selections were delicious (Italian Parma; duck; & Austrian) - serviced with slices of Parmesan, pickles and olives (the pickles weren't that great). The goat cheese wasn't as good as i had hoped but the fig confit helped make it tasty. The only two complaints were 1) (and this is more because of the HHonors program) the price for parking is now $25 per night. If it were a downtown location were parking was at a premium, i could swallow it better. I talked to the MOD (Nick) and lodged my complaint and there was little he was willing to listen to. I work in the resort business so, I definitely understand his stance but that didn't cure the bad taste in my mouth about it. Regarding the HHonors, i would have hoped after being a loyal HHonors member for 20 years, that there would be some perk for my loyalty. I didn't even get offered a room upgrade and i know the hotel wasn't 100% filled up. 2) the second complaint is that we stayed at the far south end of the property in room 501. In that room, we were right next to the property facilities (assume laundry and maintenance). At about 10pm, we started to hear sounds from a party going on. As i looked outside, i discovered that the party was actually coming from the hotel facilities. I didn't mind the noise so much (although it was pretty loud) and i had fallen asleep with the door open. At about 2:30 am, the party was still going on. I couldn't go to sleep at that point and i finally closed the door.

I was a little concerned about soaking in a public Jacuzzi, but my friend assured me that it was well-maintained and would be fine. I soaked Friday afternoon, then again Sunday morning before checking out. Sunday morning, after having been in the Jacuzzi for about 30 minutes, I got out, dried off, and when I went to put my towel in the basket, I found one used condom and two condom wrappers in the bushes adjacent to the Jacuzzi I had just soaked myself in. DISGUSTING! (Was the other used condom floating around in the water with me?!) I told the front desk supervisor, William, about my experience and how disgusted I was. He offered no apology and would not compensate me in any way. It was 11:30, and check-out time was at noon. I asked him if I could have a little extra time to take a longer shower in my room. He told me I had until noon to shower, pack and be out of the room. I went back to my room, literally nauseated by the thought of having soaked my body in that water. I showered as quickly as possible, though I wanted to stay in the shower much longer in order to get all of the umm...bodily fluids off of me. I called William at the front desk at 11:50 and asked him if I could have an extra 15 minutes. \"That will be a problem. We have another guest checking in and need to clean the room.\" (Check-in time is at 4:00.) I reminded him that I was the lady who had just soaked in someone's ___. He grudgingly gave me until 12:30, after which time, he assured me, I would be charged an additional $75.00. (I wasn't asking for a lot of time; a mere extra 15 minutes to get the other person's bodily fluids sufficiently washed off.) Anyway, I went down at 12:10 and spoke with William's boss, Josh. He was much friendlier. He apologized for the condoms and for William's behavior and assured me the used condom would be picked up and William would be spoken to. I'm genuinely saddened that this happened. Before this ordeal, I was really enjoying my stay, the staff and the grounds. William's behavior was completely unacceptable.

The walls are a bit thinner than you'd expect from a hotel of this class, however. The overall feel of the resort is good, with lots of open areas and seating. The pool area is nice but becomes a bit crowded during the day, but the beach is just a few steps away so it's easy to find a spot. It's along Mission Bay which has a great walking trail. As for location, it's great for what it is. You're not in the middle of everything but Mission Bay is beautiful and offers lots to do. If you're looking for nightlife or shopping you'd be better served to look elsewhere. We have 2 small children and they had a great time at the pool and at the beach, and unlike at some other properties we did not feel uncomfortable having our children with us. That said, the service leaves something to be desired. There were a number of little issues that left us feeling like this is a 3 star service hotel, not a 4. A few examples: some of the restaurant service was quite slow, although the waitstaff was uniformly friendly. Also, the bathrooms in the restaurant were not well maintained. Of 3 sinks, 2 did not have any soap in the dispensers, and my wife informed me that the waste baskets in the women's restrooms were overflowing (and not during a particularly busy time). The food was very good to occasionally exceptional, however, though quite expensive. As for other staff, they were mostly helpful with an occasional exception. For example, a linen cart deliveryman was at the the elevators and occupied the 1st to arrive without offering it to waiting guests. It was not like there was an endless stream of people waiting, either. It's things like this that can make people paying premium rates feel less than valued as customers. If the resort were to fix these small but quite important details it could, given its location and otherwise good offerings, be considered a true 4 star resort. And of course, no review would be complete without a complaint about the ridiculous charges assessed by most hotels in this class. No free Internet in the rooms? $25 to park when this is not a downtown location? These things leave one feeling as if Hilton is picking one's pockets.

Compared to the first room, it was much, much better. Very quiet, nice view of the bay and the room opened up to its own patio and to the lovely gardens. The walking path along the bay was conveniently located a short distance away. Each morning I took an very enjoyable stroll along the bay. The room itself was very nice with updated decor and comfortable beds and pillows. The room was a little musty-smelling but not unbearable. The resort is a little outdated, but again, it wasn't too bad. It is centrally located within the San Diego area. My biggest complaint is the $25/nite parking fee. But most 4-star hotels in San Diego charge for parking, so I expected it. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Resort. It was definitely worth the low rate we paid. If we had to pay full price, I might have had a different opinion. I would definitely stay there again IF we got the same rate and a similar garden/bayfront villa room.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Big Sky, Montana", "Title": "\u201cDirty and Poorly Maintained, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "GeyserWhitewater", "ReviewID": "UR62781628", "Content": "We stayed for a few days in the middle of April.The hotel is in a great location for Sea World and Mission Beach.

However, once I booked it, I had a feeling this wasn't going to go well before we even got there. The hotel didn't return my calls for starters, then we got there and were given a single King when I had requested a double Queen. They brought a rollaway instead - after we waited quite a while for it. (Granted, I did get a call from the front desk asking if it had been delivered yet, which it hadn't). They didn't even bring it IN the room; they knocked and presented it to us (I was traveling with a friend), and WE had to roll it into the room, move furniture around so it would fit, and set it up, which then made a desk and chair unusable because it was too tight. When we checked in, I asked for a manager to call me in the room to discuss the parking situation. They charge $25/day for parking (ridiculous, given they have plenty of room for guest parking). I am disabled and have a disabled parking permit. I wanted them to reduce or waive the parking fee. The manager never called me. I ended up with a \"supervisor\" being brought out to speak with me as I checked OUT (not a manager). He did halve the parking fee and said \"next time\" I stayed there, they would be sure to \"take care of me\" - shouldn't they be \"taking care of me\" from the moment I make the reservation?!? I even told him we were not done with our vacation but were so disappointed by the room and service that we had decided to stay our prepaid 3 nights because I couldn't get a refund, but that we were going to stay at another hotel for the 4th night. That was an opportunity for him to comp a room for our last night, but he didn't make that choice. My travel buddy had breakfast there one morning: $22 for a measly meal. And I had martinis at the bar one night - $14 each! Crazy! Even the bartender recommended not ordering certain desserts because they were \"the size of a MINI Reese's peanut butter cup\". MINI, mind you. Peace and quiet? Only rarely - on the one hand, seeing the SeaWorld fireworks every night might have been fun, but they didn't even mention it on check-in, so we were startled every night by the booming noises from across the bay and didn't get out in time to see the whole show. Not to mention the \"young adults\" who were running around our small building of units, outside our door, and knocking plates and glasses over on the room service tray we had set outside by our door. Oh, don't forget: there is a fee for EVERYthing. Parking, wi-fi, gym access, etc. A total ripoff. The room was dated, very dark. There was a floor lamp that I couldn't figure out how to turn on; ends up it has a foot switch, but it was so dark on the floor in the corner where it sits that I couldn't see it. Why didn't someone come and orient us to the room? We did have \"Doug,\" a kind of shabby but nice older man unload the bags from our car but that was it. There was also mildew all over the shower curtain. The positives? The king bed was comfy, the linens clean, the towels big and thick, and the big oval, cushioned lounge chair on the patio was very comfy to lay on when outside. Oh, and their location is good, but there are better places to be, especially if you don't plan on doing Seaworld (we didn't).", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney Australia", "Title": "\u201cThis motel masquerades as a Hilton\u201d", "Author": "rbinsydney", "ReviewID": "UR62183543", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at this excuse for a Hilton Hotel.

You get the sense that the owners know their location is great for families and they do just enough upkeep to keep people interested in staying there. There are definitely pluses: the beds are very comfortable, staff tries to be accommodating, and it has a pool, spa and conference center. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure, in room safe and refrigerator were all pleasant surprises. Great access to I-5, Sea World, downtown and coastal beach towns. The property sits right on the beach with a large (cement) \"boardwalk\" walking/biking path running alongside the bay. If you like taking a walk/riding a bike on a scenic path right outside your door this is perfect. Mission Bay is beautiful and very peaceful on winter weekdays. The pool looked very nice, and the conference center seemed to be in better shape than the rest of the facility. Free wifi connection was sporadically available in that lobby and in the registration area. The minuses are significant. First, as others have noted the buildings are older, rooms and halls are dark. Several rooms had a musty/mildewy odor as did the halls. Our building's outside door locks didn't lock at night so it didn't feel very secure knowing anyone could walk into the building at night from the nearby parks or walking paths. The recent renovations in the rooms are attractive but we tried several rooms due to musty odor, malfunctioning phone/TV, or absurdly poor location of the parking lots right up to the first floor patio door. There's a huge tent sitting in the parking lot which is used for special events. If you are in the tower building on the first floor be prepared for the intrusion of car lights shining right into your room. The 2 story villa buildings have no elevators so they assume everyone is ok hauling your bags to the 2nd floor room or being in the tower. The worst is indeed the noise. The doors must be hollow since we couldn't escape any hallway noises of housekeeping carts and personnel shouting to one another in Spanish or the heavy footsteps above our room which awakened us each morning. The bathrooms were renovated but the paint is chipping, and there's a panel over the tub area that is reminiscent of a 1970's era apartment. The halls and rooms are dark, and they only illuminate the ceiling hall lights and not the wall sconces, despite the unappealing dark appearance. The front desk staff are impresseive since they appear to be doing everything. The Hilton charges $25 a night for parking, plus $12 a day room (ethernet) internet connection. There is no concierge on duty for this \"resort\" ; which even 3* hotels frequently have, so to call this a resort seems outrageous for what you are getting. Overall, it is challenging to stay here, but the accessibility of the parks and paths, location right on the bayfront, hard-working front desk staff personnel, and general location made it a better experience.

Location was far away from everything but there were alot of activities to do just near the hotel. Great bike path and a great pool. Pool was packed...lots of kids and families. One of the pool guys - Dan - tried to help us find lounge chairs (towel wars - saving of chairs). He tried a couple of times - great service!!! The pool was cool and refreshing. One morning we had bloody marys at the pool (great ones!). They don't start bar service until 11:30 which was kind of late (need that bloody mary on a sunday morning!!) but you can walk to the very nice Olive Bar (very funny bartender) and they will give you a pool drink. The beach out front on the bay (it is not on the ocean) was really pretty. They have public fire pits so we bought a bundle of wood (which they sell at the resort) and sat on the beach with a fire - it was very beautiful. They also have really nice little conversation areas throughout the hotel - and a gas firepit they light at the pool until 10:00.

The property has since undergone a renovation and I'm pleased to say it's even more beautiful today. Our room, on the sixth floor of the tower, was a bit smaller than I would have expected (two queen-sized beds didn't leave much floor space). And the bathroom was REALLY on the small (almost cramped) side. Nevertheless, the room seemed very clean. We had a great view of Mission Bay from our balcony and were able to watch the fireworks at nearby Sea World each night of our stay -- a big plus when traveling with young children. We spent quite a bit of time at the pool, which did not seem to be heated (though it should have been -- it gets chilly both day and night in San Diego). There's also a 1-foot-deep \"kiddie\" pool that was nice (though not lit at night and also not heated). The two spas were very busy in the evening hours. Only one minor pool problem (not the hotel's fault): The pool was shut down beginning in the mid-afternoon on a Sunday due to an, um, \"human waste\" issue. It did not reopen until the next morning. That it was unexpectedly closed was a real bummer. The staff throughout the property was extremely friendly. EVERYONE we passed in hallways and around the grounds greeted us with a friendly hello and offered to assist us with whatever we might need. The concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable in giving us directions to area attractions and eateries. Same goes for a parking valet who gave me step-by-step directions to a restaurant one evening. We dined two mornings during our stay at Acqua, the hotel's casual dining restaurant. The breakfast brunch offered a decent number and variety of dishes, most of them very tasty. My only complaint: There were a lot of flies buzzing around the food because of the many open patio doors in the restaurant. I also took issue with the resort charging $25 per night for parking (which is pretty scarce in the evenings on weekends). It would get one thing if it was valet service or if the lot was secured, but neither is the case. It seemed very expensive. Overall, though, we had an outstanding stay at this property.

We thought it odd that only one staff member even bothered to smile at us during our entire stay. With the exception of the gentleman who will assist you in renting a bicycle, not one staff member was courteous or personable. It's almost as though the entire staff has been instructed to ignore guests. We experienced this at the pool, the restaurant and the front desk. Considering how much we spent to \"enjoy\" the property, we expected more. We don't think that responsiveness from the front desk, a \"hi\" and smile from staff on the grounds, or decent service for a meal that cost well over $200 for a family of 4 was too much to ask.

The primary problems with the hotel, although there are a good number of them, seem to pale in comparison to the bad service rendered at the hotel. I guess the best way to look at it if you're considering a stay is this: Why is a waterfront hotel and resort run by the Hilton company with TONS of amenities in a great location rated SO LOW in Tripadvisor ratings for the city?!?!?! Think about it. First off, some of the positives: -Nice bay location that's up against a nice city park with a great jogging path and lots of room to play and relax, whether it's water or land you wish to play on. -Good coffee and lighting in rooms, and having a mini-fridge is always a nice touch. -Pool area is nice and complete with lush landscaping, bar service, hot tubs, plush towels, security, and firepits that make for a really nice area. -Good, comfortable beds and quality air conditioning that truly works! Now, a dose of reality about this hotel that makes you feel it's all facade, and no heart. -Poor housekeeping. My room featured a kleenex and an India Palace or some such restaurant's receipt UNDER MY PILLOW! -While rooms have nice furnishings, they seem to be getting old and a bit worn down around the edges. My room featured some chips on the wall, a shower curtain coming off the rod, an inconsistently flushing toilet, and a remote control for the tv that only had part of the buttons working. -OUTRAGEOUS prices in the snack shop! Let's just put it this way,...THREE DOLLARS for a 12-ounce container of milk. -Overpriced parking for $22 per night when it's nowhere near downtown and is set next door to a park with HUNDREDS of free spots. MONEY GRAB!! Also features an overpriced restaurant, overpriced bar, and overpriced internet for your overpriced web-surfing pleasure. Lastly, and most important of all, this place simply has disgustingly poor service, particularly at the front desk. I checked in with a supervisor and had some questions about my benefits as a frequent stay member. Because he was unable to satisfactorily answer my questions, he suggested we call the main answer line for Hilton. After several minutes of holding, a lady came on the other end, and after hearing my questions and concerns offered a statement I'll never forget,....\"Sir, we appreciate your loyalty to Hilton and would like to offer you and your family a weekend to look at one of our Hilton Grand Vacations destinations!!!\" NO JOKE,she was trying to sell a customer with a question and a complaint a TIMESHARE CONDO!! My question was never answered, the guy at the desk kept shaking his head and smirking, and they had a customer whose stay had been ruined before it began.

We did have a problem when we tried to check in early and were assured they would put a rush on having our room cleaned so we could check in. By 4:00 they still did not have our room ready so they upgraded us to a Garden Front Villa which was tastefully furnished and very comfortable. The towels were fine - don't know what to say about \"sharp edges\" review. And, yes - it costs $22 to park your car but I am from Seattle and this is common there, too.

Worth looking for the brochures and doing your own research.

It is absolutely nothing like the pictures illustrate on all the websites. We stayed in their Lanai villa bayfront room priced at $320 per night. What a joke of room and waste of money. If you're looking for a nice romantic weekend with the one you love look elsewhere to spend it as you will be completely disappointed. Our room faced out toward the \"bay\" which was actually more like a swamp without trees. Its located on a public park with a bike path nearly 15 feet from your sliding glass door with constant people walking, running, biking and/or skateboarding from sun up until about 11 pm at night. Their noise can easily be heard even with the sliding glass door shut and no windows open. The furnishings in the room are all mismatched and look like they were picked up the day before at a consignment store and thrown in to make it a \"room\" including hanging wires to the tv and internet connection (of course you have to pay to use the WiFi) visible and dangling there under the table they set the tv on. There was not even a coffee maker even though in their description it states there is one. We ordered room service which came after 45 minutes (it was a pizza and chicken sandwich, yes seriously 45 minutes later) and both were cold and almost inedible had it not been for our hunger. The beer was the best part of that dinner and that was because it was bottled beer they couldn't screw up. You have to PAY $22 A NIGHT TO SELF PARK YOUR CAR BECAUSE VALET ISN'T OFFERED. On Sunday morning, we were woken up by two sets of crew teams rowing and yelling down the swamp, err i mean bay, at 830 am. To top it off and yes, i'm not joking about this, YOU HAVE TO INDIVIDUALLY TURN ON AND OFF EACH LIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIGHT SWITCH IN THE ROOM. I mean, is there any other word to use here besides simply, unbelievable. The best part of our weekend was when we weren't wasting time at this awful, awful hotel.

Also, parking will cost you $22/night if you do have a vehicle. However, to keep that in context, a short cab ride to Old Town or beyond will cost you about $15 plus tip for each way, more than offsetting the parking cost. A taxi to the airport is $25 plus tip one way. The good news is the hotel's restaurant food and service is excellent if you choose to eat there.

Also if you need cash don't use the hotel installed ATM, they have a limit of $100 and charge $3.50 for the priviledge. At the local bank there is no limit and they charged $1.50 for a withdrawal. The quality for all meals (breakfast & dinner) in the restaurant was good but again we paid half the price for comparable quality outside the hotel. There are many restaurants a short cab or drive away especially in Old Town, which are comparable quality but half the price. Our sense was that the hotel is seeking to charge extra at every opportunity.

We got a garden view room which had a little peek of the bay and a great open area in front for our kids to run around on. The room was nice and check-in (Taylor) was really good. I don't know why they charge $22 a night to park when it doesn't seem like they enforce parking. Also, I think they should give guests a bit of a price break on the Bay activities (renting kayaks, catamarans, boats, etc.) rather than charging them the same price as anyone else walking by. Unfortunately, someone pooed in the pool our 2nd day there, so we were not able to enjoy that. That was a real bummer. They closed it off and the staff didn't seem at all accommodating to the guests for the inconvenience. When we called the front desk the next morning (the morning we were going to check out) they said the pool would still be closed until the afternoon. So then we proceeded to pack up our stuff to head to our next destination up near Knotts Berry Farm, and walked over to the pool area so that the kids could get one last game of table tennis in. To our surprise (about 1 hour after we called), the pool was open, and I guess had been when we called. Takesha (I think that was her name) did not offer much sympathy when I told her at check out and only said, \"well, you could go swim now.\" Obviously she didn't appreciate the hassle of having to unpack everything and get 3 kiddos under 7 ready. So, when I say \"not a 10\", I mean that this is the level of service they're striving for but didn't achieve in my opinion. This to mean, if I were a teacher grading, 10 would mean \"exceeds or is above expectations.\" Taylor was the only one that seemed to be close... maybe a 9-9.5. All others did not seem overly accommodating or appear to want to go out of their way to please the guests. Next time we may try the Hyatt Mission Bay or go on Coronado or stay at La Jolla Shores.

It's loaded with families and kids... so it was good for us as a family. We were in the main hotel facing the freeway. The Good: - Gorgeous setting on Mission bay. - It's only a few minutes from Seaworld. - Lots to do on the sight. - Nice pool area. - Employees were all very friendly. - Plenty of parking spaces by the main hotel. - Larger than average rooms with big balcony. - Nice bath soaps/shampoos. - Bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The Bad: - Parking $22/night (way too much for the area... downtown you'd expect this... in the area it is in the parking should be free; or at least no more than $10/night). - While we didn't notice outside noise, we could here EVERYTHING going on inside the hotel. Every step that was taken in the room above us, every time a door would open/close in the hallway, every time someone would open their sliding closet door or even flush their toilet we could hear it... loud and clear. - While the hotel is maintained well, it could use some updating (especially in the rooms... the tile and most of the fixtures in the bath area appear to be many decades old... and there was a bad patch job done above the shower head (like the room above must have leaked onto our ceiling and rotted it at one point)). - The TV was old and the picture slightly distorted. Most 4* (and even quite a few 3*) hotels have already upgraded to large flat-panel TV's... at this level of property I would kind-of expect them to keep up. - Took housekeeping 3 calls and 5 hours to bring us a roll-away bed... albeit the front desk was very friendly and apologetic. Conclusion: If they would update and soundproof the rooms and cut the parking fees I'd give this place the top 5 out of 5 rating it is certainly capable of.

Our balcony with cushy furniture overlooked the bay. Very romantic at sunset and sunrise. My fiance and I took long walks on the quiet and private beach area. We had breakfast at hotel restaurant. The complimentary coupon was for 18 dollars each person, which more than covered our delicious meal (large portions, great food). The restaurant overlooked the bay area.

A king room with lanai with a fire pit. Great location, however they recently renovated the rooms and removed the ceiling fans in all there rooms. With an energy crunch, who does this. We no longer could enjoy the cool breeze with our fan as we had done in the past. Instead we had to run the air conditioner. What a waste. When they renovated, they put in some funky type wicker furniture that is not comfortable. The patio furniture is just as uncomfortable. When you are paying 480+ a night you expect better.

The Banana Cabana offers a full bar and grill as well as snacks and drinks for kids. A little over priced but what resort isn't?? We ate dinner at the Bayside Grille and had one of the finest dinners we've ever had. True fine dining. Don't expect fast food when eating at a 4star restaurant. Good quality food takes time but is well worth the wait. Everything was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. I highly recommend the mushroom crusted halibut! We didn't eat there for breakfast or lunch so I can't tell you if the service is faster at those times but I can only assume so since they never had a wait time. Expect prices to reflect the qualtiy of the food. If you want fast, cheap food try Dennys. I've often said that bad travelers write bad reviews.

When we checked in and went to our room, we got a huge surprise upon opening the door. Of course it was probably a bigger surprise for the people who had arrived at the room five minutes before us and were already camped out on the beds. One would think that the front desk would respond diligently to such a problem of double booking, but after a curt \"we'll do what we can\" reply on the phone, the other family called with a little more fervor. After twenty minutes, someone arrived to give the other family key cards to their new room. They didn't help them move, didn't apologize, and didn't offer to tidy up our soiled room. They did manage to deactivate our room keys though. When we went to the front desk for new keys, the lady proceded to give us a lecture on proper key usage like we were kids. While the location is beautiful and San Diego is a magic place for our family, this stay ends a six-year routine we have kept. Something changed drastically in the way the property is managed. The hallway smelled of mildew like we never smelled before. The staff attitude was indifferent and rude, when it used to be very friendly. The kicker is that two months after the fact, I got a form letter from the property manager saying something along the lines of \"we appreciate your feedback and will consider your input\" or something like that. When I emailed back to say \"don't bother,\" it was clear she had no clue what the problem we encountered was. I got a form response about \"improvement and change\" with all sorts of corporate buzzwords like \"synergy\" and \"teamwork.\" It thoroughly explained why we had the experience we had. No one in management listens. The vibe from the staff was one of indifference and being there solely to collect a paycheck. While the property is beautiful (despite the sometimes polluted bay), it is not worth the huge prices they want. To top it off, parking is extremely difficult, because with a full hotel, packed conference rooms, and sections of the parking lot closed off for their storage and events, there are not enough spaces.

Checkin: I arrived at about 10:30 in the evening on a Sunday night. I was initially very impressed. There was a live band playing in the background, and it definitely added to the resort feel. Checkin was quick and easy. (Be forewarned if you use Debit to backup your account, they will put a hold on your account for $100 for EACH day of your stay!) The Room: Our room was 377. The hallway had that funky smell that has been mentioned in other reviews. Smelled like fresh paint to me. It was noticable but not too bothersome; I could not smell it in the actual room. My first impression of the room was \"WOW\". It was very contemporary - not my style, but very nice nonetheless. Also liked the balcony area. Beds were very comfy. The NOISE: This is where the WORST part comes in. I have never stayed in a hotel where the noise was almost unbearable. Light sleepers beware! The noise tended to peak at the 11:30 pm timeframe - about when the Sea World folks were returning and then start up again around 7 or 8 am. You can easily hear footsteps, voices, doors, and of course the unique toilet flushing sound. Sometimes it sounded as if it was several floors above. It was quite obnoxious! I'd managed to wear my 3 yr old out every day of our stay, so luckily SHE slept through it all. Restaurant: We ate breakfast at the terrace restaurant every morning. It was consistently good. I ordered from the menu two days and did the buffet one. Both were good. The buffet had a little of everything and then some. $22-24 for one adult and a child (includes tip) wasn't great, but it was convenient and tasty. The service was excellent. General appearance: The grounds in general were very nice and well groomed. You could see people working each day on maintaining this. The pool area was lovely and had quite a lot of shade in the mornings. It looked like a nice place to just sit and relax even if you weren't enjoying the pool. Parking: As mentioned before, the $20 parking fee is outrageous. We did self park each day as I did not want the hassle of waiting for a valet. We never had a problem parking close to the tower. Overall we had a good visit. The location was very convenient to Sea World and at $80 on Priceline, it was definitely a bargain.

If you can afford the extra few dollars get this bigger room rather than the cheaper smaller ones. The smaller rooms had their patios right outside their front doors on commonly used walkways rather than on the oppossite end of the room the way ours was.

Beds were comfortable but not as nice as some I've stayed on. The bathroom was loud, you could even hear when neighbors took showers, but had nice towels. The pool and grounds around it were above average, even better than I had hoped based on the rest of the exterior condition of the hotel. There were lots of kids on the weekend however so I wouldn't recommend for someone looking for a quiet get away. The weekdays we were there were very quiet. Some rooms have fire pits outside. I personally did not like this as I don't want to smell smoke when I'm sleeping. We had a family move in below us who liked a good fire so that prevented us from leaving the sliding glass door open in the evenings. The beach that is right outside of the hotel is really nothing special at all compared to the other excellent San Diego area beaches we visited. Still it gave our 3 year old a chance to play in the sand which is all she really cared about. We had lunch and dinner at the hotel multiple times. It is very expensive but was of a high enough quality that we weren't dissapointed. One tip. Ask for the lunch menu if nothing on the dinner menu looks appealing. I could only have steak so many times and discovered that they'll server lunch during the dinner hour. The turkey wrap I ordered while still expensive was excellent.

In fact, we were only able to book a king bed room (we wanted 2 beds) and request the 2 beds. The clerk then told me that she was giving us a room with 2 queens that was 25% larger than their regular rooms. To make things even better, the room she gave us had a bay view. Our room was very clean and definitely renovated. It was in one of the garden wings (not the tower) near the bay. It was very contemporary in style (if previous posters did not have a contemporary room, they may not have had the renovated room that they thought they had). There was an additional area where the bar was, that was down a few steps. It had bamboo or bamboo like flooring. The kids wound up playing down there (it was the area that made the room 25% larger) and we nicknamed it the playroom. We were so tired that we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. I usually prefer to dine off premises because hotel restaurants are typically not worth the money in places like San Diego where there are so many good restaurants. While it wasn't cheap, it was quite good. The creme brulee for dessert was perhaps the best we've eaten in years and was large for the price. The pool area was large and attractive. However, the water was 12 feet deep in parts. That makes me nervous with my kids swimming. Definitely one of those pools where we joined them a lot and watched them like hawks when we weren't in the pool with them. My only complaint with the hotel (which will be an odd complaint because this seems to be the one thing that other people consistently like) is the hotel's location on Mission Bay. Mission Bay really has at least two different parts to it. The part that the Hilton is on, is the least attractive of the two. It looks more like an estuary than a bay.

Very pleasant and the area felt very safe. The hotel locks all outside entrances except for the main gate at night. There is a starbucks coffee cart in the lobby which suited us perfectly in the morning, but the hours were sporadic. The restaurant was the typical pricey kind you find at this sort of hotel. 99% of the staff were very very pleasant to deal with. I was very concerned by the previous reviews and fortunately my experience was very different. We had two rooms and travelled with a 19 yr old.

When we did get the room the smell was soooooo bad and the carpet was wet..... They told us they had cleaned the carpet 2 weeks ago. It was so bad we had to move to another room. Our walk out lanai was not a walk out at all. We could go out but if you sat in the chair you could only see the ski and brick.

Well maintained landscaping connects the buildings and at its core is a main lobby with restaurant and pool. Parking is limited to one side of the hotel, and all the rooms seem to face towards the beach or landscaping on other side, so once you leave your car, you feel like you're really in a resort. Our room was not a suite and yet spacious with its private balcony and cathedral ceiling. The hotel is right on the beach of Mission Bay, so it's an easy walk from even the furthest room. On either side of the hotel are public parks, so you can walk on paved sidewalks for about a quarter mile in each direction, take the kids to a nearby playground, or enjoy a picnic on the grass. Some downsides are that the hotel is close to the interstate highway, so the sound of the traffic is omnipresent if you're outdoors. The beach, unfortunately, is on an inner bay, so no waves--just still water like being on a quiet lake. Great for kids, though, who won't be struggling with waves or an undertow at the ocean. During our stay, however, the water was contaminated and you weren't able to go in for a swim or ride a boat. The biggest disappointment was a $20 charge to park the car--not for valet, but for self-parking in an open parking lot--a ridiculous price considering the high cost of the hotel and a poor welcome to a resort. Hilton should reconsider this. The Hilton San Diego Resort advertises itself as a resort, but it's definitely a mixed bag. Any problems associated with its location on the water or by the freeway can't be easily be overcome by the hotel, but it should certainly warn its guests, especially if they can't take advantage of all its amenities or expect a romantic secluded spot on the ocean.

Having said that, it may be that the staff's attitude is a defensive response to the boorish behavior of some of the guests particularly at the check-in desk. I agree with previous comments that your experience at this property will be greatly enhanced by your room assignment and that seemed to be a problem with quite a few people during our stay. If you're paying Priceline prices it's not so bad, but if you're paying rack rates it can be a big disappointment. Ask to see a map of the resort when you're checking in and ask questions about the location of your room in relation to parking lots, freeway, etc. Once you get past the room issue the resort can be enjoyable.

The grounds are nice, well kept, expansive banquet facilities with weddings, 'proms' and business functions going on, a full building dedicated as a spa, great pool featuring 'banana cabana', resturant right on the bay, guest access direct to sandy beach where there's sailboat and jetski rental. Now for the bad - THE ROOMS. We were checked into a room on the bottom floor located as soon as you walked in the tower door, that faced the lobby, valet, and all the busy-ness of a hotel on Friday night. The screen door opened up directly to the driveway to valet, an inferior room that we wondered was maybe the result of being a 'discount purchaser'. You get what you pay for?! The bathroom was tiny and the tub still had hair and stains in it. So we asked for another room and were given a 2nd floor one in another building. When we went to check the 2nd room out, thinking it was on the first floor because our room number started with '1', the hallway on that floor was littered with room service plates, nats and bugs flying around them, and the smell of sweet-dampness (kind of how bad fruit smells). It was syrup... and fruit... and eggs, pancakes, jam - seen on the many plates outside almost every other room door, that were obviously sitting out from breakfast - at 3pm in the afternoon! Came to find out odd room numbers were on the top floor, made our way up the stairs (no elevator) to our 2nd room. Soon as we opened the door, there was the most terrible PEE and musty smell in this room. We wanted to give it a try anyway (and not be headaches to the front desk), opened windows and turned on the ceiling fan (a plus) but couldn't get rid of the smell. We thought maybe the carpet had been cleaned and not dried properly, but soon found out when we tried to put our kids drinks in the room fridge that it was old, moldy, brown and rusty inside, emanating that old, foul smell. No wonder the room was damp and stinky! We called front desk to complain ... again. And were given a room a few doors down from the second, that was better - new fridge, mildly damp smell (maybe the humidity in San D ). So overall a *decent* stay, but here's the thing - NOT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT OF A 4 STAR by any means.

So, on that note, for $99 a night, this hotel is stellar! For $200+ a night, I would have had a lot of complaints. First off, you really need to request where your room is. I understand that the Tower is not where you want to be and I can see why from my limited experience with the Tower. It is very tall, cold feeling, like an old apartment building. We were placed in a villa that was one story, side by side rooms (others are two-story). The majority of the rooms in our villa block had arcadia doors that opened in the back onto gorgeous green lawns with putting green, hot tub, etc. Our room was flipped so that the arcadia doors were in the front (next to the front door) and the patio (two lounge chairs) sat right on the parking lot. Needless to say, the patio wasn't used and I didn't feel safe opening the curtains for all of the parking lot to be able to look into our room. So beware. The room itself was very small, barely enough room for two double beds. The room had an old motel feel to it, low ceilings, although the beds and furniture was top-quality. Very tight quarters, I can't imagine spending a lot of time in the room. Would request a bigger room option next time (but for $99 who can complain?)

Parking was very tight and it was nearly impossible to park close by to our building each day. We soon realized people were parking on the street instead.

We have checked in to many 4 and 5 star hotels before and have never received service like this before. Aside from the lazy and unattentive bellhop, service didn't get any better. We requested a room overlooking the bay over the telephone before our trip, and the agent said they'd honor that.

In the restroom, it had granite countertops, good water pressure, but an ugly sight below the countertop. The front of the counter is actually a faux cabinet door, and is one big piece of wood. It was coming apart and was really ugly. Aside from that, the furniture was pretty basic.

I do agree with the other reviews that the Kids Club and the restaurant were very good. Mike the concierge was on his game but the others were much to be desired. Bottom line: if you don't expect too much from a hotel, have kids and don't pay more than $79 a night then this might be the hotel for you. There are others in the area that are better.", "Date": "June 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cHilton Diamond member --enjoyed the stay...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3539844", "Content": "Being a Diamond level Hilton Honors member, I certainly have expectations for staying at a \"resort\" hotel. My wife and two sons (16 & 20) vacationed over the Memorial Holiday week and we really enjoyed ourselves. POOL - Nice and warm, but could have been a little larger. HOT TUB - A little too small, as well. Also wound up needing renovation while we were there--so it was out of commission. FOOD - onsite restaurant food was good, but we enjoyed eating at other spots for lunch and dinner. However, we enjoyed the breakfasts. WATER SPORTS - you can rent bikes, sailboats, paddle craft and jet-ski's. The price of the jet-ski's at $90/hr was a turnoff to my son's. Too pricey. We wound up taking the ferry to Coronado Island, rented bikes there, and rode around the island for several hours---GREAT TIME!! ACCOMODATIONS - We were scheduled to stay in the Tower, but after reading a previous TripAdvisor review, I chose to ask for a \"garden villa\" on the ground floor when I checked in. The staff were very courteous and accomodated my request. This was REALLY nice--being able to step out of the room onto the well manicured grounds. I'm really glad I did this. The room smelled a bit \"musty\", but it wasn't unpleasant. The beds were REALLY comfortable and we all slept well the 5 nights we were there. OVERALL - I would rate this hotel a 7 out of 10, all things considered. If I was going to return to this area, however, I might be inclined to try another hotel--more for comparison reasons than anything else. My \"benchmark\" for Hilton \"resort\" hotels is Hawaii (Oahau, Big Island). Those are all 9-10 out of 10.", "Date": "June 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cCould not have been better!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3506553", "Content": "My family and my sisters family have a yearly trip planned to Mexico over Mother's Day Weekend every year. Unfortunately, this year we were unable to cross the border b/c we would be traveling with an eldery woman who is not well. So, at the last minute we needed to find reservations North of the border and settled at the Hilton San Diego Mission Bay. What a fantastic discovery! They treated us like family. We are a party of 15 and they met our every need. From our request of a table that we could put outside, (for the elderly Mom's to play cards at, or a table all together on their restaurant patio for breakfast, this place hit the mark. I am in Sales at another San Diego Hotel and I got to tell ya, I was WAY impressed. I came back with lots of great ideas for our staff.

Now when I come home from college, which is in cold New England, the Hilton San Diego Resort is where I want to go. It is perfect for families on vacation, friends on a weekend road trip, or couples looking for a romantic getaway. The rooms range from traditional hotel style to cabana mini-homes. All rooms are well equipped and within walking distance of the hotel's private beach. The restaurant is absolutely phenomenal. I highly recommend the breakfast buffet as well as the dinner buffet. The restaurant provides the best seat in the house to watch the fireworks set off at Sea World (which is right across the bay) during summer. The hotel provides endless amentities: tennis courts, water sports, bike and skate rentals, pools, an amazing spa, and a great stretch of beach. The great thing about the Resort is that you don't need to even the grounds of the hotel to have fun! My boyfriend and I spent an entire just exploring the grounds and soaking in the sun. Very relaxing! The Resort is a bit pricey, but the staff will completely take care of you. We've never had a problem with them, not even when we brought our dog with us (yep, they takes pets too!!). I've stayed in plenty of hotels in San Diego on vacations and weekend getaways, but the Hilton San Diego Resort is by far the best!!", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton San Diego Resort & Spa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d119721-Reviews-Hilton_San_Diego_Resort_Spa-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$151 - $405*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1775 East Mission Bay Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515491", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1a/d7/09/resort-pool-in-the-evening.jpg"}}
