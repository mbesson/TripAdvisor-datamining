What a treat! In the afernoons, there are snacks provided (chips, salsa, cheese and crackers, etc). Shutle is provided complimentary within a 2-mile radius. I rented a car and didn't have to use the shuttle. Service was great, staff was friendly. Recommended good restaurants close by (Kona Grill had delicious sushi and grilled salmon). Only few miles to J W Marriott where I had my conference. Gym is clean and has TV for each treadmill. Bring your headset to plug into the equipment otherwise you will not hear anything. There is a TV where you can use the remote and hear without a headphone, but if you want your exclusive show, use the equipment TV. There is also a mini store for snacks, medicine, and drinks.

My experience was second to none. We arrived very late and check in was fast and courteous, despite the fact that it was after 1:00 am. I'm sure the person working behind the desk was tired, but you would never know that by the way we were treated. My room was excellent. It was a large studio suite with a king bed. The kitchen was updated with stainless appliances and new-looking cabinets. Everything you could need was available in the kitchen. There was a desk, a chair and a pull out couch - plenty of room to relax and get some work done if necessary. Free in-room internet (wired) was convenient and worked well. The television was on a swivel so you could see it from anywhere in the room, including the bed. The large king bed had a firm mattress - not the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on, but still good. The room was spotless - could not have been cleaner. The bathroom was not too large, but the double sink is located outside of the bathroom which gave some extra room. This hotel offers free breakfast from 6 - 9 am. While I wish it was offered until 10, a little more convenient if you are on vacation and want to sleep in a bit, the breakfast itself was fantastic. There was a wide variety of foods - most of the breakfast staples (eggs, sausage, waffles, pancakes, cereals, bagels, etc.) and they had a special each morning as well (quiche, casserole, etc.) Best hotel breakfast I've eaten. Janet is the woman who runs the kitchen and she does a fabulous job. She's personable and goes out of her way to make sure that guests' needs are met. Even when she was working on Thanksgiving day, she was happy to be there - making sure we all had what we needed, that people knew when the food was going to be cleaned up and even made sure that the Thanksgiving Day parade was on the television. On weekday evenings, there is a social hour with a complementary buffet. We did not take advantage of this, but what was available the one night we were there looked and smelled good. I didn't use the pool or fitness rooms, but they were very nice and well maintained. The fitness room included several machines including treadmills and ellipticals. The outdoor area was comfortable with two firepits that were perfect for the cool night air. There was plenty of seating outside as well. The hotel looks far more upscale than the rates.

Downside was no Comedy Central so I missed John Stewart and Stephen Colbert. * Complimentary wired internet access - ethernet cable provided; easy to access. * Excellent fitness center . . . though I opted instead to go jogging on the trails that go through the parkland to the south of the adjacent Mayo Clinic (takes about 5 minutes of running to reach the trailhead). * Nice pool and large outdoor patio area, putting green is a nice touch. * Friendly staff. Small concerns: * Other than the Mayo Clinic, the property is in a desolate \"no-man's land\"; if you do not have a rental car, be aware that there are no shops, grocery stores, or restaurants within walking distance . . . nothing but desert scrub within a 1-mile radius. * I tend to think that placing a full size refrigerator-freezer in rooms at Residence Inns is a waste of energy and environmentally unsound. I suppose there are some long-term guests who fill them up as they would a refrigerator at home, but I would think a compact unit of some type would be sufficient to meet the needs of 99.5% of guests. * Elevators were somewhat awkwardly located . . . not in or adjacent to the lobby . . . you need to take three right turns from the front desk, walking past first floor guest rooms to get to the elevators. Not a big problem, just kind of strange. * It was very expensive . . . but that seems to be the norm for hotels in Phoenix in March. * AC was rather noisy.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sahuarita, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cOne of the nicest hotels I've stayed in!\u201d", "Author": "tlinde755", "ReviewID": "UR96920040", "Content": "I was very impressed with the Residence Inn.

I had two beds, a dining table with two chairs, a full kitchen, a desk, a chair, and a couch bed. The main lobby was also huge and had countless little seating areas. There were also seating areas outside. There was an outdoor pool, a small putting green, and a great exercise room Each morning, they had a full breakfast and two evenings they had a dinner (hamburgers or baked potato bar), all included in the price of the room.

Everything looked brand new, and the rooms were very spacious and comfortable. There was a full-size fridge, kitchen utensils, and dishes in the room which was very convenient. The complimentary breakfast buffet was very nice as well, and a staff member even helped me use the waffle-maker. Didn't get to use the pool, but the area outside looked nice too. Overall, great home-y feeling..
