Who the hell did we think we were, etc? When we asked to see the manager, saying we wanted to complain, he now started swearing, saying the manager could f*** off. Totally unbelievable. Had it not been late, we would have left. Instead we spent the rest of our stay timing our coming in and out to avoid him. I have never met anyone working in a hotel that crazy and appalling. We loved the Lido generally, so it was just a shame we ended up there. The staff in the day time were fine, however, so it wasn't all bad.

We asked reception (when we could find them...very rarely ever at the front desk) about it and they showed no concern or willingness to come to the room and check it out and they never offered to move us when they clearly had plenty of rooms open. The room had cracks in the walls, wallpaper peeling off, and the bathroom sliding glass doors were off their hinges and one slide away from being completely broken. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. The room was a dump!!!! The porch was the nicest place of the hotel. Great air flow and comfy chairs to eat and drink. it was 3 blocks from the beach. Not as crowded as Venice which was nice. It is a 50 minute boat ride and 5 minute bus ride to get to downtown Venice. Please, do not stay at this hotel. It is not worth the money. The service is horrendous. It ruined our experience. We will never recommend this hotel to anyone and would hope that you do not give them business because it was not worth the money we spent in comparison to our other budget hotels.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "EJtotone", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!

We were pleasently surprised. The hotel was great! We arrived on Lido and we didn't know where we were going, it was late at night and so we just asked a taxi driver how much to the hotel and it was 13 euro. We got in the taxi and the hotel was a 5 minute drive if that. It was literally just down the main road from the water bus station on Lido. From then on we walked from our hotel to that water bus. It was in a great location as it was opposite a gorgeous restaurant which we had a meal and a few drinks at. The hotel was clean. We had 4 single beds in our room and it was a huge room. The beds were excellent, it must have been the best nights sleep I've had in years! I have stopped in lot of hotels 5 star plus and really this hotel is great and we will be back as we loved everything about our venice trip and hotel villa parco! The main thing too was that the hotel was so quiet and I love that about hotels. I hate doors slamming and noise of a night! I sound old but I'm a 29 year old that just loves travelling and having a great time! Oh our television didnt work but we was never in longer than 1 hour getting ready to go back out again and there isnt any WIFI but then again we didn't question it as overall the whole of the 2 night break was fantastic!

There is also a bus (free if you've got a Vaporetto ticket other than a single) service which runs very frequently and takes 2 minutes (3rd stop having left the Vaporetto stop). The staff were very nice and helpful and the hotel was attractive from the outside and in the lobby. The room, however, was shabby (faded carpet, peeling walls) and a little on the small side, but with a big bathroom. The shower was a bit rubbish and the room staff seemed undecided on how many towels we should have each day! We only had one thin pillow each and my friend's was extremely lumpy. When we asked to change it, the staff were unsure if there were any more because the hotel was full but did eventually find her one. The website advertises an internet cable in every room and I didn't see any obvious sign of this. I had asked before going if there was free wifi and was told there was, however we could not access this in our room as the router was down in the basement and only reached as far as the 1st floor (we just sat in the lobby instead). There was breakfast available downstairs in the basement, but we only knew this by chance as there was no information about it in the rooms and we weren't told about it by staff. We went to a local 'bar' about 5 minutes away instead (Bar Bepi - very nice croissants!). All in all, you get what you pay for.

I booked my room for four people 1 week in advance. A few friends, who wanted to stay at the same hotel as us, booked 2 rooms a few days after us. When 2 of the 4 people arrived at the (beautiful looking) hotel to claim our room, we were informed that, despite our reservations, they had no room for us. Instead, they had a room at a \"comparable\" hotel which was closer to the dock. They explained it as if they were doing us a favour, by booking a hotel closer to the boat transport. So, after trekking via bus and by foot TO the hotel, we had to trek all the way back, to their \"sister\" hotel: Hotel Reiter. Unfortunately for us, Hotel Reiter was in no way, shape or form comparable to the type of facilities which we were paying for at Villa Parco. It was a 2-star hotel, and they expected the same payment as a 3-star. Not only that, but they tried to charge our 2 would-be roommates for our room that we had apparently \"refused\". Bottom line: they lied to both us and the rest of our party, they pulled a bait-and-switch, they demanded payment for subpar facilities at a different hotel, and they failed to contact us before hand about any changes to our reservation. Furthermore, our friends who were staying at the hotel who reserved rooms AFTER us ended up receiving a room. PS: There are also 6-in long crickets.
