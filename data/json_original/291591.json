The best thing about this Hotel is the location which is relatively quiet whilst very central, being on a small road just south of Gran Via and just north of Plaza del Sol. Large parts of the surrounding area is pedistrianised and there are many shops, cafes and other historic sights such as Plaza Mayor all within an easy walk. Also 2 subway stations closeby (clean, cool and quick) with connections to Prada Museum etc. There is also a full size train staion UNDER Plaza del Sol, allowing you to travel right out of the city without using the Metro. The Hotel itself is modern and clean and just about lives up to its 3 stars. Our room was very small for a twin/double and the beds were hard. The shower room was 'one at a time' size, but well fitted and clean. Staff were all friendly and the buffet breaffast was as good as you get in Spain. At the right price this is an excellent hotel. We paid the prebooked rate of only 56 Euros incl breakfast and you can't argue with that for the centre of a capital city - but I noted the rack rate in reception was 167 euros per night, which is way over what this standard of accomodation is worth. Essentailly it is a 'Premier Inn' in a great location in the city centre.

Staff: The staff was excellent, extremely helpful, and friendly. They gave a great alternate suggestion for seeing a flamenco show at a place called Las Tablas, rather than send us to a typical overpriced tourist tour for a flamenco show. It was a great show and we thanked them for it. Food: A wide variety of breakfast foods ( we had included breakfast), toast, pastries, fruit, juice, coffee,tea, cheeses, sliced meats, cereal, yogurt, many choices for most people. Price: THe hotel was reasonably priced for the season. Not over priced and you got what you paid for. Room: Clean, 2 single beds, mirrored closet and safe. The bathroom was very clean and basic toiletries were provided. Towel service is there to change towels every day if you like, or you can save water and re-use them. Same idea pertains to the bed linens. Rubbish was emptied out every day and anything that you needed for the room was provided. Over all I would rate this hotel a 9/10. Coming from the \"western\" world, i feel that for the amount we paid we got a grea deal.

Our bath/shower was fine, with great water pressure, except for the half-way glass barrier that is typical of some European tubs, and holds no water in while you shower. However, our other parties in our group had a shower stand in which no person even slightly overweight would easily fit \u2013 much in the manner of a tight cruise ship shower stall. The wood panels at the floor of this stall expanded and shrunk with water and temperature changes, causing strange noises. I hate to think what could be growing under that wood. Breakfast was good, many choices, with the exception of coffee, which was dismal as per usual for Spanish 2 to 3 star hotels --utilizing a machine to dispense something approaching very weak brown water. Our room looked into a courtyard which was actually a series of private apartments, with clothes lines running across the courtyard. The residents would speak from window to window and you would hear the conversations at random times.

This is one of my bugbears, being frequent travelers, we encounter this a lot. How hard is it to offer a double bed? Location Located on Calle de la Abada, just of the Gran Via, the location is almost faultless. You are steps away from the action but not so near to the main strip to get a sleepless night due to the noise and constant car beeping. Also, the Madrid Metro system is a doddle to use, much easier than London, with the Callao and Gran Via Metro stops minutes away.

Guests The hotel was mainly full of Spanish clientele, which was never a problem. Food The main reason for steering clear of this hotel has to be the buffet breakfast. The choice is fairly uninspiring with meat, meat and more meat. If this isn't your thing you have to make do with half decent croissants, stale cakes and some sorry looking tinned fruit. The cleanliness of the cups, plates and dining area left a lot to be desired and instead of a hearty breakfast we had to pick our food carefully.

We did not take the Metro but understand that that is a convenient option. We did walk and took a few cab rides. We eventually realized that the II Castillas is a good value for the price: clean, quiet, good AC, and boasting excellent security. The security is definitely needed because there is a major \"street of prostitution\" one small block away! The hotel is locked at night and you have to be buzzed in to enter. One small complaint is that the lobby lights are dimmed to semi-darkness at night. I don't know if this is an energy saver or a feeble attempt to create atmosphere. Occassionally it took a long time for hot water to come to the sink. We had a full enclosure around our shower so the typical water-in-the-floor was not an issue.

We were about 2-3 \"blocks\" away from Puerta del Sol (there's a metro stop there), shopping, and tons of awesome tapas bars. The hotel itself is on a little side street with minimal traffic, so we never heard any street noise AT ALL...which is rare in a hotel in Madrid. The room we had was HUGE! Again, a big surprise. We booked a double room, and were given a corner room with (a) a view, (b) a king-size bed, and (c) an enormous bathroom with plenty of toiletry samples. We stayed there for an additional night after returning from five days in Sevilla, and we asked to be given a corner room again since we loved the first one so much. The gave it to us, and that one even had a bathtub! I didn't even know 3-star hotels in Europe had rooms with bathtubs in the bathrooms. The breakfast they serve downstairs is awesome...pastrys, cold cuts, chorizo, breads, fruit, cereals, and fresh cheeses. Loved it! CONS: Really, there weren't many at all. The bed was on the hard side, but I think most hotel beds in the 2- to 3-star range in Europe are like that. The staff was friendly enough, but not what I could call overly warm and gracious...very formal. I read in other reviews that the hotel can be hard to find. We took a taxi to the hotel several times (always with a Google map of it just in case), and our drivers never had a problem with it.

The floor towels really need to be used to avoid slipping on the tiled floor. I couldn't help feeling the old fashioned shower curtain would have done a much better job!
