The downtown location plus heated rooftop pool make this hotel a very attractive option. Parking is right below the building. Good restaurants like Norah Gray (without the kids) are close by, and you can easily walk to Old Montreal, McGill, or the main shopping areas. Desperate to feed the kids in a hurry ? Don't worry there is a Tim Hortons and a McDonalds right across the street. What makes this hotel memorable for me are the high quality staff and the interesting setting - the hotel is built on top of a 1970s skyscraper.

The location is perfect if you take the train in, as we did, as it is just across the street from Central Station. It is quicker to go across the street at ground level although underground access is also available, but more circuitous. The desk staff was very helpful, even walking us over to the elevator between the half-floors ( reception is on a level halfway between the 2 floors of the hotel) as one of us has mobility issues. As a place built in the 1960's (?), it is not as handicapped-friendly as we would want these days - the pool is definitely not very accessible as you have to go up many steps to get to the entrance. The locker rooms are large and airy, but have small (an inch or two) level changes which can trip you up if you are not looking; the attendants are very helpful and fully bilingual - we speak both official languages but it is comforting to know that the staff switch between them depending on how they interpret your accent. The pool itself is small but nice and warm on a cold April day - if you float on your back, your body will be warm but your tootsies will be cool. The room itself was large and well furnished - the listing did not specify that it had a mini-fridge but there was one - a great place to store your doggie bag from Dunn's - a few blocks away and a must when you visit Montreal. Everything else was there - clock radio, Internet access, coffee maker (although the coffee provided was only so-so; it was also in a bag, like tea, so don't bring your own coffee as there is no filter cone), iron and board, etc. The 'Serenity Bath collection to pamper yourself after a long day' is a tad overstated as it consists of the usual - no bubble bath or bath gel, only a bar; run of the mill shampoo and conditioner; hand cream; shower cap (does anyone actually use these); and bar of face soap. The ice bucket was good as it was double walled and stayed cold long enough to cool down the gel ice packs my husband uses every day for his back pain - a freezer in the fridge would have been better, but mini-fridges are not usually big enough for this. The safe in the room was a nice surprise and we used it whenever we left the room. The alarm clock hadn't been adjusted for daylight saving time and there were no instructions on it to adjust the time - both my husband and myself tried to wing it and failed - good thing our cell phones have alarms. It plays from your MP3 but doesn't charge it so bring your own charger. We had a garden view which was fabulous; it was too early for the plants to be blooming but the pond and waterfall were pretty - we saw some finches at the bird feeder and a gull eating a fish from the pond - sad but natural. The heating/cooling is adjustable in the room. but it was noisy when it kicked in - not so good when you are trying to sleep. All in all I would stay here again, but I would bring more of my own toiletries.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "JoeinTO", "ReviewID": "UR127784607", "Content": "I was pleasantly surprised by the Hilton Hotel Bonaventure.

There were two minor things that bothered me during my stay at this Hilton. When the hotel was busy you often had to wait in line to get down via the elevator to the ground floor. The service at the bar and restaurant at the hotel during lunch was exceedingly slow, even after we had told the waitstaff that we had a meeting to get to.

This meant we paid full price for the first night and got the second night for half (the sweet winter deal). After checking everything on line, for the extra $ we upgraded to the executive level package-well worth it. First off-we find the Hilton staff the best of any hotel chains we have experienced and this time was no different. From the moment we arrived until the final \"have a safe trip\" from the doorman it was a totally great experience. We travelled by Via rail and arrived before noon on Friday and left on Sunday at 4 pm. We checked via phone and the Hilton would store our luggage on arrival & departure (Hilton is right across the street from the train station) but it was suggested we check if our room was ready on arrival (12 pm). It was, so we could check in, use the facilities, etc. Also we requested a late checkout on Sunday and that happened as well without extra charge-maybe/probably because of the upgrade to executive. We feel the $50+/night more than compensated. Executive upgrade included a really great \"continental\" breakfast which included at least 3 hot dishes (over 2 days we had scrambled eggs, homefries, french toast, pancakes, sausages) as well as top of the line breads, bagels and pastries, fruit, cereals, excellent cheeses and cold cuts and an awesome selection of juices, milk, coffee, tea, expresso, cappucino, etc. (We paid $24 each for a sunday breakfast at the Marriott in Niagara Falls in February and this was actually a better option because of the specialty coffee available.) Also on offer with the executive upgrade was the all day beverages options-including juice, soft drinks, hot beverages and the specialty coffees and teas + 5-7 h'or doevres -beer and wine available but extra and a dessert selection from 7 to 9. We ate a great lunch on Friday and didn't go out for dinner...cheese, crackers, a couple of hot selections (quiche, puff pastry, polenta with proscuitto) a different pasta each night, a couple of vegetable options (gazpacho with raw vegetables, greek feta salad-tapas style, etc.) All staff were very friendly and everyone spoke french/english and other languages! We look forward to going back! The roof top swimming pool is so awesome! There were lots of families (we are a middle aged couple) but there were lots of extended families from parents with tots and teens and lots of families with grandparents. The rooftop is beautiful and I can imagine in summer it is a topnotch place (there is a sweet deal in the summer but we will have to see if Hilton Bonadventure is a part of that (first 2 nights full price, 3rd night half price). And even dogs-not in the pool, in the hotel. We loved our stay and the winter swimming and executive lounge topped off the experience, suggestions by the concierge for dinner were spot on also (see later review...) Staff were awesome-can't remember them all but 3 at front desk, Guy in BonAdventure Executive Room and Louis at Concierge were memorable.

If it was possible I would give this hotel a rating of 3.5, because it is better than average, but I wouldn't go as far to say it was great - but good enough. Overall it severed it's purpose as place to sleep at night, and the staff were all accomdating. The things I disliked about the place were: 1) The elevators up to the lobby were usually crowded (there are only two, and usually there were atleast a dozen people at any givin time waiting to go up or down, plus luggage and bags etc.; 2) The King size bed was not as comfortable as I had hoped for, and the room seemed a little dark; 3) Everytime the tank on the back of the toilet would refill after we flushed, it would make a loud noise and the whole toilet would shake back and fourth hitting the wall behind it. The first time it happened, we were afraid it might actually break free it was shaking so hard. They are small things that didn't ruin our stay, but prevented me from giving the hotel a higher rating. The good: 1) We arrived at the hotel at 11:45 a.m., despite check-in not starting until later in the afternoon, they were able to accomidate us, and let us check in early. Being tired from a very early morning flight, I really appreciated that. 2) In the evening we wanted to go for a casual, but nice dinner. We didn't want to go to any chain restaurants, or spend a fortune on swanky fine dining, but we didn't know where to go. We asked the concierge, Chantal, who recommended a place, gave us directions and the address. We had such a wonderful meal, we were talking about it all weekend. 3) The location is very convienient, as it's connected to the main metro line (orange line), just accross from the train station, the 747 express bus from the airport stops 1 block north, and it is walking distance to St. Catherine St, and Old Montreal. 4) We had a late departure flight, and were grateful that we could store our bags at the hotel after checking out, instead of lugging them all over the city all day. I did notice there were a number of steps going up and down throughout the hallways, so if you have mobility issues, this hotel probably isn't the best choice. There was some confrences happening on the Friday when we arrived, because it seemed busy and there were lots of groups of people walking around with name tags on, but we still felt well taken care of.

As you enter the ground floor, you are directed to an elevator and whisked to the top floor where you check-in. You might think this would make for fabulous views of the city, but it does not -- the top floor of the building is \"landscaped\" to look as if you are on a ground floor; thus, the disorientation.

The only thing is if you plan to walk underground beyond 730, you should expect the shops are closed and the traffic is rather not too busy, but its connected to the Eatons centre which is closed around 830 I believe. The only down side is on our 2nd nts, we encountered with this college/ university grp and they were very loud right through 2 a.m. in the morning. It was a bit irritating and we made complains to the hotel couple times. It was pretty bad that other guests from the other rooms walked out to talk to the teenagers. Other than that, our stay was really decent and for the price we paid, we definitely would want to go back again.

Our biggest challenge was up front: finding the hotel while driving in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al. The hotel, including reception, is located on the top two floors of the Bonaventure building (at the time of construction the largest office building in the world), and the signs to the driveway were of rather modest size. But once there, things improved quickly. Parking was plentiful, if paid (as can be expected in a city hotel) as the Bonaventure has a large underground parking garage. Take the elevator to the ground floor, a second elevator to reception, and a short walk later we were checking in. Friendly service in both French and English, and quickly we had our room (executive room on the \"second\" floor, facing the gardens). Oh yes, the gardens: while the Bonaventure has brutalist architecture with lots of exposed concrete, the top floors have extensive gardens with trees, greenery and even koi ponds. And a large outdoor pool ... The rooms were large and clean, with nary a noise to be heard from next door (one advantage of concrete, to be sure). A few details in the bathrooms belied the age of the hotel, but renovations over the years have kept the rooms at a top-notch level. And the cleaning service kept the rooms impeccable. With the executive floor you also get access to the executive lounge (Bonaventure Club), which offers a highly impressive continental breakfast, including Montr\u00c3\u00a9al bagels and other breads and pastries; cold cuts and cheeses; some warm items varying by the day; a good-quality espresso machine; and all the other usual suspects for continental breakfast. Hors d'oeuvres from 5 PM to 7 PM were generous and had lots of variety, too: we saw a number of people clearly using them as a dinner substitute. The hotel location was within a 15-minute walk of the old city, of shopping on St-Catherine Street, and of Place-des-Arts and other venues for the Montr\u00c3\u00a9al Jazz Festival.

We noted others had expressed concern with traveling through the wings of the hotel with the gentle steps separating levels. We noted this to give an intimate continuous feel.

Housekeeping was very nice and I liked the chocolates when they turned down my bed. Must give a shout out to Guy in the Bonaventure Club where I had breakfast every morning. He was so helpful and friendly and really is a credit to his profession. Facilities: This hotel is oddly laid out. The hotel itself is atop an office building so you must take an elevator up to the lobby area.

And to top it off, for that extra $40 there was no free in-room Wi-Fi. Their free access is either via phone line (so you are screwed if you only have an Ipod touch), or some sort of TV internet that I couldn't be botherd trying to figure out as I didn't have time. Other than that, the Pool and Garden did look quite nice, but didn't have a chance to enjoy. Would I go back? Probably, but not at the rates they charged, especially if it's more than one night.

Although I didn't use it, the pool seemed kind of interesting. Heated in winter, it's on the top floor of the building. I had breakfast at the restaurant one day, and it was good, if pricey. The gym was fine--and clean. Then the less good: the main thing was the building. I wouldn't stay here if I had mobility problems. There are stairs to get from the street level to the elevator which one needs to take to reach the lobby. The stairs are difficult enough for an able-bodied person, particularly with luggage. There was a needless flight of stairs, down and up to the exact same level, on the way from the reception to the room. The other problem with the building is that we were awakened on two of the nights of our stay by clanging pipes. We did speak with the concierge about it, and he offered to look into it, but frankly I'm not sure what someone is going to do in a full hotel about banging pipes in our room. It seems like an endemic problem with the heating or plumbing system not something that maintenance can fix in a few minutes during our stay. Maybe, but we turned him down on the offer because by the time we mentioned it, it was evening again and we just wanted to go to bed. I don't think it should have happened in the first place, and I doubt we were the first with the issue. The other less than fantastic thing was the details of the room. There was no hair dryer, just the conical top for one. There were no sewing, shoe polishing or other types of amenities: just soap, shampoo, and conditioner. There was a coffee maker in the room, but once we used the one herbal tea, it wasn't replaced for three days (at which point I asked for another). The coffee goes into paper cups instead of glass ones. The hotel claims to be \"green,\" but I think--not so much (particularly with the outdoor heated pool in winter). There was free cable internet, but it was slow. To get a faster speed one had to pay. Why not just provide proper internet service? I expect the location is fine for business events--the prices at the restaurants suggest they get business travellers on expense accounts--but I wouldn't recommend it for a holiday. There aren't many nice restaurants or other nice Montreal things in the immediate vicinity.

We had booked through HHonors and a prior phone cal'l assured a larger room at no additional cost (double queen versus double double with free wifi). When we went to check in the room wasn't ready, I noticed on the website that the executive lounge was closed and I usually ask for an upgrade even if I have to pay a little extra since the continental breakfasts are typically all we need and eating breakfast at the hotel is usually very expensive. Anyway, I asked for free wifi instead of the upgrade to executive level and they said, 'what the heck its the holidays' - Off to a good start. They said that the room would be ready in 20-30 minutes (it was 2:40PM - check in is at 3PM - never had trouble checking in early before, but they said I had the last double queen left). It was 3:15 when I was informed the room was not yet ready and the desk staff offered us free drink vouchers for the bar - ALL RIGHTY THEN - they gave us two worth two drinks. Nice gesture for making us wait. 20 minutes or so passed and the room and the room was finally ready when the staff asked if we wanted our bags brought up (they having been with the bell staff already) - I said, 'I am surprised they aren't already there with the wait and all', the staff noticed my displeasure and asked if we enjoyed the drinks at the bar, I said we did, but it was a little embarassing with my family and all waiting in the lobby all this time; they then offered us free breakfast vouchers. I was a bit embarrassed, saying that it was not necessary, but also knowing this was like $100 worth of breakfast. She insisted and I took the vouchers. The room was worth the wait, it was huge and big enough for 4 adults which is rare at any hotel unless you upgrade to a suite, which we have done on many occassions. The hotel is awesome, the architecture is very period, it is in a great location and offers many ammenities. It is directly connected to the RESO (underground and subways) and the staff is very nice and very accommodating. They treated us very well. The sleep quality is incredibly good. The room was the quietest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. We had neighbors on both sides and across the hall and never heard them once. We used the outdoor heated pool in the middle of winter, which was cool (pun intended). The bar and resturant were very good, and the service was very, very good, especially the bell staff and greeters/valet, they really set the tone. I am looking forward to staying here in better climes as the gardens and grounds look as if they are very nice. TIP: use the valet parking if you want to charge parking to the room as the parking is independent of the hotel and you can only charge parking to your room if you use valet as oppossed to self parking ($2 or $3 extra) - Another tip: if travelling to Canada and Boxing Day is on a weekend, the banks are closed on Monday and Tuesday following and you have to use ATMs or exchange kiosks to exchange money.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Brunswick, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PaulEBNJ", "ReviewID": "UR92816157", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location and has fascinating architecture.

First the good: The beds are extraordinarily comfortable! I did not want to get out of them. The rooms are nicely decorated and modern, as is the foyer & hotel lobby. We truly enjoyed the rooftop pool, which was a warm comfortable temperature, after a long day of sightseeing. I liked having the elevator take us up and away from the activity down below into the quiet lobby of the hotel. The metro is conveniently located below the building (but a long long walk). Now the problems: signage was the first. We had difficulty finding the hotel, even with the address & map, because the sign is on the side of the building. The driveway is easy to miss because there are no signs. Frustrating when you are driving in from out of town during rush hour. When we checked in, we were told we had our choice of the following rooms: a room with 2 double beds, or a room with a queen bed. Upon further inquiry about the queen, we discovered it was actually a queen pull-out sofa located in a suite, where the hotel had already rented the bedroom portion of the suite to someone else!! (I will note here that we did book the room at a very low rate on priceline.com...but that is no excuse for offering a pull-out sofa and calling it a bed!) We chose the double beds, and were very satisfied. Another problem: our room had a grassy weedy area outside the window with junk laying around, mostly what appeared to be unused electrical fixtures. Very ugly and made the view look like something out of a cheap motel (I am posting a picture.) In addition, there was a hallway door that opened out onto the junky area, which allowed anyone who opened it to stand right outside our window, even though we were on the 12th floor! I was actually standing next to the window wearing next to nothing when the door opened, and I quickly drew the curtains, leaving our room in darkness. Since our visit coincided with the jazz festival, a major event in Montreal, we asked the concierge about getting tickets to a particular concert. He looked at the event calendar, then said the event was invitation only so we couldn't go. Not very helpful. Later as we walked around the city, we entered the Hyatt and asked their concierge about the same concert. Even though we said we were not guests at the Hyatt, the concierge was very friendly, made a few calls, drew us a map and showed us exactly where to go. All we had to do was go to the venue of the concert and buy tickets. The Hilton concierge should have been able to figure that out. (The Hyatt concierge also recommended a fabulous restaurant (Restaurant Julien....great food, great service!)). And finally, although the hotel lobby and rooms were elegant and comfortable, the hallways had carpeting that looked 30 years old, was fraying and threadbare in places. Even with these problems, we would stay here again if we got a good rate. I would not pay more than $200/night for this hotel.", "Date": "July 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southfield, MI (north of Detroit)", "Title": "\u201cAlmost perfect, practically in the clouds, serene and peaceful\u201d", "Author": "WeLikeTravel", "ReviewID": "UR35056784", "Content": "Hotel is the top two stories of a block-sized downtown office building with a private elevator, with a convention space directly beneath. Lobby's in the middle, rooms are split-level around the perimeter with four courtyards. Two patio bar/restaurants between the rooms and lobby form two courtyards, a spectacular outdoor pool in the third courtyard, and a serene rooftop garden in the fourth. Gardens are plentiful, this is truly a unique space of peace in a busy city. Enter 900 Rue De la Gaucheti\u00c3\u00a8re Ouest, Montreal, QC, Canada in Google Earth and you'll see the driveway entrance, pool and gardens for yourself. Garage is underground. Waterfalls and fountains are everywhere (even in the pool, which is open year-round with a small indoor entry). Pool was very comfortably warm and did not smell of chlorine, surrounded by lilies, flowers and mature trees. Study any fire exit graphic and you'll quickly get the layout. Yes, you must go up or down a 1/2 flight of very shallow stairs to get to any room, so baby strollers could be a challenge. If you go anywhere in Montreal, you'll climb many stairs and do a lot of walking. Let the porter handle your luggage. Prices in Montreal are high for everything a tourist would want. There are cheap places the locals go to eat, but don't bother unless you're on a tight budget. Or go to Beijing in Chinatown for a very good, affordable meal. Get restaurant recommendations from Chantal at the Concierge desk - she never steered us wrong. Gibby's in Old Montreal, Vertige, nearly everything we ate was really fabulous, with presentation and service (and prices) beyond compare. But avoid Cora's (6-block walk) for breakfast unless you want a dull, comparatively inexpensive but impressive looking meal. I found that the $10/day fee for in-room wired or wireless Internet access generated more than quite a few very casually-dressed folks in the lobby area (which has unlimited free wi-fi). I tried every trick I know to get a free signal in my room; no luck. This may be de rigeur for Montreal, but it looks ridiculous to business travellers (who made a few comments about it in the lobby). Every hotel in any town has free in-room wi-fi, but not this one. I hope they fix this issue. Staff was very courteous and professional, very stylishly dressed, bilingual. Room was completely quiet unless you get a crying baby in the adjoining room. Self-parking was $17/day but no in & out. If you want to use your car, it's $25/day for valet parking to come and go as you like. This is not uncommon for downtown hotels. Bed was very comfortable, with a comforter between two sheets -- very nice. Bring your own pillow if you can -- these are pretty tall. Room was nice, roomy, clean, well-appointed. Nice closet, dresser, TV, electric outlets, bathroom. Every room has a view of a courtyard or the skyline. Mini-bar means there's no refrigerator for you to use. Roomy desk/work area with a nice office chair. Minor maintenance issues, but that seems to be pretty normal for hotels -- you need to tell someone if you want stuff fixed. Fitness center with the usual machines is huge and unused, additional room with yoga mats & pilates, lockers, more. About 6 block walk to Chinatown, 9 blocks to Old Montreal. Metro subway station in the basement, so you could get anywhere in town without a car (subway trains coordinate with bus routes). Train station across the street for out of town travel. Two blocks from freeway exit, but a GPS will come in VERY handy if you wish to drive in this town. Lots of one-way streets, and all the signs are in French. The only printed English we saw was in the hotel and most (not all) of the menus. Local drivers are pretty aggressive for tailgating, yet incredibly courteous for turns. Gridlock is common. Cabs are good for local transportation. You can rent a bike for $5/day from an automated BIXI kiosk nearby (they're all over town) but you might struggle to find an empty slot if you return it late at night or bike with a group. Very nice hotel -- I'd stay here again, but it's pricey ($150/night for conventions, $225 for ordinary folks, plus tax, tips, parking, wi-fi, etc.).

Built for Expo 67, the architecture and design has the bones of a mid-century modern Wallpaper magazine gem. Unfortunately, those bones have been much modified, in various attempts at updating and modernization, so the feel of the interior spaces are rather charmless and haphazard and often \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel generic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My room was a basic king; spacious, clean, very comfortable bed, good LG flat screen, nice working area, reading area, good lighting and roomy closet. No complaints on the layout. The bathroom however was 1967 small, no, 1957 small, the shower a let-down, a half decent hand-held with so-so pressure, but in a little tub with absolutely nowhere to put sundries. However, a well-placed and well-lit shaving mirror was a pleasant thought, given how hard it is to shave in hotel rooms with dim lighting and distant mirrors or desk-level make-up mirrors\u00e2\u20ac\u201din other words, the norm. The hotel sits quite far east, on the border of old Montreal and a few blocks from busy St Catherine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, so a good spot for tourists, but a bit of a slog if you want to get out of the touristy areas and hang in the more interesting urban neighbourhoods. Staff at all levels were exceptionally pleasant; housekeeping was efficient and always said hello, desk staff helpful, door staff prompt and the concierge desk was always quick, courteous and offered us very nice dining suggestions. The hotel restaurant has a wonderful open deck bordering a pond with a small waterfall and khoi; very appealing on a sunny morning (but no culinary destination; given the diversity and volume of epicurean delights in Montreal, eating here is like penance). I really liked the quiet, relaxing interior open spaces, by the pool and at the restaurant, the interior views of the plants and ponds. But I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the irritating green blinking light of the smoke alarm, the fact that the blackout blinds were half an inch too short and thus the room was flooded with light at the crack of dawn, the efficient but very noisy AC, the small bathroom, the coarse toilet paper and the fact that you get invoiced for phone calls even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice mail or a five-ring no answer left call! At this level of service it would have been pleasant to wake up to a newspaper at the door, but no such luck. Although I had a great stay and slept well, given the Hilton online price point\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich hovers much higher than many other central hotels\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI would be inclined to try another venue next time round.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great staff, enjoyable stay.\u201d", "Author": "LondonSpeccie", "ReviewID": "UR31167341", "Content": "The location of the hotel was extremely convenient - especially if using the Gare Centrale.

Had I paid 300+ for this hotel as some have, the minor irritations we encountered would have been likely magnified in my view. Location: This hotel is in downtown Montreal and easily connected to the underground city. The actual rooms are on the highest floors of an ugly office building and so you first enter a small foyer area with an elevator that then takes you to the actual hotel lobby on the top floor. I did not like walking around this area of Montreal at night. Very dead and almost ominous. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider this an ideal location for Montreal, but certainly convenient enough. Lobby and public areas: The hotel layout is quite atypical, with something approaching a courtyard garden w/pool around which many rooms are situated. The plants and foliage in the garden were delightful and it was pleasant to walk about in the public areas of the hotel with a view of this garden. The lobby general seating areas were also decorated nicely and pleasant to be in. I found the variety of artwork in the public areas quite interesting. My only complaint was that the hallway carpets in pretty much any part of the hotel were dismayingly filthy, to the point of distraction. Perhaps these were not renovated yet. But in addition to all the permanent staining and wear, no end of food, trays, towels, and messes would show up in the hallways constantly. The staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to care at all about attending to hallways. Rooms and bathrooms: The room we stayed in was clean, newly renovated with very nice furnishings but an odd shape. We did have a nice flat screen TV but the oddly-shaped long corner courtyard room given to us resulted in the TV being at quite a distance from the bed (none of the tripadvisor photos posted by other travelers reflect the odd L-shaped room we had). In general all the furniture placement was very strange in this room, with the bed in an \"alcove\" and the desk, dresser and TV awkwardly fitted closer to the other portion of the L-shape. The room had all standard modern amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable, with very nice comforters. Bathrooms were extremely nice - with high quality material used for renovations. Our room was facing the edge of the garden but all light was blocked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c partly because the plants covered most of the window area and also because the part of the window not covered would have resulted in the folks at the pool area having full view of us in the room. Altogether I wish we had been given a different room location (preferably NOT facing the courtyard) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they were sold out by the time we checked in. In fact, we had requested two beds, and I was irritated when we were given a room with a single queen. We had to live with a rollaway they provided.

The lifeguard during the afternoons was a little \"crabby\" to say the least, running out of the sign in area (yes, you have to sign in and out when entering the pool area) whenever a child even raised his/her voice, reminding us every few minutes to keep the kids on one side of the rope, etc. He was sort of standing at the edge of the pool and staring at one father whose young child was screaming a bit, until the poor guy got out of the pool with his other kids and left. It was a little weird. You do get towels when you sign in, so at least there is no need to bring them from the room. Housekeeping is very nice, and responds quickly if you need extra towels. However, on the last night there was some kind of party going on, and they never brought coffee for the coffee maker, which I had requested. I was told this was not housekeeping, and the minibar lady would bring it, but she never came. The underground city and the Metro are right under the hotel, it can be a little confusing, but we figured it out. Also, be warned that many people outside the hotel speak limited, if any, English. One of the reasons we went to Montreal was because my daughter is in an international school and wanted to practice her French. I speak a little, but mostly I had to depend on her to translate. It was pathetic. The buffet breakfast is overpriced, $20 for adults, $10 for children. The 2 kids hardly ate anything, cheerios, toast, definitely not $10 worth. You can get Pizza Hut delivered to your room through room service (limited menu), and there are the underground food places, Subway, etc. Also, you HAVE to pay for parking, and cannot leave your car in front to unload luggage and check in. If you need a luggage cart, the bell staff have to take your luggage. My husband had a large tote bag with his binoculars on top (we had stopped at Niagara falls on the way to Montreal) which he gave to the bellman, and after we got home we realized that we no longer had the binoculars. Incidentally, he forgot to tip the bellman at the door of the hotel before he went to park the car. I tipped the man who brought the luggage to the room, but it was a different person. I didn't know my husband had put his binoculars on top of the tote bag, so I didn't realize anything was missing. We don't know for sure, maybe they fell out somewhere, but I think the moral is (as I told my husband), Don't forget to tip at the Hilton Bonaventure! Overall, it was an OK hotel, but I don't think I would stay there again.

La Source toiletries are fabulous! The negative: Front Desk. We booked the reservation about 3 weeks in advance and upon arrival, were surprised to learn that the hotel had switched our 2 bed room to a King bed room. Their response seesawed between \"sorry, we ran out of those rooms\" and \"well you booked it as a king.\" Nevermind the fact that we had called to confirm this 3 times the week before - so be VERY careful. Luckily, I was holding the printed piece of paper that confirmed what I said, so they had to give us a room with 2 beds, even after calling me a liar.

After reading many hotel reviews on this site, we were unable to secure two beds (apparently not an easy feat in high season on a whim!) at a few hotels higher on our list, so called the Hilton Bonaventure directly. We have had overall good experiences at Hilton previously, and we were not disappointed. Initially we booked two nights, and then added on a third. Due to a delayed flight we arrived into the hotel close to 1:00 AM, asked for a quiet room and were assigned 3402. It was indeed quiet, had terrific beds, and was nicely appointed. Shortly after 2:00 AM an alarm sounded, an announcement was made declaring a report was being investigated. This was repeated for about three minutes before we were given an all clear message. It may just have been something like a person smoking in a non-smoking room; we never heard. This was a first in our hotel experiences but decided we would rather be alarmed than not, and what better way to inform the masses. There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this property. Every single staff member with whom we interacted, whether by phone or in person, was courteous, friendly, helpful and efficient. It turns out that our room was part of a two-story suite that was booked on our third night, so we were asked to move next door to 3404. It was effortless. Another quiet, lovely room with terrific beds! We did not use the gym or the pool, but the outdoor heated pool looked fabulous and we would definitely try that next time. We ordered room service breakfast on our last morning and while it can be an expensive venture, the food and service were good and we were willing to pay for the convenience. Directly across the street is the underground shopping mall/train station where absolutely everything you could ever possibly need or want is located. Many food outlets are there as well as a pharmacy, shoe shine station, shops galore, you name it. In fact, most everything is quite close to the hotel. The consierge desk was always staffed with courteous and knowledgeable individuals who were quite helpful in suggesting how best to see Montreal in just a few days. Plenty of brochures available there as well. The first day we chose the 3-hour Gray Line city tour to acclimiate us to the area. We had a terrific driver, John, and thoroughly enjoyed this experience. He recommended the sound and light show at Notre Dame Basillica, which we viewed the next night. Definitely an interesting experience. He also spoke of Gibby's, a wonderful restaurant in Old Montreal with quite a bit of history. We splurged on that fine dining experience and were not disappointed. Reservations are recommended, dress is casual, service is excellent and food is terrific. One can order anything from vegetarian to fish, chicken and meat and prices range from about $35-40 on up, depending. This includes salad, bread and two sides. Another reviewer mentioned Eggspectations restaurant for breakfast which we tried. Good food, and plenty of it, good service and good prices too. Breakfast is served all day and lunch too until 3:00 PM. A reviewer mentioned the elevator situation at the Hilton. This was NOT a problem. We were advised that the lobby is actually on the 15th floor, and all rooms are just steps away from the lobby, making an elevator unnessary. We would agree. From the street there are approximately ten steps to the elevator, and there is one button only to push (lobby). We found this to be far more expedient than standing around waiting for elevators to hit every floor before reaching us. Our room was reachable in about two minutes taking 30 shallow steps and walking down two corridors. Definitely not a problem unless one is impaired or is carrying too much luggage for comfort. While the lobby and corridors appear a tad shabby, there is a huge sign in the lobby announcing that millions are being spent in complete renovations, including all bedrooms, to be finished in spring 2008. Both of our rooms appeared to have new decor. The locals complained of the heat and humidity which is not normal for them. We did find it hot, but we are used to hot in Texas. It is a terrific city with lots to see and do, good food and lots of shopping too. Our Hilton experience was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in Montreal.

My husband was out there on a business trip and I went along for a vacation of my own (expensed out of our own pockets of course). However, I found the staff extremely friendly and the hotel was very clean. I even chatted with the maids, the doormen, etc... Everyone was so helpful. The service and the smiles I had received from the staff had made our stay that much more pleasurable. We had even found the Bartender's in the Lounge had a great sense of humour and were very friendly to talk to. I would recommend staying there to anyone who travels to Montreal and would love a touch of elegance added to their stay. Another thing I had found is that it is so close to everything. I loved the fact that the Underground shopping was just across the street and that walking to Old Montreal was only 20 minutes away. However I would also recommend you wear very COMFORTABLE SHOES for walking. I just love Montreal. The prices on clothing and shoes is Fantastic too!!! Now that I am home again in Vancouver, B.C., I find myself daydreaming of the day that I will be able to return to Montreal and stay again in the Hilton Bonaventure. Thank you to all the staff for making my trip to Montreal a very memorable one.

Getting into the hotel driveway is quite tricky. We drove around the block a couple of times before we figured it out. It's a very sharp turn right at the corner.

Since I came back from my meeting late at night, I didn't discover the problem till late. After calling I was told that no one was available till the morning. The decor of the hotel is very worn and hotel breadspreads were something I figured they have had to have used for at least 5 years now. I complained to the staff politely the next morning but found that they didn't care to rectify the situation. I dont recommend this hotel to anyone and definitely not waste your money in this questionable establishment.", "Date": "January 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNot great, but not bad\u201d", "Author": "llfmpt", "ReviewID": "UR4299958", "Content": "We stayed overnight for a night away from the kids while visiting in-laws.

The front desk staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations for shopping and dining. Common areas were nice and clean--nicer than the rooms.

It is so 60's/70's in style. The concrete structure is laid bare for all to see inside the hotel and gives it a distinctly strange feeling. I could not deal with this nor the fact that the first 20 odd floors were office space. We stayed here in October 2004 on priceline - the price was good but I did not think the hotel merited 4 stars! Some of the staff were down right rude - this is the first hotel in all my years of travelling where I was refused (by a very aggresive french speaking waitress) a glass of milk to take to my room when retiring for the evening after having a couple of drinks in the bar. It was nothing to do with the fact that our french was poor - she was just rude. The room was grubby and tired and most distressing of all, for a female traveller, the door safety chain could eaily be undone from the outside. This meant a room change after some initial disbelief of the problem and then an attitude of well what's the problem anyway! I value my safety, even if is just a slip chain! The food was poor and in the main restaurant the waiting staff couldn't be bothered. All n all a most unenjoyable stay here.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Hampton, NH", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding\u201d", "Author": "CaptDoug", "ReviewID": "UR3791740", "Content": "Albeit a little difficult to find, but the location is perfect!

Room service - after the posted 23.30 closing - was not an issue for the attentive staff. The hotel feels like a ground floor locale until you peer out your window. The pool and sun-deck offer plenty of play area for teenagers.
