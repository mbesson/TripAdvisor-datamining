We reached our apartment the plus's a great size very spacious lots of room (i'm trying to be positive - I know its the same point 3 ways) the kitchen living area was actually ok - great to have fridge & kettle etc however the area was very tired - we had curtains that didn't reach across the whole window which meant we could see in the offices across the road and they could see into our room - also the sofa and carpet were quite grubby - i didn't feel that i could relax properly in the space. the bathroom was nothing like the one featured on the website - well to be fair it was a similar shape. The tiles I think dated back to 1970 (i remember having similar ones in a home we moved to in 1978) the shower did not fit to the wall - had to phone to get it fixed, generally the space was tired, having a shower was not an enjoyable experience. the bedrooms were a good size with lots of hanging space - but no duvet's and whilst bedding was very clean , again the carpet looked and felt a bit grubby and general decor all felt very tired and place generally could do with a deep steam clean. no full length mirror and no plug point near a mirror The location of the plaza was hard to beat due to its close proximity to the tube and our favourite shops as well as being a stones through from the tourist bus and green park - we were simply disappointed with what we feel is misleading advertising on the website - we booked the plaza specifically because it looked modern and clean. (we normally stay at places like the City Inn Westminster) but for this trip needed to be near Green Park and liked the idea of an apartment. At one point the lock on our door broke and we couldn't leave the room! not ideal having to wait to get out and could have been a disaster in event of a fire to be fair though this and the shower issue were attended to quickly by friendly staff its a shame they are let down by very tired accommodation - this place would be a real haven with a few small improvements and upgrades. on balance if you got the rooms for less than \u00c2\u00a390 then it's probably worth staying there, we simply feel that for the money we paid that we were 'had'.

It's not a five star hotel but it definitely isn't a hostel. We can higly recommend Curzon Plaza for everybody who travel to London for leisure.

There was a fridge, toaster, microwave, kettle and a small sink. There was no room in the kitchenette so I had to stand in the doorway to wash up and put the kettle on. Having said that, it was all we needed for one night. Another minus point is that we had no hot water for my husband to shave in so he had to boil up the kettle. The shower was an electric one although it felt like a trickle of water rather than a proper shower. Bed was nice and comfy and was ziplocked twin mattresses. Plenty of storage space in the bedroom for clothes. There were wooden blinds in the bedroom which unfortunately did not close properly so let some light in.

There were problems, but none that weren't tolerable for a few days. Some of the previous reviews mentioned the hotel being dirty. I found that it was older - carpets are well worn, fixtures and windows are old and show signs of wear - but not dirty. There weren't any strange smells, corners were free of dust or dirt, sheets and blankets had fuzz balls, but were clean. The carpeting in the hallways could stand to be replaced, but does look well tended. The location is amazing. A very quick walk from the Green Park tube, it's convenient to several lines, and you can get almost anywhere in London on less than one transfer. Within walking distance you have the stores on Bond Street, Oxford Circus and plenty of attractions. In addition to the Tesco, there's a Marks & Spencer's food store across from the Green Park tube that has lots of good things you can pick up to take advantage of the kitchen. I had a studio, which was carpeted and spacious. The bathroom was obviously older, the drain was ridiculously slow in the shower, and there were cracks in the tiling at the edge of the shower. Despite the age, it was clean and aside from the slow drain I had no issue showering there (no mold, residue or general bathroom nastiness). The bed was sufficiently comfortable and there was enough space to spread out my laptop and documents. I will agree with those who noted that the hotel hallway and rooms are very hot. I actually prefer a very warm room, so this was a plus for me. As other reviews have noted, the windows are a bit old, so I suspect this is to negate any drafts that may come from having uninsulated windows. One of the big reasons I chose this hotel was for the free wi-fi. Unfortunately it was pretty bad for most of the trip. I never got a strong signal, and it kept fading in and out when there was a signal. Finally, the keys used at the property are very old fashioned. \"For security\" they ask you to leave your key at the front desk when you leave. For convenience, they really should invest in an electronic key system. A bit of an annoyance to do this every time you want to pop out. Now even though the accommodations aren't top of the line, the people at the desk were. I mentioned the wifi being weak, but when I brought it up they offered to restart the router pretty frequently. When I asked for directions to a store, they were quick to print a map and give directions from the hotel. The welcome was a bit long for my tastes, but for someone visiting London for the first time, probably helpful. All in all, a generally pleasant and helpful staff. At some of the rates mentioned, I can understand why there might be some disappointment. I paid a little over $120/night, and for the size of the room, location of the hotel and kitchenette think it was a good deal. I was expecting a 3 star location, and it delivered on that. If the property wants to charge luxury prices (they definitely have the location), they should probably do a floor by floor renovation - electronic keycards, new carpets, replace windows, include more modern bathroom fixtures and tiles, new bed linens. But for a clean place to stay in an excellent location at a reasonable price, I would stay here again", "Date": "February 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Curzon Plaza\u201d", "Author": "GeordieR", "ReviewID": "UR23580071", "Content": "I stayed at the Curzon Plaza last year from September - November on business, spending between 3 and 4 nights there each week. Before staying there, I spent another two months staying at hotels in and around the central London area. I think I know what I am talking about! First thing's first. The Curzon Plaza is not a hotel. It is an aparthotel, which means from my experience that your room comes with at the most basic a ktchenette if not a fully equipped kitchen. Throw in a real, good-sized bathroom, and you are looking at considerably more livng space than any London hotel room. Believe me there is only so much hotel and restaurant food anyone can eat, and with a small Tesco on the corner, it's great to actually be able to prepare even the simplest meal in your \"own\" kitchen. Also on features - when it comes to plentiful hot water and powerful showers - in my experience the Curzon Plaza cannot be beaten. However, a word of warning - the bathrooms are a wonderful collection of teh original 'seventies suites from plain white, to orange, to avocado. Devotees of Elle Decoration should love them! And they are spotlessly clean! The bathrooms that is, not the readers... Lets look at the cost. We're talking Mayfair here - an easy stroll (yes minutes, not hours) from Berkeley Square, Bond Street, Regent Street etc. I challenge anyone to find a room rate as good as those at the Curzon Plaza in central in Mayfair! The place is spotless, with the best hotel beds in London. They are big, new, firm and clean. The linen and towels are equally so. Room service here is to be commended, they run a very tight and clean ship. And on the decor front - this admittedly is a tad eccentric. This is an art deco apartment block which is looking tired, but has some wondeful deco features. And the neutral Magnolia and laminate flooring throughout every room will not be to everyone's taste. But it is fresh and clean, and inoffensive. And it certainly is not worn frock or faded wallpaper! Finally, the front of house desk were always fantastic. Warm, friendly and incredibly efficient. A real asset to the Curzon Plaza and themselves. In short, give Curzon Plaza a go. Facilities, cleanliness, location and rate.

When we arrived and checked in (we had prepaid for the room), the reception area looked comfortable and was nicely decorated for Christmas. We were pleased that the location was only 10 minutes walk from the party venue. We got in the lift to the 4th Floor. Our room was opposite the lift door (which was to be a problem later on in the evening with the comings and goings of other guests). First impressions were not good but we put on a smiley face and thought \"it's only 1 night\". The lounge was basic, the kitchen about 5ft x 3ft and the cooker didn't work. The bathroom was very old fashioned but the shower curtain was clean as were the towels. However, when we began to get ready to go out there was no hot water . It took 10 minutes to get luke warm and we then shared it just in case we couldn't get any more! The bed was comfortable (and modern) and the sheets were clean but it was obvious that the rooms had been decorated as a rush job as there were paint splashes over the plug sockets and light fittings.

The Curzon Plaza is wonderfully situated in the heart of Mayfair, with excellent restaurants/pubs a very short walk away, a Tesco Metro and Cafe Nero on the next corner and loads of tourist attractions within easy walking distance. The rooms are big, spacious and well appointed and the staff very friendly. BUT . . . . The Curzon seems to be situated right on the corner of the main cut through from Piccadilly to Park Lane and the rooms are not double glazed. Therefore any kind of sleep at night is well nigh impossible thanks to the constant rumble of traffic (and we were quite a way up on the fourth floor). Of course the hotel can't really do much about that, but my wife was distraught to find a cockroach in the bathroom in the middle of the night!!! (As indeed was the individual who had to dispose of it. ) ME! No sooner had she recovered from that shock than she found an appalling looking brown stain right in the middle of the bath towel. Fortunately, on closer inspection, this turned out to be nothing more sinister than a burn mark, but it was still disconcerting. The kitchen of the apartment also smelled of stale cigarette smoke, which is presumably where the offending mark originated. The exterior of the building looked a little shabby with some of the windows cracked, which filled my wife with a sense of foreboding before we even entered the building. Sadly that sensation proved accurate. At \u00c2\u00a3269 for a night the Curzon appears to offer reasonable value for a family of four, but we were hoping for a little more for our money. If you don't have a visa card you have to pay \u00c2\u00a350 on your debit card as an up front deposit, but this is refunded when you check out so isn't really a problem.
