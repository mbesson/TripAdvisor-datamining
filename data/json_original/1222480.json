Due to total confusion, we ended up at this sister hotel as they had no rooms at the comfort which is another story. We were given the twin room, number 2 on the third floor. It is without doubt the worst place I have ever stayed in or even seen. The carpets were dirty and full of mould as were the skirting boards. The beds had no head boards, with only one sheet and a bed spread which with it being December and with little or no heat, made for a very cold night! The television was missing a panel by the infa red light exposing bare wires, the table top fridge was on the floor and there was not one piece of furniture to put clothes in. I would go as far to say that the bathroom was a health hazard. The shower head was totally encrusted with mould and limescale and by the time we had both had a shower, the tray was overflowing, the door even fell off as I closed it! The sink had no plug and the entire room was full of mould. Perhaps the most disturbing fact though,is that being on the third floor, there was no fire escape except down the stair case, with an AFFF extinguisher only being available on the landing below.the instructions in case of fire were in a frame with broken glass and very sharp shards sticking out. I f I could, I would have given it a big fat 0. Please do not stay here. I intend to take the matter further.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOnly if you can't find anything else!\u201d", "Author": "bookmoth", "ReviewID": "UR116844518", "Content": "We were group of 4 and we booked 2 twin rooms. The booking was made few months before arrival and we requested, if possible, adjoining rooms or at least at the same floor. However we got 1 room in the basement and one room under the roof. Both rooms were noisy and in the room in the basement was the window broken. We couldn't open it but also it wasn't closed properly, there was 1-2 inch gap on one side so the room got quite cold during the night. It was impossible to regulate water in the shower - only bloody freezing or piping hot, nothing in the middle, but this was only problem of the room in the basement room 10A. Breakfast was simple, nothing special, edible. I certainly won't come back.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cI WAS STOLEN IN THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "Luli2011", "ReviewID": "UR115850548", "Content": "24 july 2011 When I came back at night, I have found out that an employee STOLE GOODS FROM MY LUGGAGE (goods value more than 300 dolars!!!!). Nobody took responsability and today I received a note that the hotel debited un amount of my credit card because they said I did not arrive. A NIGHTMARE !!! Please, take notice of that!!! First of all, I did reserve in the EURO HOTEL(31 Shepherds Bush Road) but when I did the check-in, the receptionist sent me ARBITRARILY to the BALKAN HOTEL (33 Shepherds Bush Road). They are both from the same owner, I knew it; but I decided to reserve in the Euro Hotel, as the reviews were a bitter more \"positives\". The Balkan Hotel has no reception, there is no control at all, and the lock doors are old. Although another room was stolen too, I am completely sure that the goods from my luggage were taken by an employee, and not a street thief, as they wanted me to believe. I saw the luggage carefully closed, for exemple. Both hotels are very insecure. Noone took responsability of the robbery. In addition to that, today I have received an email from booking.com that the hotel said that I did not arrive to the hotel. So, they debited un amount of money from my credit card!!!!! It is a nightmare! I cannot believe it!!!!!", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Armagh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cyou get what you pay for!\u201d", "Author": "bopeep70", "ReviewID": "UR83560208", "Content": "Stayed for 1 night with hubby, we were going to a concert in the Shepherds bush 02. So the location was perfect. It's not a hotel by any stretch of the imagination, it's a b&b. We were only staying for the night so we wanted somewhere to put our heads down. The room it self was very small which was fine, it was clean, however it's the first time I ever saw an en-suite in what used to be a wardrobe!!! The shower was very dirty, and musty. We had to ask for extra towels only 1 provided even though the room was booked for 2. Breakfast was dreadful, not good at all, breakfast is from 7.30am-9.00am wish I had've stayed in bed.
