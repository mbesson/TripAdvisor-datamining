The Argentina is the highest starred hotel in the building and is on the fourth floor, reached by an ancient and tiny lift, or lots of wide, marble stairs. The hotel itself consists of probably not more than ten rooms and a small breakfast room. It has a permanently staffed reception. Pros: Great location for the rail and bus terminals and within easy walking distance of Santa Maria Maggiore, the Coliseum and Forum. We even walked back from Villa Borghese one afternoon in about 20 minutes. We had a 3 bed room (me and 2 older children) which was spacious enough and quiet with a large, airy bathroom. Both had windows that opened onto a quiet interior courtyard and full Italian style shutters. Breakfast was fine but not spectacular. We stayed at other three star hotels and had much better breakfasts. Plenty of restaurants nearby (try the side roads in particular). Cons: The breakfast room, reception area was certainly air conditioned. I think the rooms were supposed to be as well via a rather strange central vent in the ceiling, but it only was effective if you were lying directly underneath it. Fortunately, Rome wasn't particularly hot when we were there and we just slept with the sheets on the bed. I imagine the room would have been stifling in really hot weather. The reception staff was a rather mixed bag in terms of professionalism and helpfulness. One individual encouraged my faltering Italian and had quite good knowledge about bus services etc. Another spent a lot of the time chain smoking in the corridor directly outside the entrance to the hotel, with the result that the reception area and breakfast room often reeked of smoke.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens Greece", "Title": "\u201cOld building, hotel on just a floor!!\u201d", "Author": "Rozmariee", "ReviewID": "UR82586506", "Content": "The only thing positive that I could think about this hotel is its location.

The hotel itself is on the 4th floor of an old but well maintained building which is within easy walking distance of Termini station. A very old lift which almost takes two persons and two cases will take you to the fourth floor. The express train from Fiumicino airport travels to and from Termini every 30 minutes which is very handy. Termini can also be used as a base to explore Rome city by Tour Bus. Breakfast is a typical continental one, nothing special, juice, coffee and the usual. Overall the hotel was adequate for our needs. As this was my first visit to Rome I would find it difficult to compare it for value. One thing to note is that there are a couple of other hotels in Rome with Argentina in the title so don't get confused like we did.
