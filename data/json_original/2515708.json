There are a variety of rooms to choose from. I tend to travel with my dog when I get away for pleasure and Ocean Beach Hotel has plenty of pet friendly rooms. Unfortunately, the nicer rooms with the ocean view are NOT pet friendly, but hey, you are staying at an ocean-front property so it's not that big of a deal. The rooms are pretty basic so again, if you're looking for a \"lap-of-luxury\" hotel, you might want to stay at a Four Seasons. The hotel is situated at the end of Newport Ave which is pretty much the main drag. Plenty of food and bars are walking distance from the hotel. If you're interested in Dog Beach, it's just a few blocks away. The staff are super friendly, helpful and make your stay very comfortable. The only reason I don't give this hotel an \"excellent\" rating is because the surroundings are very noisy. I love laying in bed with the patio door open, listening to the sound of the ocean but you really won't get that til about 3am after the bars have closed and the noisy bar-going people are passed out in bed (or on the beach). That is the price you pay for being in the heart of the ocean-beach action. Aside from that, this place is truly a gem and I can't wait to come back for another weekend away.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cAwesome location at an affordable price.\u201d", "Author": "SDJeff", "ReviewID": "UR128544883", "Content": "We live in San Diego, but every once in awhile we like to vacation at the OB Hotel as its right on the beach and is a great deal.

The room was really different than a standard hotel room but it was very cool. It had hardwood floors and instead of a balcony, it had two floor to ceiling double doors. They both had signs that said not to open the doors but if you wanted to hear the ocean, you had to open them. We opened them at our own risk and it was just fine. I would say the only downside to this hotel is the noise. It is right on the beach/main road into the little town and there are constantly pedestrians, bums, cars, tourists, etc. biking and walking along the beach/road. We didn't really mind the noise but then again we were there to party & relax so we weren't too picky. I would stay here again in an instant if I came back to Ocean Beach. In fact, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. As far as the surrounding community, it's mostly smoke shops, surf shops and bars. Go to the sushi place that is adjacent to the hotel.

We liked the lively atmosphere BUT I witnessed a shady drug deal and we saw a guy get arrested right outside of our room (separate incidents). It's an area where there are bikers and skaters and surfers (fun!) mixed with homeless junkies (not so fun). If you are a surfer you will love the waves here. The hotel itself was okay. We were traveling with our two dogs so our options for hotels were limited. The staff was very nice and the courtyard was pretty cute. However the room was super basic and bare and the towels are made of sandpaper. The pictures on their website make it seem like a much nicer place than it actually is. We got a room with a patio and it was $195 which, it was not a nice enough place to justify that rate. You can hear everything through the walls. It sounded like the people upstairs were moving furniture all night. And at about 6 am we discovered that we were in the airport flight path and I was woken by low-flying jets sounding like they might just land inside my room. So I really couldn't sleep past 6 in the morning. Another reason why we chose to stay in Ocean Beach was for the Dog Beach. The dog beach is actually a very very long walk from the hotel. But the dog beach (when we finally got there) was great and huge. There was a disturbing sign posted saying \"Warning! Run-off\" which we really didn't quite figure out what that meant. But no one else seemed disturbed by it (and I guess we are sheep so we just did what everyone else was doing and ignored it.) BUT the dogs had an excellent time!

I was a little sceptical at first about staying at the Ocean Beach Hotel thinking that it was going to be \"a dump\" like what some other reviews has said...but it was the opposite!!! It looks just like shown on the website but make sure you get the right room because the pictures on the site ofcourse are going to be the suite rooms with views...not your basic standard room. Oh and the pictures on google earth are terrible pictures of the garden...it doesn't look that dumpy, those must have been taken in the winter, garden looks just the way it looks on the website. Ocean Beach is a \"beach town\" not a luxurious resort so if you want luxury, go somewhere else. If you want a nice place to relax, that is romantic then this is the right place. It had a more antique european style look. The room we stayed in had a shower no bathtub...which is fine because I don't want to be bathing in sand after I just came from the beach. As appose to what couple negative reviews said below there are FUN bars with pool tables, GREAT food dives, and CUTE antique stores. There WERE hippies hanging out all over the place but isn't that what you expect from a beach town?? By no means though does that mean there were bums around because we looked and we never saw any. As a matter of fact there wasn't one car in the area that wasn't made before the year 2008 at the Motel or the beach parking lot. There were very few people staying at the hotel there and we were there over a weekend. The Rooms did not smell BAD, the garden area smelled a little \"musty\" because it's on the inside of the Motel and if your room faces the garden then chances are that your room will have a musty smell if the window was left cracked open by the staff that cleans the room. The floors were very clean and I have high standards...I stripped the bed to look for bed bugs ( there weren't any), I checked under the bed, in the drawers, the whole room was spotless...I was actually surprised that this motel was cleaner then large Hotels that I have stayed at in resorts. The one negative to the room was that where we went in, it was a little warm and the towels felt a little damp...even though we could tell they were clean by the way they were folded. As soon as we turned on the air conditioner, it was fine. The lady at the front desk told us it was very secure and that has someone on guard 24 hrs a day. You can't enter the Motel Garden without a key. As far as it being roudy at night, The town does get a little packed but we were able to eat dinner in 20 minutes and get back to the room without any problems. This Motel was Exactly what we wanted. The room was little and cute which was what I wanted. It's right across the street from the beach...but not \"across the street\" as in far...it's literally 84 ft away from the beach. It has a beachy and california look atmosphere. The service at the hotel was excellent! We asked for an extra blanket because it gets chilly at night and they brought it to us right away. oh and someone said that they don't have heaters?! The heating temp unit is right on the wall!!!!!...idiots. Oh and the Doggy beach is about a half mile away, the walk through the houses are pretty. If you bring dogs with you I recomend it, they will love it and there are many nice dogs around...just beware of the aggressive ones because we saw a few. We stayed in the pet friendly room that faces the garden so you can take them right out. O would recommend asking for the pet friendly patio rooms so that way they can take care of their business their and not in front of a couple trying to see the beautiful scenery!! There is a great view into the garden from our window and the view from the garden to the beach was beautiful! Watch ot for the noisy people upstairs who like to stomp---if you don't bring pet I recommend getting a top floor room. Oh and we couldn't really hear the ocean because the water fountain outside was loud...but you can hear it in the garden We are definately coming back for sure!!!

On arrival we were told that they didn't have us reserved until the next night. Also, without a confirmation, the rate was now $220, quite a bit more than promised. We had just driven over from Phoenix with our dogs and thought it would be hard to find a dog-friendly hotel last minute, so we checked in (bad mistake #2) without first looking at the room (bad mistake #3). (Also, we fortunately discovered that most hotel chains are dog friendly these days.). At the promised price of $150, we would have tolerated the disgusting room conditions to take advantage of the Ocean Beach charm. At $220, this was robbery pure and simple. The supposed recent 2 million dollar renovation didn't include this room. You might ask what was wrong? 1) Paint peeling off the walls in several places. 2) drawer handles missing from the furniture. I guess handles weren't really necessary since the drawers were cracked and didn't really close anyway. 3) I put on white ankle socks which were filthy in 10 seconds. I realize that it's hard to keep things clean at the beach, but that was just gross. 4) Baseboards cracked and didn't come together with the door jambs. I guess the dirt was keeping them apart. 5) The \"patio\" had a table and four chairs, one dead plant, empty planters, weeds, and a chunk of concrete missing from the wall. 6) Missing faceplates and exposed wires on electrical outlet.

From the noise levels to the musty bathroom, this place brings back fond memories of college.

My boyfriend and I checked in on a Friday in July, not expecting the Ritz based on reputation, but hopeful that the very-friendly, helpful staff was a positive indicator that the facility might just surprise us in a fun, carefree San Diego kind of way. Nope. We arrived at our third-floor room and our jaws hit the floor when the stink hit our nostrils: eau de must, mold and cigarettes (in a non-smoking room). The bathroom was a stall-sized cell containing a stand-up shower (wear your flip-flops), toilet, sink (upon which one could rest their chin while enjoying a session, if one felt so inclined), as well as the most sinister-looking dust bunny ever seen peering down from the ventilation fan (see photo, though it does not do justice). The carpet was scary (wear your flip-flops). The a/c was portable, and though we could technically see the ocean from our awkward screen-free window, we could also see the back of a crummy condo, ample bird pollution, broken furniture, and two thankfully retired commodes (see photo, this one does do justice). The real fun started at 3am when the frat boys arrived to their room next door, though it could have just as easily been our room, since the walls are simply a formality possibly formed by wall paper over, evidently, nothing. \"Who's up for beer pong?!\" Not us. Though we were up. For the next six hours. Until we checked out after deciding that our fun, carefree, blissful vacation would be better spent in a hotel with not as much \u201ccool,\u201d a little more quiet, and a lot less chance of catching staph. Bottom line, since you were likely wondering when I'd finally get to it: Great staff. Cute courtyard. Fantastic location. Hooray for free parking.

We actually enjoyed being AT the hotel too, thanks to the nice courtyard. We met friends and hung out in the courtyard under the sun more than once! Our room was on the corner at the beach, a fluke but probably the best room in the place. The hotel lets folks with dogs book rooms on the ground floor only, which is what I wanted anyway - that way the courtyard (sunny, teeming with blooming jasmine, comfy tables, fountains) and the ocean view were right there! The room was very nice- simple, but clean, comfortable, and with tiled floors to deal with the inevitable sand issue. We walked everywhere around OB for the four days we stayed- out the pier to relax, to music, beers, etc. I will definitely return to OB Hotel, and next time with my beach cruiser in tow! A note to dog owners, the beach across the road is not for dogs from 9-6, but Dog Beach is about five blocks away and HUGE. So there's plenty of places to exercise the pooches. My only complaints were about a) the patio- which was potentially cute but currently boring-it needed some plants or something, and even the little fountain wasn't working; b) the bathroom needed some more towel racks and hooks, and c) the staff was at times less than responsive. A small example: we had our own coffee grounds and filters (we were on a road trip!) and all we needed was hot water for great coffee. When i asked about hot water, all I got was the blankest of stares. Luckily, there are great coffee shope all around, but it still boggled my mind that there was NO access to hot water in the lobby, though there was coffee (bad coffee, but still) offered in the lobby!

We stayed at the Ocean Beach Hotel, which looks like it's been around for a long, long time, judging by some old pictures we saw (including pictures of the hotel before a street separated it from the beach). The front desk staff and cleaning staff were very professional, accommodating and friendly. We stayed on the second floor with a partial ocean view; rates for each of our days varied between $140-160. Our view also included colorful local characters (as one reviewer has noted), who hang out near the POW/MIA memorial across the street. The \"local color\" also attracted the S.D. police three times, who twice hauled away people. The third time appeared to be some kind of \"contact\" visit by cops to talk to the homeless, the skaters, other rough characters and the well-dressed people attracted to them (drug sales?). That said, we walked around day and night and never felt threatened -- no aggressive panhandling (and little panhandling in any case), no need to watch wallets etc., like we might have felt elsewhere. The vibe was good. Ocean Beach has done a good job of deflecting chain stores (although the fought-over Starbucks up the street from OB Hotel easily had the biggest crowds of the coffee shops we frequented). In fact, our find was that one should hit a local coffee shop. Besides the lines being shorter, folks are remarkably friendly and open, the coffee is excellent and the pastries are local and better. Hit the same place three days in a row and you'll be shooting the breeze like you've lived there a year. So while the anti-corporate mentality may be a bit militant, it makes for a pleasant main street to wander up and down. Now to the hotel. The room smelled musty and the carpet had that mildly-wet feeling from high-humidity climates. Our bathroom sink faucet swiveled left-and-right, though not by design. The toilet was constantly on the verge of stopping up (did the previous tenants through a baggie of dope down it?). There was a table on the patio, but the patio had some kind of half-worn off macadam covering that made it uneven (repairmen were working their way down patios sanding that stuff down, which was very noisy during the day). The room had two chairs on opposite sides; we used the bed for sitting and as a table. There was a fridge and microwave. The wall had been torn and repaired (badly). There was a new door to the bathroom, and while that was fine, the frame around it was unpainted. An attempt has been made to spruce up the courtyard -- box planters on the 2nd and 3rd floor railings, container plants below, strings of lighting overhead, and so on. Some of the lights were burnt out, and the fountain in the middle was bone dry. Indicative of good intentions that are not well-funded. A good cable TV selection and free wireless internet were bonuses. As others have noted, the rooms are very noisy. From newlyweds on one side (they'll learn, I guess) to a guitarist practicing his heavy metal riffs (presumably for a local show one evening), to drunken screeching in the courtyard, to the sound of Harleys being revved, to one fight on Newport Ave outside our room, to revelers at all hours (including nine a.m. one morning), to a pretty good ad hoc music jam session (think three of the talented players were sailors) at the POW/MIA memorial, to fire trucks, to a thumping bass from a nearby bar, to the occupants above us daring walk to the bathroom, to people yelling at their buddies across the street -- the joint is NOISY. We've lived in 24/7 congested areas of several large cities abroad and in the US and never had noise like this. So, if you want a quiet weekend by the beach, this ain't the place, by a long shot. We enjoyed the town and its free-wheeling environment, but hated the hotel -- save the staff. We figure for the annoying noise level and the run-down condition of the hotel, it's worth about half the price we paid per night.

I was a bit nervous after reading other postings telling of homeless sleeping in the doorways and the courtyard. I have to say there are a lot of homelss in the area, but none that I saw on hotel property. Still, there was an almost constant police \"presence\" just across the street by the beach. My room was partial ocean view on the third floor. Yes I could see the water, but one troubling thing is that the windows don't have any screens on them. I wanted to listen to the ocean as I went to sleep, but that would have meant leaving the windows wide open and they are big enough for someone to just slip right in. Needless to say, the windows stayed closed which was disppointing being so close to the ocean. Otherwise the room was neat & clean, and very basic. There was a decent sized refrigerator that looked almost new. My friend rented the \"occeanfront\" condo which is next door to the hotel. It's nice inside, but to get up the stairs we had to go past the beer swilling mob lingering outside the downstairs unit -- I'm not sure if they live there or if it's also a rental. They were friendly enough, but my friend was a bit unnerved by empty beer cans all over the entryway. The condo is a bit pricey, but the view of the beach is nice and we spent a lot of time just sitting there on the deck watching the surfers. Inside the condo was clean and neat. Ocean Beach is a busy little part of town with lots of shops and restaurants, and of course the beach. One thing we really liked was \"Shades\" restaurant, literally right next door to the hotel. Good food, good prices, and a nice view. it was packed on Sunday morning for breakfast! Bottom line: if you're looking for the Ritz, this ain't it. If you want clean and neat near the ocean without breaking the bank, give the OB Hotel a chance. I'd probably go back if I was in that area, but I wouldn't be heart broken if it was booked and I had to go elsewhere.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, ON", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time\u201d", "Author": "EGrattz", "ReviewID": "UR7670127", "Content": "I stayed at OB Hotel only for a night but had no problems.

There seems to be a crew of drunks adn addicts, but seem to stick to themselves. I just wouldn't be walking on the beach alone late at night. The hotel was clean and affordable. The room had a bit of a musty smell but that didn't bother me too much. I just needed a clean place to sleep. The only negative was how thin the walls were. I was up at 7:30am due to this because I could hear CLEARLY what my neighbours were saying. This is a great town to be in, I highly recommend experiencing this at least once in your life.

The staff was really friendly and helpful. I will say that in the two-three years since I had last been to OB, it seems to have gotten a bit raunchier.

The rooms do smell a little musty and like disinfectant but overall I was happy with ours. We had a balcony room but our friends did not and their room felt a little cramped without it.
