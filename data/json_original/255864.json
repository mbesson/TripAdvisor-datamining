{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Utter Hell!!! Students mostly live here and it is obvious that once you've signed your contract the staff couldn't give a f**k. When I first arrived I wasn't shown around and when I had finally found my room it was utterly filthy! I really mean disgusting! I just can't explain the dissapointment I felt. There were cockroaches on the wall, I remember writing my name in the dust and the toilet had not been flushed (I am not kidding). I just dumped my luggage and cried. The walls desperatly need painting. The carpets need to be changed. All the hallways are filthy and never vacuumed. The bin areas on each level are completley unacceptable. Here bags of rubblish becomed piled high 2meters! Flies! The stench wafts through the building. I will not use the kitchens. I simply can't go through that. After a year of being here a year, I now have a diagnosed skin condition because of where I live. Treatment costs a lot. I am someone who used to go bush hiking for a month at a time and still be healthy!Over the couse of the year my mail and others', has been mysteriously stollen periodically. The staff never bothered to contact us to tell us of the problem. It was not untill the police were called in that they were made to.Every 2 or 3 weeks I since the beginning of the year I have received threatening letters telling me I will be denied access to the building if I don't pay my rent. However, as my account is set up automatically the money was ALWAYS there! They never apologised for this treatment nor endevoured to stop the letters to this day! This is NOT how you treat a paying client.I am a Sydney University student and went to my student union. They have told me how dreadfully sydney students have been treated there. Please contact them if you are wanting advice on where to look for student accomodation. I want to warn all overseas students that you WILL be taken advantage of. Prices will be raised for you guys. Make sure you speak english well. That American and Asian students are particularly conned in because of overseas contractual aggreements.This is NOT a friendly or truthfull place. The staff are down right arrogant and rude simply because they already have your money. There are no social events apart from one pathetic BBQ a year. The gym that they had advertised was a brocken arm press and a bike with no seat. The pool is filthy.The owners, management and staff of this business display no sense of professional pride in their work and product.I have read the other reviews and want to clear up that the people who had an ok experience were not students but short-term visitors who were given rooms that are cleaned daily.I have been coping by getting a (private) professional cleaner in to completley clean my room after moving in and then did what ever it took not to be at home too long or to avoid staff. However, the noise in this building is so loud but luckily I could escape to my nearby library to study. During my exams they demanded that I move rooms because my room had been privately sold!!! So much for supporting the student who is also paying their wages.To anyone looking to move here I hope your experience is a better. I feel that by writing this review hopefully, someoe will listen.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR579550075", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "unhappystudent"}, {"Content": "Ok if you're a student, but be careful I stayed here for a semester as an international student, and I have a couple pieces of advice for others staying at the Unilodge long-term. This is going to be a fairly long/detailed review, so it may only be worth reading if you're in such a position.First of all (and I realize this is not the Unilodge's fault), do NOT walk alone at night, especially in Victoria Park (across the street in front of the University of Sydney). The park is gorgeous by day, but my friend and I were mugged at needlepoint there one night, and were later advised by campus security to only travel in groups after dark, even if it was shortly after sunset. Take a taxi door-to-door if you have the money; since I usually didn't, I became very familiar with Sydney's great bus system. If you're out so late that the buses aren't running, seriously, either crash with a friend or take advantage of the University's (free) campus security escort service. Just be extra polite to the drivers - they have to ferry a lot of drunk students around, and as nice and patient as they are, I'm sure that must get old fast.Secondly, if you open an account with an Australian bank, do NOT, under any circumstances, have your ATM card or other sensitive information sent to the Unilodge - just pick it up at the branch instead. I was just one of many students who had their ATM card and PIN number stolen, and I immediately lost all but $3 of the money in my account as a result (this was about two weeks after arriving). The Unilodge employees were less than helpful, even going so far as to suggest that perhaps my best friend/roommate (supposedly the only other person with access to our room's mailbox) had stolen it. After speaking to several employees, I was told that the only thing they could do was replace the lock on my mailbox, as there was no security camera in the mail room. I fail to see how this was supposed to solve the problem, since the thief clearly had easy access to all the students' secure mailboxes, and I was frankly appalled at the staff's overall blase attitude towards the theft of all but $3 of a foreign student's money - a situation that could have been disastrous if not for an emergency credit card and the good graces of Westpac, who let me continue to withdraw money on credit even before it was actually restored to my account.Unlike the Unilodge staff, the Westpac bank employees across the street were extremely sensitive and helpful; one man, who had been working there for a while, explained that they usually tell students to pick up their ATM cards and PINs at the branch, since apparently this problem has been going on at the Unilodge for quite some time.On to the room.Let me be clear on this, since we weren't aware until we walked into the apartment: if you're sharing with another student, you will have your own bed, but NOT your own room - it's freshman year all over again. It's very difficult to get privacy of any kind in a Unilodge apartment - in our room, even the saloon-style bathroom doors wouldn't close completely - so we got by by moving one of the beds down from the loft and rigging up walls with sheets and twine. It wasn't too terrible because I was living with my best friend, but I shudder to think what it would've been like with someone whose company I didn't enjoy.Some of the other students in our program had a balcony off of their room; we, however, had one window, which opened onto a roofed indoor courtyard. For this reason, our room had little to no natural light or fresh air, and even when the weather finally cooled down in the autumn, the room improved from pretty much unbearable to merely stuffy. Living without air conditioning in Sydney's warm season is a little rough in any case, but doing it in a room with no other kind of ventilation was brutal. Although some other students had full fridges, our room only had a mini-fridge, which was definitely not a sufficient size for two people with no meal plan. I'm still trying to understand why every student paid the same for one semester's accommodation when some rooms were much better equipped than others, but whatever.The walls were thin enough that we pretty much knew what was going on in all the adjacent rooms, and the indoor courtyard echoed and amplified the noise from every other room with a window facing it. It's not too bad if you've got headphones or earplugs, and I was grateful for the eye mask I'd brought - I couldn't close the windows to cut down on the noise, or the curtains to cut down on the other apartments' lights, as that would have also cut off the closest thing to fresh, moving air.The rooms don't have much for furniture; we quickly realized that although we each had a desk, there was no way to store schoolbooks or anything like that, aside from stacking them on the tables. Being cheap foreign students, we constructed shelves out of milk crates.There are common lounges/kitchens on each floor, but don't expect much. The cheap couches were without cushions about half the time (I don't know if other students were taking them, or what), and don't expect to be able to cook anything that can't be made on a stove top or in your room's microwave. The Unilodge is conveniently located for a University student, and it was nice to have a small pool  hot tub in the basement, but if you're given the choice, definitely opt to stay at one of the other student accommodations. The Sydney University Village was especially nice - everyone gets their own room, the apartments there are equipped with full kitchens, and there are plenty of windows to get you through the Sydney heat.Basically, the room was bearable for a semester-long stay, but it actually made me homesick for my own college's dorms. Not so bad if you're a student, but if I were past my college years, I would probably be wary of staying in a place that's mainly used for student housing.", "Date": "Jul 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR208684587", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bilby86"}, {"Content": "leslie from CO We were at the Unilodge for 2 days. Got there early in AM and were able to keep our suitcases in a locked room while we hopped on a nearby bus for Sydney Harbor. All staff were helpful. We were put on the 4th floor interior so less noise. We had a twin bed room. There was a microwave, small fridge, sink and even a tea set up and cookies. Bathroom was adequate. We felt this was a great room for the price--$102/night--I was rather nervous that it was so inexpensive as I had heard the rooms in Sydney could go for $300+. Lots of ethnic restaurants nearby. We walked to the Powerhouse Museum--a real gem. Had no experience with exercise room or any of the other problem places the student had written about.

I have read the comments below and have to say I agree entirely with those who have rated this place badly.I have actually stayed here for a year as a student in the apartments, and it is the most overpriced ($345AUD A WEEK FOR A TINY ROOM) and ghastly accommodation I've ever had the misfortune to stay in.I moved in in July last year, and when I got here (after a 28 hour journey) a contract was thrust under my nose, and I was told to sign by the next morning. I was given no tour/guidance as to where anything was (i.e. kitchen etc) and the staff were rude and arrogant. The contract I signed had an inflated price than that which I had been quoted, but left as an international student from Scotland, with no where else to go and with no family and friends in Sydney I decided to sign.I should have cut and run!Over the course of the last year the facilities, which were advertised when I moved in, have decreased and broken. For example, the mini-gym (which was mostly broken and minimal to start with) has been removed, the buisness centre (the only place to print in a so called student accommodation, where work must be done) has gone and the student lounges which are advertised as social have 2 old, smelly couches, a TV and a vending machine (which Unilodge will not take responsibility for) in each and are always empty.The place is awful, the rooms are tiny and the kitchens are constantly dirty. The only oven in the four floor building (with over 400 student bedrooms) looks as though it has never been cleaned - it is caked in layers of spilt food. It is also the worst oven Ive ever used - it burns the bottom of items and does not cook the middle!The expensive laundry facilities are often out of order.The social events which are advertised on the unilodge website do not happen at UniLodge Sydney. In the time I have been here there has been one organised BBQ.The loction is good for uni and there is a shopping centre for groceries near by - the only good points!The staff turn-over says alot about this hotel - they are unable to keep most staff for more than one month. Those who do stay rarely speak good English. There is only one staff member, to my knowledge, that is efficient at her job. If you do have the misfortune to stay here then hope you get her to check you in, otherwise you may find you do not get the price or room which you booked.The games room consists of one, broken table tennis table and the bar and grill is literaly a counter top with a sink - no cooking facilities for the grill and no bar at all!!!As far as I can find there is no complaints procedure, and the staff continue to be obnoxious and unhelpful. In some cases they are down right rude.All in all, don't stay here if you want a pleasant, friendly or value for money experince. I hope no-one has to endure the experience that I have.", "Date": "May 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR255498779", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "binza87"}, {"Content": "Noisey, definitely student accomodation Unilodge is in a great location, right next to Gleb so that was fantastic.

When I explained we did not plan on leaving a credit card as it was their internal problem, the manager became confrontational and said I had insulted the way the staff was dressed. I asked the staff member if anything I said offended her and she said no. Following this, the manager stormed of and refused to deal with us any longer.

I felt very uncomfortable in the room.Third, the receptionist staff were very rude and arrogant about our concerns staying at the hotel.As I said, my wife and I did not appreciate the service or facilitaties at this overpriced place.Mr BayBrisbane Australia", "Date": "Mar 4, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR408547006", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u9289\ufe3a\u5116\u9289\ue15c\u510d\u9288?#x201d;   showReview(19169943, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR467186873", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "5\u5a09\u5a3f\u4ed0\u9287\u4ff1\u4ed0\u9287\u71b4\u4eb4\u9286\u4f80\u5134\u705e?..   showReview(21803117, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR850910593", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Pratique et central   showReview(11666881, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR311113565", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u5b28\u4efe\u9288\u5a45\u7872\u9288\u52e9\u4eb1\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u9286?#x201d;   showReview(19158514, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR569847832", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Best...   showReview(19919667, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 15, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR201558770", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d255864-r22492319-Hotel_Unilodge_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "255864", "Price": "$131"}}
