The hotel is small in comparison to others in the City but understandable when you compare the compact nature of its environment. Staff were very friendly and helpful, hotel was clean. The only downside was the size of the bedroom which was compact and the decor fairly basic when you consider the price of the rooms per night, but I guess you are paying for location.

The Atlas is located on a peek-a-boo side street so most rooms offer quiet, a welcome quality when you are tired. The desk staff are knowledgeable about tourist needs and can help with tours, dinner and shopping advice.Two important tips: 1. Your taxi and other traffic cannot enter this side street, and need to drop you about 50 feet or so from the door. This is important information if you are locating this hotel by the street address. 2. If it is important to you to have 2 people sleep in one bed ( a double as opposed to a twin arrangement) mention this when you make your reservation.

They are simply unrealistic. Spent 4 nights here and worked really well. It also seems as though the hotel has been upgraded since many of the reviews, as the room and bathroom were modern, functional and reasonably stylish. Good powerful shower compared to many hotels, and the beds were comfortable. Rooms were clean, had a free safe and free wi-fi access with very good signal. Staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast is advertised as continental, but there was basic hot food. Enough to start you off for the day, but if you want special cereal, fruit juices, or breads, you'll have to buy your own, or this isn't for you. If you are coming to Barcelona to be guided around and sit on a tourist bus, then maybe not the best choice. Why sit in a hotel when there are so many bars and restaurants close by to the this hotel? So, if you are coming to visit Barcelona, get around easily and use the hotel as simply a base, this is fantastic. It's about half way down Las Ramblas, so 10-15mins walk from Catalunya Sq, for airport connections, or 10-15mins walk the other way for the port. You are just on the edge of the gothic quarter, so really easy to explore that way as well and many nicer bars / restaurants than on Las Ramplas. Metro Liceu is really close by on line L3. It is noisy around the hotel, but that's because of being in this area. And yes there are building works going on around, but that seems to be par for the course in these areas. Ask for an inside room to minimise the noise. So if you want the location, you have to accept the limitations, which other reviewers don't seem to have taken into account. If you stay here and like walking around, you don't need to buy a Barcelona Card and you only need to use the tourist bus if you are in Barcelona for a very short stay. A 10 ticket bus / metro pass or a day or 2 day unlimited pass if you want to walk less is perfectly adequate. Works out much more cost effective and is much more fun. For a good tapas restaurant, Taller de tapas www.tallerdetapas.com is quite close to the hotel.

I got there by car, and my Garmin gps wanted me to drive down the stairs from the Rambla to the hotel which you obviously can't do so I ended up parking in the underground parking at the Placa Catalunya at the end of the Rambla and bringing my luggage to the hotel from there. When I got there the WiFi wireless internet was down, and as it turned out it was down all the stay which was a major setback for me, as I partly chose the hotel for having WiFi. I got the room on 4.th floor (5th floor by American calculation) facing the street in front of the hotel, room 404. The photos are of that room. The location is amazing! Right next to the Rambla, just across from the Rambla is the Boqueria market and the Liceu subway station is right between on the Rambla. Tip: When shopping in the Boqueria, never buy from the stalls in the center walkway, you get considerably cheaper prices by going right or left a couple of aisles. I booked it without breakfast as I rarely get up in time for it so I can't talk about it, but you really don't want to get your breakfast there in any case, go into the narrow streets of the old Barcelona away from the Rambla and pick a little place there to have your breakfast, tapas and whatnot.

I was told at the front desk by a pleasant man at first that we have the last room on Friday night. Our room was not cleaned for two days, we called downstairs for towels and JIGGAR the great person at the front desk argued that it was clean, and didn't understand why we needed towels. At the same time we asked for an iron and he refused to come up because apparently now they were really busy at the front desk sitting on the internet or on the phone ona personal call. HE did come up with the towels 20minutes later, and still said oh the room must have been clean but if you clearly looked nothing was clean he still wanted to prove that he was right. The next day the maids came in to clean our room, the same bed sheets that were dirty in the same spots, filthy, were now turned around from top to bottom, pillow case was not changed, We called front desk and got the nice person again, cant remember his name. He said ok madam, ok madam, ok madam, just kind of brush it off and don't really care and will not do anything about it. We asked him to bring up new sheets, which he did and we changed our own bedsheets. We made a movie of where our zippers were and how we left our luggage before leaving our room, when we got back they were on the opposite side. Nothing was missing, but clearly someone was going through them. Jiggar was extremely the rudest of them all. AAAAh my favorite called for a wake up. Can you please wake us up at 8:45pm. No problem. Luckily, I looked at my watch it was 9:10pm, and he had not called. I called downstairs to ask him what happened, his reply, \"Oh I got busy at the front desk, it does happen\", I said what time is it? He lies and says oh it's 9pm thinking i dont have a watch. I said no its 9pm and what if I had a flight to catch or an important meeting, would you pay for the flight? He didn't like that, oh what u mean, i know pay, no !!! no!! No! ...i just let it go. Rooms overall were clean, pleasant. Beds were awful, I could not sleep at all number one due to the noise level, brutal, but putting that aside you could feel the springs in the bed digging into your body all night long, not a good experience for a hotel were we paid 150euros fri/sat and then 100 euros for the rest of the days. Rates on hotels were different for each person as they walked in. Met another couple there, who experienced the same thing as us, actually worse with the front desk. We atleast got our calls transferred to our room, he was told he had to come down to front to desk at 1am or 2am and they dont transfer calls, so different rules for everyone. Front door has a sensor, so you walk up to it, it should open. At times you would wait 3-4minutes before it would open. On one of our days iBAN who also works the front desk, there is a story with that one too, A BIG LIE!! I will discuss in a moment. I knocked on the door, bc I had to go to the bathroom, he was yapping with someone else. He comes up to the door which I kept knocking on and starting knocking on it back at me being rude before opening the door. NOw that is class in Barcelona for sure. Great manners, and great customer service. Last day there, I am getting my luggage out of the storage room. I ask IBAN at the front desk nicely, pleasantly who is the owner of Atlas, now before this, this man is on the phone having a personal conversation, laughing, not even ackowleding us at all. Great customer service. NOT. As soon as I ask him, he doesnt reply, so i grabbed a card knowing that he is talking to his friend on the phone, write out OWNER? and a line __________ for him to fill out so I Dont disturb the front desk guy. He goes quickly, why you want to know? I reply i want to send an email because we realy enjoyed our stay here and he knew clearly how bad it was and why it was and that we were in the right and yet we kept quiet because we had more than 1 night there booked. He wrote down IBAN VEMONT, I go you are the owner here? He goes yes, you can send the email to this address on the card. Went back to his phone call. As my other half comes up and I tell him that did you know that this man who knocked on the door that day while we were waiting and was rude is the person that owns this place? He said what, the first guy on the first night told us it was owned by an East indian person, so guess they switched ownership immediately within 2 days. I believe that IBAN lied to us that he is the owner, yet he is working the front desk so that we do not comment on ow rude they are, customer service was poor, someone went through our luggage, the maids did not change our cheats, they were filthy, there were no towels, our rooms were not clean, they lied to us that our room was the last room, we met ppl at breakfast who complained how poor the service was, they didnt get towels, and also that they checked in after us, and how their rate was higher than ours. Jiggar extremely rude, One of them was pleasant only because he didnt say anything but laughed about it later, ok ok ok ok, just brushing it all off like it wasnt a big deal. If i wanted to stay in a run down hostel I would have. We didnt complain about the beds at all, we didnt complain about the noise at all, we only complained about the bedsheets being flipped from bottom of the bed to top still dirty, and that we think our luggage was tampered with, no towels, room was not cleaned, and their response was ok ok ok ok...yeah ok ok ok...didnt even phase them. I would recommend this hotel for ppl who are ok with sleeping on a bed with thin mattresses and springs poking their body, great location wise, a bit noisy 5 out of 10, cleansiness good, breakfast everyday was, ham, toast, bacon, OJ, milk, cereal, croissants, which was nice it was included in your hotel rate. Front DESK RUDE!!!!! Customer service POOR, very poorly run. They made no suggestions as to where to go, what to do, nothing at all. At times, we got the watch your purses. We rented a go car for the day, excellent service, last day i looked through some stuff in the lobby and there was a card there for 10% off had no idea it even existed. wish I knew. I think if they worked on their customer service, it would make a worlds difference. These are just little things but make a worlds of a difference. To me, pleasant ppl at the desk, and acknowledging the fact that sheets were dirty, room was not cleaned instead of accusing us of lying or making you feel like that it awful. Because of this I would not recommend Atlas hotel to anyone I know. Very rude people. There was no language barrier at all either, I speak the exact same language as them, even then my epxerience with front desk was not good along with many others and after reading through the reviews im not the only one who complains about their inconsistency. It asks at the bottom if there was high speed internet, we dont even know that but on their website it says there is. we asked the gentleman at the front where the nearest cafe was and he told us next door but never mentioned internet use at the hotel at all. Oh they do sell jacked up prices to the football game if anyone has the desire to pay extra for some odd reason. When our room was not clean we had no toilet paper, had to call down for that too!!!!!!

We did stay at the Atlas Hotel for 2 nights June 19-21. They do serve complementary breakfast in the lobby area next to the elevator - nothing special - cornflakes, toast, cheese, ham yoghurt, coffee, orange juice and some sweet stuff. We never had breakfast, because we preferred the Boqueria for the tortillas and the atmosphere there in the mornings. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the aircon was very silent so sleeping was no problem. Of course there is noise out on the streets - but hey, we are in the main tourist area here and bars are all around. The Tapas bar, next door is excellent.

The rooms, elevator, and hallways are on the small side, the floors are covered with linoleum, there is a church bell that rings every half hour from 8:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. that the sound proofing does not keep out, and it helps if you like orange walls and bedspreads, but these detractions were insignificant relative to the benefits this hotel offered. The bathroom had modern facilities and we found the beds to be very comfortable. The staff speaks several languages including English and were very friendly and helpful. They were very attentive when we couldn't figure out how to work the air conditioner and were happy to give us directions and recommendations of places to go and things to see. The hotel offers breakfast that, considering the price we were paying, was fairly extensive. It consisted of cold cereal, breads, fruit, meat and cheese slices, fruit juices, and a machine that made several types of coffee. The best selling point of Hotel Atlas is its location right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, the heart of Barcelona. The area has countless pedestrian friendly walkway, especially a street called The Ramblas, filled with cafes and shops. The Mercat de la Boqueria, a covered food market filled with vendors hawking everything from fruit juices to meats, fish and wine is two blocks away. There is an internet cafe just around the corner, and the beach is an enjoyable 25 minute stroll from the hotel. The Liceu subway stop is within 200 feet and the Plaza Catalunya where one can catch the tour buses is a ten minute walk. While we were warned to be wary of pickpockets, we felt safe walking back to the hotel even at midnight. Hotel Atlas is not the Four Seasons, but at 70 Euros a night vs. 400+ a night for the Four Seasons, it is a great value for the money.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cBarcelona is great\u201d", "Author": "susmaya", "ReviewID": "UR17027902", "Content": "We booked this hotel mainly because of its location, just a few steps from La Rambla. Its a bit overpriced, doesnt have minibar, restaurant, no breakfast and no bar..but somehow this was ok, just step outside and you\u00b4ll have no problems to find something to eat. Quite noisy outside on the street. Lots of britts, drunk and carrying on late...not the hotels fault tho. Nice bathroom. They did not seem to use locks at the hotel tho. Once when we came back from a day out on the town we found our door open. Luckily noone had gone inside and nothing was missing. The door next to our room was also open, we looked inside and saw someones luggage and shoes but noone was there...the maid must have forgotten to lock the doors.. Overall hotells are very expensive in Barcelona, especially close to the main attractions.
