{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Owner is only interested in your money We had booked into this hotel via 'booking.com' for 1 night only and arrived at around 6pm. The young gentleman behind the reception was very pleasant and the room itself was basic but clean. Alas, that is where our nice experience ended. The crucial bit of information about this hotel is that not all the rooms are air conditioned!Our room was extremely hot, so we decided to switch on the fan and go out for a meal and a walk to let it cool down. When we got back, at about 11pm, all that happened was the hot air was circulated around the room, like a fan assisted oven and we could not stay in there. We were told by the nice young man that there was one air conditioned room available at a higher price (which we asked to take) but on speaking to the owner we were told that we would have to pay for both rooms! When the owner came to the hotel we had offered to take the more expensive room and even pay a cleaning surcharge for my use of the shower. However, the owner continued to insist that we pay for both or take showers to keep cool!!Of course we refused to pay and luckily found another hotel at 11.45pm, but I stated that my wife would move to the new hotel and I would wait behind for the police - This was my suggestion to ensure that we were not going to be accused of absconding from the hotel without paying! - After the owner had called the police, he said that they would not arrive and just wanted us out of his hotel.At this time I am being told by the booking agency that the hotel is now going to charge me for the room. Looks like this one did not end there on the night.My advice - Don't stay here!!", "Date": "Jun 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR841623165", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MonOverHere"}, {"Content": "A decent hotel for a short stay       The view from our balcony", "Date": "Jul 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR965643219", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Faune"}, {"Content": "ASSOLUTAMENTE PESSIMO stanza...   showReview(22864128, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR700986833", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Centralissimo, personale...   showReview(21052969, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR469661063", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'accoglienza ricevuta in hotel...   showReview(17115566, 'full');", "Date": "May 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR987780813", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Quello che mi ha colpito di pi\u9709...   showReview(16727236, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR181420965", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d662244-r17208770-Hotel_Rita_Major-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "662244", "Price": "$107"}}
