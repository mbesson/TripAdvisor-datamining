{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A wonderful surprise in a great neighborhood This hotel was a real find, after a couple less than fabulous experiences elsewhere. The neighborhood is great, there is a terrific organic coffee shop next door, and the connections with the rest of the city are very convenient. The hotel itself seems a good deal more polished and refined than its cost would indicate. The room (we were on the interior side) was clean and nicely decorated; above all, it was quiet. Overall, I would call this far and away the best value of hotels we found in the city. Free spirit that I am, it is seldom that I can say that I wouldn't consider looking for a change of scenery on my next visit to a place, but in this case it is the truth. The price is definitely right and the overall experience makes me look forward to my return.", "Date": "Mar 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR580900134", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Rosecrans"}, {"Content": "Hotel Milan: Good Value We stayed at the Hotel Milan on two, separate nights earlier this month. The hotel is clean, modern and more than suited our needs. The style is modern-business hotel, bland but not unattractive.The King size bed room is only $470 MXP, and despite being a bit on the small side, is clean and well maintained. It's comparable to a King room at the Hotel Catedral, in Centro, but the latter costs a bit more.The bed is very comfortable. The shower and hot water supply are among the first things I notice in a hotel. At the Milan, the hot water arrived within a few seconds and was plentiful. There are the usual bath amenities.I did not have a laptop along, so I could not try out the un-advertised Wi-Fi I'd read about on a travel forum.. There is a single, coin-accepting PC in the lobby, but it was out of order on our first night, and turned off when I wanted to use it on our second night. The night clerk did not seem to want to turn it on.However, an Internet cafe, about 1 block west, esCool, has high speed Internet access. There are even four Macs.There is a restaurant, but we did not try it, preferring to eat at one of the original Bisquits Obreg\u8d38n located within a block away. The latter offers moderately priced, varied meals and is extremely popular.We would stay there again when in the area.", "Date": "Feb 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR269413772", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Don_Cuevas"}, {"Content": "title I stayed here for 2 weeks in Jan 08. good 3 star hotel. I started with a room with a street view as it is a pleasant outlook, but as with most of Mexico City it was really noisy  made it hard to sleep. I transferred to a room at the back where the only view was a light well, but blessedly quiet. Rooms are nice  staff are friendly  helpful. Moderate English skills. Prices went up on Jan 1 '08. A single room was 390 pesos, up from 290. Roma is a good area, plenty of cultural attractions  places to eat. Only a moderate walk to Insurgentes metro station or the metrobus line.", "Date": "Jan 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR862357738", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MWSydney"}, {"Content": "Great hotel, great value If you're looking for a hotel in Mexico City, you can do a lot worse. The facility is in a nice part of town, plenty of eating nearby and shopping, easy access to subways etc. Also, the hotel never mentions it but they have WiFi (computer access in the lobby too)! The rooms were clean, service was attentive and fast. The people at the front desk are happy to send bellhops to run errands (buy beer etc) for you. The hotel was nicely decorated, tasteful. Oh, the pillows were hard but that doesn't bother me.Only one downside, the restaurant. The TVs (3!) in there were blaring so we never could tolerate the noise to order a meal. Too bad, it would have been convenient. I suggested that the manager try an experiment of lowering the volume to see if sales picked up; apparently we weren't the only ones who felt this way, the restaurant was always sparsely attended (the manager defended the practice saying it was a cultural thing). Also, one of the servers in there is really slow (we ordered coffee). Luckily, there's a coffee place right next door with faster service and better coffee. If it weren't for the restaurant ambiance, I would have given Hotel Milan five stars. Pricing: great value! The rate for a room with one bed (matrimonial) was $40 a night. The room rate for two beds is $25 a person (X2). The place was impeccably clean. Even their underground parking lot was immaculate. I didn't see a single piece of trash anywhere. Caveat: the rooms are not heated. If it will be chilly in late afternoon, don't leave your windows open all day. I won't have a problem returning to this hotel if I go back to Mexico City.Oh, if it matters, I don't know if they speak English.", "Date": "Jan 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR547837791", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kathleenfasanella"}, {"Content": "Very good value in a great location! I stayed in the Hotel Milan twice in late 2006 (Nov  Dec). The location is great, in the trendy but still authentic Colonia Roma. 15 mins walk from Condesa, easy metro or taxi ride to the Centro Historico, 15 mins taxi to Polanco. Having lived in Mexico city for over 8 years I would rate the Milan tops for value for money. The rooms are priced about 10-15% over those of the Hostal La Moneda and other similar places, but the quality is FAR superior. Very clean rooms  bedding, A/C, spotless bathrooms, cable TV, even a complimentary sewing kit! If you don't mind a little street noise then get a room at the front looking over Calle Alvaro Obregon and the Casa Lamm across the road (excellent restaurant, if a tad pricey, good for a treat). Rooms at the back can be a little dark, looking over a central vestibule, but are quieter. The experience of the previous poster with nocturnal activities would be an exception, this isn't that type of hotel. There are many lovely little restaurants in the area, both along the main street and up side streets. For example, take a left on your exit from the hotel, then another left up Orizaba for 2 blocks to find a shady tree-filled plaza with fountains and lively eateries along one side.This is the hotel I always recommend to friends travelling to the city who want to be central, comfortable, and economical (under US$50). At these prices it simply can't be beaten!", "Date": "Jul 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR853638670", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Madramor"}, {"Content": "Like the location, not a great bargin I've stayed at the Hotel Milan twice now. The first time was 2 years ago for 5 nights. The second time was last year for 4 nights. The rooms are OK. They are fairly clean though the carpets and bedspreads looked very well worn. The staff was nice. The rooms were both pretty dark and a little stuffy. I did have a bad experience. One night at 2 AM when I had to get up early the room next door was rented to 2 couples for an hour. They were loud, drunk and proceeded to have a really, really, really noisy lovemaking session. I'm sure it woke everyone on that floor and the one above with the noise they made in the hallway, room and then hallway again. As soon as they were done they checked out. In the middle of it I called the desk clerk to complain but nothing was done. It seemed pretty obvious that someone had come in late that night and just rented the room for a couple of hours. Unfortunately it was next to mine. One plus is that one of the largest gay dance clubs called The Living Room is literally a block away. That makes it nice if you are sampling the nightlife in the area.", "Date": "Jun 11, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR801269946", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d252637-r14582867-Hotel_Milan-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "252637", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
