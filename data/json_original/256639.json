The package we booked was called the lazy day package and it is excellent value for money. The service in this hotel is the best I have seen in the world!!..... Yes and we are frequent travellers and this hotel obviously prioritises in service to hotel guests. I have never stayed in Sir Stamford hotels but now after my experience with this hotel in Circular Quay I will seek them out in my travels.

Glad I did. The beautiful decor and professional, friendly staff reminded me of some of the nicest hotels in Europe . . . very upper class but however, without being the least bit stuffy. We felt perfectly comfortable coming and going in our casual clothes, and simply enjoying the peaceful atmosphere of beautiful oriental carpets, era oil paintings, fresh flowers, old-fashioned constant courtesy. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. There is a restaurant where we had breakfast, and a bar that looked quite appealing. From the covered arch entranceway and doorman to the lovely view (from the 10th floor) it felt magical. There are several shuttles from the airport to the hotel at $14 each way, and once at the hotel just about anything worth seeing is walking distance. Even in heels, it was an easy walk to 100 year old stairs leading down to the outdoor cafe area and the Opera House. The price was reasonable for the area. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms had all the amenities one could hope for (see the bedside tables for coffee pots and safe). Our room didn't have a balcony but it had stunning views over the harbor. We could only see the back of the Opera House, but a great view of the bridge, the sailboats, etc. We were going to originally stay in a hotel that had an (expensive) full view of the Opera House but realized it was quite a walk and so opted for Sir Stamford instead.

I'd requested an early check-in, which is always subject to availability, but the room was not quite ready when I arrived. This was no problem, however, because I was granted access to the 5th floor fitness room and pool where I could shower, change and/or use the outdoor pool while my room was readied. The pool is quite tiny -- not too much bigger than a large hot tub -- and is only 1 meter deep all around. But -- oh, heaven -- did this help! While my husband took a post-shower nap in the patio's filtered shade, I showered, swam about, and lounged poolside... and the room was ready after an hour-and-a-half. Room 312 overlooked the main entrance and the Royal Botanic Gardens -- or what we could see through the trees that is. [The third floor is noted as a Lounge (Club) floor in the elevator, but I was told that the perks that came with the floor no longer apply.] Our room was spacious and spotless with plenty of natural light. The bed and furnishings were comfortable -- perfect for some much-needed rest. There was a little bit of road noise, but not much considering our busy streetside location. The bathroom was elegant and clean, comprised of mostly marble. There was a double vanity, soaking tub, shower and a a toilet room. Amenities were plentiful and of good quality. Within the hotel, all of our staff encounters were pleasant. We utilized the concierge's advice a few times; he was friendly and good-natured to boot! From my research I found that rooms at the Sir Stamford at Circular Quay can be on the pricier side for travellers on a budget. Typically, a room here would be more than I'd prefer to spend unless I were splurging for a special occasion. However, I booked this room about a year in advance and was able to secure an excellent rate (south of $250/night) -- a bargain, considering the room and hotel class, location, and the splendid service! The one oddity we experienced was a mid-stay change of furniture! I'm not sure if this happens often, but it was a first for me. When we returned from a long day of sightseeing, I noticed the couch and chair were a different color. My husband didn't believe me until I showed him the picture I'd taken upon our arrival. He inquired at the front desk and he thought the gentleman was surprised we'd noticed. Apparently, we happened to be in a room where the furniture was cycled out for cleaning and they'd replaced it with a set that was just cleaned.

We ordered room service because we were too tired to go out. i did not have very high expectations - our experience of room service meals is that they are rarely something to write home about. We noticed that, as well as the usual fare they had a Singaporean menu so we thought we would give that a try - again, not usually a big fan but we had recently queued for nearly an hour outside Mamak to try their famous roti's and were interested to compare. All I can say is, from the moment I tasted the the roti dipped in lamb curry my eyes widened with surprise and we just kept saying \"Wow\" over and over. We also ordered curry puffs and satay sticks. All of it delicious - flaky, buttery rotis and fragrant, juicy curry. Apparently the Wonton Soup is also amazing but we will have to keep that for next time. Other comments - our room felt spacious with King bed, desk, couch and armchair, also a Juliet Balcony so you can have fresh air. Service very prompt, understated and friendly.

The hotel is very close to the Circular Quay area of Sydney where alot of the tourist action happens especially if you need to catch ferries or the train or are going to the Sydney Opera House (walking distance). There are lots of cafes and restaurants close by as well as the hotel's own restaurant. The large Botanic Gardens are just across the road, and a few blocks up you are into the main shopping areas.

We book a different 5 star hotel each time we visit in the attempt to find the hotel which is perfect for us.

We found the perfect mix at the Sir Stamford, a beautiful smaller 5 star hotel which has amazing personal, friendly yet professional service. The larger 5 star hotels are slightly sterile, mass produced and impersonal, this is where the Sir Stamford has the definate edge. From the moment we drove up outside we were greeted with genuine smiles and a sincere friendly welcome. We were made to feel special from the very beginning and this feeling didn't stop until we left. The staff here genuinely appear to love their jobs which shows in the way they treat their guests. Our suite was large, inviting and spotless and the bathroom was huge! The furnishings created a relaxing ambience. It was lovely to be able to step out onto the balcony, something which is quite rare in an innner Sydney hotel. We couldn't hear a sound from adjoining rooms even though they were occupied, another rarity these days in most hotels!! We thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the personal service at breakfast, never having to wait or queue for anything.We weren't rushed and the staff were happy for us to linger as long as we wanted, topping up our coffee without having to be prompted. Overall we thorougly enjoyed our stay at the Sir Stamford and will be making this our hotel of choice when visiting Sydney.

The bottom line is this: The Sir Stamford is in the best possible location for a tourist in Sydney! In addition, the hotel staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating.

The food is always lovely (both room service and at the restaurant), and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. I always find the concierge staff to be fantastic - they go out of their way to help you, even when you don't request it. As an example, the staff knew from a previous conversation that I was planning to walk to the opera house for a show that afternoon, and when I was on my way out, they informed me that although the weather looked clear now, the forecast showed rain later in the afternoon, and suggested that I borrow one of the hotel umbrellas. Sure enough, after the performance had concluded it was pouring quite heavily - I returned to the hotel completely dry thanks to the concierge staff! :) As a Senators Club member, I am entitled to a complimentary late check-out where hotel capacity allows, and this was requested on check-in (on presentation of the membership card). The staff member originally tried to charge me for this, however the other receptionist quickly said that it was \"free for him (me)\". Unfortunately, the staff must have then forgotten to enter the request into the system, as we received a call the next day (at the standard check-out time) asking why we had not yet checked out, and asking when they could expect us to leave (spoken much more politely of course). Eventually this was sorted out, however this isn't the first time that this has happened (and it has happened at other Stamford properties too), so perhaps better staff training across the various properties with regard to Senators Club benefits would prevent this from happening to other guests in the future. Also, staff in the restaurant should be remided that when a couple asks for one dessert item \"to share\", it is a request for the item to be served on one plate with two sets of cutlery as appropriate (we were only given one fork between the two of us, and had to specifically request a second one after ordering the item \"to share\"). All in all, the issues with check-out and the restaurant consumed all of 5 minutes during our multi-day stay, and the quality of this hotel (and the staff) still warrant an \"excellent\" rating.

Hotel is expensive, but I got an amazing deal (~$110/night) that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pass up. This hotel is really nice (former Ritz Carlton), and the quality has not declined since. The quality of this hotel is surpassed by its location: across the street from the Royal Botanical Gardens, 2 blocks from Sydney Opera House, and 1 block from Circular Quay. What more could you ask for (OK, not in Darling Harbor or other districts)! After a 15 hour flight from LAX (including a 2 hour unscheduled fuel stop in Brisbane), and 8 hours originating from Washington DC, I hopped on the metro at Sydney International which quickly took me (~30 minutes) to the Quay, and 1 block further (literally), voila! My room was not ready yet (I was early), and I suppose I looked worse than I felt because the staff tactfully suggested I go to the spa and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfreshen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 up. So I did. Overall, excellent hotel and staff, and I highly recommend it (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back). Shop around for prices; when I was searching, rates were $250 a night and up. And then one day I saw it advertised for $110. Again, shop around. The pros: Amazing amazing amazing location!!!! Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough. 180 seconds from metro, 180 seconds from Sydney Opera House, across the street from botanical gardens! Spotless hotel, attentive staff, nice bar, nice restaurant. Cons (nobody is perfect): Hotel restaurant is a little expensive; then again, so is Sydney. Some might find this hotel to be a little \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstuffy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If you like classical d\u00c3\u00a9cor, are low key, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at home. If you like flashy districts, go to places to be seen, like modern decor, party atmosphere\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then this hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for you. Recommendations: Go to the gardens across the street. One word of caution though: giant golden orb spiders everywhere! I lived in Africa and forgot about those guys. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re huge (by US standards); some reach 5\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in diameter, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re totally harmless. They have this nasty habit of spinning webs where people walk, so watch where you go and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t freak out if you look above you and 6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd above is a 5\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd spider! Also, Sydney has a healthy indigenous population of lethal funnel-web spiders. They are very dangerous, but I never saw one, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the hype about those nasty critters. Also\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for internet! Go to McDonalds (3 minute walk away) for free internet; or any other McDonalds. Go to Fortune of War pub; Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest pub. Not tacky at all; in fact, when you walk in you feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a Cheers episode. Australians love their alcohol, and this bar is fun and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let you down :) Do the touristy local attractions stuff (Sydney tower, Manly beach, Bondi beach\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). Visit the country side. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much time, but I did a day-long winery tour. Was fun! Check out the aquarium in Darling Harbor. Do hop on/hop off tour of area. Eat Croc and Roo! As a foodie, here are my thoughts regarding restaurants there: I love sushi, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d skip sushi restaurants in Sydney. Yes, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re good, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no different than your US sushi restaurants. BUT-Sydney has amazing seafood and really good Chinese restaurants, so research what you want and go for. On one particular day, I had a really good meal in a Chinese restaurant for lunch. Then an hour later I saw this amazing Chinese seafood restaurant. No and food, together, are not in my vocabulary. They have a whole wall filled with aquariums with exotic seafood. I had shark fin soup, fresh steamed abalone on the half shell with ginger and lemon grass, and other yummy stuff. Also, the west side of Sydney Cove has really nice restaurants (http://darksite.docksidesydney.com/). I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the one I went to, but definitively go there one evening for dinner. Not that expensive, and I highly recommend the Kangaroo and crocodile (no, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taste like chicken). Parting thoughts: I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend hotel enough! Also, Sydney is a very expensive town (even by Washington DC standards), so plan ahead. The city has many many fabulous restaurants; some are really amazing, some are not, some are really expensive, some are not.

On our return we were a bit tired and hot. Vikram, one of the staff, immediately saw this and took us into the lobby, sat us down, got us some iced water and said to relax while he organised our bags and a taxi. Taxi came, Vikram got our cases and loaded them up then opened the doors for us, made sure we were comfortable inside and wished us well on our journey. He was just one of the many wonderful staff on duty. He anticipated our needs and gave us all we needed without us having to request it. We didn't dine there, but did have a nightcap on a couple of occasions in The Bar. This is a beautiful, sophisticated space with great atmosphere, a hearty welcome and great staff. I now love this hotel and I hope that our first visit there is not our last! Oh and also, its just a few steps from Circular Quay and across the street from the Botanic Gardens.

However, it is unlikely that we would visit the Stamford again. First, we pre-requested a King Bed and we entered the room to find 2 doubles much to our dismay. We advised front desk, and the representative advised us that this was subject to availability. While this is a valid point and we could have accepted this if she had offered to check if there were any available King rooms for the next 2 nights, she instead told us there was nothing she could do, with an attitude that screamed \"So Deal With It\". Dejected, we went back up to the room, and upon discussion, we decided to follow up the matter and requested a search for available beds, and it was only then that they confirmed that they could move us to a King bed for the next 2 nights. I would now disclaimer that after this incident, the next list of cons may be extremely nit-picky. Please take my petty list with a grain of salt. The CONS - The shower in the first room was also not cleaned properly, and there was still facial scrub still smeared on the walls. The ice machine was broken on our level. We sought to order an \"On-Demand\" movie and the feature was not working for our TV - however we must commend the staff on their great efforts to try to fix this and troubleshoot it with the tech support people (but could not be resolved). Room-service food was average for the quality of the hotel (though the wedges were awesome). I booked the hotel (female) - but all documentation stated \"Mr\" and staff kept addressing my partner as me (I have a unisex name).

While I do think it was a lovely hotel, it was a bit reserved for my style and they seem to service an older, more opulent clientele than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to hanging with. A couple of times I almost expected some of the guests to tell me to fetch their bags, which of course says far more about the guests than the staff. The staff were very helpful and friendly and were very quick to resolve the few problems I had with my room. The first problem was the safe was not working and so even after a change of batteries they had to send the electrician up to fix the safe, after that it worked fine but again these things happen. The other problem with the room was on the first night when I came back to the hotel the electronic key slot seemed to have gotten loose and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let me into the room. At first the staff member who was helping me assumed it was my mistake (I had, had a few beers so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really blame him) but once he realized it was actually the door problem and not a buzzed guest he called the electrician and had it fixed immediately. This is a very nice hotel but I am just not classy enough to feel comfortable staying in a place like this. I believe the next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in Sydney I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably head on back to the Park Hyatt which is more my style.

The rooms are nice with lots of space and character, and the concierge staff were more than helpful, with plenty of great local knowledge. Our negative experience with the Front Desk Manager occurred after we had returned back to our room one afternoon after having spent thge day sighseeing. When we returned to our room we found a cockroach which was thankfully dead in our bathroom. Since we had no balcony attached to our room, we were confused as to how it had gotten into our bathroom. I called downstairs to reception to explain this, and they told me that they would ask the Front Desk Manager (Gabriel [--]) to come up to our room asap! After we had waited for 30 minutes, the Manager finally came to our room together with the Housekeeping Manager to investigatehe cockroach issue. The Front desk Manager was not at all apologetic, asking us, \" Were we had been on Holiday before we arrived at the Sir Stampford?\" Thus, giving us the implied impression that he felt that we had brought the cockroach into the room with us. We felt that he was very rude and very dismissive of the fact that we had a cockroach in our room and he also adopted a very patrionising attitude. Now I do travel alot, and would never have expected that type of response from someone who works in the hospitality industry as a Manager. The Front Desk Manager had however asked us to come and see him when we returned back to the hotel that evening to reesolve the cockroach issue. When we did return to thge hotel we asked for the Manager, but he lady on reception went away, came back and said that he was busy, but he had left us a voucher for 15 Aud for our inconvenience. We obviously felt that his compensatory offer was very derisory but were even more dissapointed by the fact that he didn't even have the decency to come and speak to us in person, which we obviously though was not a way to treat his guests.

My husband and I decided to spend our honeymoon in Sydney and we started out at Blue Mountains which was beautiful! It was my turn to surprise my hubby for the city leg. To my dismay, there was no special treatment for honeymooners. I have specifically indicated that we were on our honeymoon in our hotel booking. It was clear, they may not have received the information because when we walked into the room, there was NOTHING! Not even a fruit basket, much less, a bottle of wine or rose petals on the bed. Therefore, I left an urgent message to the Hotel Manager. 2 days later, there was still NO RESPONSE. So, when I checked out, I told the Hotel Manager how disappointed I was. He informed me that they did not have our profile as honeymooners and asked if I mentioned this to the front desk receptionist when we checked in. Well, we did, and all the receptionist said was, \"Congratulations!\" So, clearly I'm disappointed because that was our one-and-only honeymoon and the hotel did dampen our mood. It didn't help that concierge sent us to a restaurant that was closed. He got the closing hour wrong so we had to spend on a pricey (80 AUD) meal at a nearby restaurant which we did not enjoy. Plus, don't order the breakfast. It's not worth the money. Even, our breakfast in bed was disappointing. Writing this makes me upset all over again at how horrid the honeymoon turned out to be.

We arrived at 9.30 am knowing that we could not check in until 3 but were told to check back at 1 pm. We left our cases and went off for a massage and lunch. Exactly on 1pm we returned and she was actually coding our door cards as we arrived. A very competent Concierge took us to a spectacular room on the 10th floor with every possible thing a hotel should supply. Then a surprise of a bottle of champagne for my ladys 60th birthday. Just that little extra touch which is greatly appreciated. We rested in the afternoon(early start that morning) then moved to the bar for drinks - an oasis in a mad world. Staff very caring but not obsequious. We did not eat in but we have done so before and the food was excellent. After dinner a night cap and so to bed to sleep the sleep of an innocent!. Thursday was much the same - sight seeing, lunch, rest, bar, night out and then another great sleep. Every time we entered or left we were greeted by someone.

You can come from the airport by train ($15) or taxi (about$40). Be aware that there is a short steep hill between the train station and the hotel - I am 67 and had no problem. This time we ate breakfast at Coco's opposite the station, and dinner at the Summit on the 47th floor a revolving restaurant, and Guilliames at the Opera House which is 5 mins walk away.

Until then, pay more, or less, to stay elsewhere.\u201d", "Author": "traveller2007", "ReviewID": "UR103277185", "Content": "I read all the reviews here and was excited about my stay prior to meeting friends for travelling around the country. I was a bit disappointed with the general hotel greeting, on arrival tired from a long haul flight. Staff were helpful in that my room wasnt ready so gave me access to the fitness area in case I wanted a shower. My luggage was stored well and check in was smooth. A query about the mispricing of my reservation was quite helpfully, and in fairness I think the error was due to the e-booking system rather than the staff -although when I just wanted to log on to my email to find the correct reservation info to pass t them , I was told it would cost me $5 to use the business centre. Hmm...but as it was I didnt need to do so as the issue was resolved. But somehow overall. I had expected more. negatives: Didnt feel much pleasure in the staff, no feeling ot out-of the way of helpfulness. My first impressions of Sydney as a result were a bit negaitve and it was only aftr I had walked around and discovered people are quite nice beyond the hotel that I felt better. But maybe it was also my jetlag. However I did have a coffee at the Intercontinental next door..and what can I say? Sheer delight. Excellent staff, amazing courteous welcome, warm service. Same at the Shangri-La when I was lost and needed a map and directions. I know Sir Stamford costs less than they do, but not much less and I think for Sydney where it is all pricey I would pay more to get the extra \" umph'\". Room: The room was suppoed to have been ready at about 1pm, but I came back at about 5pm, and it had been assigned and my lugage taken up. The room itself was large with a small balcony but I had requested a harbour/gdns views and only got the view of trees/street (and the noise!) as was too low down for the former and too high up for the latter. I thought the hotel might have realised that..but anyway, no matter.\\Overall it need soe updating - it just looked a bit tired out and instead of olde worlde charm it just felt like someone forget to modernise it in a city that is otherwise quite up to date. Lighting! - this was bad as someone else said - it took too long to swtich on every lamp and no over light made reading hard. Mini bar and others furniture was chipped. Some of the drawers felt *sticky* like they hadnt been cleaned properly. Clocks - both of the ones in the room had not been updated since whatever time change had taken place. 1 hr out. A poor oversight and a confusing one at a hotel when people are arriving from all across the world. Bathroom - THE worst of all YUK YUK YUK to the bath. There was no way I was getting into that dirty, marked, black bath much as I was desperate for a hot bath after my long haul flight.. I could NOT believe this was a top rated hotel and I was paying about 170 quid a night for it! I will attach photos after my trip. If it cant be cleaned than CHANGE THE BATH. It looks like it has had about 5 too many ears of people bathing in it, or else the cleaner isnt doing her job. Had I been paying 1/4 of the price I may have excused it but even then...it was soo offputing and didnt improve the second day. No Occitane products any more - shame. Lucky I had my own from my previous hotel visit in Asia where they do provide nice products. CLOSET - - the false celing of the clothing closet was broken and there were exposed wires - again I wll post photos, but it was pretty dangerous looking. By then I couldnt be bothered to complain or ask as was soo tired. RECEPTION e/switchboard - I rang to ask how much an itnernational call would be and they were unable to tell me. I asked at the front desk and it was the same. I know its not a business hote but i did expect some knowledge... I only stayed for 2 days in the end, as was meeting my friends early and was happy to move rather than stay the extra night. The hotel were very courteous about my changing my plans, so that was good. CHECKOUT- On the morning itself: I wasnt feeling well, had popped out to the shops to get somethings, came back and fell asleep. I woke up at 10.30 and was getting ready to check out when I thought I ought to double check if check out time was 11 or 12. I called reception at 10.50 asking if chck out was 12 or 11 and and they explained it was 11am. At 11.10 the phone rang - I missed it was was in the bathroom - but it was reception called me. I called them back to explain that I was on my way , down in 10 min.Now they knew I had called before asking the time, and then ahd called them back to explain I was coming down. But at 11.15 they had sent up the concierge to my room! ...as I opened my door to leave, he was there asking if I needed help. All rather ironic,font you think, in a hotel where the clocks arent even set to the right time? OVERALL - Maybe had I been older clientele Id have felt I was treated more respectfully. But as I am in my 30s I didnt.... As a single traveller d not need a double sink or huge room but had this....was it a less popular room? I felt rather shortchanged. I felt it was a pricey stay for what it was and it didnt have any warmth altough most of the staff were helpful. . I know Sydney is expensive but I wish I had either paid a bit more for the Shangri La or Intercontinental, the same price for the Westin (where I am staying next month when Im in Sydney again) or else not believed all these good reviews and stayed at a slightly cheaper hotel, although I know in Sydney thats it hard to find!

Internet connection for a fee, but the numerous McDonald's in Sydney all have Wi-Fi, so go there, buy a coffee and connect if you must. Sir Stamford price was reasonable via Expedia for location and quality - US$212 per night. Location fantastic. Literally a 5 min leisurely walk door-to-door to Circular Quay transport station, to catch trains, buses and ferries to points near and far. Yet Sir Stamford location across the street from the Botanic Gardens makes it feel away from the hustle & bustle. 7 min walk to Opera House, which lived up to its reputation. Sir Stamford food was good, but not economical -- no worries, several cafe's and fast food places located within that 7 min walk perimeter. Many more choices of restaurants and pubs in The Rocks. Hotel let's you use their nicely appointed locker room /showers in their fitness center, if you arrive early in the morning from an overseas flight. We were prepared for this, with a change of clothes conveniently accessible in our luggage - so we showered dressed and headed out to see the city with friends. When we returned late in the afternoon, they simply handed us the keys to our now available room, our luggage already having been delivered. Great service! Yes, you can take the train from the airport .. two block walk to the Sir Stamford, although that second block is uphill! My suggestion -- get a shuttle, you can sign up for round trip. Sure you have to make multiple stops, but the airport is close, and it will drop you off at the door of your hotel. Typical fit adults will find walking to be the most rewarding way to see the many sites within reach of the Sir Stamford. 3 of the 4 in our party are early 50's and we all walked to the Rock's & Harbour Bridge 10 - 15 minutes, Darling Harbour 25 minutes, Shopping on George and Castleagh Streets - 10 -30 minutes depending upon where. Chinatown - 40 mins total - hint, break it up by checking out shops in the Queen Victoria Bldg. Botanic Garden starts right across the street, stroll for 60 - 90 mins, lots to see, or sit and enjoy the urban park atmosphere, then pop in to the adjacent Art Gallery of New South Wales. Catch the ferry to Manly Beach or to the Taronga Zoo. A bus runs to Bondi. Sir Stamford can hook you up with a nice, if expensive small group tour of the Blue Mountains - but cheaper options are available. We considered buying the all transport passes (bus, ferry, train) but walking worked out ok. Some friends stayed in Potts Point - a more diverse urban neighborhood, more economical, but further from most primary attractions. Weather worked out perfect for us, although some March days can be cooler than what we experienced, and on has above average rainfall. We had no rain, 77 -82 F temperatures. Polo's & shorts perfect for day time. Smart thing is to be flexible - length jack or sweater just in case. Crime didn't seem to be a significant tourist issue -- as always, exercise good judgment by not planning to take long walks down deserted streets late at night.

It was very exclusive and an enormous treat for us. Sadly, I injured my back on that occasion and so we repeated the trip in order to complete our dinner harbour cruise with Captain Cook. That offer was not available when we returned 6 months later and is still not mentioned anywhere on their web site, which is a great pity. So instead when we returned we took the best available suite option without the private lounge or any meal inclusions. The first time the suite was larger with two televisions, but both were very spacious with walk in robes, powder room, balcony (albeit small) with a view to the harbour, and impeccable decor and facilities. Service was impeccable at all times, when I injured my back a doctor was quickly found even late on a Saturday night, and a wheelchair was provided, ramp placed and assistance given. The private lounge service was really excellent. We also went to the bar both times and service was great, the Friday night singer was brilliant and came around and spoke to all the patrons in her breaks. Decor is beautiful throughout, I was surprised to find it is actually a new building not a heritage building as it has been constructed faithfully to period specifications and furnished accordingly. Room service was above average. I suspect some of those who have made adverse comments were perhaps not given as good service due to being in standard rooms rather than suites. Location is nothing short of perfect. Close to circular Quay for ferries, trains or buses and ideally located within walking distance of the Opera House and restaurants in the Rocks. Stroll through the exquisite Botanic Gardens to the Art Gallery. We recommend the German SteakHouse for a fun night and hearty feed. Great reasonably priced breakfasts can be had at the Circular Quay 24 hours cafe. Our Captain Cook dinner harbour cruise deserves a special mention. Great food, sensational band for dancing, and a long cruise around the harbour made it a magical night to remember forever. Perfect for a special occasion, there were lots of anniversaries!

For location, you CANNOT go wrong with the Sir Stamford. It is 1 minute from Circular Quay, you can get the train from the airport and is within walking distance of Hyde Park, The Rocks and the Opera House. I booked this hotel 8 months in advance for New Years Eve for myself and my Mum. I am an agent and go by the room descriptions the hotel send to the wholesaler and also the hotel website itself. As the \"Harbour View Room\" with terraces were booked out, I booked a DELUXE HARBOUR VIEW ROOM instead as I could get a Juliet Balcony. The descriptions actually say \" French doors open on to Juliet Balconies or Terrace, overlooking our beautiful Sydney Harbour and the Royal Botanic Gardens\" . By Sydney Harbour, they actually mean Watson's Bay, NOT the part of the Harbour ( i.e. The bit that has the Bridge) any person I have actually asked would be expecting. At $700.00 a night,( yep you read that right and there was a minimum 3 night stay) we were disappointed as we hoped to be able to watch the fireworks from our Juliet Balcony. The hotel isn't even high enough to give you a \"proper\" harbour view of the bit with the bridge. Apparently if you stay in a superior King you may get a glimpse of Circular Quay according to the hotel website ( so strange as this is the lead in room type?). Even one of the boys on the desk described the description as slightly misleading. The repair man did not seem interested in making sure the lock on our Juliet Balcony doors actually locked without turning the knob 12 times to get it locked. I would like to mention that Jessica, concierge team leader and Robert who was on the front desk were exceptional. The marble bathrooms are massive, and so are the rooms. On the whole it is a beautiful hotel and you just cannot beat the location- we fell in love with the fact we were a minute from the facilities of Circular Quay. I have put 3 for value as I feel I paid for a room that wasn't correctly described. But for location it gets a 5 for value. I am just glad I didn't book this for a client, I was disappointed enough, I would have been heartbroken for any client. I am very careful when booking rooms for premium events ( and just in general) and had the description clearly said there was no view of Circular Quay, I would have booked a Superior Room instead and saved some money or spent an extra grand and stayed at Quay Grand Suites and got my own balcony on Circular Quay and 2 extra nights. Although, we had a great time, and I would definitely stay here again, I will be booking Quay Grand Suites, Shangri La, Intercontinental and Four Seasons for my clients over New Year as they actually do have views of the part of the Harbour that people are expecting.

We had thought that as we had booked and paid in advance for 3 nights, we would qualify for a reasonable view. I'm afraid that the lack of a view coloured our view of this hotel. The room was spacious but rather drab and the carpet dirty. The bathroom was large and well equipped. There was no information about hotel/room facilities so I didn't find the pool until our last night, when I spoke to some people who had swimming costumes in their hands. The lounges would be nice if they had some windows but unfortunately they are internal and even the \"roof-top\" pool lacks a view. (The pool is in fact on the 5th floor and loses sun mid afternoon.) For a hotel in such a good location it seems ridiculous not to allow guests to enjoy the view unless they are lucky enough to get an upper floor room. The concierge was unable to give us any information about hop on buses although I did find the routes on the city map that he provided. he had no idea where the nearest stop was and offered no information about the free shuttle buses.

I recommend requesting a high floor, for good views. I especially liked being able to open the balcony doors for fresh air, as I hate staying in hotel rooms where no windows open (like most other hotels in area). We booked directly through the hotel and paid an advance purchase rate which included full breakfast for the 3 of us. So we got a very good deal - our breakfast cost us about AUD$9 each instead of the standard price of $38. Definitely worth doing that - the delicious Bountiful breakfast includes cereals, yoghurt, fruit, pastries, toast, & hot buffet, as well as being able to order other freshly cooked hot breakfasts from the menu - I recommend the eggs benedict! The room was very clean. Staff were always very helpful & polite.Taxi from airport cost AUD$38 (20 minutes).

The roof top pool (heated) & gym were well used by my husband. If you are trying to decide to stay in Darling Harbour or The Rocks/Circular Quay, then Circular Quay is a far better choice as it is central to everything and has lovely views.It is just a few minutes walk from the hotel to the Opera House, The Botanical Gardens and The Rocks (& lots of harbourside restaurants) and the Harbour Bridge. You can walk across the Harbour Bridge for free (it is not necessary to do a guided tour unless you want to go to the very top). The Rocks has outdoor markets on Saturday & Sunday. You can also walk to/from Darling Harbour in about 15 minutes if you go the inland route (along George Street & up Margaret Street, then down the hill). The ferries, trains & buses also all leave a few minutes walk from this hotel. Buy tickets first at circular quay for most trips. Public transport is frequent & inexpensive in Sydney. We caught the ferry from Circular Quay to Manly (half hour) - beach & shops. We caught the train to Paramatta (half hour) - train stops right in huge shopping mall (get on at Circular Quay, then change at Central). We caught the bus from Circular Quay (no. 380 or 333) to Bondi beach (half hour) - lovely cliff top walk. There is also a free green shuttle bus (no.555) every few minutes circling the inner city, with stops including Circular Quay, Central train station, & Chinatown (from which it is short walk to Darling Harbour). Get off at Chinatown stop for Paddys market which is open Thursday - Sunday. Darling Harbour has lovely harbourside restaurants & a small shopping mall open late. The highlight though, since we are \"Home & Away\" tv fans, was catching the public bus (no. L90) from Wynyard (about 10 minutes walk from hotel) to Palm Beach where all the outdoor scenes are filmed on Mondays & Tuesdays. The bus trip takes about one&half hours but you see many lovely North Shore beaches on the way. Palm Beach is a small beautiful quiet beachside village. It has a windswept surf beach on one side and a quiet inlet on the other side. We visited the Home&Away \"Surf Club\" at the far end of the surf beach, and had a nice meal at the \"Diner\" cafe jutting out over the water at the jetty/wharf on the inlet beach. The surrounding bush covered rocky shores are very beautiful. We had a great holday in Sydney. This hotel is in a very posh, safe feeling street.

My room was the biggest I have had in any hotel, clean and very well-equipped (including the essential safe, tea and coffee making tray and ironing board!). This was the cheapest \"City View\" room on the eighth floor. (Incidentally, despite the \"Lowest Price Guarantee\" on the hotel's own website, there was no mention there of the 3 nights for the price of 2 deal I got from hotels.com.) I could see much of the Bridge, a shell or two of the Opera House and the Museum of Contemporary Art out the window (no balcony) beyond nearer and less distinguished buildings - not altogether a picturesque view but I would not have paid extra for one. How much time do you spend looking out of a window anyway, especially in the winter when it gets dark early? The location is excellent: a very few minutes walk from the Circular Quay train, bus and (wonderful) ferry hub, the Opera House and (wonderful again) Royal Botanic Gardens. Easy walking distance to the Rocks, Harbour Bridge and even the City Centre along Macquarie Street. I did not eat in the hotel (seldom do in any hotel unless breakfast is included in the price).

We booked the \"Jet Lag Recovery Package\" which according to the Sir Stamford website, \"High Priority early check in (6:00 am)\" and \"High Priority late check out (6:00 pm)\" and \"Upgrade to the next room type.\" \"Terms and conditions: The package is subject to availability.\" Our flight from Los Angeles landed at 6:10 am so we thought this package was perfect and my boyfriend called to make sure a room was available because I made a big fuss about wanting a shower after 22 hours of flying as soon as we got to the hotel. Upon check in at the desk, the gentleman (who looked barely 18) said our room would not be ready until 3:00 p.m. He was not aware of the \"Jet Lag Recovery Package\" on the website. He did not even try to look it up. He simply printed off a piece of paper and handed it to us to sign and said he would hold our luggage until 3:00 p.m. Where are we suppose to go at 6:00 in the morning? Where is this \"high priority\" that was mentioned on the website? When we insisted that such a package exists, he then asked us whether the website said it was a guarantee. We said we called about availability. He then said the only way to guarantee a room was to check in the night before to guarantee a room in the morning? Please explain to me how that sentence has any logic? So in order to get a room for the day that we want, we have to check in the day before? Can you imagine if all the hotels in all the world had such a policy? It doesn't make any sense, at least to anyone with a brain. When his colleague who was helping another guest check out overheard him speaking to us, he simply said do what you have to do to get them a room. Even the guest that was checking out offered us his room and said it can't possibly take that long to clean it since he only slept in it for one night. But thankfully, the other colleague was now able to assist us. He got on his computer and switched a few rooms around offered us a room on the second floor. His effort to get a us room was the type of service I had expected in the beginning. The room was nice and clean. The bathroom was gorgeous with a tub and separate shower and double sink vanity. There was also a separate water closet which I have never seen. The marble tiles in the bathroom were beautiful but made my feet cold from walking around barefoot. I didn't discover the slippers until too late. I did find the nice bathrobe. There were not enough hooks for the bath towels. Only one hook on the back of the door. There was a rod by the tub but that was too far to reach when getting out of the separate shower across the room. We did not have a nice view of the harbour or the gardens, just the back of another building. The room was quiet and still lovely nonetheless. We liked the fact that there were two wine glasses by the ice bucket. Speaking of wine, as a surprise, I ordered a gourmet gift basket and bottle of wine to be delivered to the hotel upon our arrival. When it did not arrive by the second day, I finally had to go to the front desk with my boyfriend to inquire about it. They did not know anything about it. Someone even checked a log book for deliveries but said they have no record of it. But she kindly offered to call the company for me. Disappointed that my surprise was ruined, we went back up to our room. Within a few minutes, a hotel staffer brought up the package and said they found it in the concierge room. I was very disappointed that it was not delivered and placed in our room ahead of time and that if I had not asked about it, it never would have been delivered. It makes me distrustful that if anyone needed anything important delivered to the hotel, that it would never make it to the person in a timely manner, if at all. I was also not impressed with the lack of a doorman. Every time when we arrived back at the hotel, there was no one to greet us whether it was in the morning or the evening. We always had to walk around the hotel lobby looking for a valet to hand the car keys off. I am used to someone walking straight up to our car as we drive up and open the door for me but this never happened at Sir Stamford. I attribute this to the \"smallness\" of the hotel which was the very reason that I chose Sir Stamford in the first place. I thought it would be nice to stay at a smaller, older, and charming hotel instead of a larger, modern chain hotel. I really thought the service would be more \"intimate.\" I do have to say that when I called room service just once to get two forks so we could have dessert and drink our wine in the room, not even before I hung up the phone, someone was at the door with two forks. That was the fastest room service ever in any hotel that I have experienced! I really didn't think the hotel staff went above and beyond to provide a five star quality stay. There were many little things that they could have done immediately such as the check in process and the delivery of the wine that would have made our stay there wonderful.

The hotel building combines the heritage Health Department building and a 1970's wing - not much to look at from the outside, but has spacious rooms decked in old-world furnishings. If reproduction french-polished furniture, plush upholstery and wallpaper are your thing, this hotel will fit the bill. Higher floors offer views of Sydney Harbour (not the Bridge) and Opera House, over the top of the Botanic Gardens which is across the road. Its timber-panelled foyer, dining, bar and library all follow the theme of european old-world and offer a comfortable retreat from the very busy Circular Quay area which is only the next street away. Easy stroll downhill to the Opera House, 10 minutes to the art galleries and Rocks area meant that touring by foot was easy. This area is perfect for those who want to see the Bridge, Opera House and easily access the ferries and harbour tours. Further away however, is Darling Harbour, Chinatown and the CBD shopping area, which was better accessed using buses, ferries and monorail. Breakfast was laid out as an opulent buffet, but offered a standard Aussie cooked breakfast in addition to a selection of cold meats, cereal, fruit and pastries. No asian brekkie dishes here, nor on-hand chefs to cook up your favourite omelette. Ours was included in tariff, which made it all the more enjoyable. The piano bar in the older section is atmospheric with it panelling, Steinway and oil paintings; it offers a fussy tea experience, makes an almost acceptable coffee and good for a drink after a night out. Not cheap though. Neither is their internet facility. We enjoyed their small 5th-floor rooftop pool and sauna; the gym is well kitted out and the outdoor terrace pleasant enough. The extensive use of energy-saver lightbulbs in every fixture and lamp detracts from the room atmosphere, giving everyone a pallid grey fluro glow - but hey, it's poignant to point out that we were staying here during Earth Hour. The hotel also smells old. Its warmth is to be found in its old world plushness and from the friendly service we experienced from all the staff (especially in the bar). Definitely not for the aficionados of minimalist decor, nor for those who expect pristine spaces from their 5 star hotels.

We could all have what we wanted to eat and for a very reasonable price! So fortified, we headed out to do some shopping and sightseeing before collapsing. The Sir Stamford is across the street from the Sydney Botanical Gardens (which we visited the next morning) and is up a steep hill from the Opera House, the CBD, the Rocks and Circluar Quay. To paraphrase what another Trip Advisor reviewer said in their review : \"the walk up and down the street from the Sir Stamford to the Circluar Quay area is very steep and so not good for someone with walking difficulties. \" I would absolutely agree with that. 3 out of 4 of our group were age 75+ and all of them complained about the 'hike\" back up the hill to the hotel. If we all went to Sydney again, I would book us in to the Marriott Circluar Quay or somewhere else down the hill on the flat area surrounding Circular Quay. The hotel itself, the former Ritz Carlton, is very comfortable and does not seem to be showing its age. We all had king-bedded rooms that had a sitting areas with sofa, easy chair and coffee table.

The concierge were always happy to help with maps, directions and suggestions. In fact, when booking I mentioned we were going to Acer arena the night we arrived and at check-in they gave us train routes there and a map of the venue and surrounding area. Service was excellent. Location is also excellent - 2 minutes from Circular Quay Ferry and Train Station, 2 minutes from the Opera House, and a short walk to the Rocks and Harbour Bridge.

There is a restaurant on premisis (we did not eat there) and a bar called The Bar with a piano player on most nights. The Concierge was very helpful with restaurant and tour recommendations.

The hotel is of yesteryear in style but not dated and not worn. The carpets in the rooms are fresh and the decor clean. The feel of the hotel is intimate and welcoming- you don't feel like \"just another number\" The hotel is right across from the gardens, a minute or so to the Opera House and coming out of the hotel turn right, gown down the hill and you're in Circular Quay ready to catch a ferry. Valet parking was a breeze and the helpful staff showed us the facilities of our room upon check in. The room was large with an enormous bathroom- the shower with it;'s own light (only down point of the whole room was a tiny shelf in the shower) double sinks, seperate toilet (ability to shut its door) and bath, Balcony overlooking the back or Circular Quay- double doors- Bliss! The bed was comfortable and we had a pillow menu to choose from. We took advantage of the free pre dinner drinks and canapes in the quay lounge and enjoyed both. Staff members were in attendance but kept their distance enough so we were comfortable. Breakfast was served in the Quay lounge- tables set with white linen, china and cutlery. An attending staff member (who was just lovely) bought out breakfast plates for us featuring fresh juices, fruit salad and cheese or quiche or other delights. We were able to self serve coffee, tea, juice, toast and pastries from the side buffets of the lounge. Then were able to order cooked breakfast (or cereals) from the menu. The best part about this was meals arrived piping hot- as opposed to normal hotel buffets. We dined in the bar one night which has lovely old world charm. The wedges with sweet chilli sauce, guacamole and sour cream were delicious are were the fries and aioli. The cocktails were delicious too. The concierge got us a booking at an acclaimed (though disappointing) restaurant at last minute. The staff were all generally welcoming and kind- each greeting us as we entered and left the hotel. Getting a taxi, or our car from valet never took too long. Our room keys stopped working in the lift twice but the issue was quickly attended to by staff.

We were a little unsure what to expect having looked at the website but I have to say that it does not do the hotel justice. But, I'm getting ahead of myself... We arrived pretty bleary eyed very early in the morning after flying straight through from the UK. Our rooms were not yet available (we were not suprised by this since it is such a busy time of year). However, we were offered a pass key which allowed us to take our luggage up the gym where we could make full use of the showers/hairdryers etc and change our clothing. This was wonderful and allowed us to head out into the morning sunshine to enjoy our first day in Sydney feeling very refreshed. Our luggage was left in storage and when we returned later in the afternoon to check in our bags had already been placed in our rooms. The reception staff were lovely and seemed genuinely pleased to welcome guests to the hotel. Our 2 rooms on the 5th (I think!) floor (one twin and one King) were an unexpected delight. Both were spacious and airy, with sitting area, desk and double doors opening onto a Juliet balcony. We were at the back of the hotel but had a pleasant view to Circular Quay. The bed was extremely comfortable, with a cotton sheet and duvet. Tea and coffee making facilities were provided in the room along with a safe. The bathroom consisted of two sinks, a bath tub and a shower cubicle, all in marble finishings. There were bathrobes, slippers and an abundance of towels. The room was very clean, not at all worn and all linens were clean and fresh. We used the wireless internet (fee) and it worked very well. We did not eat at the hotel but the restaurant always looked busy at breakfast time. We did frequent the bar for a night cap once or twice. This is in the oldest part of the hotel and well worth a look. Concierge was very helpful and managed to arrange car hire for a day at the VERY last minute on a public holiday. The gym was small but useful for an indoor run or basic workout. The pool was also small but better than nothing in our opinion. For our particular visit over New Year the hotel had a perfect location. Just one block from Circular Quay and opposite the Botanical Gardens (where we spent NYE).

Right from the friendly welcome from the staff on arrival, we had a great 2-day whistle-stop stay. Check-in was a breeze. Our heavy luggage was whisked up to our deluxe room by a friendly, customer-oriented (elderly) bellman who delighted in showing us all the 7th floor room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facilities down to the splendid view of the harbour (and opera house), and the handy golf-size umbrella in the cupboard. The room was spacious with a lounge settee and chair, desk, broadband, and a large bathroom with two basins and appointed in Carrera marble. The bed was comfortable, large, and not too soft. Every time we passed a staff member, we received a friendly smile and solicitation. Even arranged late evening room cleaning while we went to dinner, after we forgot to take off the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign on the door! We did not try the elegant restaurant for dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but breakfast offered good, wholesome, hot and cold food with a wide variety of choices, including good back bacon (not the cheap streaky/fatty stuff offered by US hotels). We also did not have time to use the swimming pool. In the 2 days we spent there, we visited the New South Wales Parliament (personalized tour, even though they had just closed!), the Barracks Museum (showing convict archaeology and history), St Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral, and the outside of the Opera House (really one of the greatest twentieth century buildings in the world!) Had dinner outside at the East China restaurant on the Quay with a great view of the bridge at sunset. (Some of the best Chinese food we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had + a good wine list.) Second day (Good Friday) was overcast and cooler; we visited the grounds of Government House (the House was closed) and then did the tour of the Opera House (a must) and the ferry to Manly, enjoying great views of the Bridge and the Opera House on the way (Get a seat at the stern.) Manly is a favourite short-range destination for Sydney folks on holidays. At Manly, we visited Oceanworld to see the sharks and other exotic fish in a glass tunnel. Despite fearing it would be cheesy, it was a real eye opener, and not at all cheesy. (You can even don a diving suit and check out the fish on a more personal basis. We were told the sharks didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bite, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to take the risk!) Back to Sydney, then spent a couple of hours just walking up and down George Street and around the Rocks. Wonderful. When you check out, do check your bill carefully to ensure you are not charged for the inclusive breakfast and broadband, if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to be included in your package. The hotel sorted it out \u00e2\u20ac\u201ceventually. One more tip: if you take the shuttle back to the airport, be sure to leave yourself plenty of time and confirm 24 hours in advance.

We asked them to make a room available as soon as possible and the receptionist just looked at us and repeated \"check in is 3pm\". We said OK, we would wait in the Quay lounge (we were paying for the privilidge) but were told - no you can't use the lounge until tomorrow. When we asked why, the receptionist said \"because lounge access doesn't start until the next morning after you check-in\"!! On insisting that we were going to the lounge the receptionist made a call to the manager who graciously said that we could wait in the lounge! We sat in the windowless room and had coffee but after 3 hours and no news on the progress of the room, we went back to reception. A different clerk said that there was no such thing as priority cleaning and check in was still 3pm! He also said that he was going to charge my card not only 5 x $400 AUD upfront for our stay, but also $500 for \"extras we might charge\". Have you ever stayed in a hotel that charged you the entire cost of the stay plus extra before you've even checked in? I refused permission to make these charges and he very bluntly told me that this was company policy. I told him how rude I thought he was and his response was a very smarmy \"thank you madame\". In fact that's all he'd say to anything else I said! When it became clear that we could not check-in until we paid $2500 we decided to leave. I asked to see the manager and the rude clerk said \"I am the manager and I have nothing more to say to you!\" He then said \"even if you leave I'm charging you for 1 night\" (which he in fact did) - so it cost us $400 NOT to stay at the Sir Stamford!

We paid A$280 for a Quay Lounge room (3rd floor, canapes, breakfast included). The Sir Stanford continually promotes itself as saying its own website will offer the best online deals, but in comparing Wotif with the company website, found that for the same thing the company website was circa A$50 more expensive). Maybe just an oversight on this occasion but I was not arguing with it. My wife took an instant liking to the room - very English like, nice curtains, juliette balcony, white marble bathroom, lovely bed etc. And spacious. Some negatives, that hopefully management (if they read these reviews) can work on for the benefit of guests:- 1. As we were only coming from the Sheraton up the road, we checked in circa 12.15pm - room was apparently not ready, but were advised to come back about 2pm. I explained that as we were leaving quite early the next morning we would appreciate a room as soon as possible, and the front desk girl confirmed with me what my mobile number was and that she would phone as soon as the room was going to be ready. I did not receive any phone call but when we returned to the hotel at 1.45pm, our room was ready and baggage was already there. So the promised phone call did not eventuate - poor service in my book. 2. Drinks and canapes provided on Level 3 between 5 and 8pm. The alcohol range was fine. The nibbles - absolutely pitiful. The service by staff - terrible. Non existant I would say. You are provided with a plate of small delicate morsels - three each, on a plate which is brought out of their back room. That is it. I did ask for another plate - and was told sorry, only one per couple. There was no food at all once you had your little plate - not even nuts. Initially the service was okay - we came into the Quay Lounge, sat down and were offered drinks and the small plate. We stayed maybe an hour, and watched as other guests came, and had to help themselves to drinks as no staff member was around (there would have been a maximum of two in the back room, but heaven knows what they were doing). I waited for about 15 minutes before helping myself to a top up of my wine glass. Compared to the drinks and canapes we had the previous three nights at the Sheraton on the Park - the Sir Stanford gets a total of 1 for 'the English feel' - the Sheraton blows them out of the water in terms of food and service in scoring a 10 by comparison. We did not stay for breakfast as we left at 6am so cannot comment on the quality of the breakfast food and service. The hotel itself is in a brilliant situation (better than Darling Harbour hotels) as it is on the doorstep to the Opera House and the beautiful Botanic Gardens. It is also an easy ten minute walk to The Rocks. If you want to catch a ferry or train - at most, a three minute walk away. Best part for us was taking a walk at dusk through the Botanic gardens and having the lorikeets and cockatoos land on your arms and shoulders searching for food. Although they have signs up to not feed the birds, take an apple or two as it will make a wonderful picture with these darlings sitting on you feeding away (but also take a few tissues as they do have a tendancy to go to the 'toilet' whilst posing wonderfully for the camera!).

The conceriege was either unable (or unwilling) to make any restaurant reservations on our behalf and the bar was distinctly unwelcoming. So dispiriting was the whole experience we actually aborted our stay by several nights and flew back to London.

The hotel matched the best rate we found on various websites. One thing to be aware of if you have a back or knee problem is that Albert Street which leads from the hotel to the quay is very steep.

Nice to be able to open a window to enjoy the Sydney air. The entrance hall with closet was spacious and the bathroom with shower/tub was large enough. It also had a seperate toilet room. The Concierge - Chris had incredible dining recommendations and was so helpful and thoughtful the whole time we were there - 3 days. We loved the outdoor pool which seemed to get lots of use as the temps were ripe for sunning and swimming. Must say parts of it looked a bit like it was an after thought by the standard of chaise and cushion covering. But it was perfect for us. The location is just up the hill from the Circular Quay. It looks like some rooms may not have much of a view, So check carefully when you book. For the price, the comfort, the charming old world elegance of the hotel's public areas and rooms, we were very happy with our package. One would need to pay more for a really hot view!

The decor was rather tired in places. Having said that, the bedrooms were very comfortable, with really large beds and it was all very clean. Although it is in a very central location, it isn't close enough or high enough to have decent views of the harbour or opera house, which is a great shame. However, it is only about 4 minutes walk to the opera house from the hotel, and only slightly longer to some great restaurants. They were extremely accommodating about an early check-in. We arrived at the hotel at around 08.00 from an overnight flight, and were offered access to the leisure facilities to shower and change, while they promised to prioritise our room. By the time we had finished, they came to tell us that our room was ready. Although we didn't use the gym facilities ourselves, we did see them first-hand, and thought they were very small and inadequate, both in terms of the equipment and the showers/changing rooms. Two people would have been a crowd! Although tea and coffee making facilities are provided in-room, the milk was in the fridge and \"charged\" as being part of the mini-bar. We came across this elsewhere in our travels in Australia, and it seemed annoyingly penny-pinching. As it was also long-life milk and therefore not that nice, we simply asked housekeeping to provide a jug of fresh milk. This they did, but with some reluctance.

Our standard room was large with sofa and desk, tea making facilities etc. The bathroom was marble, large with high quality fittings. For breakfast there was a wide choice of fruit, cereals, bacon, eggs etc. Towards the end of our stay we realised that you could actually order omelettes, fried eggs etc but noone had told us that. My only criticism was that the coffee was in my opinion poor compared to the general standard in Sydney cafes. In general we found the hotel very quiet ,although we did have the windows closed at night. On one occasion we could hear noise from another room but that was all.

It is housed in a beautiful National Trust Heritage building with nine or ten floors. The foyer and lobby area are gorgeous with lovely 18th century Georgian antique furniture. The hotel has a distinctive ambience and oozes with charm and character. The art work within the hotel is also very impressive. Our room 905 which was booked through wotif.com.au at a cheap rate was absolutely wonderful. It was very spacious with a king size bed, small table and chairs, lamps, mini bar, coffee and tea facilities, trouser press, with a comfortable lounge chair and ottoman. The best thing was our huge balcony which had stunning views of the Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour and the Botanical Gardens. I was very ecstatic, as I had booked this hotel for a surprise for my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. Most of our time except for dinner was spent just sitting on the outdoor table and chairs taking in the spectacular view, and at night it truly was magical. We noticed the room next door to ours (911) had a bigger balcony and they would actually get the same view but with the Opera House added in as a bonus. (Fabulous room for New Years Eve.) The bathroom was marble and had two separate vanity units and excellent makeup mirror. Fluffy white bathrobes and slippers were also supplied. The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool and a good size deck area with sauna and gym supplied. We had dinner in the restaurant which had a lovely atmosphere, but we were hugely disappointed with the service. We waited 40 minutes for our bottle of wine, and another hour for our entr\u00c3\u00a9e; the main took approx the same amount of time. I was furious and complained bitterly, as to me they had ruined my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. They did say they had a conference downstairs, and there was a problem with the kitchen. Regardless, I thought this to be unacceptable, they later apologized and offered to refund part of our meal. Overall, apart for the misfortune of our dinner fiasco, I thought this hotel to be wonderful. If I was visiting Sydney, this hotel would suit me perfectly. I have given this hotel a 5 star rating for its position, ambience, atmosphere and our fantastic spacious balcony with stunning views.
