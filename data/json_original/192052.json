Located in Pimlico and about 10 minutes' walk from the Victoria Station and various eateries and supermarkets, this bed and breakfast inn offered a simple continental breakfast and relatively comfortable bed. The wifi was not free but reasonably priced at 1 pound/24 hours, and you could use the internet for free on the computer in the reception area. The place was monitored by CCTV and the rooms were fairly clean although some of the blankets had some mysterious stains on them. This place was let down mainly by the very poorly designed open-plan shower/toilet which was extremely cramped with the toilet being right adjacent to the shower screen and no separating stall so that the shower water would run under the screen and right into the toilet floor, unless absorbed by a shower mat. There was also no light in the shower so one had to shower in the semi-darkness with only the lonely toilet bulb providing some feeble lighting. The shower pressure was good but the temperature was temperamental and I alternated between getting scalded and gasping in the cold when taking a shower. There was also no hairdryer, no jug to boil water and no helpful list of internal numbers and other hotel services. Also the new towels had a pungent food-like smell to them. I had no complaints about the staff although it appeared that some of the guests were not too happy with some of their pricing options. Overall this place was very basic and average, but if low cost and good location are paramount to you and you are desperate, then this hotel is tolerable.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland", "Title": "\u201cTiny room & Miniscule bathroom, but good sleep!\u201d", "Author": "LorrainePAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR123352901", "Content": "Stayed here two nights.

Ok, tea is not so necessary, but it would be nice to have at least a glass for drinking. Breakfast consisted of toast and cereals.

We had a basement room which was booked as a double and there was actually also a single in there too. I'm not complaining as it gave us somewhere to put the bags. As a native Londoner I knew what to expect in terms of size and I have had the same in Rome, Madrid and Paris etc. The room was clean, the en-suite bathroom had a great shower, the bed was comfortable and the TV, although small, worked with a great picture from the bed. The reception was twenty four hour and we could leave our bags as long as we needed the next day. It's a short walk to the coach or train station which is why we booked it. The fact is you're in London and very central. When I stay in cities around the world the quality of my hotel room is always second to location because I'm there to see the city not to sit in my room and stare at the walls. I have one very important comment which nearly made me review this as very poor. Don't get reception to book a cab for you, take a black cab from outside there are plenty around or walk up to the station. The receptionist did us a favor of calling his friend to take us because he was reliable and fairly priced. What this means is they over charge you and the receptionist gets around 50% of your overpriced fare.

The bed was made once a day, but the sheets and towels were changed every two. The room was otherwise clean. Personally I found the matress very hard for my comfort, but the rest of my family were fine. Breakfast was (the bad kind of) simple. The dining room was in the cellar and could only accomodate about 20 people and even then it was cramped. People would arrive to find no seating available and would queue in between the door area and serving table. The toaster had 4 slots and people would (again) queue to even get their bread toasted. All on all, the breakfast secnario left me mildly stressed and eating there was uncomfortable. I would advise visitors to arrive at 8 for breakfast to get a table as the breakfast is only served for an hour. We went there as soon as possible (at 8) and it reduced the stress and we had our breakfast with less waiting.

Pay \u00c2\u00a355-67 for a double en-suite and you will be fine. I can't vouch for the single rooms with shared bathrooms - I guess they will be far worse. You do after all get what you pay for in London hotels. If you pay \u00c2\u00a320-\u00c2\u00a330 a night what do you expect? So ok, just stayed @ Colliers for 4 nights on a business trip. And having read the reviews on TA I was fearing the worst. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's actually pretty middling in terms of quality and cleanliness. But it's not without some issues. Good points : - The hotel has a nice enough reception and entrance (some marble steps no less..) and it looks like it has had some recent money spent on it for refurbishment. This is true of the carpets which are new all throughout the starways and certainly were in my room. Decor is in good state too. - If you (like me) get one of the en-suite rooms on the top floor you will have a nice newish bathroom that whilst small is totally adequate. - The beds were made every day, the bin emptied and the towels were clean and new. - The noise levels were low both outside as it's in a decent area in Victoria. - Local shops and pubs are plentiful and major public transport links (Rail/Bus/U-Grnd) are 200m's away. - Safety is good with smoke detectors and camera's and key cards for the rooms. Bad points: - There is clearly a bit of a problem with damp in the hotel stairways as the odour of damp is quite high and they have to have a window open in one of the landings to help diffuse it. This odour was also present a little bit in my room. - There was some dry paint flakes on the carpet (not sure where that came from), and some of the stairway woodwork needs a bit of TLC. - The breakfast (and the breakfast room) is the thing that lets the hotel down the most IMO. The breakfast is basic and poor and the room just is not big enough for all those wanting to use it especially as breakfast lasts for only for 1 hour. There is also some room for improvement in the cleanliness of the sideboards where the food is taken from. And the lady who 'supervises' breakfast spends most of her time talking on a mobile phone is some east european language!", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but thats where it ends.\u201d", "Author": "gridsysmith", "ReviewID": "UR72402862", "Content": "Wow.

Continental meaning a corn flakes dispenser and toast/morrisons 20p flimsy bread.

People with babies will understand how inconvenient things were for us! When we tried to open the door, something was stopping us. There was a bed which prevented it to be fully opened! They must have added another bed to our room when our original room was taken! Talking about professionalism, tsk tsk. When we entered the room, we were shocked by the condition of it. It was...beyond description! Everything was wrongly positioned (because the additional bed wasn't mean to be there!). The cupboard was placed right in front of the basin, which means that we had to stand next to the basin when using it, tilting forward if we needed the mirror! Not only that, the window was broken and we were on ground floor! People could just jump in and say hi (I wouldn't complain if it was Brad Pitt, tho). We knew it was a budget hotel, but it didn't have to be that bad to reflect the price? lol. Initially, we wanted to tell them that we didn't want to stay for the remaining 2 nights but I was sooo paranoid that he was gonna kill us or something that night so we left it till tomorrow! I called them to cancel our booking but they got so mad!!! They raised their voice and said that I should have told them the day before if we knew we didn't want it.

While it is clean and in a convenient location (very near Victoria Station), and is reasonably inexpensive for the area, we experienced many problems. Upon arrival the evening manager was in the process of yelling at a young couple who were simply complaining that they had paid for a double bed and were given a single. Literally -- his voice was raised far beyond comfort level and they were being told to leave (without a refund) if they didn't like it. We had booked 5 nights and were told (in a much more polite tone) that if our travel plans changed, we were not entitled to the advertised three-day cancellation notice because we had booked online. We were given the option of paying for the 5 nights in full or leaving then and there. There is no lift (a minor inconvenience unless you have bad knees); the bathroom was so small that you couldn't use the toilet with the door shut; the shower wavered between too hot and too cold, with a few seconds between where you could actually stand under it; the bathroom fan vented the steam directly into the room; the furniture was a couple of plywood desks and a wobbly wardrobe, which took up so much of the limited floor space that you could barely get around the bed; the telephone only allowed incoming calls (you couldn't call out even with a calling card -- in fact, you couldn't even call down to the front desk!); and on our third night the building fire alarm went off repeatedly from 10pm to 5am, every half hour or so. In the morning when we asked for either a refund for the night of no sleep or to be let out of our 5-day obligation, we were literally yelled at and told that refunds were impossible. Another guest who joined in our conversation was insulted by the manager and told to leave the premises. Note: Neither we nor the other guests we observed approached these requests as demands. We were all quite polite, but were not treated with reciprocal civility. (On a happier note, after putting on a sappy-sweet and overly understanding composure, I was successful in getting out of the last two nights' contract.)

When we booked in we asked for the cot and were told to go out and buy one at a shop down the road!!!! We were then given a basement room and our baby had to sleep in our bed with us, there was no headboard on the bed and the back of the bed was not against a wall with the result that our child fell out of bed one night!!! My blood is boiling as I type this because of the danger of that room, we had to go down two flights of stairs with a pram to get to the room and then there was 2 foot of space on one side of the bed to walk through the room! There was a steep step into the bathroom which again caused problems with a young child. The stairs were failing apart as I was walking on one step it fell right through!! The next day it was repaired with staples!! The room was so filithy and disgusting, the pillows were dark brown with stains!

In case you are wondering why we stayed there, well it was because we had no choice, we walked to 9 neighbouring b&b's and hotels and all were booked out as it was the bank holiday weekend. The rate for the hotel is cheap but for gods sake they would want to pay people to stay there instead of the other way around. And when we booked in they tried telling us that the price was 190 instead of 160, we had to take out our print out from booking.com to correct them.
