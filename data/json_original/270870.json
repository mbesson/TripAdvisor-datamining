In Hotel Valadon, there is a sitting area and coffee-making facitlities on the main foyer, which you could help youself to a drink anytime. We booked 3 rooms, 2 standard and 1 family room. The standard rooms are big for a Paris hotel, but the family room is the same sized and when because the sofa is pulled out into a bed, there is practically no walking space and you literally could not open your luggage. For family, it is more advisable to book seperate standard rooms instead. As there are only 2 rooms on each floor, its like the whole floor is yours anyway and you get more space. The rooms are relatively clean. Bathroom is small, with a shower and small wash area. There is free WIFI provided at the hotel, and breakfast is included in the price as well although you have to take your breakfast in Hotel Cadran's basement.

We stayed in room 40 and it took us a minute to figure out that there was a small entry room before our actual room door (anyone watching us trying to figure out where to put the key would have laughed)! :) There were two twin beds that pushed together to make one large bed that was perfect size - much better than the double bed we were used to having in Europe! The room had great windows that gave wonderful light during the day and overlooked the little street. Looked brand new and very clean/modern. There was construction going on in a building next to us, so we got woken up early in the morning by lots of noise, even with the windows closed. I would suggest a room off the street if you are a light sleeper, but the front desk was willing to move us to the main hotel (which is where the reception desk and breakfast are) if we wanted, which we decided not to do since we really did like our room. We sure did appreciate the offer, though! The desk was also extremely helpful when we were having trouble purchasing some tickets online - wonderful people every time we needed anything. There was also two computers with internet and a printer in the main hotel lobby, which was nice since we didn't bring a computer. We did have great free WiFi in our room, though, that we used with my iPhone. The best part about this hotel was the LOCATION! It is right by a metro stop (Ecole Militaire on the #8 route) and only about a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. It is also right off the little Rue Cler neighborhood with several great restaurants and tons of little shops right around the corner.

The young man on check-in was very welcoming and the fact that the main reception was at the Cadran across the road was not a problem. The gift of macaroons was a lovely touch. However... on our first morning for breakfast we had a problem finding the breakfast room at the Cadran (along with a couple of other guests). Reception was busy (understandable) but a woman, who we think might have been the manageress, deliberately ignored us as we wandered around trying to find out where to go, she was busy having an altercation with another member of staff at the office desk. The next day we retuned back to the hotel after a long day sightseeing to discover (at 8.00pm) the towels had been taken from the room and not replaced. As we wanted to shower before dinner we went over to the Cadran and explained to the young man on reception. Before he could answer the aggressive \"manageress\" in the side office told us that the hotel was full and the towels not ready and we would have to wait. We tried to explain to the young man again that we needed a shower, even just one towel would do, but the woman interrupted again and said she had already explained and we would have to wait. The young man decided to help us despite the manageress and went to find us a set of towels, much to her annoyance. What a shame her attitude was so unfriendly and unhelpful because all the other staff under her were super and helpful, but it really upset us. I think for the price we paid, a towel for the evening is a minimum requirement no matter how busy the hotel is. We were also disappointed that in the Valadon reception the milk supplies were not regularly replaced for the coffee machine so we never managed to get a drink in the morning or the evening as there are no facilities in the room. To finish on a positive note, as I have never complained about a hotel before, the breakfast was really great, as were the breakfast room staff, the bedroom and bathroom were immaculate and well decorated.

Would the pictures be true to form? Would it be as roomy as I was expectingt? Would it be clean and not dingy? I had emailed another trip advisor user who stayed at the Valadon and asked for recommendations - she said I would love the cottage, and she was right. We stayed in the cottage with 2 x 14 yr olds and 1 x 16 yr old. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathrooms were huge. We had three other families of friends staying nearby in other hotels - our rooms were by far the biggest, with the bathrooms being 3 times the size of theirs. Their hotels were 3 stars and on average about $ 70 - 100 dearer per day, yet they all say ours was far superior and way better value for money.The privacy of the cottage was worth it;\\'s weight in gold . We went out to Crazy Horse without our kids and they were very happy in their room and we didn't need to worry, as they were safely tucked away in the cottage. The downstairs area of the ground floor meant we could have our friends over and share a take away meal at the tables and chairs. This area also gave us a third toilet to use if needed. The wifi was great. The service from the Cadran staff was exceptional. We were given free macaroons and a bottle of champagne. Breakfast was soooooo good that we were spoilt - the best croissants I have ever tasted. The communication of staff via email before we left Australia was superb and their manner while we stayed was an absolute pleasure - so friendly and accommodating. This is a real gem of a place and such great value for money - budget price for great accommodation in a perfect location!!!!!!!!! I'd give it 6 stars if i could!", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newton Aycliffe, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, basic rooms but spacious and clean.\u201d", "Author": "PinkyPearly", "ReviewID": "UR91626206", "Content": "This hotel was in a great location, there are plenty of bars and restaurants around the corner and even more a couple of minutes walk away.

The room was clean and spacious, the bathroom was a bit on the small side but there was still plenty of room to move around. The decor was a bit eighties in style but looked like it had been done recently. The bed was very comfy. When we return to Paris i think we may look at booking the Cadran as it is virtually the same location but looks like the rooms are less basic. The Valadon didn't have room service or a mini bar but the Cadran does. They are both owned by the same company. I would deffinately reccomend the Valadon as the price is quite resonable for the location.
