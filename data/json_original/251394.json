Under ordinarily circumstances, I would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly. In the past few weeks, criminal activity has increased included countless muggings and armed robberies which occur both at night and during the day. The hotel does not have any security staff at all. You are totally on your own. Given the current crime wave in Puerto Rico, the local Police Force is helpless and does not possess the tools and/or financing necessary to properly patrol and police the streets. Therefore, since you cannot count on the police or hotel security staff to protect you, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT walk outside of the hotel ALONE. Avoid this area at night entirely. In the past few weeks attacks have escalated. Entire families have been held up at gunpoint, as brazen robbers steal cellphones, car keys (and hence cars) wallets, purses, jewelry and other valuables.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, UK", "Title": "\u201cClean and big rooms\u201d", "Author": "PassionateTraveller3", "ReviewID": "UR115364707", "Content": "I stayed here for 1 night after a cruise and then 1 night after a week on the island of vieques. The hotel is close to the isla grande airport (domestic airport(the local one good flights to Vieques), san juan and also an easy place to get a bus to the old town (if you are a confident traveller). Also very cheap on bus about 50cents or 75 cents one way to the old town!!!!! for a 10 min journey. Cost about $10 or $15, dollars by taxi from the cruise terminal to get here about 10 mins journey. It is not really a hotel but a block of flats with a small reception area and a lift (no food provided or offered) My rooms did have a fridge. Very helpful receptionist. All very clean. On both nights I stayed here the room I was given was a big double with a balcony and big clean bathroom. It is not really top spec new, bathroom a bit dated but very solid with windows, but really clean, and not claustrophobic and quiet. This hotel is so much better value than most others I saw advertised. It is a good base from which to enjoy San Juan without paying ridiculous money. I booked via email - couldn't book direct by internet - had to phone up with credit card number. My first email wasn't really answered - better results by phoning. They are 5 hours behind UK. I liked the area of Miramar which this hotel is based in. It is a relaxed suburb where it is easy to walk to the bank, pharmacy, late night supermarket and restaurants and take aways. There is a good restaurant right next door to the Olimpo which I didn't have time to visit but didn't look too expensive and looked fun. I had a good manicure and pedicure on the main road at end of street that the Olimpo is on (it is a hairdressers) . Not expensive and all very puerto rican and fun. No english really spoken. For breakfast I also had a simple tasty breakfast with lovely egg on toast at cafe (green colour cafe) at end of street. It opens really early. Taxi journeys seem to cost $10 one way what ever you do locally which i thought was expensive.. As mentioned I took the cheap bus to old town instead. Reception can help out with bus times. They run late and I used to come back about 9pm and felt safe. The buses run very regularly. I loved the old town of san juan. Lots of good restaurants and cafes and bars and south american music and energy. Lots of shopping also - some good factory shops for top brands eg Coast bags, Croc shoes, Ralph Lauren and loads more. Really beautiful buildings. I got a ride to the international airport at the end of stay from the taxi rank outside the hotel which was good value. (can't remember exact amount!!!) One other thing to note when I was there end of April it was a bit cloudy rainy - there was a tropical storm for a few days - after that it was good. May is the start of the rainy season here.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rostock, Germany", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and clean\u201d", "Author": "Fordie84", "ReviewID": "UR98377677", "Content": "The rooms were simple but clean and with a lot of space.

There's also a movie theater, pharmacies, lot's of great places to eat, banks...Everything u need is at a walking distance. You can take public transportation (bus) for 50 cents and, in a couple of minutes, you're smack in the middle of Old San Juan. There are also lots of taxies, for those who don't want to take the bus, but it'll cost u $12. The hotel isn't modern-looking, but it's clean, comfortable, has fridge & microwave, the staff is friendly, the price is really great, the location is also great, the parking is free...It's a great affordable place I'd recommend to anyone who's looking to visit the Old San Juan area at a great price. There's no pool and (at least in our room) the view isn't all that great, but all that i've mentioned before make up for it, specially cuz you'll be hanging at San Juan most of the day!

I knew this hotel was in an inconvenient location and I was also ready for a low budget accommodation. I choose this hotel because I had a late night flight and needed to sleep only for a few hours before driving to my next destination. After sending some e-mails asking for information and pointing out to my late night arrival, I gave the hotel my credit card number and personal information as requested. In one e-mail, the hotel manager reassured me, even though the hotel did not have a 24 hours reception desk, that they would leave my room key with the watchman. I called and e-mailed the hotel a couple of times as I was experiencing very poor communication and little response, up to finally, my reservation was completed. When I arrived to the hotel, located in a dark and isolated street, I was informed by the friendly and solitary watchman that the reception was closed and he was not expecting any guest. As I requested his help, he made a phone call and then informed me that my credit card did not work, so no reservation was made. I was never informed about this situation. To end my adventure, he told us that I was welcome to sit in a chair in the bare and simple lobby or search for another hotel. After some more talk, I noticed it was pass 4:30 A.M. so I decided to drive to my next destination where I did not have any problem with my reservation - as I never have had before my Olimpo Court shocking experience.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, VT", "Title": "\u201cOld World charm & value\u201d", "Author": "macwacks", "ReviewID": "UR28438160", "Content": "Our group of 7 (with 3 teenagers) was looking to find a decent place w/ good value, for our first night ever in PR.

Actually it was more than I thought. The hotel is being renewed, so the main entrance and lobby are modern and new. The parking area is wide and safe. I was a little affraid about the pictures I have seen in internet, but everything was better than imagined. The room still needs to be reformed and renewed; instead, it is clean and spacious. The bathroom seemed to be renewed as it was looking a little bit more new than the room. The room decor is not that good. TV is old, but enough, as we spent more time out of the hotel.
