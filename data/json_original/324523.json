Given how everything in Venice is rather pricey, this place is fairly decently priced given its close proximity to the central station, and the occasion. The service staff were friendly. The breakfast offered is decent and very typically American. I had a room with shared bathroom on the 4th floor. The shared bathroom was really clean and big. However, the room I was given (first room on the left right by the stairs) could do with a lock change. It was easy to lock the door, but extremely difficult to open the door. A hard push to the door was needed each time you wanted to open the door. The hotel could do with a lift. I was solo backpacking. So, while climbing the flight of stairs up to the 4th level was a little tiring, it was fine for me. It would probably be more difficult for someone with luggages. One last note: The stariways smelled really bad, particularly the first level. I can't quite pinpoint where the smell was from, but it did smell a little like sewerage.

The hotel is located on a quiet street, so there were no issues with noise for sleeping. Hotel Description: The hotel lobby has been recently renovated. It has a modern look and feel. There is a small breakfast/caf\u00c3\u00a9 area off the lobby. There is also a large area to store your bags if needed. Room Description: We booked a double room and, perhaps this was lost in translation, but we expected a large double/queen bed. Instead we got two very small single beds. The hotel was full, so we could not get another room. Not a big deal, but something to double-check when booking. The room itself was poor in quality. Small window with little natural light; not very clean (mysterious smudges on the walls); and very small (even by European standards). We did not have a bathroom in our room. There were several bathrooms on the floor. These varied in size and quality. One bathroom had a large bathtub, while another had a stand-up shower that was so small, it was difficult to change clothing. The bathrooms were kept very clean. Breakfast/meals: Breakfast was included in the room rate. The breakfast area was a bit of a mess. There were two staff members working the area, however, the tables were not cleared, and the food was not replenished very quickly. The staff members were seen texting on their phones and socializing with other staff. We were not greeted or acknowledged in any way. The food itself was very unremarkable consisting of yogurt, cereal, bread, coffee & juice. Service/staff: The front desk staff was very nice. Check-in and check-out was efficient. They were very accommodating with us leaving our bags for the day after our check-out (we had a late train). As mentioned above, the breakfast staff was not very good. Overall: Having read other Trip Advisor reviews of this place, I knew what I was getting into\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.an average hotel with good prices close to the train station. So, in short\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if you want a well-priced, no frills hotel in Venice that is close to the train station as a home-base for exploring Venice, this is your place.

We had to carry our baggages up to the 3rd floor as there are no lifts in the hotel. When we open the hotel bedroom, we were shocked to see that we were given a room that is only half the size of a standard room with 2 single beds across each other, which looks like hostel type of room!! The room was small and dingy and the toilet was located a few doors away next to another bedroom! There were no towels or toiletries. I was very angry and disappointed since this was booked based on the positive reviews from Trip Advisor. It is really over rated! Luckily I had printed out the booking confirmation and showed them that I specifically booked a double room ensuite (which means toilet is located internally). I requested the dark man at the reception to change our room as we felt shortchanged and this was not the room that we booked (there are pictures of the room in the Venere website when you book and the room does not look like that). Anyway, he told me that was the last room they have and willing to give me free wi-fi as compensation. I kept complaining and finally he checked with his colleague to give me a room at another sister hotel, Albergo Marin (which is located 5mins across the bridge). We were given a triple room in the alternative hotel and this looks more like the standard room with attached bathroom. However, there is no air-cond in the room. There is only a fan.

'Room 200' turned out to be the sze of two broom closets, with two single, wonky beds at opposite sides of the 'room' and a tiny window above.

The breakfast was pitiful for the price we paid - only 1 croissant per person was handed out by the unfriendly kitchen/cleaning staff (except for 1 lady who could smile), two cereals with yogurts, jam, nutella, cocktail breadrolls, coffee and fruit juice. Their stinginess or rationing of guests was so blatantly obvious - they'd keep a heap of croissants in the back (not refill the breadtin) and each guest would have to ask for their portion. We also got the impression that because they had a 'fancy' coffee machine and cuppacinos could be ordered, this made up for the measly breakfast!

My one niggle is that WiFi is charged: in a city where simply standing still seems to drain your wallet, free internet access would be welcome. As previous reviewers have noted, there is no lift, so this isn't the place to stay if you have mobility problems or are travelling with heavy trunks.

It will be interesting if in time this look takes over the currently more traditional main building. Contrary to some other comments, this hotel is very easy to find, even in Venice's maze: it's towards the end of a lane almost directly opposite the Ponti degli Scalzi. If you're arriving by train, the hotel's just a few steps away from the station (and just as close to Lines 1 & 2 vaparetto stops).

Transporting luggage long distances on foot is not recommended in Venice owing to the narrow, often crowded streets and arched bridges. The Hotel proved easy to locate despite being down a narrow street, (we would call it more of a lane) And appeared to be three buildings joined together.

Our criticisms of the room were as follows: 1.An odour emanated from the floorvent in the ensuite which we noticed upon arrival. We raised this with management who advised us that the rooms were ventilated twice per day which suggested to us that this could be an ongoing problem in some rooms. Unfortunately the hotel was booked out and we could not be moved. We covered the vent with our bathmat and kept the door shut which kept the smell at a very manageable level. 2.Our room was adjacent to the main staircase and the noise of the foot traffic was noticeable from time to time.

The street is easy to overlook and it's right in front of the stairs of the bridge. We knew there was no lift and thankfully were given a room on the 2nd floor. Quite a few steps up upon entering and then 2 flights up. I think we were in Room 114 at the end of the hall. It was a large room with an extra twin bed that looked like a sofa. The lighting was non-existent. The room and bathroom were dark. Hairdryer had no power and the coil cord broke off so we couldn't even use it if we wanted. Spacious shower and bathroom. Like another reviewer I agree the keys were not very secure and it was always a different desk clerk. I had to bring my printout that i booked online so they would give me a wifi code to access however i could never get a strong enough signal and he said i could access internet in my room. I eventually gave up. They do offer to hold luggage on the ground floor down a few steps but again it didn't seem very secure. I'd recommend the twist off locks so you know if your stuff was tampered with. At certain times the breakfast room is very crowded and not large enough to accomodate that many people. People would go and there wouldn't be room to sit so they would leave. Only 1 lady worked it and she clearly needed help. We had to eat without utensils one day! Horrible!

We were offered the option of leaving the bags in the hotel storage room overnight, but declined the offer as the room has no door and is not supervised. The rooms were very clean, quiet and comfortable with A/C and heating, television , ensuite shower room with WC/sink and plentiful supplies of hot water. There was a full bathroom in the hallway outside the rooms. The breakfast room was small - I'd recommend going down 10 minutes before it opens as it fills very quickly. Breakfast comprised bread rolls, croissants, jams, choc spread, cereals, fruit juices, tea and coffee The hotel is very conveniently situated down a narrow alley called Calle Priuli del Cannaletto (?sp) just along from the train station, and very close to Ferrovia waterbus stop and a bridge over the canal. Piazza Romale is within walking distance but there are 2 bridges to cross - not easy with luggage. An easier option is to take the waterbus for one stop All-in-all this 2 star hotel is excellent value for money . Would I stay there again? Yes - provided I had only a small amount of luggage and only after reconfirming booking by email", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNice little room\u201d", "Author": "hunter0008", "ReviewID": "UR5914027", "Content": "This place was nice.

The doors were locked with skeleton keys making them easy to break into. The keys are all stored at the front desk in plain sight of anyone in the lobby. If you wanted to rob someone all you would have to do is walk into the hotel, see what keys were available and ask for one. They will give it to you without checking to see that you actually belong in the room. Especially disturbing is the fact that after a 3 day stay I never once saw the same desk clerk. There would be no possibility of them knowing who belonged there on sight alone.

The hotel itself was decent. But keep in mind (when you read the other reviews) that you need to compare it to other hotels in Venice, which are also renovated old buildings as well. Obviously going into an \"retro\" city like Venice, you cannot expect a hotel to have state of the art Western amenities, or a Olympic sized pool with waterslides. I would say it was above average. I stayed in a double room, with private bathroom. The bathroom was kinda small. The bed was pretty much two twin beds put together (which I encountered a few times in this trip to Italy). And yes, there is no elevator, so if you have a high floor, you will have to \"rough it\" a little up and down the steps. The two main factors that put this hotel over the top into \"Recommend\" status is 1) Location and 2) Price. First, the price. It was fairly cheaper than many other hotels I had researched in Venice. Were they better? I don't really know, but this one was a good value. Especially the hotels located in Venice itself and near San Marco Square, the prices were outlandishly high......which leads to my second attribute.... .....the location. There is (in my opinion, of course) absolutely no need to break the wallet for a hotel in the touristy areas of Venice. I can't emphasize this point enough. The Alloggi Agli Artisti is located in the Cannaregio area, which is north of (the main part of) Venice. It is literally about a two minute and 45 second walk from the train station and a two minute and 50 second walk from the Waterbus stop of Line 1 and 82. This is fantastic. No need to lug your bags onto the crowded waterbuses. In fact, this is a mere 8 minute ride to the Rialto Bridge, where you can get off and walk to San Marco square in about 12 minutes. Venice is pretty small and very manageable to survey on foot (although I'd still recommend the waterbuses to get about to save time and strength for long journeys). But the location was what sold me on this. So take my review as you may. Perhaps it may be taken more as a recommendation for the hotels in the Cannaregio region in general, of which there are many of that I walked passed. The main street there has a lot of people outside into the late hours, so it is very safe, although the Alloggi Agli Artisti itself is not on this street but on a really really tiny and quiet street (some from big cities like me, may call it an alley), but there are other hotels and restaurants on the street as well; and again many of Venice's streets are like this, veritable cracks between two buildings. But either way, whether this hotel or one of it's neighbors, I'd highly recommend this area and I would recommend Alloggi Agli Artisti too. It had its good points and drawbacks, but in the end it did not disappoint. And it would certainly be a consideration as a place to stay if I were to arrive in Venice again.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNeighborhood vibe with good train station locale...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5416021", "Content": "Venice was great and this is a perfect hotel pick.

It was nice to soak in the Venetian feel sitting on the balcony with a Venetian Spritz in hand while the neighbors listened to Italian opera across the way. If you are looking for a more rustic hotel setting, this is the place. I would not agree with most of the reviews regarding cleanliness, I did my fair share of cleaning once I entered the room we were given, a good dusting was definitely needed. Aside from that, no problems, nice people at the front desk and the breakfast consisted of croissants, coffee and cereal. Trying to find an egg in this town for breakfast can be difficult but we found some places with tramanzinis of egg and salmon or egg and ham while checking out the sites. Take a trip over to Murano while you are there and stop by the supermarket \"COOP\" and pick up some local stuff you might want to bring home.
