The man at the front desk was SUPER helpful and friendly and he showed us some great places to eat close to the hotel. We had to check out at 5am and they let us check out the night before. The location was perfect for walking to the Colosseum, the Trevi fountain, and finding a bus stop to get to the Vatican, and the location was very safe. The ac did turn off at night like the one reviewer said, but we had double windows in our room and it was deathly quiet outside for most of the night. People who live in the area do hang out on the street where the hotel is, so it is noisy during the day, but it is a big city, and everyone we ran into was very friendly.

It is the only place we would definitely not return to. We loved the location and the neighborhood, but that's about it. Despite the hotel being very modern (bathroom is lovely), numerous issues really marred our 3-night stay #1 - The air conditioning turns off at night (despite the denials of this by the staff) and there is no way to turn it back on. So, in September it was incredibly hot, so we had to open the windows for any air circulation while we slept. This would be fine, except for... #2 - how incredibly loud it was. Despite being on a very small street, the traffic noise goes all night, and I believe there was a police station nearby. If you live in a large city, I'm sure this won't bother you, but I live in a small city, and the noise at this hotel kept me up nearly all night. #3 - There is an overwhelming cigarette smoke smell that comes in through the air vents around 5 or 6am which is a horrible way to wake up if you are not a smoker #4 - when we complained about all these things the next morning, the lady at the desk basically said \"so what\" and refused to do anything about it. I gave up fighting it so as not to completely ruin my attitude at the end of our trip. Basically, this hotel reminds me much more of the type of places I stayed at as a college backpacker, paying $20/night for hostel rooms. No romance, no ambiance, very sterile and boring, in addition to the specific complaints above. It's really unfortunate, as this hotel very much hurt our experience in Rome as a whole - instead of treating it as our last wonderful stop on our great vacation, we thought of it as 3 nights to get through before we could go back home.

You can explore most of the historical center of Rome by foot, therefore there is even no need to purchase any prepaid metrocard (I recommend just to buy a 1-euro ticket for some of the longer rides - e.g. getting to/back from Vatican). Back to the hotel itself... We had a triple room on the first floor (was it #12?). The room was large enough and was perfectly clean. Nevertheless there were some downsides due to which I cannot give it a high rating: 1) The airconditioning might be working well, but it is operated centrally (you need to call someone to adjust the temperature if it's not convenient) 2) The only window in the room faces to an external air conditioner unit with the fan forcing the hot air into the room if you open it, also the daylight in the room is quite limited by this (the second window is in the shower). 3) The beds are incredibly hard. Altogether I would give it 3 stars (for this stay), however, I decided to go for 4 stars since it might be valid just for this specific room.

A GREAT LOCATION, close to the ancient sections of Rome. (10 minutes to the Colosseum & Forum - other sites branch out from there) & close to the Metro (10-15 minutes depending on the line selected.) The Gelato shop just down the street is incredible as is the nearby Coffee Bar. The staff are personable & helpful, the hotel is spotless & our room was spacious, comfortable & clean We stayed on the second floor facing Via Dei Serpenti.

We weren't prepared for the early morning garbage/recycling collection but my trusty ear plugs fixed that problem.

There are a number of fantastic restaurants in the area, and if you're looking for a change from Italian-style food, the Mother India restaurant just down the road is HIGHLY recommended! We were in Rome for seven nights, and ate there for dinner once, and lunch a number of times. We did have a number of concerns with the hotel itself though: 1. Unwelcome visitors: A friend happened to be traveling in Rome at the same time, so we planned to meet at the Sunset for a couple of drinks, then go out for dinner. We were told that only the guests were allowed in the rooms, and there seemed to be veiled threats that the police would be called if we tried to bring him up. There is no lobby, no meeting place in the hotel, so even just to meet our friend, we would have had to wait out on the street. 2. Transportation recommendations from the staff: The Sunset Hotel website boasts that the hotel is easy walking distance from the train station. The train runs directly from the Termini station to the departures area at Fuimicino Airport. Upon checkout, the staff asked us how we planned to travel to the airport. We had researched costs, and decided that the train would be easiest/cheapest. Hearing this, the staff recommended that we take a taxi to the airport, and more than double the cost. He then tried to get us to take a taxi to the Termini station, making us wonder if he was getting kickbacks from the cab company. RECOMMENDATION: walk from the hotel to the Termini station (it took us 10minutes even with our suitcases) 3. Restaurant recommendations from the staff: The one restaurant recommended to us was the worst food we had during our entire stay. We are very adventurous eaters, not picky at all, but the food was bland, greasy and not up to our expectations based on other restaurants in the area. Eat at Mother India instead - fantastic food and wonderful service.

As many reviewers commented on TA, the hotel is in an excellent location tucked away in a side street near a small fountain square with many restaurants close by. No breakfast or tea/coffee making facilities but we knew that before we arrived at it didn't cause us any problems. There is a small mini bar in the room which is not too expensive. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the beds made up and room tidied on a daily basis. It can be a little noisy at night however the shutters and double glazing does the trick. the owner is very hepful on arrival giving you a good map and pointing out all the main attractions and telling you how to get there. If you need him throughout your stay there is a telephone at reception where you can phone and he will be there in minutes to help you. Most are within walking distance apart from the Vatican where you can get a number 40 or 64 bus there in about 20min. We bought the Roma Pass at Termini for 22 euros each but because we stayed so centrally to everything we didn't have much use for it. Although you can use if for discounts to museums etc the first 2 being free and discounted after that. So if you use if for the first 2 then you've got your money back. Don't forget to take the actual Roma Card to the museum and not the Ticket as we forgot to take this with us and had to pay to get into the colleseum so we lost out on that one! Thought the tickets themselves would have been enough. We were dissappointed with the Spanish Steps at the moment as there were no flowers or anything on them. You normally see them on all the photographs. Maybe we were too early for them. We took \u00a3400 worth of euros from Monday afternoon till Friday morning and had to lift out another 200 euros. We found food and drinks expensive. Watch out for high prices on the main street leading up the vatican.

Beautiful location and more importantly central..to all the sites and the owner Andreas will give you a map and take you through the various sites and best buses to catch, etc. On the same street is a bank, with ATM about half a dozen small restaurants (avoid the chinese La Pace not good!) The remaining restaurants very good and reasonably priced expect to pay about 25 Euros (2 courses 1/2ltr carafe of house wine - surprising good wine for only 4 Euros if your interested it was Fruscati vino) Tubacci shop - sells cigs and does a nice morning cup of cappichino and pastries, lovelly ice cream shop sells icecream from 9am - 11pm!! Even if you are only in Rome for a few days as we were I would recommend the following sites: Vatican catch the No 64 bus we were warned about pick pockets but had no problems, felt safe albeit a bit squashed in the bus - free entry (expect a donation) pay the extra charge and go in to the treasury to view the whole of Rome from the top of St. Peters. Collesuem - breathtaking cost 11 Euros or slightly more for guided/audio tour see so much more than just from the outside and you get entry into Palatino included (Roman ruins alongside) picturesque walk Not for the faint hearted (you have been warned) but very interesting Saint Maria della Concezione church (bones musuem) located in Via Vittorio venete, basically 4,000 monks bones have been sculpted into various scenes (clock & lampshades) if your interested - beware the church is closed between 12 - 3pm. If you're interested in a guide book would recommend the Eyewitness Travel for Rome, really useful with bus/metros stops and information about each sector of Rome...Amazon books are offering around \u00a311 including deliver at the time of writing.

His best advice was to use the coffee bar just down the street for breakfast - absolutely superb coffee and pastries, and a wonderful way to meet the locals, who throng there. We had the room up the glass staircase, with good air-conditioning. Being at the back it was also very quiet - you could hardly believe you were in the centre of Rome. The bathroom was smart and well equipped, and we did not have any of the problems with hot water described in an earlier review.

My wife and I had booked a 2 person room. At the last minute, her brother (stationed in the military over in Europe), was able to join us for the trip and planned on just staying in the bedroom with us and sleeping on the floor. Apparently, the rules in Rome do not allow for such conditions and a 2 person room means that only 2 people can occupy the room at any given time. So with night upon us, her brother had to go searching for another room in the city. The concierge provided some recommendations, but it would have been much more helpful had he been able to whip out a phonebook or something. Anyways, I don't know if this rule applies all over Rome, but I thought it was kind of ridiculous that we could not even have guests in our room for the day just to visit. Is this the case throughout Rome? Maybe they should reconsider this law? Overall, the location of the hotel was good. Very close proximity to the train station and the sites. Almost central to both. The room was clean and modern. It was actually very spacious as well. The bed was less than desirable. It felt like I was sleeping on a rock. There also wasn't any air conditioning, at least that I could find, and there was no way you could sleep with the windows open with the noise from Rome.

We regret this decision as it was cheaper and way more comfortable than the city cabs. We paid 80 euro for the city cab and when we arrived and gave him the money, he pocketed 20 euros and told us we didn't pay him enough. Be aware that you need to count the money out to these drivers. The driver was also crazy driving at speeds close to 190 km/hr and then he almost got in a fight with another driver on the freeway.
