For those of you who are unfamiliar, that's probably one of the worst times to go there because it's the peak season and hotel prices just go over the roof. We chose the Wesley because its rate was relatively cheaper and the reviews from other travelers who reviewed it was OK. Transportation If you're looking for the right location, this is a good candidate. The hotel is along Hennessy Road and three blocks away from the Wan Chai MTR station. You can also take the tram, a bus or even catch a cab (you need to walk a bit to Johnston Road in front of MediMart). You cal also ask the people from the lobby to get a hotel for you (I believe there's a surcharge though). Food There's no room service but you don't need it anyway. There's a McDonald's right across the hotel and a Yoshinoya a few buildings on your left when you exit the hotel from Hennessy. If you walk towards the MTR station, there's another McDonald's there plus a Fairwood restaurant at the opposite side of Hennessy. There are several convenience stores very near the place - Wellcome on Johnston, Kmart on the corner of Hennessy and Fenwick, and two 7-Elevens at the corner of Johnston and Fenwick, and at the end of Anton Street, respectively. Lobby The lobby looks nice, but as a few people who reviewed this place pointed out, it's a smokescreen. It's quite different from what the actual rooms look like. As for the lobby people, the ones I encountered during daytime aren't as warm as I wanted but they're OK. The Room The room is small compared to hotels in other countries, but for Hong Kong standards and with the price that we paid, it's roomy enough. The carpet is old and dirty. The table needs some paint and so do the walls. If you check my pictures, you'll see that it needs touch up. The TV is small. There are only a handful of English channels available and we can't seem to tune Star World properly. Yes, there is a view from the 18th floor if you enjoy seeing Hong Kong's dirty buildings. The Bathroom The bathroom is tiny. Only one person can fit at a time (unless one is taking a shower while the other one is taking a dump). There are molds on the bathroom tiles and the exhaust duct needs major cleaning. Sleeping The bed is OK but the pillows are not. You'll suffer from stiff neck because of their lack of support. The walls also seem to be a bit thin that you can hear doors opening and closing from the other rooms. Internet Our room/package had free internet BUT it's wired. Unless you have a USB ethernet adapter for your MacBook Air or iPad, you will need to go to the lobby of the hotel, where there is free wifi available. Overall, if you're not picky and you're OK with these, then the Wesley is a wonderful place to stay. Would I go back? Maybe.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cLow Cost hidden gem\u201d", "Author": "tgancayco", "ReviewID": "UR122280294", "Content": "Great hotel!

The area around the hotel is vibrant and bustling with all kinds of restaurants, bars and mini-markets. You can eat Italian (and pick up wi-fi in Pizza Express) or find a kind of English tea room that will offer you pastries and Early Grey. There is a Macdonalds nearby where you will find children and students sitting doing their homework and not far away there is a kind of pub that serves Thai food. Spanish and Korean food can also be found. This a place from which it is easy to explore Hong Kong going to the ferry terminals or using the hop-on-hop-off bus to give an overview of history and heritage. I found the hotel through Bookings.com which irritated me by failing to make a surcharge clear. You may end up spending 10% more than Bookings.com indicates once you check in. But, to give the desk its due, the staff did warn me when I checked in that a surcharge would be payable - so they are not to blame.

We asked for a different room, which they gave us on a different floor (18th). That was just as filthy, so I'm guessing all the standard rooms are like this.

Since we are vegetarians, we did not try the in house restaurants but glanced at the menu. Felt it was moderately expensive. Rooms are clean, adequately sized, bathrooms are a bit cramped though, with barely enough standing space between the bathtub and the washbasin. There is a platform next to the windows (which of course you cannot open). You can sit on the platform and glance at the world going by outside. We had free broadband (because of long stay), but otherwise, in house broadband is quite expensive. Biggest selling point of this hotel is its location.

General comments NIce hotel about 10 years old, but fairly recently refurbished. The design is contemporary and the location is great, very close the ferry and entertainment area of Wanchai. Rooms I had stayed in a superior room category and not the standard. The size was very good for Hong Kong terms and functionality as expected from a 4* hotel, incl. wireless internet and a fridge (not a minibar, as the fridge was found empty). Don't expect a breathtaking few, however you can have this from Victoria Peak if you want. The advantage is that the rooms are very good sound isolated which is imporant in a city with so much traffic. Bathroom is fairly basic and the bed of medium comfort at max. F&B Very short description for Westerners- NOT EXISTING. Breakfast is only Asian style, not even continental breakfast is served. No Room Service, which leaves you with the plenty of restaurants, just outside the hotel (e.g. try the Thai place accross the side entrance of the hotel. not very friendly stuff but a good value for money, tasty meal.) Service Only Front Office, which was fine. Asian friendliness..... not at it's peak, however on an absolute exceptable level. Concierge was not impressive at all, unforutnately, which was very disappointing for me, being the first time in Hong Kong. Surrounding Areas Plenty of Restaurants, contemporary clubs and bars and of course, way to many \"girly bars\" with absolute annoying Filipinas trying to convince you to have drink in their place. As I did not go in, I cannot comment any further. However, what I had tried were a few of the life music place in the same area. Almost all the bands I had heard were from the Philippines, however not comparable with the caliber you hear in Manila. Therefore 1 out of 5 only :-( . Also, drinks are way too expensive for what you get, at least for my taste. ($7-8 for a cheap, but not bad San Mig light, beer from the Philippines) Having had the same a few days earlier for as little as $1....... you can appreciate where I come from.

By the time I was up in the morning they had another room ready and fully setup and the Manager personally assisted in the transfer to the new room.

The rooms are small but have enough room to move around. I think it is comfortable for one person. The washrooms are a bit cramped. I think they need a door that can slide into the wall to save space. The beds are quite firm but they do offer extra pillows. The rooms come furnished with a mini fridge and microwave as well. I think some floors are still in the process of getting new carpet-but at the time-the 18th floor did not.

I paid about US120.00 for the entire stay, which is a phenomenal price for the location. The Wesley is 5 minutes walk to Pacific Place. It is on the border of Wanchai with a McDonalds across the street. The tram stops right out in front which will get you to Central in just a couple of minutes. This is not where you stay on your honeymoon. Its a tall, narrow building, well worn. Although it has non-smoking floors, I got put in the smoking floors, and it smelled like smoke in the halls. Most of the rooms get a lot of road noise, despite the height. The rooms and halls are utilitarian and the walls show the effects of collisions from suitcases, etc. Most rooms are small, but the last night I was upgraded to a very large room at the end of the building, which still could not compare with even the worst room in the Oriental, Shangri-la, or Hyatt (where I frequently stay when on business). For somebody young or young at heart looking for a way to experience HK cheaply, this is very good value, especially for first timers who spend about 6 hours max in the room, and then being completely unconscious. One anecdote; When I arrived I was very thirsty and it was almost midnight. The room does not have bottled water (don't drink from the tap in HK unless you know specifically that its got its own filtering process), and it does have vending machines to buy it on some of the floors but you may end up having to go downstairs to get change, etc. In my case, when I called to ask for water, though it is not a service, one of the staff brought me 2 bottles that he paid for himself (but of course he doubled his investment with my tip).
