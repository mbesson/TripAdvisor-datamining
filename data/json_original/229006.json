When I queried the room he told me he knew we had requested a twin but there were none available but we would be moved the next day. The following morning I reminded the receptionist of this ( a new member of staff) and he stood there with the room list and announced that he didn't know where we were going to be moved to as there was nothing available, and he didn't know why his colleague had made such promises. Needless to stay we remained in the double room. In general we found the reception staff to be rude and unhelpful. As to the room, the kettle socket didn't work and we had to use the socket in the bathroom, there were no tissues, the toilet paper was hard, a stained tea tray cloth remained unchanged all week and we had to keep requesting milk as they did not appear to replace it each day. We were also disturbed in the early morning and from about 11pm because we were directly under the dining room and we were treated to the clicking of a staff member's heels across the floor and the dragging of tables.

We stayed in the \"newer\" section of the hotel, with a separate entrance next door to the main lobby. It was very secure and the room was very clean with enough room for 3 people comfortably. One large king size bed and one fold out couch (double size). All beds were very firm and very comfortable. It is true that they do not provide face cloths (aka wash cloths), so if that is important to you, bring your own. The bath tub had wonderful jacuzzi jets which felt great after a long day of walking. It also had a shower with great water pressure. There was a fridge (mini bar) but we used it for left overs. The TV was small but did have two English news channels and honestly, we didn't miss having TV at all since we were in Rome for sightseeing and after dinner and gelato we were ready for bed. The best part was the breakfast setting, included in the price of the room. It was a lovely dining hall with an attached roof garden patio with an amazing view of the city and the cathedral across the street. I especially liked having the wait staff greet us every morning fully dressed in suits and ties and escort us to a table and bring the coffee (with steamed milk) and tea. Then we'd visit the buffet which was pretty much the same every day but with something for everyone. I loved the giant kiwis. A couple of nights the free wifi in the room didn't work because it was down throughout the hotel, but they helped us out by looking up the weather on the lobby computer or checking on out return flight. The weather had turned surprisingly warm and our room was hot at night, even with the one small window open, so we asked for a fan, which they brought up immediately and it helped a lot. They said the air conditioning doesn't work until May. I also liked that we could drink the water out of the tap and it tasted great, so we saved money by filling our water bottles every day. Because the room was not on the street it was extremely quiet and we all slept great. It was a 5 minute walk to the Termini train station and there were lots of good looking restaurants near by.

The bedspread, curtains and carpet were dingy and musty, but the sheets and towels were always crisp and clean - which is the important thing. Very firm bed. I personally prefer softer beds but you will probably be so tired walking around Rome, that it wont matter. TV is really a computer monitor about 11\" or so. Breakfast is included, but no hot foods (cereals, pastries, hard boiled eggs, cold cuts). Staff - some super helpful, others not as much.

In between the lobby and the outdoor stairs you pass by a gelato place which was delicious and cheap too! We checked other gelato places in the area, and this was the one we liked the best. Every night before going back to our room, we would get some gelato as a treat! The location of the hotel was also great in regards to getting to the major tourist sites. We were able to walk to the Coliseum, and the Metro was also close by for getting to the Vatican. There are several good restaurants around the area so eating out was not a problem. There is a bank right across the street with an ATM so it was easy to withdraw some cash. Watch out for the fees though because that bank charged us quite a bit of fees.

The positives: Location (10-15 minutes walk to Coliseum and other major sights and shopping) Roof top garden (amazing views and service) Price for location Wifi all rooms The Averages: Room size and quality Two double beds (quite hard) pushed together to make king size. I do not mind this, but others may not like. Buffet breakfast on roof, average selection but adequate, same every day. Minibar in Room The Poor: Concierge (not existent), you may get a little information from front desk depending who was on duty.

The hotel is clean, but has a few \"rough spots\". If I was new to Rome and want a hotel that has a more extensive services or looking for that \"up-market feel\", then I would look at the 5 Stars. A few tips: Executive Rooms are not in the same building but across the road. For water ask the roof top bar. For EUR3 you can get a huge liter bottle to take to your room. Floors 4A & 5A have stairs to the rook top garden, very convenient than taking the really small elevator. This hotel is not for the mobility challenged. You will need to use stairs. Find out about Rome. Best thing to do is take open top bus, and look around, then you know where the shops/sights are. The open top bus stops at the Church square right next to the hotel (very useful). Also the best evening eating area is across the river SW of the Circus Maximus, across the river (a 10 min taxi ride). Ask the locals, they all eat there.

Staff were very courteous and helpful both on the front desk and in the restaurant at breakfast time. If you're travelling into or out of Rome by train or airport transfer bus it's ideal as it's less than 5 minutes walk from Termini station. To find it come out of Termini station on the side opposite to where the transfer buses stop, walk straight down Via Gilberti and you will come to the big square of Santa Maria Maggiore church. Turn to your left and the hotel is then on Via Carlo Alberto which should be straight ahead of you if you have followed these directions. There is a posh looking cafe on the corner and the hotel is immediately after that on the right hand side of the road. It may sound silly to give these directions but we walked around the outside of the church several times before we spotted the correct road and it was very hot! Although it's excellently located for the station this hotel is not in the main area for sites so we took lots of buses and the occasional metro. Not being in the middle of everything can be an advantage too as it was nice to return to the relatively quiet square after a day fighting your way through the tourist hoardes! Beware though as we found Rome hard to navigate since there are only a couple of metro lines, most of which do not run under the 'sites' (for obvious reasons as the ancient buildings might not take too kindly to being destabilised for an underground railway!). So, if you are trying to utilise public transport you will be taking a lot of buses and we found it hard to get on the right one, in the right direction and they were often full to bursting! If we visited again we might well consider buying a pass for one of the 'hop on hop off' tourist buses. Fortunately Termini train station is also a huge bus terminal so you can usually find a bus going there wherever you are in Rome. Like in many cities the area around the station is quite seedy and can be somewhat intimidating at night time. However, we too kept very alert and had no problems. In terms of the quality and value for money of the hotel room we were quite satisfied. We had room 516 which faces the central courtyard of the hotel. Whilst it would have been fabulous to have a view of the church we were quite happy with our room as you could see over the rooftops to the hills in the distance and get a taster of the residents of Rome living out their lives. Plus, since we didn't overlook a noisy street we were able to keep our window open all night, which was a blessing in the August heat! Yes the decor could be considered a little dated, but I have stayed in a dozen other european hotels with similar dark wood, chintzy wallpaper and brass fittings style decor and it's not unpleasant - and it is certainly not dirty! The bathroom was marble and brass, truly Italian style and yes, maybe a little dated, but again clean and workable with a vast array of complimentary toiletries, shaving kit, comb, shoe cleaning kit etc. The only thing that we would suggest is that if you are not a smoker make sure to request a 'non smoking room'. I did not realise that you can still smoke in Italian hotel rooms and there was a faint odour of cigarettes about our room which was unpleasant, especially since we don't smoke. I'm sure that had we addressed this to the concierge we may have been moved but we didn't bother since we were only there for 2 nights and didn't intend on spending much of that in our room. I completely agree with other reviewers that the hotel's crowning glory (literally!) is the rooftop terrace. The view of the church and over the surrounding area is fantastic and it was excellent to be able to eat your breakfast in such lovely surroundings. The breakfast spread was really good and perfectly what you would expect for a continental breakfast. Yes you do have to pay extra for a hot breakfast, but again this is quite normal for a european hotel. There is a great choice of cereals, fruit, hams, cheeses, bread rolls, jams, spreads and some fantastic looking (and tasting) croissants, doughnuts and pastries, which we know arrive fresh daily as we saw them being delivered! We didn't dine in the hotel other than breakfast as we agree with a previous reviewer that Rome is full of restaurants where you can go and soak up the atmosphere so you'd really be missing out if you eat in your hotel. The only other thing to add about this hotel are a few tips about the surrounding area if you do stay here. Turn right out of the hotel and explore the area at the other end of the Via Carlo Alberto where there is a typical european square park with iron railings and all the buildings around the square have huge arches that you can walk through in the shade. It was obviously once a grand area and is now populated with an interesting mix of shops and food outlets. I think it would be a good place to go if you're looking to buy presents outside of the usual tourist traps. There were lots of cheaper clothes shops, jewellery stores, electronic shops and a couple of shops selling nick-nacks and souvaniers for less than the busier tourist areas. There's also a couple of restaurants and cafes, some serving typical Roman fayre but some serving other different types of ethnic foods such as Indian food and halal food, if you fancied a break from pizza and pasta. Definitely go into the the Santa Maria Maggiore church - it's beautiful! It's more the size of a cathedral than a church, with beautiful intricate mosaic work. It also has a great feel of a true working church rather than just a tourist attraction. We ate lunch at the restaurant on the left of the church square (as you face the front facade of the church). The food was tasty and we would return. The place is small on the outside but inside it's huge and looks like the sort of place locals take a working lunch, with good honest food (obviously it was quite empty in August during the summer feria). We took the 'tourist menu' which was 10 euros each for a pizza/pasta and a carafe of wine. However I did notice that it would actually have been cheaper if we had ordered the items individually so do bare this in mind. All in all we enjoyed our two night stay at the Mecanate Palace. We thought it was reasonably good value for money - not exactly cheap but mostly worth what we paid, especially if you consider the good breakfast included in the price where breakfast was offered in a cafe down the road for 10 euros each! If we came back to Rome we'd probably try to stay somewhere within walking distance of the main tourist sites as the travel by bus was not enjoyable. However, if we needed a hotel for a comfortable stay within very easy and quick reach of the train station we would readily consider the Mecanate Palace.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean Hotel, helpful staff and good location.\u201d", "Author": "Lulew81", "ReviewID": "UR116413369", "Content": "We had a small but clean and tidy room (room 304).

We had stayed in the Albergo del Senato on our first trip to Rome, and the staff there spoiled us I suppose, but the agency we went through this trip didn't list it as one of our choices, so we decided on another hotel close to the Trevi Fountain. However, we had read some not-so-good reviews of our second choice hotel here on Trip Advisor. When we contacted the agency, their representative gave us three other choices, and after consulting a map and reading up on these hotels, the Mecenate Palace seemed the best choice out of the three. The hotel itself wasn't bad; in fact, the room was nice although the mattress was a bit hard. The room was large enough and clean, the bathroom fine. The view from our room was nice, too, overlooking a tree lined avenue. The rooftop restaurant and bar is really the main reason to stay at this hotel though. The view of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore right across the piazza from the hotel is quite impressive from there, and the food is very good--they have a chocolate cake to die for.

It was ridiculous - and I have hundreds of euros worth of phone bills to prove just how ridiculous it was. That aside, the room was very beautiful. Yes older, but more in a historical way than an outdated one. And that's what we were hoping for - something with a little history. And things that should be updated WERE updated, so that was nice. LOVELY marble tub, for example. The breakfast on the roof each morning was really lovely and a nice addition. Sliced meats and cheeses, breads, fresh kiwi, cereal, etc. Staff was very friendly.

He shrugged and said that the hotel was completely full and that two groups in our party could share a room. No concessions were made and the person at the front desk was unfriendly and rude. We eventually ended up contracting two groups into one room and since we were only staying in Rome one night that sufficed. In addition, my Dad called down to ask where to obtain ice. He was told by the front desk that room service could bring the ice up for him. When the ice came to the door he was asked to pay 4 euros. He was told that the 4 euros were the room service charge. In addition, the ice container could not fit in the refridgerator. How ridiculous is that? Not only was he not told that there was a room service charge for ice, but when he refused to pay, the person at the front desk (different from before) was very nasty.

My husband, my teenage daughter and I stayed in the same room and did not trip over each other. Besides, we had 3 large suitcases and 3 carry-ons, and had ample room on the floor to store them. Most of the amenities in the room were above average (bed, dresser, closet). The beds were comfortable (double beds and one single). The double beds (which are placed together) are larger than our known King Size bed (in the United States). Besides the normal amenities in the bathroom (which were above average), it contained a bidet and a hair dryer. Do not expect to enjoy cable TV there with English stations except for CNN and BBC news. Breakfast was included in the price of my stay and it was pretty good. It was buffet style (all you can eat). Besides coffee and tea, there was toast, bagels, muffins, salami, ham, different types of cheeses, jellies and jams, butter, fruits, juices, water, etc. However, if one wanted to eat eggs, that would cost approximately 7 euros. The service from the front desk and house-keeping was also prompt. During my 4 day stay there, I called on two occasions with requests, and within 5 minutes, both requests were taken care of. I recommend staying in the annex (Executive Room). The famous Santa Maria Magliore church is within a short walking distance (1 block); also, near the church is a bus stop where many of the tour buses stop (hop-on, hop-off tours), and a few good restaurants near the tours bus stop (1 block).

At first we were a bit disappointed that we were being taken to an annex a few doors down the street from the hotel lobby, but ultimately were very pleased with the modern room and the quiet courtyard (which I have a hunch may not have been the case with rooms in the hotel proper, tho have no idea). Not having to go thru the hotel lobby to go to/from our room, it almost felt like we had our own private apartment in Rome (and it did share an entrance was used for private apartments) The hotel is quite convenient to the Termini Station (where we arrived via Florence) and to the subway, either back to Termini or Vittorio Emanuele station for the red (?) line that can get you to Trevi, Spanish Steps or the Vatican. My only (and quite minor) issue re: the hotel was the location. While Rome is pretty contained, it just didn't seem like any of the major tourists sites were close enough to just drop-in/pass-by when near the hotel. But again, the location provided no hindrance to seeing everything that Rome has to offer and just used the hotel for sleep or midday rest. You don't go to Italy to spend time in a hotel room! The breakfast buffet was totally fine for what one should expect from a European breakfast (very little protein... lots of breads, fruit, cheese, deli meat pastry) and we always tried to make it to the rooftop terrace for happy hour, when you get a bit of a break on the over-priced drinks (but again, what do you expect!?), but the view is wonderful. Definitely would recommend the hotel's gelato shop, one of the best bargains of our entire Italy trip and a refreshing and delicious end to most of our exhausting days out exploring Rome. My one caution would be to avoid the cafe at the corner, Antico Caffe Santamaria, it was the one place we felt scammed while in Italy (and if you check out their Trip Advisor reviews, you'll see we are/were not alone). We also arranged a private car service with the hotel to get us to the da Vinci/Fiumicino airport. I want to say it cost 50-60 (70?) Euro.

The bar next to the hotel was very expensive for meals and if you walked a little way there were excellent choices of places to eat. We chose to get about using the tour bus 27 euros each for 48 hours use. You could hop on and off at the different tourists attractions from 9.45 am to 6.30pm. However, be prepared to fight your way on as some of the other Europeans do not believe in queuing and they were quite rude barging you out of the way to get on first.

No bottles of water provided for free but the water was nice to drink from the tap. My wife suffers from irritable bowel syndrome but had no problems with the water. The windows were double glazed but could be opened and they certainly kept out the noise as too the drapes were dark and we slept in a couple of times due to this. The breakfast was ideal and was included in the price. The roof top resturant is also where you have breakfast and the view was magnificent. No smoking under the roof line but outside, yes they smoke even if you are eating at the next table. We got up and moved one day and expressed our dissappointment that this still happens so be warned. The food was all cereals including coco pops which I love, ham, meats and cheese, yummy yogarts, fruits and lots of fatening pastries. Bread for toast and all. If you wanted a cooked breakfast, I think Bacon and Eggs was 5 euro. Breakfast was from 7-10am. 5 Euro and hour for internet but there are internet cafes around for half the price but we preferred the security of the Hotel. The lift is fairly small but not as small as Paris. The roof top restuarant is on the 6th floor and they have nice drinks, cocktails and great food. We ate there a couple of times for it was about 28 euro for 2 course meals I seem to remember that. We found a nice restaurant not too far away that had nice steak and pasta. Plenty around so head for where the tram is and follow your nose. The safe in the room is small and requires more buttons to be pushed then usual and lighting is very dark trying to see the keypad was a bit daunting but if you have a mobile, this helps. The tv is really a PC monitor but it was ok. Strange there was no clock in the room so pack an alarm clock just in case.

Now around the Hotel. If you go Right from the Hotel about 100m there is the train station. If you go left and then cross the predestrian crossing to the right (be careful, they won't stop unless you are in front of their bike or car) then walk left and on the bend there is a supermarket under ground with good prices. I bought 4 Coke zero 600ml botles for 3.40euro. The Hotel mini bar has them for 3euro each. It has all normal supermarket things. There is also a shop lovey (my wife) loved, called UPIM clothes for lovey so she was happy. Buy your tickets online to coluseum or vatican for the queues were gigantic. The hop on hop off bus stops near the hotel next to Maia Mangalore to the left side near the tourist info booth. Be warned, if you sit down to eat or drink, you will be charged double. That is the case everywhere. From the cafe to the left of the Hotel next to the one which has coca cola unbrellas, we got cheese roll, cake, bottle 600ml coke and 600m fruit drink 22 euro. I nearly had a heart attack and thought they were rip offs but others places did the same. If you like Latte's.....forget it they don't know what you are talking about so stick to Cappacino and you'll be fine. All ATM's don't offer multible accounts to choose. We loaded up our Visa and savings and cheque and all money we withdrew, came out of visa. Keep your emtpy water bottles for there are a few fountains around that give you nice cool clean water for free. Do the Isle of Capri tour and take the chair lift from Anna Capri to the top. Breath taking views. Also spend 25euro and do the blue grotto. Same tour but if you are clastaphobic, don't for they take you into a cavern in which you have to nearly lie down in a small row boat to get into the entrance but it is a must thing to do. 7 nights was too much in Rome for us. 3-4 nights would have been ample. Met a lot of people who were off to Venice and florence by train. We will do that next time. Would we stay in Mercenta Palace again, yep and even ask for room 421 again.

The hotel makes a fairly good impression as the facade and lobby area are well renovated; the staff were pleasant and helpful and assisted where possible. The advertised wi-fi wasn't included but luckily for us we ended up doing a fair bit of research before reaching Rome so we did not need to pay for the internet more than one time. The roof top terrace, where a nice (if not always fresh) breakfast is served was quite lovely, overlooking the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore. The Colloseum is also visible from the terrace. Pluses include proximity to Termini Station (though its far enough to avoid the sketchy types, generally), Via Cavour (leading to the Colloseum and Imperial Forum) and serveral neat restaurants including La Base and and a Sicilican pastry shop on Via Torino. At the foot of the hotel is a great gelateria called Orso Bianco, heavily recommended as the flavours were authentic and tasty. Our room was on the first floor overlooking Carlo Alberto Street; it was the tinest thing I've ever stayed in. Though the ceilings were quite high, the room barely fit a small double bed, a desk, dresser drawer and one night stand; there wasn't enough room for two pieces of luggage. With a bit of Tetris like astuteness, we managed to fit our luggage by the window between the bed and undernear the desk in order to have access to our bed. The bed itself was very uncomfortable. On the positive side, the bathroom was rather large, though the shower was tempermental and sometimes wouldn't provide anything but boiling or freezing water. Front desk staff were helpful and accommodating but the cleaning staff, perhaps by management orders, removed our water bottles from the fridge and left a curt note that this is forbidden. If I'm paying for the room, I should be entitled to keep my water in there in order to keep it cool. This was bizzare and unappreciated; we got a convoluded answer and managed by cleaning up our own room to avoid another shuffle of the contents of the fridge... was I in a dorm? Oh, no, a four star. The question of the Termini ghetto also worried me before booking; I was persuaded by some of the comments here to not worry. Generally, this is true - Carlo Alberto, the square in front of the hotel and via Cavour were fine, but the remainder of the streets to the south-east of the hotel are best avoided at night. On our way to a trattoria near Vittorio Emmanuel on Sunday night, we encountered a rather large and unpleasant group of people. Lots of people down and of luck also tended to hang around Termini, especially on the bus platforms. I would definately caution anyone intent on taking advantage of night life or getting in late to watch themselves moreso than regularly in the area near the hotel. Overally, I thought the hotel was decent in terms of cleaniliness and some of the services, but given the cost and what was provided in terms of room size and by virtue of location, I wouldn't recommend it or stay here again.

Great views across the Roman rooftops and a good way to get an idea of the heat of the day before heading out.

The one double bed in the room was placed against the wall. The bed had a sagging mattress which rolled you toward the middle of the bed. The bathroom had a stall shower for which you could not open the door inward because if you did, you could not get in . It could be opened outward only about half way, maybe two feet wide, because the shower door then hit the edge of the toilet.

The hotel indicates that it has an elevator and it does, however the elevator only goes to the 5th floor and the dining room is 25 stairs beyond where the elevator ends. This was a real problem as my wife has a walking disability. Because it was a Sunday night and there were no open near by restaurants, we ate at the hotel. The food was over priced and was less than mediocre. The hotel is also located in a run down area. They charge 5 Euros for internet access and this was the best part of the stay.

They charge you for the internet connection, but the rate was reasonable. I only checked my emails each night, and the total for a week came out to be only 3 euro.

If you wanted to get back to the hotel by taxi after all-day sightseeing, all you have to say to the taxi driver is \"Santa Maria Maggiore\". No need to explain the location of the hotel. This hotel is very convenient for first-timers. The downside is that the hotel is not right in the heart of the city, so you have to take some form of public transportation between the touristic sites and the hotel. After a few days, it starts to feel like a waste of time going back and forth each day. And there is no good place to eat in the neighborhood, so you have to have dinner elsewhere before coming back to the hotel each night.

We had a thrice confirmed reservation at the Golden Tulip Mercenate Palace for two nights to sight see in Rome. Upon our arrival at the hotel, the desk staff was quite cordial as they looked for our reservation. After a considerable length of time, they advised us they did not have our reservation. I told them it had been confirmed by our travel agent and we showed them our written confirmation and number. It didn't matter to them. They also advised us they had no open rooms. They also called a few other hotels and there were no rooms available in nearby hotels. As an experienced international business traveler who had managed our corporate travel program for two years, I can assure you every hotel holds one or two rooms in reserve for \"special travelers or circumstances.\" It didn't matter. Their mood changed completely toward us. After more than two hours of demanding a reason why our reservation was cancelled, they contacted their company office. They told us their office told them that since our credit card had an expiration date between the time our travel agent made our reservation and the time we were to stay in their hotel, when the card expiration date arrived, they cancelled the reservation. This was done with without notifying our travel agent or us, even though they had our full home and business contact information. Golden Tulip had even confirmed our reservation again before we left for Rome even though it no longer existed. Fortunately, a call to American Express resulted in us getting a room at a small boutique hotel on the opposite side of St. Peter's Square from where we had stayed two weeks earlier before embarking on our cruise. My wife and I learned four lessons: (1) Never stay at a Golden Tulip Hotel because, based upon our experience and opinion, a written confirmed reservation means nothing to them, and they won't attempt to correct their mistake. I wrote a complaint to their home office upon our return to the States and never heard back from them. (2) Make sure your credit card doesn't expire between the time you make a reservation and the date you travel. We had renewed our card with the same ID information automatically. There was no problem with any other part of our trip requiring prior reservations with the same card. (3) Advise your card issuer you will be traveling internationally and you do not want to have any problems with ANY ATMs. We did have some rejections of our card at overseas ATMS, while it worked fine at others. (4) Carry any American Express card. Their travel staff is always willing to assist you if you run into problems while traveling. They saved our great vacation from a bad ending. The hotel they placed us in at the last minute was outstanding, less costly than the Tulip Mecenate Palace, and closer to places we wanted to see. We will never stay in a Golden Tulip property.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cOk but Rooms are small\u201d", "Author": "hubbjay", "ReviewID": "UR20924455", "Content": "Hi Have just returned from Rome booked our hotel through priceline.

They get bookings off travel agents at the highest price, and discount online auction sites at the lowest. If you use the best-known discount auction site like I did, you should get a room for around 120 British Pounds a night. This is very cheap for a city offering very expensive accomodation at the 4-star level and above. + Some rooms are air conditioned (mine was). BUT judging from reviews, others arent. If you are travelling in summer, I would ask for A/C in advance of arrival. + The staff were friendly - particularly if you make it clear you are not American. Regardless, at 120 pounds, who cares if they are not?! + Location is fine. Centrally located and a short walk to clean streets/ tourist sites. - There definitely seems to be a theme where cheaper purchases get sidelined if tours/more expensive offers come in.

It was disappointing, therefore, when we arrived at the hotel, to be told that owing to their mistake they had no room for us. Allegedly, their booking agent had booked us in for three days from the 17th (the day of our departure) rather than the 14th. They were full, they said. However, they would arrange for us to stay in a four star hotel around the corner, at their expense. This arranged, the porter took us and our baggage to the alternative hotel. This alternative had pleasant rooms but virtually no other facilities. The breakfast room was windowless and there was a small lounge too. However, there was no bar and the roof terrace was closed. We re-grouped at a local bar to decide on our itinery for the day and whilst sitting there we saw the same porter take at least two other groups of people to the 'overflow' hotel! It seems someone had made a lot of mistakes......or had they? When we managed to get booked in the following day (no apology however!), we noted that there was a large tour group from the U.S. booked in. I suspect that their booking was received after ours and seemed a more attractive proposition, so we were bumped! For us, this was a really bad beginning to our holiday. We chose this hotel because of the location, the rooftop bar, the rooms and the good reviews. We didn't want to stay somewhere else. Anyway, when we did move in to the right hotel, the service was fine, the breakfast pleasant although not particularly varied in content and roof bar splendid early evening. Watch out for the price of cocktails though..... Nine euros each! We found Rome to be very pricey compared to other European cities, not helped by the current exchange rate of \u00a3 against Euro. Our great bargain was the Roma Card, 20 Euros for unlimited public transport for three days plus free entrance to two museums/sites.

In any event we had to schlep down the block to stay at another hotel for one night, which was a hassle even though a bellman helped us because we had a lot of luggage and a baby in tow. Another reason I suspect the hotel routinely overbooks is that while we were dining at the cafe next door one day, we saw the bellman carrying away the luggage of two other travelers who seemed to be going to the same hotel we were put in for one night.

The hotel is within walking distance to all the major sites. 1 minute from Santa Maria Piazza, 25 mins walk to the Colusseum, 1hr from Vantican City 20 mins from Spanish Steps (and the designer shops) and 25 mins from the Trevi Fountain It costs around 30 Euros in taxi back to the airport - which is good value I'd give this hotel 95/100 for value, location, cleanliness and the staff", "Date": "February 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiesbaden, Germany", "Title": "\u201cLOVELY in Every Way\u201d", "Author": "Rhine-and-Roses", "ReviewID": "UR12839806", "Content": "We stayed at the Mecenate Palace for MLK weekend of 2008. I cannot say enough how much we enjoyed our stay here. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, even though we clearly had managed to book this hotel far below the normal price. The room we were given was beautiful- really one of the prettiest, most elegant rooms I\"ve stayed in, although it was small. The walls were covered in fabric, the ceiling had beautiful woodwork, ceiling medallions, and a gorgeous chandelier. The draperies, headboard, and upholstery were all custom, opulent, and gave the room the feel of Versailles, without being over the top. But the best was yet to come. When I opened the window, which was small, I found a BIG view of the Maria Maggiore church. I couldn't believe my eyes! From that same window, we were treated to a bird's eye view of a Saints procession on Sunday. The soundproofing was excellent in the room- I did not hear the procession until I opened the window. The bathroom was dark marble, with double sinks, and a separate bath/tub/toilet/bidet area. Everything was incredibly clean, and hot water came quickly and did not run out. There were toiletries, although my ONLY complaint is the teeny tiny package of 3 tissues. (I'd prefer a full box, thank you!) The room had a safe, mini bar, and a coffee/tea service. There was a tiny flat screen TV, with lots of channels, including English, German, French, as well as Italian. The common areas of the hotel were as pretty as our room- lots of crystal chandeliers and beautiful paintings/ murals, and molding. The breakfast was included in the cost of the room and was in a rooftop, enclosed garden. The service was friendly. (Our waitress spoke a bit of English, fluent French, so we worked in French.) The food included rolls, pastries, yogurt, cheese, cold cuts (charcuterie), cereal, canned and fresh fruit, and more. For an additional 5-10 euro, you could also order a hot breakfast with eggs and ham. The rooftop restaurant is apparently opened part of the year, but not when we were there. We ate one evening in the tiny lounge downstairs. The food was good, but the \"menu\" was extremely limited, and it was really something more of a heavy snack than a light meal. I had turkey and potatoes for 12 euro, while my daughter had a bowl of salad (greens and a few vegetables) for 8 euro. I think the drinks were around 2.50. The neighborhood has a few cafes/bars/bistro. We could not find a real restaurant handy, but I confess we were tired and ended up happily in the hotel lounge. The hotel was an easy walk from the train station -about 4 blocks. The traffic was so heavy that I think it is faster to walk if you do not have a lot of luggage. The desk at the hotel booked us on Ciao Roma tours, which was a hop-on/off tour. It was fine, but I did notice there are several companies, so you might want to check and see if the other companies are more convenient for you. The Mecenate Palace desk staff were very efficient and helpful. They did offer to pick us up at the airport for 55 euro, but we had already booked the Leonardo Express train for 22 euro each RT. They also booked restaurants and other tours. Everyone's English was respectable. There was WiFI\\i access throughout the hotel, and a computer with internet and printer available for 3 euro per 1/2 hour by the lobby. The room had comfortable beds, a small (tiny!!) easy chair, a desk with chair, and a small table, as well as two night stands. The closets were fitted with drawers, plenty of hangers, a couple of extra pillows and blankets. There was no iron in the room. If you enjoy a romantic, lush look in a comfortable hotel, I highly recommend this hotel.

Have a drink on the roof and eat elsewhere. While the hotel was very nice, comfortable, clean, and the staff friendly, I think there are more charming neighborhoods to stay in in Rome. Some of the areas around the train station is very low class touristy. The hotel is about four blocks from the train station, which can be handy.

Having found this hotel from Frommers and after reading tripadvisor's ratings, finally selected the most expensive room in the hotel, the Virgilio suite. Upon arrival at the Termini, we had a rather stressful time locating the hotel since the Termini is such a massive building. Remember to look for the Termini's southern exit, and walk 4 blocks towards the Santa Maria Maggiore Church. Turn left upon seeing the Upim Dept store (at the corner) and cross the road to find the pink and grey coloured hotel. The suite is located on the roof top with a sitting hall, a bedroom and a huge terrace with sunbeds, table and chairs. The antique looking furnitures, fire place, sofa beds, two LG flat screen TV with English channels, free tea and coffee making facilities were good value for 350 euros, breakfasts and VAT included. However, we realised later that every Tom, Dick or Harry could have easily entered our suite through the huge terrace via a publicly accessed un-locked door! This is a serious breach of security, we thought. Though nothing bad had happened to us, but in Rome, we would really have second thoughts staying at the same suite again... Breakfasts served on the roof top terrace was very adequate and good in variety. But the quality of the food is merely of average quality. And from 28 October onwards, there is a one hour adjustment to the clock in Italy/Europe but we only found that out on the morning of 28 October. Had we been told about that upon check in the day earlier, we would be better prepared. Staff were generally courteous but not overly helpful nor enthusiastic, maybe its because we were staying for one night only? That said again, the good thing about staying here is the proximity to the Termini station (for easy and cheap transfer to Rome's Fiumicino airport), Epim supermarket right across the street corner and a taxi rank at the Santa Maria Maggiore church. Do allow at least 2.5 hours for departures at Fiumicino airport. The airlines'' check in counter can be quite long depending on season and the time of the day.

The room is probably italian standard if it comes to size so dont expect a large room. The bed is really just a double, not Queen or King size but it was OK for us. The bath is clean and bright and towels were there in abundance. After a shower the floor is very wet though since there is no shower curtain just a glass covering maybe a third of the tub. There is a minibar and a fridge and a coffeemaker with free coffee. The nights were quite but you could hear the noise made by the elevator which was adjoining our room. Breakfast is a little more than the usual italian job since you get toast, baguette, cheese, marmalade, mortadella, some kind of \"ham\", cereals and if you are there early enough you will find some fresh fruit. For an extra 4 Euro they even prepare an egg for you. The breakfast is served on a lovely terrace on the roof of the hotel and in the afternoon this terrace is a bar. We had a small local beer (at 6 EURO) some icecream from the hotel ice cafe and 2 glasses of tap water which they charged us 2 EUROS each for! The view may be nice and the staff friendly but the prices up there were just killing me. No wonder no-one but us was up there, a few people came to ask for a bucket of ice: they probably drank their glass of tap water in their rooms for free...;). The restaurants around there were typical tourist restos, nothing really special. We walked some 20 minutes to a \"Slow-Food\" resto called Tram Tram which has really excellent italian kitchen as reasonable prices (dont expect a 6 EURO pizza though). Will I go there again: not sure, location is excellent but I would probably try another hotel for my next trip.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "Beony", "ReviewID": "UR7854073", "Content": "The Hotel is ok.

Let me first say that this was our first trip to Italy, and the reviews here helped us so much in our trip planning- everything went off without a hitch! I booked this hotel based on the positive reviews I read here, and I was not dissapointed. We visited the \"Big-three\" of Italy: Rome-Florence-Venice. We arrived in FCO on May 6, and stayed for 3 nights at The Mecenate Palace. We left on May 9 for the rest of the trip, but returned and stayed for an additional night on May 16 for the night before our flight back home from FCO. Location: The location of the hotel was convenient and fairly close to Termini, about 4 blocks. Before I arrived I was slightly concerned about the location, because I read that the Termini area was a bad area. But it turned out to be okay. I guess I'm use to being in worse areas in New York City, you just have to get used to dodging beggars, pay attention to your surroundings and keep your hands on your purses, wallets, and your luggage. We were happy with the location because the hotel was close enough to Termini to be convenient for buses/trains/metro, and far away enough from Termini to be safe and comfortable. There were two cafes close by, there was a bank with ATM directly behind the hotel on Via Merculana, and there was a good-sized supermarket on Via Gioberti, about 2-3 blocks from the hotel. We walked to the Colosseum/Forum on our first day there from the hotel. (It is a long walk though, if you are not used to walking a lot). The rest of the time we either took the #64 bus from Termini to the sites, or took the Metro. If you don't feel like taking public transportations, the hop-on/hop-off bus is also available in front of the beautiful Santa Maria Maggiore church, which was on the left side of the hotel. Rooms: The rooms were nicely furnished with damask window drapes, marble bathroom and polished wood furnishings. The in room safe worked fine. Teas and coffee was complimentary in room, and we had a mini bar (but we never use the mini bar in hotel rooms anyway).Our room was a smallish size for the first 3 nights, but I guess normal for a city hotel room. We were okay with it but I can see some people might think it's too small. It was enough room for our luggage and we still had room to move around. The bathroom was marble and a decent size for European standards. I am a bath and beauty products nuts and I usually have a lot of bottles with me when I travel. The counter in the bathroom was spacious enough for all my stuff so I was happy about that. I was also pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer was actually strong enough to dry my long hair. There was a bathtub with shower, and also a handheld showerhead. There was a glass shower door, although the door only covers about 1/3 the length of the bathtub so the floors did get a little wet when we showered. When we returned to stay at the hotel for 1 night before our flight back, we were given an upgrade. This time the room was larger and they gave us bathrobes and slippers. The rooms were spotlessly clean. The sheets felt thick and I think had a pretty good thread-count (500 maybe?) The bed and pillows were comfortable, but the mattress was definitely firm. I happen to like firm mattresses, and I slept like a baby the whole stay. Staff: The staff were definitely well-trained and helpful. The front desk staff were polite and efficient. When they learned that it was our first time in Rome, they gave us a map and directions to the sites even before I asked. The bellmen and staff serving the breakfast were also courteous and they even smiled! Breakfast: The food was okay. They had a small selection of pastries, cold-cuts, breads, canned mixed-fruits, yogurts, cheeses. It was good the first day, but after 3 days I was a little bored. The coffee was very good though, it was dark, strong and well balanced, but not overbrewed and over-bitter like Starbucks coffee. You could order cappucino or espresso at an additional cost. Breakfast was served on the roof-top terrace which had a nice view.

Also every single street in Rome is cobbled which makes it really hard on your feet, so don't even think of wearing your stilettos girls! The cobbles also multiply the traffic noise, so the double-glazed windows at the hotel came very handy. The standard room is on a small size: you can walk around the bed and there is some space for a table with a TV and couple of chairs. Bathroom is small but adequate. The shower above the bath had an overhead tub which was useless, but the hand-held attachment was very good, although the water temperature varied at times. The room was clean and the bed quite comfortable. There is a terrace with lovely views of St Maria Maggiore, and top of the Coloseum, however you can't enjoy the view if you're sitting down because of the wall. They have a bar that serves drinks from 5PM.

I had read all the reviews on this website and I have to say that we were more than happy with our choice. The Mecenate Palace rooms were really nice, small compared to what you get in the US but perfectly adequate. We stayed in the main part of the hotel and had a room looking into the court yard so it was quiet. I personally thought that the bed we had was really comfy and had no problems sleeping at all. Breakfast in the mornings was good (Continental Breakfast), really liked their coffee and made for a good start to the day. Good view from the Terrace which was not open for breakfast when we were there as it was cold in the mornings. A lot has been said about the location but I have to say that I was happy, not too far to the Metro station (Vittorio Emanuele) at the bottom of the road and close to the Colosseum. We didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable walking around at night. As the hotel does not cover evening meals we managed to find a couple of nice restaurants not too far from the hotel. The first was called UNICOM (Restaurante Pizzeria), which is just past the basilica, turn left out of the hotel and follow the pathway around keeping the Basilica Santa Maria on your right as you walk round past the ROMA shop take the next left (Via Santa Maria Maggiore) and walk down the hill and it's the one with the piano in the window, they have a pianist on most nights which was a nice change from the piped music. The second one to try was called Trattoria Tinimo (or something like that). Directions are the same as UNICOM once here you will see a Galato shop across the road (Via Cavour) if you walk to the right of the Galato shop (not down Via Cavour) on the right hand side of that road on the up slope you should see some yellow down lights and this is the Tratoria. Lots of choice but had a lot of Sea food (not that I like Sea food) but there were other choices as well. In all got to see everything that we wanted to in Rome without having to rush anywhere. The open top tour bus was a good way to get an idea of all the main points on interest. I would use this hotel again if the coin in the fountain works. P.S. Don't forget to go into the Basilica it was really impressive and right on the doorstep. P.P.S If you intend to take an Audo tour - Vatican & Colosseum don't forget to take some ID.

We leave husbands, boyfriends and children behind for a break away with 'the girls' although this is not necessarily an accurate description of our age range! This year was Rome and it was fabulous. We arrived late Friday morning and it was lunchtime by the time we arrived at the hotel. As other reviewers have noted, there is no restaurant in the hotel but we found no problems with finding good value places to eat. We took a tour on the Open Top bus (number 110) from Termini that afternoon to get some idea of location and it certainly gave us a good taste of our Roman holiday. On Saturday we had decided to go to the Vatican but when we got there, trying to meet up with our guide from Angel Tours proved difficult as there was a special event happening in St Peters Square and it was thronged and various entrances had been blocked off by the police. One tip - it's worth checking with the hotel if they know of anything happening at the Vatican/St Peters. We had checked the Vatican website but this event wasn't mentioned. Still we eventually set off and did the usual lengthy wait to get into the Vatican museum but it's worth the wait - it really is spectacular. Our favourite was the Map Room - completely jaw-dropping. The Catholics amongst us enjoyed the Sistine Chapel as it had special meaning but the crowds don't make it much of a spiritual event. We had no trouble spending much of the day at the Vatican and St Peters. Sunday we explored the Colosseum, Forum, Palatine Hill, Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. Yes, we all tossed our coins - the fountain is quite a sight. Monday was the day for the Pantheon, Church San Giovanni in Laterano and some last minute shopping before flying home. We enjoyed a lovely meal in Ristorante Santi in the Via Mannin (about five minutes walk from the hotel) - a family run restaurant and really good value. We loved the hotel - it was in a great location across the road from the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore which is well worth a look. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We loved the happy hour in the bar as this set us up for our evening meal in the great restaurants in Rome. We used the Metro and the local buses - buy a day travel card for 4 Euros - great value and saves on queue time. We were all truly sorry to go home and we hope that our coin dropping in the Trevi will guarantee a return trip to this wonderful city.

Flew in to Campinio on the Saturday evening and returned home on the Monday evening. As previous reviews have mentioned, the Terravision bus service between Campinio Airport & the Termini Station in Rome makes everything very easy, although I must admit the organisation at the Termini stands for the return journey left a lot to be desired! The walk from the Termini station to the Hotel was only about 15 minutes - we did it with suitcases in the dark when we arrived, which was a little bit disconcerting, when you have no idea where you are - strange city and all that! We checked in and then met up to find somewhere for a meal! The guy on reception was great and recommended a lovely restaurant - now can't remember the name of it, but it was full of very depressed Welsh Rugby fans! He was more than willing to phone ahead and book for us, but we decided to just take our chances - luckily they had space for us all - just!! Food was good and service was friendly! Euros seem to go a long way in Rome - I was impressed! Breakfast in the hotel was just fine - good coffee and a decent enough continental selection - lots of pastries and donuts to keep my better half more than happy!! Fruit salad was out of a tin, which was a shame, but that's not the end of the world! Plenty of yoghurts to choose from and tinned Prunes, Pineapple, Peaches & Pears (all separate), along with various cereals.and butter/preserves/cheeses & cold meat. The Breakfast room/terrace was very nice, although Romes roof top views do very little for me personally - I know - I am a heathen! When you check in the hotel provide you with an excellent free map of Rome, which we found invaluable during our stay! There is another Metro station (Vittorio Emanuelle) even closer to the hotel than the Termini Station - only a couple of minutes walk - turn right when leaving the hotel reception! The area around the hotel is just fine (it didn't seem dodgy to us) - plenty of restaurants/bars/cafes and the Santa Maria Maggiore Church is just across the piazza from the hotel - some of our group had rooms facing the Church - lovely! We decided to walk on the first day - Colosseum and Palatine Hill/Roman Forum (they are very close to the hotel so we started there), followed by Trajan's Column, Torre Argentina (Roman Temple ruins with apparently over 200 cats living there and cared for by lots of cat ladies!), Piazza Navona & the Trevi Fountain - which is just a wonderful sight! We had lunch at a lovely restaurant just across from the Temple ruins at Torre Argentina - it was great - again I can't remember the name - I'm not doing very well at this am I?!) Once we'd seen the Trevi Fountain, my feet gave up the will to live - so while half our group crawled back to the hotel, the others went to the Spanish Steps! Met up again for a wonderful meal at another restaurant located just off the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore - stones throw from hotel (think it's called the Piazza Ristorante, but I could be wrong!). Food was gorgeous and again very reasonably priced with a happy, friendly and efficient waiter! Next morning, the hotel kindly stored our bags for us free of charge, while we went to the Vatican - by metro this time! The metro is great - 4 Euros gives you an all day pass - can't go wrong with that! One of our group caught a really bad cold and was really not well that morning (the previous days walking had taken its toll!), so for an extra 60 Euros, the hotel happily let him sleep in his room until late in the afternoon, when we dragged him out for a late lunch before we left for the airport! Lunch was conveniently at the cafe just next to the hotel - again great food and not expensive to sit in - we ate in their outdoor restaurant area - 22 degrees Celsius - lovely!) - 8 main courses (one of us was extra hungry!!) & 2 litre bottles of still water came to 82 Euros! I think, by the sound of things, it's expensive to sit in and simply have an ice-cream/coffee etc., but for a meal, it really is not bad at all and again the service was friendly and efficient! A quick tip for the Colosseum/Roman Forum and also the Vatican - keep your eyes peeled for people walking around offering English Speaking tours (can't remember the cost for the Colosseum/Roman Forum, but it was 40 Euros for the Vatican) - they are quite cheap and you skip the queue - worth it just for that!! I'm sure there must be tours for other languages, but obviously I wouldn't have spotted them - being linguistically challenged as I am! The company we used had their offices on Via Germanico - right next to the Vatican wall - again, being useless I can't remember their name, but they were great and made both the Colosseum/Roman Forum and the Vatican extremely enjoyable experiences - I think the 2-3 hr wait outside the Vatican would have polished me off for sure!! The tours themselves were very informative - 2 of our 3 tours (Roman Forum & the Vatican) were done by students who obviously had a lot of enthusiasm for their subject, although the Colosseum tour was a bit of a let down - the lady doing that one seemed to be simply repeating a script parrot fashion. Anyway - all in all - the hotel provided us with a very pleasant base for our whirlwind visit to Rome - our room wasn't huge, but it was very comfortable with an ensuite bathroom with bath tub/shower over, which was extremely appreciated at the end of that first day!! The bed was extremely comfy (I slept like a log!) and there was a safe in the room, along with mini bar and snacks - the prices were not that bad either! Internet access was very good - computer in reception was 3 Euros for half an hour - spot on for keeping in touch with home! There were telephones in the bedrooms and toiletries supplied in the bathrooms. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel's location is really not a problem - I felt safe walking back in the evenings and would be more than happy to stay there again if we ever head back to Rome in the future! If the hotel happen to read their reviews - 3 little requests: ** a couple of biscuits on the Tea/coffee tray would be nice ** the availability of some fresh milk for the tea/coffee in the bedrooms (only needs to be on request by guests), since the long life stuff was pretty dire! We did ask at reception, but none was apparently available, which I find very hard to believe (there was plenty at breakfast for the cereals!) - we were simply given more mini cartons - I think they missed the point of the original request! ** a long shot I know, but If it's possible - BBC news (World service?) on the TVs would be great. They had CNN, so I'm sure they might be able to manage BBC too!?

Very simple to arrive in the center and no problem to find the coach (for the coach : see the Terravision Company perhaps on the Internet. With Ryanair, the link is on their website.)

It's the biggest negative point of this hotel. Don't ask for a coffee or a hot chocolate... it's like boiled water!!! The staff speaks very loud inside the restaurant and all the time! One good thing : the restaurant (for breakfast only!) is on the top of the hotel. What a view! And it's possible to eat outside in summer! As I said, no restaurant for dinner! You have to reserve one at the reception. I can tell you 2 good restaurants in the neighbourhood: Trattoria Monti's (very close; a little restaurant with fresh food of the market!) or Tema, an italian restaurant at 5 minutes walk. The first one was full (find it on the Internet and reserve it!) so we tried the second one. Good! The waiter was very kind. Different touristic menus (22 - 28 -35\u20ac written in french or english!). Pay attention : in Italy the bread isn't free (5\u20ac just for bread without butter!!!)... don't accept it (of course, if you like dry bread...) For the tour of Roma: - You can take the \"trambus\" (see it on Internet) to make your tour - For the Vatican, take the subway early! You have to visit the Musei Vaticani... wondefull!!! Don't go to the museum by the St Peter's Cathedral, the official entrance is at the opposite side outside the Vatican walls. The queue is VERY big to enter but don't worry, you won't wait a lot, fast entry (many gates inside)! You want a free guided tour? Just wait and look after an english (or french) guided tour and follow it! There are a lot of guided tours for tourists groups all the time! No need of audioguide otherwise you'll stay 5 hours inside! The St Peter's Cathedral is easy to find after the museum and is closed later! - Subway : 1\u20ac for a single way. Attention! In the Termini you have both lines (A and B) but not at the same point! To go to the Vatican, you have to take the red line (A). The entrance is on your left when you put Termini behind you. You'll find a ticket machine inside. If you come back to the hotel, don't exit in Termini but in Victor Emmanuelle station just at the end of the hotel's street! - For the Colosseum, the queue is enormous! Take a combo ticket for the Palatin/Colosseum in the Palatin entrance (no queue!) and so, no queue for you at the Colosseum!!! GREAT! You'll win 30-60 minutes!!! Take an audioguide (1 for 2 is enough!) just after the entrance on your right. - St Angelo Castle was fine. Great view at the top of all the city! The tour we've made in two days? Day 1 : Musei Vaticani - St Peter Cathedral - Piazza Navona (lunch) - Pantheon - Fontana di Trevi - Piazza di Spagna - Piazza del popolo (superb!) and subway there to go back to the hotel Day 2 : Foro Romano (free! If you don't have a touristic guide, take an audioguide at the entrance of Palatin close to Titus Arch) - Palatin (take the combo for Colosseum!) - Colosseum - Piazza Venezia (unknown soldier) - St Angelo Castle - free time for shopping...

We moved into the Virgilio Suite when our daughter & son in law arrived. The balcony is enormous & the tub has a jacuzzi. The suite is beautifully furnished, but honestly 4 people is a bit cramped.

We booked this room based on Trip Advisor, & Frommer's reviews and the location. This was all of our first trip to Rome except my wife that came for a meeting a few months prior. Our room was a triple and I would say that it was a little larger than a cruise ship cabin. My in-laws room was a double & I would say that it was about the same size as a cruise ship cabin. The bathrooms are nice, not cruise ship bathrooms. The rooms were very quiet. Our room faced an inner courtyard and there was no traffic noise whatsoever. It wasn't even bad with the window open. My in-law's room faced the main street and he said that with the windows closed it was very quiet. Breakfast was included with our room. It is located on the top terrace and is buffet-style. Selection is canned fruits, cereals, a couple of meat selections, pastries and breads. It is OK but it kind of got tiresome after a few days. The selection does not change. Don't forget, you can order cappucino with breakfast. The temps would be in the high 60's during the day and low 50's to high 40's at night. We & the inlaws were always warm in the room. We had to open the windows to cool off. I don't know if americans are hot or something, but a lot of Romans looked like they were expecting snow storms. We were always taking our jackets off and walking around in shirt sleeves trying to cool off. Apparently the hotel turns off the air conditioning system in the fall & winter. Thank God you can open the windows at this hotel. The front desk personnel are not overly friendly, but they will help if you ask for assistance. Don't ask them to get transportation to or from the hotel. Make these arrangements yourself. My father-in-law & I had to go back to the airport to get our luggage (this is because US Airways SUCK!) and the front desk person said that he would arrange a van to bring us back to the hotel for E75. Well later in our trip we found a sign for an airport shuttle and called them a got a van to carry 5 people and luggage for E50. I think the front desk guy made a few extra bucks I read the reviews before we left about how the cafe on the corner is a rip-off. I would like to dispute that. That's the way all cafes & bars are in Rome. They charge for \"table service\". If you go to the bar and order a cappucino and drink it standing up at the bar it is E0.90. If you sit down at a table it's like E5.00. If you notice, you will see locals come in and order drinks and drink them at the bar and then leave. We stopped at a pastry shop and ordered desserts and cappucinos and sat down at a table and then when we paid the bill it was more than we just paid for our dinners. We learned that lesson. The location is not too bad. You can walk to the Colosseum and the ruins from here. The Termini station is a short walk and this is the worst part. If you plan to use the Metro for transportation a better alternative is to come out of the hotel and turn right and walk to the Vittorio Metro stop. It's actually shorter walk than Termini & you don't walk around drug deals, drunks & prostitutes. And believe me, you will walk by all of these things, especially at night going to & from Termini. The hotel is across the street from one of the major tourist sites. The basilica Santa Maria Maggiore. This is one of the vatican churches. Some of the hop-on hop-off buses stop here so you can buy a tour pass right there. One of the main hop-on hop-off buses, the 110 Trambus, does not stop there. The closest stop is Termini. If you read about pickpockets in Rome we can attest that it is true. My wife was robbed on the Metro. They cut a 6-inch gash in her purse and stole her wallet. She didn't even know until about 30 minutes later. This was on Wednesday, the day of the papal audience, on the Metro heading to the vatican. The Metro was jam-packed and ripe for pickpockets. We got cocky & paid the price, follow the suggestions about carrying valuables. Bottom line; would we stay there again? I believe so.

We arrived at our hotel jet lagged, hungry and traumatized by Roman driving. I thought how strange it was that I was going to get a passport, finally leave South Louisiana, only to die on a Roman highway strapped to the top of a smart car. We arrived at approximately 11:30 a.m. Two of our rooms were ready and the third would be ready shortly. Check in was efficient and without any problems. We were given rooms in the residence which is steps away from the Main Hotel and up two flights of stairs. This wasn\u2019t a problem for our party although I don\u2019t think there was a lift in that building. Actually, since there was a gelato shop betwixt the hotel and the residence, the stairs probably kept us from gaining weight. The rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated in a modern style. There was a wall unit with dresser drawers, and a closet with ample storage space. There was a safe in the room. Okay, for some reason we, my partner and I, couldn\u2019t operate the safe. No one else in our party of six had this problem so it\u2019s safe to assume that WE were the problem. However, every time, and I think we called 4 times, that we called to have the safe re-set, someone was sent, promptly and without any commentary (which probably was due). They were very professional and understanding. Of course we tipped them generously. Air Conditioning. Big perk for me. The rooms had climate control which you could adjust by 2 degrees either way. For anything greater, you simply had to call the front desk and they would make the adjustments.s The front desk, depending on who was working was either Great or great. The only difference is/was one personality whom we affectionally referred to as \"The Emperor\". Although the service was still stellar he was very different in his approach to guest services. His attitude was more \"you are here for MY pleasure\". Very amusing on hindsight. We had a King which was two twin beds pushed together. I knew this going in but somehow I thought they joined the beds so that you wouldn\u2019t fall through the middle. At any rate, the beds aren\u2019t joined so any \u201ccrossing of the zone\u201d ended in a Lucy and Ricky sort of comedy routine. The Bathroom was tiled in a beautiful maroon tile. Spacious, toilet and Bidet (I sooo don\u2019t get this), Huge Jacuzzi tub with two, count them, two shower heads. Heated towel racks, great products (luved the bath salts), and a hair dryer (which you had to hold down a button to keep on \u2013 a little strange but it worked). The scale in the bathroom weighs in stones and kgs. I think I\u2019m a quarry! Every day the room was cleaned, the sheets changed (I didn\u2019t think anybody did this every day) and any amenities replaced. Our housekeeper was a darling who did a fantastic job. Breakfast was served on the rooftop terrace of the Main hotel. The panoramic views were astonishing. The food was plentiful and good. Cheeses and meats and pastries, yogurts, cereals and the like. Fresh fruits, coffee, juices. Hot food was available for purchase off of the menu. The hotel is located about 3 blocks from the Termini and about 4 blocks down to the Vittorio metro stop. The neighborhood closer to the hotel is great. . However the closer you get to the Termini the more quirkier it got. One additional perk is that there is a supermarket right across the street and downstairs. Great for perusing and purchasing inexpensive pastas and wines and such.

We had a slightly rocky start to the visit - on arrival the reception said that a guest had broken a leg and so had to remain in the hotel beyond their booking, and they asked us to share a single room for two nights after which they could offer us the second room that we had booked. Genuine, or overbooking ? You decide. Typical British, we reluctantly agreed to accept using one room, but in fairness to the hotel they gave us a huge room in the Residence (50m along the street from the main hotel) which had been set up with a double and two single beds, and dropped the price for the two nights we shared. For the following three nights we had a second room also in the Residence. The rooms in the Residence are very well furnished - I guess they exceed the three star specification of the main hotel. Based upon website photos I'd say the furnishings are more modern in styling than the main hotel as well, but with bath robes, toiletries, haridryer, tea & coffee making facilities, TV with satellite channels, air conditioning and safe, there wasn't much missing. Breakfasts were as described elsewhere on this website - no shortages on quantity, hot food if you want to pay the extra. The rooftop venue was nice, the view of St Maria Maggiore impressive, the other rooftops less so. Reception & restaurant staff were all helpful and most spoke English well. One minor adverse comment - although there's a control for air conditioning in the bedroom, for some reason the hotel seems to have overidden it so that only reception can make changes. In our opinion the temperatures were much cooler than the displayed temperature (perhaps it was just the force of the air flow) but we had several attempts to get reception to adjust it and ended up asking for it to be turned off in one of the rooms.", "Date": "September 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cA gem!\u201d", "Author": "SpinMamma", "ReviewID": "UR5782770", "Content": "We were very pleased with our stay at this excellent hotel.

To the center (Trevi, P.di Spagna)-take bus no.71 from Santa M.Maggiore to P.San Silvestro.If you stay in Rome for more then 2 days - buy a ticket for several days- much cheeper and you do not have to look for Tobbaconist shops where you can buy it- since only several buses had the automat for tickets.Validate your tickets! Vatican and Borghese gallery tickets must be booked in advance!(www.galleriaborghese.it, www.vatican.va).On Vatican sire you can also book a guided tour so you wont need to wait on the enterance- costs 21 eur ticket included.Termini station is very confusing- so on your way to Fiumicino be prepared- be early.

Save yourself a lot of time by booking here, I stayed here with 20+ family members for my wedding and after extensive research took a chance and booked this hotel and it exceeded all of our expectations. Firstly the hotel is very modern and comfortable which I found to be very difficult to find in Rome unless you pay crazy money.I stayed in a suite because we had 2 kids with us and it was very nice, we did have a look at the superior rooms and they were also very nice, well furnished and roomy enough.The location is pretty good, this was one of my main concerns when booking but I can say that it is as central to the sights as any other hotel the metro is on your doorstep although we used taxis everywhere (never paid more than 6-7 euro around the city). The staff we found to be very efficient, this is a wierd one because at the start I found them to be quite cold and unwelcoming (bordering rude) but I think this is just the Italian attitude, anytime we asked for anything they were very efficient, we even had the neck to ask for breakfast one day at 12.30 (it was a late night previously) because the kids were starving and the guy on reception opened the bar and phoned one of the staff to bring down something for us. Well the girl im sure wasnt too happy but she put on a smiley face and sorted us out with everything and was still pleasant, needless to say we were hughely impressed as we didnt expect them to do anything and only asked for cereal for the kids. We had our reception in another hotel and we regretted having left this super hotel as we were let down badly, we were even more disappointed when we seen the roof terrace because it would have been perfect. This hotel is great value for what you get, rooms are faultless - spacious modern and kept spotless. Breakfast is not the full english but where is in Rome, as continentals go its as good as any (roof terrace is a hugh bonus). Staff are extremely efficient, dont confuse the cold welcome as rude or ignorant thats just the way they are - efficient.

This was my 6th trip to Italy and love the country. The hotel itself is beautiful and in an excellent spot. The roof deck at night is perfect. The problem is the staff.

No reason was given. They made no attempt to help. Treated us as if we were a problem even asking about it. The assistant manager said to me \"I was robbed in NYC I don't complain to you about it\" -Several reports of staff entering the room at odd hours with no apparent purpose. -7 of the rooms AC's didn't work, never fixed nor resolved -5 of the TV's didn't work, never fixed nor resoived -Elevator down for a day, which was a significant problem since my 70 year old mother ,who recently had a knee replaced, was staying in a 'handicapped accessible' room on the 4th floor. Again only gave us attitude when asked when it would be up and running. I was told to take the stairs. -Odered 50 person bus for day of wedding, a 20 person bus showed up, we had to call 7 taxi's to take remainder of guests to the wedding. No refund. -3 toilets broke, 2 never fixed, were given buckets to flush. -The rooms were generally extremely small but manageable. -The same roof deck bar tab was charged to 4 different rooms -My brothers credit card, which he only used at this hotel, was used to purchase stereo equipment in Italy. Not his purchases. PROS -Great location, good restaurants and easy walk to sites. -Great roof deck/breakfast area.

When we arrived there was no taxi we rang them up and asked where it was they said that we will have to wait 20 minutes. We ended up arranging our own and it worked out alot cheaper. 2) we arrived at the hotel, the doorman did not help us with our bags, we noticed that he was quite selective on who he did and did not help. 3) The first guy behind the reception desk was not only rude to us but not at all helpful instead he said that the rooms were not booked, after a few motion he said that there was room in teh annex we had specifiaclly said that we wanted the rooms in the hotel, but we had got to a stage where we just want to sleep.

It wa just annoying that we had to write something in order for the matter to be dealt with 2) We didnt see teh first guy that was behind the reception again has he was off duty so we delt with another guy we was very helpful. 3) Being in both room i would say if possible go for the annex there is nothin wrong with the actuall hotel rooms but teh annex is much more mordern and the shower alot better. and it is literally a minute walk from the hotel.

We had booked 4 nights, beginning Nov. 25 through the 29th--3 of them through Hotels.com and the other a direct reservation. Due to an Italian Railway strike on the 25th, and an illness of my traveling companion, we decided to stay in Florence an extra night. When I called the Mecanate Palace at 11:00 a.m. to explain that we would not be arriving until the 26th, I was informed any cancellation had to be given 20 hours in advance (hotel policy); and thus I would have to pay for the night of the 25th. I agreed and confirmed our arrival on the 26th for a stay through the 29th. Yet when we arrived at the hotel at 3p.m. the next day (check-in time) we were informed that there wasn't a room for us with twin beds, because it was Hotels.com policy to cancel the reservation if we didn't arrive. So we had to (1) pay for a night we were not there, and (2) stay in a substandard room. The next night they moved us to a room with twin beds, but the bathroom leaked, and they didn't even separate the twin beds--we had to rearrange the furniture ourselves. Throughout our stay the hotel desk staff was surly, uncooperative and unctious. We were not so much as offered an apology. I was told they had to have a credit card number to hold the reservation--but they DID have my credit card number for the night of the 28th! And they did not ask for a credit card number when I called to inform them we would be arriving a day later. They claimed they upgraded our rooms when they moved us--well, I'd like to see what a so called \"standard\" room looks like. And when I left, they refused to give me a receipt for the stay! Whatever we said--in our best and most civil voices--we were made to be in the wrong. I just wanted the nice room I was paying for from the beginning.

We were upgraded to a superior room looking out at the Santa Maria church - lucky for us. This had advantage of balcony - not that we used it other than for a photo opportunity. Room was excellent - a bit heavy on the chintz bedspread! But really high quality furnishings. Bed was a bit hard, but overall, I have no complaints about the hotel. TV in room with mainly foreign channels - BBC world & odd English programme on foreign MTV channel. If you sad like me & like TV, it is worth considering taking a portable DVD player for those moments when you are not eating / sight seeing. Lovely breakfast on roof terrace - fantastic viewing area. Weather was lovely! About 75 to 80 degrees farenheit at hottest point. But cooler at night - long sleeves weather. Not sure if this is representative though. We took an umbrella each, but did not need it. I do understand what people meant by the area now - the termini area is a bit rough. But the hotel is well out of this. It is very convenient if you are getting dropped off by Terravision. Do not worry about the location it is ideal for sights & seemed safe enough, except for the lunatics on mopeds - they do not know what a stop sign means. You take your life in your hands everytime you cross the road in Rome! The hotel is near a tube if you are feeling lazy. We caught the tube to the Vatican as it seemed a bit far & with all the walking you do when you get there. I would recomment very comfortable shoes!! I cannot emphasis this highly enough. The Santa Maria church is lovely & right infront of the hotel. Good choice of restaurants in nearby vicinity - mainly pizza & pasta (but then you are in Italy!). Sights of Rome were awesome. Loved them all. We were told to get to the Vatican museum early, which we did (9am) & queue was still heaving. I have never seen a queue like it (around 1/2 mile & five+ people deep) - no joke. So we went into St. Peters for 1 hour or so & after this, the queue to Vatican museum had vanished! Beware people offering to get you in with no queue for 40 or so euros, as the queue disappears later (it is only 12 euros to get in). Personally I found the colleseum disappointing inside & expensive considering (10 euros each), but I heard other people loved it & said it was the highlight - so maybe you should ignore me. Have a look in a guidebook at a picture of what is inside - if this appeals to you go in, if not save your money - I thought it was much more impressive on the outside. We had no incidents of theft during our visit, but personal security is of upmost importance in Rome, as I have heard loads of bad reports about this sort of thing. In summary, great hotel - it deserves to be in trip advisor top twenty hotels in Rome & I think is an ideal choice for a stay. Hotel is a four star & I would not argue with this. Superb location & fantastic sight seeing. Hope this helps. Ps. Incidentally we were looking for a supermarket & had trouble finding one - they don't seem very common in Rome for some unknown reason - perhaps we were oblivious to them!

We'd found the hotel through this site and were a little anxious as reviews we'd seen in recent weeks had been a little luke warm. We needn't have worried. From the moment we saw the classy exterior of the MP and walked into its wonderfully cool marbled lobby, we were sure we'd made the right decision. The staff were real professionals who spoke excellent English and who warmed to us when we tried our best to ask for our room key in broken Italian - and they remembered us with a warm smile every time we returned. The room wasn't huge but it was very cool - we didn't once need to put on the air conditioning despite 80+ heat outside. We were on the second floor in the front of the building (with a view to the side of Santa Maria Maggiore). It had a mini bar (where we stored cans of our own coke) and it had tea and coffee making facilities (but no milk - although if we'd have thought of it we could have bought some of our own and stored it in the mini bar). The bathroom was elegant marble with free soap, shampoo, bath foam, a comb, shoe cleaner, shower cap and tissues. There is a wall hairdryer. The shower was nice and fierce. The terrace was open for breakfast when we went and it was a joy to eat there. It's all in the shade so you don't bake in the early morning sun. The food was good - fresh pastries and rolls, yoghurt, apples, fruit juice, ham, cheese - oh, and my partner was especially pleased to find coco pops! The location is fine. A Metro just down the road (although after our first horrendously crowded trip we avoided it like the plague and stuck to buses or foot power) and a five minute walk from Termini train station. It's a bit daunting at first to see so much graffiti and rubbish everywhere but actually this is not just something you find in this area - it's all over Rome. A pity. But we never once felt threatened or intimidated here and never had any trouble with pickpockets. Across the road and to the left is a supermarket (Supermercado) - it doesn't look like one - you have to go downstairs to shop. We didn't find this till later in the trip, instead walking to a Chinese store down the road to buy snacks and cans of drink. Our total holiday cost was 359 pounds which included a return flight from Birmingham which cost about 100 pounds making each night of our five night stay about 50 quid a night! An unbelievable bargain for a four star hotel. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel and am very grateful to all the excellent reviews from others in the past that led us to choose this hotel.

Prior to our stay here we travelled all over Italy and stayed in four hotels that we loved. So we knew how nice the Italian people are and how were the other hotels and that there was no excuse for how the staff at the Golden Tulip Mecenate Palace Hotel treated us. When my wife, eleven year old daugther and I arrived to the hotel no one would help us with our luggage, there were revolving doors that we could not use with our luggage, and the regular door was locked. After several unsuccesful attempts of trying to open the locked door (while the staff looked through the glass windows motionless) someone finally came and unlocked the door without saying a word in a completely rude manner. After we checked in, the bellboy took our luggage and walked out the door into the street ??? and asked us to follow him. He walked down the sidewalk and finally stoped about three doors down in front of this unappealing, old and plain looking residential building. Went up the steep stairs, (about twenty of them) no elevator of course, and opened a door. There was a guard sitting next to it and there was a hallway with many other doors. The bellboy then opened the first door on the right (next to the guard ) and directed us to the room. I could not belive it, what in the world was this?, I mean the room was decent and clean, but this was not the hotel!!! This was a room in some other building with no lobby, no restaurant, no facilities other than my room! This was definitely not what I have booked. I went back to the reception (in the real Mecenate Palace Hotel) and asked to be moved and the receptionist told me that they were fully booked and that there was nothing he could do. Then he actually tried to convice me that my room was the hotel, that it was the same thing as staying in the hotel building. This person showed no concern or respect whatsoever and it seemed as if he was used to listening this kind of complaints and he just didn't care. I don't know what they call that in the Mecenate Palace Hotel, but in this country we call it lying to the public, false representation, and it is heavily fined. We were tired from our long vacation in Italy so we decided to forget about it and enjoy our last day in Rome. Like if that wasn't enough, the guard next to our room kept talking on the phone and the sound insulation was so bad that it sounded like if he was inside our room. I asked him in a polite manner to lower his voice and he did, for about 15 minutes, then he started talking again. Every time he talked or walked or moved the chair, he disturbed our sleep. It was a sleepless night. The Termini area is a uninteresting, impractical side of town to stay in. It is filled with budget hotels, mediocre restaurants with rude staff on the average. The first days of our trip we stayed in the Spanish Steps area and if you are a tourist this is the place to stay. It is packed with restaurants, designer shops of all kinds, very picturesque small, pedestrian streets were you can do plenty of walking around. This is not the case in Termini, you will need subways or ground transportation all the time.

The hotel's location was great for the Termini Station which was a five minute walk, though I wouldn't recommend walking to/from the station at night as the surrounding area didn't feel that safe.

It is important to us to be near transportation when staying in a city, and this Hotel met that requirement, with the train station, Metro three blocks away and a Taxi stand right across the street. (Most places in Italy one cannot hail a cab from the curb) Once we were checked into the room, we found it to be quite nice and comfortable. Most sites are walkable from the Hotel and the Santa Maria Maggiore, a landmark church in Rome, is right across the street and worth seeing. (For you Dan Brown fans \"Angels and Demons\", there is surprise in this church. Hint: it's in one of the stained glass windows) The weather was beautiful and the rooftop breakfast had the best selection and quality of items during our two-week stay in Italy, which included Sorrento, Florence, and Venice. The staff in the breakfast terrace was very nice and attentive. Eugenio, the bellman (and general do-everything person) is a great guy and very helpful.

Got a great rate of 130 EUR a night for a double room including breakfast - which for a 4 star hotel in Rome is very good (book online.)

Also very convenient - 5 mins away from Termini with great trains, buses, taxis, metros. Location 10/15 mins stroll from the main Ancient sites (Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Forum etc) and 15/20 mins from Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain etc. 45 min walk to Vatican so advise take Metro from Termini, then walk back via the Centro Storico sites! Take good shoes and walk everywhere (and it's nicer that way - there are loads of random bits of Roman building that aren't in guide books that you just fall over when you walk anywhere!) * breakfast great - all you can eat & drink - tea/coffee/juice, yoghurt/cakes/pastries, bread/rolls/crackers plus cold meat, cheese, jams/marmalade, Nutella, selection of cereals... the list goes on. As long as you're not looking for a Full English, you'll be happy. * hotel was very clean and well decorated with lovely rooms. * reasonable selection of inhouse TV channels including BBC World and CNN in English language - also Italian obviously plus French and German channels. * rooms are perfectly adequately sized - unless you're American and are used to massive warehouses to sleep in, in which case you might find the rooms a bit small. * bathrooms lovely with great water pressure in the shower! and a really cool night light thing where if you get up to pay a visit in the light, you can turn on a really dim light that lets you see what you're doing without waking up properly! * streets are indeed a bit noisy but the double glazing blocks this out fine. * all the staff were lovely to us. Example: our flight was delayed so we arrived at almost midnight on a Friday but they cheerfully took our order for pizzas and salad in the bar, even though they were supposed to close in 5 minutes. The check-in staff were also really good. * if you're British, it's a really great thing to have not just coffee but also tea making facilities in the room - although you might want to buy some milk instead of the creamer! * the mini bar prices are on the cheaper side of average for a hotel - although particularly for the snacks and soft drinks, you might want to pay a visit to the supermarket across the road rather than pay EUR2 for a packet of peanuts! Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone going to Rome - I just don't see the point in paying twice the amount just to get a slightly larger room or a slightly more central hotel (but that's obviously up to you.)

The staff is professional and courteous, and the rooms are very nicely appointed, though the carpets were a bit dingy, but acceptable. The bathrooms are large and have double sinks, but one problem is that there was only a half shower door, so each time we took a shower, the water got everywhere! The room itself is compact by American standards, but it is not at all problematic. We got a room on the top floor with a gorgeous view of the Santa Maria Maggiore Piazza. However, I am not really sure about what the view is like on the other side of the building. There is a continental breakfast every morning with breads, spreads, and some ham, and it is pretty good. The location is not central, but it is a 15-20 minute walk to the Colosseum. The main train station (Roma Termini) is about 5 minutes away, and there is a metro stop that is just a few steps away. The metro can take you very close to most of the major sites such as the Vatican and the Spanish Steps, so its location is not much of a problem. Also, the neighborhood is not nearly as creepy as other reviewers may have you believe. Some nice conveniences in the neighborhood include a nice laundrymat with good service just a few blocks down cavour towards the Colosseum (those who like to pack light and don't like hotel prices for cleaning services will love this), a grocery store across the street (cheap drinks and eats), and many internet and telephone points scattered around.

My son felt uneasy too. That pizzeria had a queue half way down the block and we ended up at possibly the nastiest restaurant in Rome, a block the other way, toward the railway station which promised Pizza Al Forno Legno (real wood fire). It had something to do with Sardegna I think, in the title, just avoid it. Also, the hotel has next to no room service, so be prepared. Only a few cold plates.

The AC will turn it into an icebox if you want! The pillows were a little hard but that's probably my biggest complaint. The location is actually great. It's about a 10 minute walk, maximum, to 2 different metro stations and the Termini where a large number of buses leave from. We were able to go all over Rome and even outside of Rome very simply from this location. It's not a great location immediately next to the hotel, sure, but it's in no way unsafe, and there are a few decent little restaurants. The Estrella (sp?) near Termini was quite charming, for example. But it's hardly a big deal to take public transportation and the buses will get you to Campo de Fiori or Vatican City or anywhere you want very quickly. We walked to Campo de Fiori a few times - if you're here for a vacation, walking is the way to go. The breakfast every morning is fantastic - the rooftop buffet was a GREAT way to wake up with a coffee and a continental breakfast. The rooftop bar isn't much in the evenings, but if the weather is nice it's a good place to have a quick little pre-dinner or after-dinner drink.

We easily walked with our toddler in a stroller from the Pantheon--one of the furthest sites. It's about 7-10 euros if you need to take a taxi. Secondly, the area is not bad at all. True, it's not located in the high fashion district, but the neighborhood is authentic Rome. We found quite a few excellent restaurants within 500 yards of the hotel (try Le 2 Colonne next to the Maria Maggiore church for a terrific family restaurant).

As for the hotel, we splurged for the Orzio suite on the top floor--a two room suite separated by a hallway with a huge double bath and jacuzzi tub/shower (190 euros per night). The room was amazingly quiet with fabric covered walls and double windows. The hallway was perfect for separating the bedroom from our toddler's room. The breakfast was nice, but as noted by others, lacking in hot food. The service was friendly. All-in-all, the hotel, while not perfect, was a superb value for the money. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "February 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel but avod the food & drinks!\u201d", "Author": "StyleTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR1664514", "Content": "Five minutes walk from the Coliseum which is a great starting point for a long circular walk with all key sights (except the Vatican) easily do-able in a long day.Nice lobby, nice staff some of whom speak no or bad English.

We got a great deal on both a single and double room and felt it was a great value. The staff (esp. Roberto) was very friendly and accommodating, and the breakfast included was definitely a bonus! The rooms, although small, were quiet, neat, clean and quite charming. The location may be inconvenient for some, however, it is very close to a Metro stop, which we used to get almost anywhere with ease. Also, Termini rail station is only 3 blocks away, which has a train that runs to and from Fuimicino airport every 1/2 hour, way less expensive than taking a taxi (and probably faster). In short, our experience at the Mecenate was very positive and we would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "January 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Saint Louis, MS", "Title": "\u201c12.29.03 - 01.04.04\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1614209", "Content": "My husband and I stayed there for our honeymoon. We arranged for their helpful taxi service and were picked up promptly at the airport. The guy picking us up was really nice and had a big sign that had our names on it. When we arrived at the hotel, we were pretty excited with the lobby. The rooms were a little on the small side, not bad for us since we're small peoople. Beforehand, I emailed them and asked for a room with a view. We had a corner room on the fourth floor overlooking the SM and the side street. It was gorgeous! We set up our little table in front of the window facing the SM and had a little cafe table. Very cute. The bathroom was also very nice and they had a safe in the room as well and they had robes and new towels every day. I think they clean your room like 4 times a day! The supermarket, which was right around the corner is a good place to get some inexpensive wine, cheese, and meat. And, if you go down Via Panispermia (pretty safe too) its not but a ten minute walk max to the Vittorio Emmanuele. I don't suggest any of the restaurants around the Esquilino hill, very expensive and not great. And make sure the cab driver doesn't screw you, just be aware. We didn't go near the termini at all. We walked the whole time or took the taxi. Anwyays, I would suggest the Mecenate Palace. Everyone was very helfpul there. If you can get a hotel near the Piazza Navona and Campo D'Fiori area, even better so you don't have to walk so much, but with all the eating we did, it was probably better we stayed where we did. Also, the Lets Go Rome book is wonderful!!! And try the Pizza at Pizzeria Bafetto on Governo del Vecchio (it doesn't open til like 7 p.m. though).", "Date": "January 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1554103", "Content": "We stayed at the Mecenate 1/8-1/14/04. The staff and hotel are fabulous. The rooms are well appointed and are very comfortable and quiet, with all the amenities you would want from a 4 star. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful - from the check-in, porter, bartender, breakfast staff, etc - they were all very nice. The only thing to keep in mind is the location. There is a grocery across the street, and a metro about 10 minutes walk down the street. But you need to do a good 20 minute walk to go down to the ruins, or to get up to Spanish Steps/Trevi Fountain areas. The poor metro system and spontaneous strikes made the metro a very poor choice, so expect to walk a lot or taxi it from/to the hotel. Otherwise, a great place to stay, within a five minute taxi ride to Termini station.

Of course there are more elegant and grander hotels in the city but you simply have to consider what you want.

Extremly clean, up-to-date with good air-conditioning or heating, comfortable beds, slippers. bathropes, good-sized marble bath rooms and if you are lucky some rooms offer a wonderful view of the impressive Church of Santa Maria Maggiore or with nice little balconies. Service: We received extremely friendly service. No matter if you addressed a request to the bellman, the check-in staff, the maid or the breakfast (rooftop breakfast room with a panoramic view) staff everybody was helpful and serviced with a smile. Especially the front desk staff did an extremly good job with recommendations for tours or restaurants. They will not send you to overprices tourist traps!!! Location: Safe area, far enough from the main railway station - right at one of Romes major Churches: Santa Maria Maggiore. About 20 minutes by foot to Trevi Fountain or Spanish Steps and major shopping. Easy subway access (station is right down the street).
