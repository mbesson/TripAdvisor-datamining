Was surprised at how close the hotel was to everything...down the street, cross the road and walk through a small side street and turn the corner to see Trevi Fountains all lit up the first night we got there...then a quick walk to the pathenon and then pizza navorna......also up the street and around the corner is the metro......the staff were extremely friendly allowing me to use their internet anytime, breakfast was great, lots of selection. We eventually returned to the hotel for two more nights at the end of our Italian vacation. Both times, we were housed in the annex, which is next door. First time 3rd floor which gave us a great workout as we did not use the elevator. Second visit on the 1st floor. Both rooms were spacious with a good size bathroom. The rooms are typical older Italian style but when in Rome (or italy)......this was a fabulous trip with sunny days every day, even for November....I would highly recommend this hotel if you are not expecting 5 star amenities.

The hotel was recommended to me by family, and I have since recommended it to others. The hotel was in a great location - on a quiet street, just a 5 minute walk from the Trevi Fountain. We stayed in the family suite, which was very clean and large enough to accommodate us comfortably. The breakfasts were delicious and the staff members were courteous and helpful. The one and only fault I can make is in relation to the hairdryer; I thought it was a bit old and lacked power. But this was a minor issue. Domus Julia is not a luxury hotel, but it's clean and comfortable and represents great value for money.

The Domus Julia is clean, tidy and very comfortable. The room was functional and attractive enough & air conditioned. The bed was was comfy and our room was quiet. Plenty of piping hot water for showering etc. We found the staff to be very friendly and good humoured-they are available at the front desk 24/7, should you need them and spoke good English. They are able to book day trips for you and provided a very helpful map of the city and leaflets about travel options. Breakfast was good, offering a range of pastries, cereal, meats, cheeses and beverages. The location was absolutely suberb! The Barberini Gallery is at the top of the street and Piazza Barberini is a two minute walk away (a metro station is located there which links to Vatican, Colosseum, Termini station, etc and is very easy & safe to use). It is a 10 minute walk to both the Trevi Fountain and The Spanish Steps, and there are plenty of bars and restaurants at hand (which is not the case in every area).

The room was spacious, clean, well furnished, air conditioned and comfortable. The street below was noisy but with the window closed at night it was not a problem. The bathroom was also spacious. Our only complaint was that the shower head in the tub/shower was located on the back wall not an end wall (uncomfortable and hard to use) and there was some unpleasant mildew around the tub. There was an elevator, although it was an easy climb up the stairs, and we are in our early 70's. The room looked exactly like the photo in the brochure. There was also a safe located in the armoire, and a little frig. The location on Via Rasella was perfect in every way for our 4 nite stay ( 150 Euros per nite) which included a lovely, abundant breakfast with cereal, pastries, soft boiled eggs, rolls, cold cuts, cheese, fruit, juice, coffee and tea. We walked everywhere, Trevi Fountain just a few blocks away, Spanish Steps too. Even shorter to the Metro stop, Hop On/Hop Off Tour Bus stop, wonderful restaurants far too numerous to mention in every direction, all within walking distance. Via Veneto, Piazza Barberini all close by as well. Taxis were never more than 10 Euros one way for the sights located a bit out of our walking reach, like the Vatican, Piazza Navonna, Campo di Fiore and the Pantheon etc. We found that ordering the set/fixed menu for the day was the least expensive way to go, and the food was always delicious, especially the pastas without exception. We were usually confused about whether the bread and service charge was included or not...... Gelato shops seemed to be on every corner, a temptation we found difficult to resist..... Rosa and the staff at the Hotel are extremely helpful, she answered my every little question before arrival, and during our stay as well. She arranged for transfer from our cruise ship and to the airport with a very good driver with a station wagon to accomodate our huge luggage. The hotel also offers free internet use, which made staying in touch with our family so easy and reassuring.
