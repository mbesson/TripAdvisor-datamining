Location was not good at all, so having an unreliable shuttle made things difficult. Don't expect consistently friendly and helpful service (evening staff we had were extremely helpful; daytime staff had poor attitudes and were unhelpful and did not take initiative). When we approached management to provide constructive feedback, they also did not take any initiative, which reflects an attitude of complacency, lack of accountability, and lack of integrity. Rated on Priceline as 3.5 stars, but would not consider a contender for Sheraton, Hyatt, etc. Would rate it 2.5 to 3 stars at most. Parking was still almost $20 after tax, so consider hotels directly in downtown that charge about the same anyway for parking. I have stayed in the Sheraton (which is rated the same number of stars) through Priceline before as well in Seattle, and only paid $10 more per night. It was definitely worth the extra $10 in comparison to stay directly in downtown.

I question why this location would be included, but technically it is downtown. My initial reaction from getting this property on Priceline was disappointment, however that changed once we arrived. The hotel is less than 10 years old and is in excellent condition. The lobby is very comfortable with friendly staff and complimentary coffee/tea station. This in one of the only hotels (per bellmen) that still operates a complimentary shuttle van service. This is a must in my opinion to attract guests to this hotel. The van runs on the half hour for a short ride to several locations, including Safeco on game days. You call the hotel when ready for a pick-up. There is a parking garage for $16 per day, a bargain compared to other cities. There is a bus that goes by the hotel, but I did not use it. I did walk to Westlake Center which took about 20 minutes, downhill there, uphill back. The restaurant at the hotel, Jimmy's was surprisingly good. It is overpriced, as hotel restaurants tend to be, but quality was good and they had happy hour for discount drinks and appetizers. They also have room service. For off property food, there is an International House of Pancakes behind the hotel, and a McDonalds a couple blocks away, as well as a couple other breakfast/lunch places a few blocks away. there was a list in the hotel directory in the room. The bed was very comfortable with a fairly large room with mini-fride and microwave. Large screen flat panel TV in room. The bathroom was decent size with hot water and nice shower. The tub did drain slowly. Security enabled elevators need room key to access guest floors. I do not know about safety of neighborhood, but it did not seem so bad. there are two hospitals within a couple blocks and there were some homelss people panhandling in the city. but this was not an issue near the hotel that I encountered. They were the most polite panhandelers I have encoutered, with a thank-you when declining to give money. The city is clean with fresh air. The public transit is free in the downtown district. I checked out the light link for one stop downtown. nice clean stations. Van shuttle to Safeco, Pike Place Market, Westlake Center (shopping and transit), and Pioneer Square make this property a value compared to the hyatt/crown plaza type room rates.

The staff here - particularly front-of-house - were consistently v helpful in answering all our questions on seattle stuff from restaurants, making calls overseas, even where would be the best place from which to view the 4th July fireworks - location. it is one of the few ( only ? ) hotel in the fun and diverse capitol hill area. most other hotels are in the busy downtown area which is more full-on urban. - the frequent shuttle to downtown was great and saves a lot of money on cabs - no laundry service but high quality washer and driers on each floor made laundry v easy if needed A couple of small quibbles : - the hotel restaurant Jimmy's was a little bit soul-less and quiet. we only had breakfast there so maybe dinner would be busier. The service was sometimes a bit slow - add a ' clean me now' tag to the doors so rooms can be cleaned promptly. rooms were sometimes cleaned a bit late in the day - maybe add an ipod dock in each room ?

The shuttle was helpful in getting him where he needed to be, though. I have to say that once we were there and I got my bearings, it worked out better than I would have thought! The lobby is lovely and the rooms are spacious enough. The bathroom isn't special but it is definitely sufficient...except for the hair dryer. Unless I completely missed something, this could be the most annoying dryer I have ever encountered - you have to hold the button in the ENTIRE time you are drying your hair. Forget it if you want to use the cool shot button - it was like acrobatics. Ladies you know what I am talking about. For a nice hotel, they need different dryers! There was a sink, fridge and microwave in the room which is a total plus! I could actually take leftovers!! We didn't get a chance to eat at Jimmy's and I see another reviewer wrote they had a free breakfast. If that is true we completely missed that memo. In fact room service was quite pricey but that is not unexpected. The shuttle is great. It runs on the half hour from the hotel and picks up from the 4 locations (Pike Place, i.e.) on the quarter hour. You just call the hotel and they let the driver know where you are. I went running one morning along the water and was dropped off and picked up promptly. Now if I had done my research ahead of time, I would have just run back to the hotel! I learned after some exploring that the hotel is a 15-20 minute brisk walk to the downtown. I took Pine St. straight down to the water and it was so simple. So you have options. I also walked around the area surrouding the hotel. There are a few restaurants (chains - Subway and Panera, and non-chains), coffee shops (Starbucks and otherwise), a college, a hospital and boutiques. I stayed on Broadway and just walked up and down, stopped in the food store for lunch, and got a pedicure. There isn't a ton to do in the immediate vicinity but I love wandering so it worked for me for an hour or 2. There is an Urban Outfitters but it is the only mainstream store I saw. I used the fitness center and it was small but fine. I believe there were 3 treadmills, 1 elliptical and a nautilus type weight machine. I may have missed something...maybe there was a bike too but I don't remember. I used the treadmill and it was good. The pool and hot tub looked nice and I wish I had more time to try them out.

Upon checkin they give you a card for a free appitizer at the hotel restaurant/bar with a $15 purchase. We didn't get a chance to use it as the place closes at 11:00 pm and we got back too late.

That, coupled with the fact that the sheets were too small for the mattress so were constantly coming off anytime you moved, made for an uncomfortable night's sleep.

Luckily we did not have to test that return route, but I truly believe that it could be done if the procedure were not too severe given enough time to recoup. It would be a bit downhill, but nothing compared to further down the hill toward Virginia Mason. They also have paid/secure parking directly below the hotel, so if renting a car--no worries about having to drop off luggage/patient and then find suitable parking...already there. The rooms albeit a bit small, were very clean and beds comfortable. I wouldn't hesitate staying there again given its location in proximity to Swedish, and given its cleanliness and charm....and the free WiFi made making changes to our travel itin a snap and cost-free!", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel- Service is wonderful\u201d", "Author": "ARavanilaw", "ReviewID": "UR95580237", "Content": "I stay at the Silver Cloud Hotel on First Hill for business on a regular basis.

The rooms are up-to-date, clean, spacious, and comfortable with wifi, a minifridge and coffeemaker with Tully's coffee (as well as brewed coffee and a selection of teas in the lobby), business center with printer in the lobby. The fitness center and pool aren't glamorous--you have to go through the parking garage to get there--but are clean and well-maintained. Is it downtown? Definitely not. I would argue it's in kind of a convenient spot, though. Next to Swedish and Virginia Mason and easily walkable to Harborview (maybe too far to walk if you're there as a patient, though), next to Seattle U, QFC supermarket 1 block away, Capitol Hill restaurants are a healthy but pleasant hike (work off all that delicious food!), and, if you have comfy walking shoes downtown is easily reached on foot--and the shuttle will bring you back when you wear out those walking feet!

It is obvious that the company hired top-notch designers, as there is a nice mix of stone and wood, colors and fabrics, from the lobby to your room.

There is a ready bowl of Washington apples for guests there, as well as hot Tully\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffee just to the side.

My high point was the staff. They were great. I'll list some of my positive experiences with them. 1. On the day we checked in, it was earlier than what we could get into our room and they let us leave our baggage at the desk while we toured around town. I had taken my camera out as I was giving them the luggage and left it on the counter. After we had left to go back out, I remembered and we called. They found the camera it was waiting for me when we returned. That shows some honest employees. 2. The shuttle drivers were great. They were willing to go out during all hours of the day to pick up and drop off hotel guests around town. Traffic was bad and I was glad to not have to negotiate it. They were always friendly and chatted with us while we rode. They also gave helpful tips and information about town. I was most impressed with them. 3. When we would ask the front desk for something, they were always friendly and helpful. 4. The ladies did a great job keeping the continental breakfast stocked and would help guests with their food. While the hotel is not in the middle of all the attractions, we were willing to accept that with the price we were paying. Also with the shuttles, you can be back in the downtown area in under 20 minutes.

There is street and underground parking for those driving. I flew into SEA and took the new Sound Link streetcar and then simply got on the hotel shuttle downtown for a total cost of only $2.50.

Breakfast was good with premium coffees/teas/hot choc. they offer hard boiled eggs for those that want protein and not just carbs. Always lots of apples at front desk to grab on way in and out of hotel. Security was great with room key needed to access floors/garage during late hours. Front desk staff very friendly, extremely clean rooms & common areas. Easy to get to & from Fwy. Charge for parking garage ($16) but secured lot & lots of parking. I felt it was a fair charge. Did not use shuttle service but saw others utilizing it.

The room was your basic two queens room with a comfy reading chair and ottoman and a well appointed desk. We were able to use wireless internet with our laptop for no additional fee. There is a large flat screen tv which is much nicer than a typical unit that takes a lot of space. The small things were nice; the hangers come off the rod. The towels are softer than your usual box hotel. There is a complimentary laundry room on each floor. The beds were super comfy. We didn't use the pool and spa but the area was clean. I used the small gym; it was unremarkable but does have a tv. We ordered dinner from room service (from the Cayenne Grille downstairs) and it was prompt and yummy. My Captain and Coke was just right and a at good price. We'll definitely stay again.

They said I could come back around at 10 or 11am to check but they were booked solid again that night. Meanwhile I had to go to business meetings in Bellevue on no sleep. I called my corporate travel agency and asked to be moved to a sister hotel in Bellevue. The agent arranged it but told me that the front desk manager (Tammy) was upset that I had not given the hotel a chance to rectify the situation!!!!

Tammy then told the agent that she would refund my remaining 2 night prepaid stay if I got there by 2pm; it was 1:20pm at this point so I had to rush to Seattle from Bellevue, and surprise! there was heavy traffic in Seattle.

The manager should be forced to jump in the pool every morning to test the temperature. That renders the pool unusable. 3) The TV in the living area of our suite would work for a while, then quit responding to commands from the remote control.

The front desk was so great and helpful that I felt as if I knew them by the second night of my stay there. The Indoor Pool and Spa was such a great way to have the kids end their day. The earth tones that are found throughout the hotel was wonderful and made us all feel right at home. This hotel only being 2 years old is a wonderful place for anyone to stay. I would recommend it to anyone that is coming to the Seattle Area. I want to thank all staff for making my and my childrens stay wonderful in Seattle.", "Date": "June 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cO.K. But Short on Class\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5236195", "Content": "Stayed there a week. It looks like a nicer hotel than it is. On the plus side, the room are of good size, well appointed, and nice. The indoor pool is nice. The continental breakfast is more than just a few danish selections and coffee. The lobby is very nice. Now, as to the issues that annoyed me: 1. There is no bell captain to help you on arrival. It looks like a hotel that would have this service, so one is disappointed when you have to lug the luggage yourself. 2. There is a lady who sits at a desk that looks like she may be a concierge, but I'm not sure as she also looks like a secretary that has been misplaced from the office suite. She is not very friendly, not very helpful, and not worth tipping. 3. The restaurant Cyanne has an ecletic menu and a nice setting, but the staff is wholly untrained and just a mess. Horrible!!! They are nice, but incompetent.l. The food is average at best, and if you're just too tired to move outside to Broadway and get a decent meal, it will pass. Reminds me of Denny's food...that's where you settle. 4. The garage is tiny, and do not rent or take a big car like I did. The turns are extremely tight, and the parking places are made for mini-coopers. At $14 a night, it seems that they should pay you hazard pay to drive there. Also, there is no valet to park your car. Again, the hotel is set up to have a valet but no valet. 5. I had a rate of $124 a night, and though this is a good rate, along with added taxes and parking it was not outlandish, but I would have paid a little more for a little more class. It looks like you are going to get a great hotel, and then it just doesn't show up. 6. I will probably stay there again, but this time I will come in with lower expectations and be more comfortable.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington State", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place!\u201d", "Author": "Annyka", "ReviewID": "UR5066507", "Content": "I stayed at the Silver Cloud on Broadway for a 2 night business trip just this past week.
