I should now mention THE NOISE. All day long, trucks are backing up in the street behind the hotel and they must be large trucks because they have constant back-up beeping noises that sounds like you are spending the day in a CostCo warehouse. What was all that clanking in the back alley ALL NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT? Apparently the restaurant is emptying out trash and bottles every hour on the hour. And the restaurant employees were smoking, talking and just being incredibly noisy all night in the alley. The new room decor is OK, although already a bit outdated. The hotel staff is super friendly-but watch out for the AWFUL RESTAURANT STAFF who are mainly just nasty and snippy. The hostess could not have been more unprofessional and rude. Never going back.

The restaurant clearly now brings considerably more people to the hotel and this is great for hotel revenue and exposure, but can be very stressful for guests. To what extent hotel guests receive preference now is debatable.

The magnificent setting - the pool, pond, gardens, and swans remain untouched - provide an oasis of calm with LA just outside your door. I had booked a five day stay through WhataHotel, which came with the added bonus of a continental breakfast, although no room upgrade was offered.The newly styled interiors are superb, with beautiful and thoughtful design features providing elegant, modern luxury. The rooms are very well finished with heated floors in the bathrooms (although surprisingly not in the loo), B&O TV's, La Prairie soaps,superb linens and fluffy robes. Although some die-hards may prefer the old club style bar, it too is now lighter and far less stuffy. The ballroom would make a wonderful spot for any celebration. There's a new spa and gym, both state of the art; although the gym could offer several sizes of Swiss ball, and also make sure there are plenty of clean headsets! The staff were apparently all replaced (except 11) after the two year shutdown; the new waitstaff, bellboys, and cleaners are all wonderful, where you're really made to feel extremely welcome. A small niggle - some of the day to day restaurant managers could be more client focussed; on several occasions it took far too long to get seated for breakfast or dinner. Wolfgang Puck's restaurant is still settling in; the food is competent, although a little more innovative menu will be required if the restaurant is to receive many star accolades. At the prices charged for dinner there were surprisingly no ameuses bouches on starting dinner, or extras around dessert. There's a great wine list, if you have a reason to celebrate, with knowledgeable sommeliers. The house white, a Gruner Veltliner, offers the best value. All in all, this is a unique hotel, with a great provenance, now brought in to the 21st century.

After being closed for more than two years for upgrading there should be major changes and there are. Building exteriors and the wonderful gardens are either untouched or faithfully restored. The swans are still there. Inside everything is new. The lobby, restaurant and bar are in the same locations, but have no resemblance to their former versions. The quality is very high and pleasantly appealing. Rooms have been completely redone and are very modern. Baths are large and swank. All furnishings are new. My first impression was good. But as my stay continued I found that function and comfort had not been given the same attention as appearance. The rooms lack comfortable seating and a good light for reading. Some things just don't work. For example, it was not possible to open the door to the toilet compartment without moving or rolling up the bathroom rug. It was not possible to place the bathmat in front of the shower door because opening the door swept it aside. Counter space in the bath was a bit skimpy. Lights can not be individually controlled--switches control groups of lights or lamps with settings of on/off, low or high. The shower has a choice of a rain shower that drenches the entire enclosure or a hand-held shower head. I could not use the shower head in place on the wall, because it sprayed on the door and I could not adjust its height--it was mounted too high and I was unable to lower it. The phone contains a control panel for the room, including the thermostat, that takes a bit of time to learn to use effectively. Valet parking costs $38.50 per day. Internet access costs $15 per day. Valet service was excellent. The wall-mounted TV is about 3 feet square, but only the upper half contains the screen which is equivalent to about a 37-inch TV. The TV controls are complex. The staff was uniformly polite, welcoming and well trained. The restaurant, now operated by Wolfgang Puck, is outstanding. Rooms were clean and quiet. There is a new added section of rooms that blends in well and looks the same as older sections. Of course, the great location in a residential section of Bel-Air, just off Sunset Boulevard is the same. There is a large new spa, but I did not visit it. In summary, I enjoyed my stay and probably will return.

The Good News The service is perfection, like nothing I have ever seen, training at its best. They make it so easy and exceeded my expectations. Luckily they did not mess with the grounds during the renovations because they are still a jewel, but parts are a little run down. The Bad News The Decor - Whoever designed the interior of the lobby clearly designed this in a vacuum in London and I would guess never even saw the property. The grounds of the property are warm, quaint and special. The cold black and white styling is objectively the wrong fit for this space. The interior should be like an urban San Ysdrro Ranch with warmth. Sadly all the soft goods need to be redone at once, maybe they should call Ty Warner. The interior is so cold, depressing and out of place it almost ruins the entire resort. Our Room and Technology - We had a regular room with Patio, the Patio was much larger than our room. The finish out was superb, the only problem was our room was way to small for the size of the furniture. It is rare that I would advocate more room for lower finish out cost but larger, but these rooms are just too small, maybe they should in close the worthless patios. Technology can be a game changer when it is done perfectly like Apple has shown. I think Microsoft consulted on their technology because it is really bad. The Ipad program crashes 10 times in a row before it works properly each time you use it. The lighting system is delayed and will drive you nuts. The wort part is the bang and olsen remote, it is really confusing and is not intuitive at all, these tv's need to be replaced asap. The pay per view movie system is hard to use because of the remote and the selection of movies is very limited.

From the valet parking to the check-in desk ( supervisor Christina) to the concierge (Lauren) to the houekeepers to maintenance and to the waiters and busboys in the excellent Wolfgang Puck dining room, service is flawless. The director of rooms Martin and the general manager Christoph both made it a point to say hello, which I thought was extremely nice. I am not anyone important - and yet every single member of staff treated me as though I was. Very impressive, and really made my stay especially memorable and enjoyable because of how attentive and caring about guest comfort it all felt. There were several small technology issues in the Patio Suite, and maintenance was sent immediately. The attitude throughout the hotel staff is always responsive, willing and \"can do\". They truly strive to listen and make improvements on anything that might be missing. I did not have a shower caddy in my gorgeous large marble rainshower, and the next day one was brought. I wanted the sweetener 'Truvia', for my hot tea and the next morning it was there (in addition to the usual sweet-and-low, splenda and equal) when I came for breakfast. The upstairs patio suite (room 176) with its wood plank floor, is light and bright and open in feel, with a lovely ample sized patio with jacuzzi that heats to between 102-104 degrees. The living room was also large and had french doors that let in the sunlight, as did the bedroom. Both had large flat screen televisions. The marble floored bathroom is gorgeous, with a deep soaking tub, double sinks, and a private room with opaque glass for the HEATED Toto toilet (wow!). The rainshower has good water pressure and the bathroom floor is heated. The bath towels and large bath rugs are large and soft. The bathrobe was mid-calf, soft, just warm enough, and one of the best I have ever worn - I would like to buy one! My two other favorite rooms were the Swan Lake Suite (room 138) and the Loft Suites (room 500 and 501) in the Spa building The decor in the rooms is modern, and everything is spotlessly clean. I do think it would be nice if there were fresh flowers in each of the rooms, perhaps orchid plants, which would really warm up the spaces a bit and be in harmony with the elegant surroundings. Perhaps they will have those in all the rooms in the future. The twelve acre gardens are gorgeous and meticulously maintained. I spent a few enjoyable hours watching the three swans in the pond - Hercules (who has a a broken wing), Chloe and Athena. If you get to them early in the morning right as they are being released from their wooden caged area, they literally 'dance' with delight, speading their wings and happily racing from one end of the pond to the other - it is a magnificent sight. Food was absoultely superb at breakfast (try the blueberry pancakes, the huevos rancheros or the smoked salmon!); at lunch (try the spaghetti arribiata or the steak tartare or the garden salad!) and also at dinner (try the jidori chicken). The dining room itself with its windows on two sides, and dramamtic two sided white marble fireplace is gorgeous. The China service (Plates) are beautiful, the silverware is attractive. Napkins are huge white hemstitched linen, lightly starched. The Manager Daniel was a great host, and the waiters John, Livius, Mandy, Marcus and Mindy each gave wonderful service. The busboys all did too. If you want to dine outdoors on a warm summer night, I highly recommend 'candlelit' booths 51, 52 or 53 - incredibly romantic, and have heat lamps as well to keep you warm. I greatly enjoyed my stay, and think that this is a special property.

This is probably seen as an uptick for future bookings. The hugely transformed terrace/ restaurant (and lobby) has gone from relaxed CA garden elegance to sleek urban trendy. A lot of black elements are in jarring contrast to the charming California mission style architecture. The design feels over wrought and out of context, especially at day time. Flame towers, really? While the food is very good, it follows the Puck tradition of overpriced and under portioned. The restaurant service is amateurish. Unfortunately, the Terrace now features a generic computer podium check-in w/ \"hi guys\" hostesses. I'm guessing the highly seasoned restaurant staff of yesteryear found employment elsewhere. Room service staff was highly competent, yet the very pricey food seemed under portioned. Surely nostalgia has influenced my assessment, though I tried not to be crumudgeony about the changes.

I could not share more the previous reviewer's point, that there are only a handful of places like this one in the world. She can feel free to share the others with me. Over the years and stays, we have experienced a dozen rooms, up to the Grand Deluxe category. They all bear heavy family resemblance, but they are all different. They all have dated bathrooms. And then, so what ? Everything in and within the room make it up for that patios are SO private and exquisite and ... The service is first of the league. Nothing is too small or too big. Always handled with smiles and care. All, from the valets to concierges, from the reservation (Maria) to bellman (Roger), from check-in (Ronnie) to pool attendants, they go over the top to make your stay memorable. And, boy, it is. Not a hint of lacking motivation, despite the situation. Thumbs up. So the owner has decided to, I quote, make a sizeable investment in the property. I wonder why, but hell, I am no Sultan of Brunei by any mean. But I, together with many worried guests, have been staing there, and come to love a home away from home. I am not sure he ever set foot on the damn property. I am sure the property will be upgraded. Besides being possibly improved, I just hope it will not be destroyed; all things that make it so pleasant : architecture, atmosphere, ambience, fireplace, vegetation, tiles, patios, ... This may sound a little dramatic. Talking to fellow guests, I realized I was only a newcomer to the place. Some guests have been staying once a month for 15 years. Some Angelino people were staying there, only because they know it was closing down. This place means a lot to ots customers. We will be back.

A lot has been said here comparing the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Bel-Air. To my mind, if you are more interested in where you are seen to be staying, and who you see while you are there, then visit the Beverly Hills. If, however, you want to experience the best possible service in a discrete, luxury location then stay at the Bel-Air. The setting of the Bel-Air is truly exquisite - it is almost akin to staying on a luxury island. The grounds are wonderful; filled with glorious gardens and the even the occasional humming bird. The hotel is far enough from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles to be truly tranquil yet the courtesy car can have you on Rodeo Drive within ten minutes. Our suites were spacious, well appointed and the linens provided were of the highest standard. Of the two the Garden Suite, though cheaper, was my preferred room \u2013 its location, adjacent to the restaurant, was ideal and its layout slightly preferable to that of the Spa Suite. The Jacuzzi in the Spa Suite was a delightful addition but the room\u2019s location, the other side of the service entrance, was far enough from the main entrance to be a mild irritation. The service, from parking valets through to pool attendants, restaurant staff and housekeeping was exceptional. Perhaps the staffing highlight of the trip was the hotel\u2019s driver, Steve, who was not only incredibly helpful but also highly intelligent and articulate and able to offer an unexpected insight into life in Los Angeles and wider California. The only flaw in what is otherwise a perfect hotel is the food. It is of a very high standard but does not quite hit the culinary heights one might find in an equivalent European hotel (Claridge\u2019s or the Berkeley for example). My advice to any European visitor used to fine dining is stay away from classic European dishes as you will be disappointed. Instead try dishes such as the delightful \u2018Huckleberry braised short rib\u2019 and \u2018Maine Lobster with Angel Hair Carbonara\u2019. On the first evening I was forced to return my filet steak which was ordered blue but arrived severely overcooked. Subsequently, at breakfast, the milk served with the \u2018Oatmeal with Apples, Cinnamon and Honey\u2019 had gone off. Both errors are inexcusable in any kitchen. To the credit of the staff they agreed on both occasions and replaced the food without hesitation. These errors aside the food was very good but not truly world class. The wine list is fantastic and includes an excellent selection of attractively priced Hirsch Vineyards Pinot Noir. For the best possible experience be sure to sit outside.

We arrived around 6PM and were apologetically told that our room wasn't ready yet and we were offered free cocktails and drinks while we waited. Certainly appropriate and very nice. She mentioned that the room was by the pool. I was worried that this would not be quiet as I had requested when I made my reservation. I had been told not to worry as all the rooms were quiet so I didn't worry. When we got to the room it was clearly not quiet. The voices of children playing in the pool was disconcerting to say the least and this was 7 o'clock. I can't imagine what it would be like earlier in the day. Perhaps they were having us wait hoping the kids would be gone? The room's window faced the patio which was quite exposed to the pool area thus making it impossible to open the drape and maintain any semblance of privacy. I noted that the drape was drawn when we were shown the room and I fully understand why. I said that this room was not acceptable and at first was told that they had no others available but that they would see if they could change our room the next day. I was then getting more upset and finally they did indeed have another room. The other room they moved us to was quiet and faced a beautiful garden area. It was, unfortunately, very small (at least at the room rate of over $600 a night with tax). Everything was really crammed in and there was really no sitting area other than the desk, the bed and the outdoor patio. It was about the size of the small standard rooms at The Beverly Hills Hotel years ago before they did the major renovation. The bed was very nice but the bathroom was small, cramped and not up to the luxury standards that should be appropriate here. Little details were just not up to snuff (the towels were thin and worn rather than fluffy and luxurious etc.). One morning we were woken up by hammering, banging, sawing and drilling in the room next door. I called to complain and they said they would speak to security (?). Finally they called back after 30 minutes to say they were making repairs. I feel that a hotel of this supposed level of quality and service should go the extra mile and check to see if we had left our room (check the do not disturb sign) before turning our next door room into a construction site and waking us up. I noted no offer of breakfast, cocktails etc. for this intrusion. We did have dinner at the restaurant and it was excellent. I have been staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel for many years and feel there is no comparison. The Hotel Belair seems like The Beverly Hills Hotel years ago before the renovation brought it up to current luxury standards.

We had just come from a 2 night stay at the San Ysidro Ranch (see my review), and so the first thing I noticed when we checked into our one-bedroom suite at the Bel-Air was that the furnishings seemed a bit worn by comparison (the SYR has just finished a complete refurbishment, so everything is bright and shiny). That said, on settling in I concluded that there was nothing about our suite that demanded replacement \u2013 and everything was in good repair. The suite was very comfortable, and quiet. The linens and bedding were all first rate, as always. There\u2019s nothing flashy about the Bel-Air. There are no large public spaces to \u201csee and be seen\u201d. Don\u2019t stay here if you want a big lobby. The Bel-Air is more about retreating from the hustle of LA, and being cocooned in an oasis of civility. I will note that the older hotel maxim of \u201cdon\u2019t stay in the cheapest room\u201d applies to the Bel-Air. Some of the standard rooms are quite tight, and look directly into passageways. What sets the Bel-Air apart is the service. My wife has always commented that the staff appears to treat every guest with the same courtesy and deference as they would a celebrity. This time was no different. Two events confirmed the high level of service offered by the Bel-Air: (1) My wife and son went for a swim, and I was relaxing in the room. Room service knocked, bringing a welcome bottle of wine and some snacks. The room service attendant noticed our son\u2019s belongings in the living room, and asked if we had a child a with us. I replied that we did. He apologized for not bringing anything for our son, and asked our son\u2019s preferences. I told him our son liked apple juice. He returned just a few minutes later, with the apple juice and also with some maple pecan popcorn. The awareness of the attendant \u2013 he didn\u2019t just deliver his items, he paid attention \u2013 exemplifies many of our experiences at the hotel. (2) My son had some homework to do and needed a dictionary. We went to the concierge, to find out if she might have one. She didn\u2019t, but suggested that we try an on-line dictionary using the guest internet terminals. A front desk clerk overheard the conversation \u2013 and came rushing out with the front desk\u2019s own dictionary, which he insisted that we use. Again, a staff member was paying attention to the needs of the guests. I could give many other similar examples from our prior stays.

Since last year we stayed at the Beverley Hills Hotel we decided to try the Hotel Bel Air this time. While there are stellar reviews on this place, and it is often named as one of the top hotels in the US, I was less than impressed. I wish someone had told me the following details as it would have really helped me not to make such an expensive mistake as choosing the Bel Air: Extremely remote location, no lobby or central areas at all, it's all about the grounds, plants, flowers etc.. The non-suite rooms are located in a separate building out back, across a service road, facing either the main road (traffic-ish) or the dumpster area (no smells, just noise). We upgraded to the best possible non-suite room and that's where we were anyway. We did have a fireplace a super small patio area with a small table for two and two plastic outdoor chairs. If you want a fire, they ask you to call a bellman and we were beyond tipped out so did it ourselves. The room was nicely decorated, but quite small. The pool was nicer than the pictures on their website, but fill up fast on weekends as there are only about 25 of them. There is only one restaurant, and it is expensive. Our modest room service breakfasts (oatmeal, fruit, two eggs, coffee - for two - was $100 per day with their additional charges added on. The restaurant was good for dinner, but we took friends to the $65 brunch and it was the all time low point. Food had to go back twice (cold, then runny egg whites.). They actually removed one of the 4 brunches from the bill so only $200 for a bad brunch for 4. The entire staff, from start to finish, seemed edgy - but it could have been me. And really, nothing can compare to the thrill of the Beverley Hills Hotel for us.

It is at the back of a lush courtyard and comes with a private patio surrounded by foliage. The patio was a wonderful spot for breakfast or dinner and was very quiet. You enter the patio through a small wooden gate and from the patio french doors open into the living room of the suite. Bliss! The suite was light and bright with a dining area, living room area, 1.5 bathrooms and a one-step-down bedroom. The master bathroom was huge with large closets. double sink vanity, separate wc and a combination tub/shower. The tub itself is a little small but a minor point with such beautiful accommodations. The associates working at the hotel were so thoughtful. Even with a big cast of my nose and black eyes they managed to look me in the eye, smile and ask if I needed anything. And they did mean anything. Extra ice, more pillows, nothing was too much to ask. The food was excellent as well. I ate almost every meal for the first 6 days in my suite and it was such a treat! The last day I did have lunch on the terrace -- Yum -- and dinner in the champagne bar, alas w/out any champagne. The gardens are tremendous and the fountains were soothing. There are gentle fountains everywhere around the property. Make sure that you don't miss the herb garden behind rooms 164/165. I loved heading out there for some fragrance -- and it was always empty! I understand from a valet at the hotel that Oscar DeLa Renta loved to have a table set-up for lunch in this area. I can completely understand that sentiment. Several reviewers talked about feeling looked down on or under-dressed. I watched people come and go -- every appeared to be treated equally to me. I didn't see anyone in jeans and sneakers running around but I did see shorts and flip flops, khakis, summer skirts, etc. Everyone was appropriately dressed but I never felt like it was a style show....just nicely groomed. One word of caution -- they are currently planning on building a new spa and have just broken ground.

From the moment you check in to the hotel and pass the swans in the pond, your senses are greeted with the beauty of the property and the smell of the colorful flowers that everywhere. Here are the specifics: The Service--This was the most outstanding feature of the hotel. Every employee was beyond generous and willing to extend themselves in every way possible. In fact, after we left my partner forgot a charger in the room. It was Fed-Exed to the next stop on our vacation, but did not arrive on time. The head of security at the Bel Air credited our account at the hotel to cover the Fed-Ex charge. He called promptly and did everything he could to resolve this slight mix-up. The Grounds--Terrific places for sitting and relaxing. Lots of little off-the-beaten path spots. I never felt crowded and I always felt secure in knowing that I could find a quiet location outside of my room. The Location--It is up Stone Canyon Road in Bel Air, so the hotel is not downtown and it does take a while to get places. However, to me, this was a plus. It allowed my partner and I to feel as though we were escaping into a hidden world tucked away from the vibe of the city. The Room--We had a standard room--room 105. While the room was not a suite, nor did it have its own patio or fireplace (many do), it felt spacious and it was very comfortable. Linens and towels are all top notch, as are the bath products. The rooms are also not overdone, which is always a pleasant surprise. The Pool--Very elegant and comfortable. Also, very quiet, which I adore. The Gym--It's small, remember the hotel only has about 90 rooms. Yet, it was never over-crowded and it had plenty of equipment. The Bar and Restaurant--Very tasty and the bar has a very old-world feeling. The service here was terrific. Concierge--I worked closely with a concierge named Mark who was a fund of information. Very helpful with directions and advice. Overall--I would not suggest this hotel for business travelers because it is away from the rest of the city and things like the Internet always seemed slow, but the setting and beauty of this place should be experienced by everyone at least once.

I was on vacation with my family and looking for a chance to relax - therefore, I decided to dress more casually - although, still in a nice shirt/sweater and dressy jeans or khakis each day (with nicer clothes for evening wear). Despite this, I still had a general feeling of being looked down upon by the hotel staff and hotel \"regulars\". This is definately not a welcoming, family-like atmosphere - it seems that it would be better suited as a catwalk for you to show off your newest surgical improvement or designer clothing from Rodeo Drive. We went to the restaurant one evening and got exceptionally poor service because all we wanted were appetizers and drinks and did not order off the \"pricier\" main entree menu (We would have ordered off it had there been more choices and seating in the Pub - not everyone wants to eat Foie Gras or Rack of Lamb after being on an airplane all day). The rooms were nice but the lack of cleanliness was appalling. There was mildew on the bathtub, the tile floors throughout the suite were full of hair and dirt, and the bathroom wall had some sort of disgusting, brown splatter on it. Oh, and the \"Business Center\" was a joke. It was nothing more than a computer tucked into a small, hot closet that you needed to ask the front desk staff for permission to use. Not what I expected from a member of the Leading Hotels of the World. Don't get me wrong - Hotel Bel-Air is in a gorgeous setting and definately worth checking out. However, I would recommend simply stopping buy for a walk on the grounds rather than staying or eating here.

This was a disappointment, especially given how much we enjoyed our first stay. So I guess the lesson is that, if you want the best service, dress and act the part (spray on a tan; glam it up; treat the staff like they are adorable, but tragically slow, children; talk on your cell phone constantly at the pool; chain smoke).

From the swans to the secret herb garden to the beautiful pool to all the hidden courtyards, it is a site without peer. Then there is the service; warm, personal, and clearly driven to exceed your expectations. The staff were always helpful without being servile - coming across as dedicated professionals who enjoyed their ability to deliver outstanding customer service. There was only one minor flaw in the service; the woman at the concierge desk had a slightly arrogant attitude - like one of those boutique sales people who become confused and start to think they own all the merchandise they are selling - but given that we only needed airport transportation and to mail a letter, it hardly impacted our stay. The room (153) was welcoming and personal, with carefully chosen furniture and art. We had a fruit plate, a box of exquisite chocolates, and a small cake waiting for us in the room when we arrived, as well as a note from the GM, which was a very nice touch. This is not meant to be a sleek modern antiseptic hotel room, so there is no swimming pool-sized tub carved from a single piece of obsidian, or curtains that open with a wink of your eye (although those are things that I do enjoy in that type of hotel) - this is a refuge designed to make you feel at ease. Everything from the lamps to the well polished wood floors to the beautiful curtains looks as though it had been individually chosen to make you feel as at-home as possible (and at-home in a mid-20th century mansion in Bel-Air to boot!). We had a beautiful patio surrounded by trees and tropical flowers, with 2 chaise lounges, a full dinning table and chairs where we had breakfast each morning, and a fountain. Probably one of the most pleasant surprises was that the Hotel does not nickel and dime you at all - everything from the bottles of water at your bedside to the WiFi access to the fruit, water and sunscreen at the pool is complimentary.

We arrived at the hotel around noon and received a warm welcome from reception and immediate access to the room. The room was a deluxe guest room with a terrace and wood burning fireplace. Due to the warm temperature we unfortunately never lit the fire. The room was small, yet cosy, and newly refurbished.

The room was quite a distance from reception, however, we loved the walk past the beautifully manicured gardens, restaurants and pool area.

No one ever updated us as to the progress, and after we asked 2 more times, we were told it wasn't working. After ordering, we waited about 45 minutes before our breakfast came. When it arrived, it was cold. We sent it back, and waited 30 additional minutes. At that point, it was almost lunchtime and we decided to leave.

I had written a hard copy letter to the general manager's attention, but I never received a response. My first disappointment was that my room was in bad shape. It was old and in need of updating, and the heater was loud and did not work well. I spent my sleeping hours alternating between being too cold and entirely too warm. Each night before bed, I always eat ice cream. It's a dumb (and fattening) habit...but it's what I do! So I called room service to order some ice cream before bed and was told that the freezer was not working and therefore no ice cream could be delivered. Another disappiontment, but not a big deal in the whole scope of life. The *biggest* disappointment was my check-out experience: I had agreed to meet an old friend for Sunday morning brunch in Malibu at 9:00 a.m. I figured that I would go to Malibu; meet my friend; then drive back to Hotel Bel Air and check out before catching my return flight to Washington, DC. In hindsight, it wasn't \"the best laid plan\"...but it was my plan for that particular morning. As things happened, my friend was running late; our breakfast therefore ran late; and traffic from Malibu to the hotel was horrendous -- it was summertime, and everyone had gone to hang at the beach. So I called the front desk from my cell phone and explained my situation. I informed the person who answered that I was terribly sorry and would absolutely be checked out by 1:00 p.m. The person with whom I spoke said that was fine and thanked me for calling. Well, after battling some of the worst traffic I had ever seen, it was about 1:15 when I pulled into the hotel driveway. I felt very bad, as I am a man who prides himself on being punctual. I **literally** ran to my room; gathered my bags; and rushed to the front desk to check out. What happened next could have been a video on how *not* to treat a hotel guest: The woman at the front desk, as I approached, informed me that I was \"checking out late.\" I told her that I was aware that I was checking out late, and added that I was very sorry. The front desk person continued, informing me that the hotel was completely full the coming evening and that I had created a real problem for them. She then continued to tell me that she had every right to charge me a half-day room charge on top of what I had already paid. Her mouth continued to utter words, but -- at this point -- I was so angry that I honestly didn't hear what else she was saying. I am an exceedingly polite person who rarely gets angry. The Hotel Bel Air representative, and her attidude, pushed me over the edge. I raised my voice and told her, \"Look, I said I was sorry.\" She looked stunned and said, \"There is no reason to raise your voice.\" I continued, \"I went to Malibu for brunch, which ran late. Traffic was terrible trying to get back here. I took the time to call from the car to say that I was running late. What else do you want?!\" At that point, other guests in the lobby were now staring -- and, to be quite frank, I didn't care (and still don't). You see, I'm not accustomed to visiting 5-star hotels and being treated like a five year old. At that point, the Hotel Bel Air employee admitted that she was unaware that I had called from the car to arrange the late check-out. But -- keep in mind I had apologized to her twice for my tardiness -- she never apologized to me for her error or behavior. I have since returned to Hotel Bel Air's restaurant for breakfast and lunch...but, to be sure, I will never - ever! - stay there again.
