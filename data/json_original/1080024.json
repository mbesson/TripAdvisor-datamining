Hotel: The staff were very friendly, spoke perfect English and were very happy to store my bags for my last day after I checked out. I've no doubt they would have helped me with any other problems. It's called a high tech hotel though I must say, other than having a laptop in the room, I struggled to notice anything particuarly high tech. The decor makes it seem a bit sci-fi, but it was clean and smart. Location: Can't be faulted, right next to the Plaza Mayor and also the AMAZING food market of San Miguel just across the road. An absolute must for tapas, wine, snacks and lovely biscuits, olives and meats to take home. The atmosphere is great though it does get very crowded later on in the evenings. There are several metro stops all within easy reach, as well as several high street shopping thoroughfares. My wallet wasn't too happy about the location, but I definitely was! The entrance is on the main Calle Mayor, so coming and going late at night after the bars and clubs felt very safe, and there were always taxis on hand just outside the hotel which was great for getting to places further afield. The palace (and its wonderful gardens) are a short walk down Calle Mayor. All in all this was a really good choice for a long weekend in Madrid.

However, when we ran off the water the smell did subside.I think that maybe the room had not been used for a few days hense the smell. The second was that there was a huge stain on the carpet which really needs to be addressed, but It certaily did not put us off the staying there. We did not eat breafast in the hotel so I cannot comment on it, we just went to local cafes which were great value for money. The Market across the road is just fantastic, the tapas are amazing and the fresh fruit superb. On one of our days we did the Bravo bike tour, which again was a great experience. Madrid is not really a bike freandly city but Geyza (spelling)! our Hungarian tour guide was brilliant. He even came to lunch with us to translate and help us with ordering lunch(as our spannish is not too good). I would really recommend doing the tour as you get a great feel for the city, which is beautiful.

The Cava Baja street with all of it's wonderful tapas bars is right outside the hotel's front door. The Mercado de San Miguel across the street is also a lively place for tapas and drinks in the evening. We had one of the family rooms that accommodates 4, with a queen sized bed and bunks. Our family of 4 (parents and 2 young adult daughters) was very comfortable. The room was clean and in good condition. The computer in the room is a nice touch.

It's an okay deal at 2 for 1, but is definitely way overpriced if you pay full price. For our other breakfasts, we walked down the street (exit the hotel and walk about a block to the left) and had a very reasonably priced breakfast at a Denny's type place called VIP (I think). It was nothing to write home about, but it fulfilled it's purpose. Two small gripes ... the hotel charged my card in dollars instead of Euro's without asking what my preference was. I always get a better exchange from my credit card company than the exchange I get from the European banks, so I ended up losing a few dollars in the transaction. And, the hotel is apparently very stingy when it comes to toilet paper. With 4 people in the room, we ran out of toilet paper on the second night and had to call down for more. They brought us one roll and the cleaning person never put in a spare roll, so by the fourth day we were out of paper again. The other people in our traveling party had a similar problem.

The breakfast was good, but as there was only one person working in the restaurant the food took a while to come out (hot food) and the other bits were replenshed when the poor person had time. The receptionist was very friendly, they did forget to fix our hairdryer despite asking twice but thats the only problem we had. It was easy to catch a metro from the airport to the hotel (2 euros and 2 changes) and the tour bus stops in the puerto del sol (down the road from the hotel).

The market had great foods, tapas, fruits, and homemade potato chips. It as a great place to eat lunch or dinner. The rooms in the hotel were decorated nicely but had no balcony and no particular views. The televisions were nice - flatscreens - and there was a laptop in every room and free wifi. Our laptop was missing the mouse button so it was a little hard to use. I also brought my own laptop but got no wireless connection on it so I unplugged the internet wire going into the room's laptop and stuck it in my own.

Although there was a mini bar in the room it was expensive (Euro 4.80 for a small beer that sells for 0.50 in the supermarket) and there was no bottle opener to be had for love nor money in the whole hotel.

Pictures can't do justice to the wonderful room we had. We never thought black and white could make up such a nice chic room. We booked a romantic package which came with chocolates and a bottle of cava. Although we had to remind them of it, we were impressed by what we got... and we got two bottles of cava instead of one. The location is excellent, about 10-minute walk from Sol train/metro station and diagonally opposite Plaza Mayor. The small market across the street was a nice one to enjoy some refreshing drinks, tapas and fresh sea food. The room was quite modern, tastefully designed in shades of black and white. The wifi is excellent and I can vouch for it because I had to urgently do some work and was able to upload a 52MB file to my office server through VPN in less than 10 minutes without the connection ever breaking.

The hotel is very central and easy walking to all the major attractions (Plaza Mayor, Palace, Prado, Retiro Park etc) and plenty of restaurants and right beside the pedestrianized shopping streets. The hotel is very modern and the room had lovely bedlinen and plenty of towels and toiletries and a great shower. We had booked a room for three and like the previous reviewer I would have to say it was a little pokey and when the bunk bed was down it was difficult to pass by and access the bathroom (especially in the middle of the night). We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel which meant we all got a good nights sleep. The internet access was a bonus as my daughter could keep in contact with friends. The mini bar is expensive so we just bought water locally and used the fridge to cool it. I did notice a smell on one evening when we returned but it was gone after we showered and then didnt appear again. One point however we all seemed to start sneezing when we turned on the heating. I'm not sure if there was dust in the fan or in the room!! We also noticed the lack of mirrors with three of us vying for one mirror to do makeup etc it required planning but was not a major issue. The check-in was efficient but staff are a little distant and somewhat vague. On the first night we asked for restaurant recommendations and we were directed to La Latina which we were told was a short walk. I'm not sure if we got lost but we couldnt find the area and it was dark and very quiet and we decided to head back towards Sol where we found a lovely restaurant and a little buzz. The breakfast is good and as we paid while booking it cost \u20ac10 and not the \u20ac16 as advertised. Its worth 10 but not 16. Locally there are lovely pastry shops and specialist ham shops that do coffee, churros, etc which I would probably opt for when I return to Madrid. All in all Madrid is a beautiful city with a laid back atmosphere, great value for food, drink and taxis. The metro is cheap, safe and never too crowded (we bought the 3 day tourist pass at the information office just before you enter the metro in the airport, it was \u20ac11.50 and proved to be great value as it covered the journey to and from the airport and all other journeys . The lady at the desk was very helpful with directions and metro changes and even marked our hotel exactly on the map The hotel is fine and it is clean, safe and very modern and I would probably stay there again as the location is excellent. If you're not looking for engaging staff and spacious accommodation and reception rooms than you could do worse than stay here. I would have liked a bar or somewhere to have a coffee or drink after a day's sight seeing. I am planning a return trip at some stage with my husband as I know he would love Madrid.

The hotel itself only opened a month ago and appears to have got over the teething problems mentioned in the previous review.

The decor and lighting were modern and well thought out. The bed was huge and comfortable while storage was just enough for a break of this size. The laptop in the room was useful for checking emails and getting tourist information. Although we had a limited roof top view this was not a real concern. The lack of street noise more than made up for it. The windows gave good sound insulation so I wouldn't expect the front-facing rooms to have any problems. The shower-room was of a good size with high quality fittings including a multi-function shower. Towels were also of a high quality.

I have returned with mixed feels which I will try and explain through this review. Firstly when booking and looking more information on the hotel I googled the hotel and could never find many hits apart from information pages from the likes of Expedia/lastminute etc. For reference the hotel is owned by a chain called High Tech Hotels ([-]). The location was great, a minutes walk from Plaza Mayor (http://www.multimap.com/s/B8Y9hQGe) where you can enjoy a number of tapas bars and sit and people watch till your hearts content. 5/10 mins walk down Calle Mayor is the Royal Palace and Catedral de la Almudena. Around 20 mins walk in the other direction is the Museo del Prado. You are also a short walk from the Sol metro station. On arrival it took 30/40 mins to check-in which was a joke especially when we arrived at 2am after a delayed flight. The guy on the desk seemed to have technical (or other!) issues using either PC he had access too. Anyway got checked in and allocated room 110, the room was clean (the hotel is brand new) but small. There was enough room to walk around the bed and that was it. If you are staying here for more than 2 nights you might want to upgrade to a larger family room. The bathoom was good, huge shower (rainfall shower head), contemporary fittings (all from Porcelanosa) and almost the size of the bedroom. You will noticed everything they could get away with they branded. Even down to the Dell laptops they have in each room. The view out the room was terrible, onto the other side of the hotel, if you opened the window and stuck your head out you could see the sky. It was unclear during our stay if any rooms had views down Calle Mayor, it looked like just the main areas. which would be great shame. When we had booked the hotel we had taken up the offer (available from Expedia and lastminute) for an upgrade to a hydromassage bath and free soft drinks. This is far from worth it, all rooms have a hydromassage showers anyway and the free soft drinks were two bottles of 500ml water. Expedia and lastminute also claim there is an informal bar at this hotel, this is not the case. Checking the official hotel website it does not advertise this. We never had breakfast in the hotel but the couple we were with went the first morning and it was nothing write home about, for 15 euros each it was better to go and explore and enjoy breakfast at a traditional Madrid cafe. As the hotel is new there are a few teething issues, one major one was that the couple we were with had continual door issues. Each time they returned to the room it took up to 5 new swipe cards to get into their room. Going up and down from the 4th floor you can understand their frustration. Hopefully this was a one off or they are in the process of sorting this. Note - For readers arriving into Madrid Barajas and getting a taxi be aware a lot of sites that say it is a 20 euro trip into Madrid. This wasn't the case for us. Always ask how much it will be before getting in a taxi, we were first quoted 50 euros but haggled down to 35 euro. On arriving at the hotel we noticed the meter said just over 20 euros, he claimed airport supplements etc made it 35 euros. We took the metro back to the airport, 2 euros 90 cents each and two changes, dead easy and only 20/25 mins. All in all the hotel was okay for a night or twos stay but no longer. As with all new hotels there are teething issues, they need to sort the check-in process and ensure all the door swipe cards work first time. The hotel was great from a location point of view. Still unclear how they class this as a 4* hotel, it has no bar or restaurant (lunch or dinner), no room service, staff who need properly trained and small bedrooms. It seemed to be classed as 4* due to the hotel being brand new. Will be looking elsewhere next time.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Petit Palace Mayor", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1080024-Reviews-Petit_Palace_Mayor-Madrid.html", "Price": "$125 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mayor 46</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Centro Hist&oacute;rico</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1080024", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/86/7a/867a4b9a98dc099edbe72288701c32978large.jpg"}}
