{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location, everything else is poor. The only saving grace for this hotel is the location. Close to everything in Florence you'd want to see. The rooms, furniture and staff we less than expected. First, the single room is that-only for one single person, not a couple. We had to upgrade at the insistance of the staff for 40 euro more than we had booked. The double bed was 2 metal cots pushed together with one thin, hard mattress and 2 equally slim pillows. The bathroom has an incredibly high tub/shower with a plastic step stool to get into. An older person would have difficulty getting in or out. The furniture in the room was very old-its a stetch to call this modern as the description states. The free breakfast consisted of a basket of bread and juice served but a stern lady who did not speak one word. The front desk staff was pleasant but not very helpful. There is internet wi-fi but they charge extra for that. Finally they allow you to store your bags after check-out but be careful. We were told to leave the bags near the front door on the floor, which we reluctantly did. When we returned a new front desk agent was there who we had never seen and he had never seen us. We went in took our bags and left without a word from the agent. Anyone could have taken our bags and no one would have questioned them or seemed to care. Again, the location probably cannot be beat, but thats the only positive words I can offer.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR866586605", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "OrlTerry"}, {"Content": "An excellentsmall hotel The Signoria, two minutes walk from the Ponte Vecchio, is an excellent small hotel with clean rooms and adequate bathrooms; the staff is friendly and competent and we could not hope for better accomodation within the prize range.

While the hotel itself was okay (although there were some issues, more on those later) the area was horrible at night. Night after night there was screaming and yelling of people carrying on in the streets below. Some nights, such as Fridays and Saturdays became so loud that even with ear plugs in and a sleeping pill, I was unable to fall asleep. This noise would sometimes go as late as 4 am. I am not some little 'country bumpkin' who can't deal with a little street noise; I live in a city of 1,000,000 people and I lived right downtown for several years. I am used to, and actually like street noise (traffic, sirens, people coming and going); however, listening to rowdy, screaming drunks every night is unacceptable.Now on to the hotel itself. The front desk staff were pleasant and friendly for the most part. One of the gentlemen up there was particularly helpful and helped us to plan a lovely guided tour in Tuscany. The cleaning ladies and breakfast ladies were also fairly pleasant.The rooms were inconsistent. Our first room was on the fourth floor and was not very nice - it looked like it was decorated in the early 1970s and the bathroom and fixtures all looked like they were from that era as well. In this room, we didn't have a shower (just a hand-held sprayer in a tub) and the taps wouldn't turn off and dripped constantly. Due to the above mentioned noise, we asked to be moved to a different room that faced a side-street rather than the main street (which actually made no difference to the noise levels). We were moved to a room on the fifth floor which was actually a lot nicer. The decor was more modern and the bathroom had taps that worked and a real shower; however, in this room the toilet didn't work. We had to plan our flushes because the toilet would only flush once an hour, and if anyone in a neighbouring room flushed, then you better start timing again. This was pretty gross and frustrating.The breakfast was okay but nothing special. I have been to many different hotels all over Italy and it is usually standard for there to be a small buffet with meats, cheeses, breads, cereal, yogurt and fruit - this hotel only offered you bread unless you wanted to pay extra, so if you can opt out of the breakfast, do.The hotel was very close to all the main sites in Florence, but in the future I would stay across the river in the Oltrano area or perhaps out of town all together. The noise made it very hard to be enthusiastic about staying in this area of Florence.", "Date": "Jun 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR532828448", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "PinkUnicorn"}, {"Content": "Highly recommended We absolutely loved this hotel; situated right in the heart of Florence nr the Pont Vecchio bridge [stunning], Palazzo della Signoria, cafes, bars, shops.

Well going by the other reviews on here none of you guys were unfortunate enough to be allocated the room I stayed in for 5 nights. It was the most dank and miserable one that I have ever had the misfortune to stay in. Situated on the second floor it looked onto a small courtyard but there was never enough sunlight to reach into my room and help lift the gloom.Room was clean at first but it was not cleaned every day during my stay, furniture was old and chipped including a glass topped desk with a rough crack in the top. Oh and yes the walls are thin, very thin and you can hear ahem far too much from the guests next door.Old guy on reception was very dour and never made me feel welcome. As for the breakfast, yes it is indeed on a pleasant little balcony with potted pink and red geraniums but ! The service was so slow and the food was not worth the wait, a paltry bowl of bread buns and a mixture of jams and processed cheese. Plus once the tables were vacated the local sparrows fly down and peck the remnants in the wicker bowls.

It's a small three-star hotel in a very central location in Florence. You step out of your hotel and you can immediately see the crowds of people walking toward Ponte Vecchio.

The staff were quite friendly and helpful although I had to feel guilty when our suitcases were lugged up three flights of stairs to our rooms by an elderly woman, who also serves the breakfast in the morning and cleans out the rooms. The walls are quite thin, we could hear people running up stairs and what the people were doing next door. You could also hear noises coming from outside from people who don't seem to go home until about 3 in the morning. We had to close the windows or invest in earplugs to get a relatively good night's sleep.
