After looking at their website however I had my reservations. So needless to say their website definately needs a make over. But what my impressions I had from the website couldnt be further from the trueth. On arrival we were greated by smiling faces and a \"allo Mrs Wells\" (my husband actually arrived a few days after us due to work commitments). They had arranged for us to have a double and a single bed in our room to fit my husband, son and I. The rooms and decor throughout the hotel is wonderfully welcoming. Admitedly, the shower was tiny. Only JUST enough room for my son and I. But that was the least of our worries. We were so happy to be in Italy nothing really mattered. The breakfasts here were seriously AMAZING! It's not worth going anywhere else in Roma for breakfast as they are brilliant right downstairs. Freshly brewed coffee was offered to us, which after two days they stopped asking what we wanted and made our regualr which was a really lovely touch. My son is crazy for berries, so they had a bowl of berries for him every morning with some juice and a special child seat. We felt really special and well looked after at Bramante. Their omletes were perfect too! Their is a house cat that loves the company of the hotel guests. Nikita. So if you have allergies you will have to be careful. Our son loved having the cat about our room, so we left our window open so she could come and go as she pleased. Once we found Nikita asleep with our son in bed one afternoon. Was wonderful.. When in Rome :) But again warning if you have allergies or get hay fever. Dry cleaning is quite expensive but they will iron your clothes for you for free if directed. And the maid will attend your room every day which is nice. The mini bar is quite affordable too and you will probably find you will drink a lot of the bottled water. Location is amazing. It is literally less than a 5 minute walk to the Vatican. A HUGE tip to remember.. that we found out the hard way. If you go to see any public monuments during peek travel periods, our suggestion would be to go in the afternoon. We waited 3 hours to get inside the Coloseum with lots of pushing a shoving.. which is just horrid when you have an impatient 2 year old. However, by the time we left in the afternoon, the line in was a lot shorter and quieter. This family run business is far better than other higher star hotels we stayed on this trip. Everyone is so friendly and you never feel like you are asking for too much. I think you will really enjoy your stay here.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thornhill, Ontario, CANADA", "Title": "\u201cA Roman Treasure\u201d", "Author": "Ex-airfaircrew", "ReviewID": "UR119033635", "Content": "Tucked away on a tiny backstreet in Vatican City, this charming hotel offers a peaceful retreat from the wonderful, hectic craziness that is Rome.

My husband and 2 young children (6and8) discovered the hotel by chance (through the \"lonely planet\" book, only after our original hotel reservations at another hotel (the name should forever be banned in our minds) cancelled our reservations without letting us know and after 24 hours of travel overseas from Canada, in August 2010. We were tired, had lack of sleep, jet lagged and trudged along the cobblestone roads from the other hotel to the Bramante with all of our luggage and two kids in tow. The reception we got at the \"Bramanted\" was very welcoming, but my husband and I were not the greatest guests at the beginning from our bad experience at the previous hotel and from our severe lack of sleep. We were the ones who were not very nice, but the owners of the hotel were amazingly patient and did not respond to our venting of our frustrations on them! The owners did not need our business or our frustrations, but the wife (whose family has owned the hotel since 1873), her husband, and their daughter were very patient, kind, and even tried to joke with us to put us at ease. Their reception of us was enough to put the guilt in my husband and I for our behavior. THey accepted our apology with graciousness and always greeted us every morning. Our room accomodated the four of usand they had a king size bed for my husband and I, a pullout twinbed sofa and another roll bed to accomodate the children. The room had beautiful rugs on them and the decor is traditional. The walls are thin, so if you have young children, you will need to advise them to really keep their inside voices. The street that the hotel is on is very quiet in the evening, but during the day, you can hear the street noise through your windows. The attached bathroom has marble floors and very modern amenities and the shower is great. The towels were always fresh and they even provided toothbrushes and toothpaste in the bathroom. The hotel has no elevators so you must climb the stairs, it has three floors. The reception area is very welcome with couches on the side. People with laptops can get wifi there it seemed. Attached to the main floor was their breakfast area. It had about 6 tables that seated 4 and there was always room as breakfast ran from 7am to 10am. The hotel also has a little patio garden off the first floor where there are two patio tables for you to sit. They have flowers, fresh basil, and other herbs growing there. The hallways are traditional and painted in robin's egg blue. Each room has its own air conditioner and safe. The breakfast that is included in the room rate is spectacular and is based on traditional Italian flair. They have an assortment of pastries, breads, abundant variety of cereals, cold cuts (prosciutto ham to die for), fresh baby mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, variety of juices, jams, cookies, egg omelets, fresh fruit salad and fruit. They have a wonderful lady that serves you fresh cups of cappucino or expresso if you want. We could of stayed all morning just eating. The hotel itself is situated in the old walls of Vatican and is superbly situated. It is five minutes walk from the Vatican (but you do not get the noise or crowdedness of the Vatican. It is about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the main metro, but we discovered on our last full day there that we were able to walk to many of the famous places from our hotel (Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and Spanish Steps to name a few). It is also 5 minute walk to the Tiber river with a castle museum across the river. Therefore, I can not say enough about the location of the hotel (location is great but still remained quiet and away from the crowds). I was able to visit the Basilica in the later afternoon to avoid all the crowds because we were so close. Retrospectively, we could of walked to way more places instead of taking the metro. The hotel is just 5 minute walk away from a main street of restuarants and small little markets (where you can buy water and snacks for way cheaper rates). We went to a restaurant called \"Romolo\" that was recommended by the staff at the hotel and it was great food served by friendly waiters. Less than 10 minute walk from the hotel. All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and kept the place very clean and a welcome air conditioned lobby after a hot day of exploring the eternal city. My husband and I would definitely recommend this hotel to people with children and without. THe service is impeccable, the breakfast is awesome, location is great! Although our trip to Rome started off frustratingly bad, we stumbled across a jewel of a hotel that surpassed our original hotel. A great family runned business (and I can see why it has lasted for over a century). On our check out date, the owner even gave us a container of their own extra virgin olive oil to take home.

Just behind St Peter\u00b4s and a short walk from the bus stop that will take you back to Termini (number 40). We had room number 26 on the second floor. The room was spacious and had a flat screen TV, a complete basket of amenities in the bathroom and slippers for each guest. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and a couple of bakeries. The tourist busses also stop nearby. A great find and a highly recommended property.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bergen, Norway", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Bergenfamily", "ReviewID": "UR10468584", "Content": "My family and me stayed at the Bramante for 5 nights during the end of september and beginning of october 2007. We found the hotel on the Internet and with some help from other hotels which were all occupied when we contacted them. We are very happy that the other hotels did not have any available rooms as we have now discovered a fantastic hotel with a superb location i Rome. It was our first time in Rome, and travelling with children from 4 years and upwards can be a bit of a challenge. However, with the Hotel Bramante as our \"home\" and plenty of good advice from the frendliest staff you can possibly think of, our holliday turned out to be fantastic. The hotel itself is very charming. We had a quadrople family room with an extra bed for the youngest member of the family. The room was very nice and clean. The bathroom was relatively small as you would expect in any big city, but could not have been nicer. Every morning we all woke up looking forward to a fantastic breakfast (even if we had a bit too much to eat the night before). Fresh bread, good selection of cheeses, fresh fruits, ham, cereals, juices and even cakes, all topped up with fantastic coffee and hot chockolate for the children. On a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 as best, I would give the rating 11. I have already recommende the hotel to other members of my family, and when we are going to Rome again, Bramante will be my obvious preferred choice. Thank you very much to all the Bramante-staff for making the stay so nice.

Needless to say it was much more than the normal 'standard fare' you get as a 'complementary breakfast'. The Hotel Staff, in particular Antonio, was very helpful in trying to get our bags from the airport. He must have called a minimum of 3 to 4 times each day until, on the 5th day we (finally) got our bags. The hotel staff was very professional, friendly, and made you feel welcome. They also can provide you with good recommendations for restaurants and for other information. I honestly cannot say enough good things about the hotel staff. My wife and I made the mistake of checking our baggage - and Alitalia had the bags for 4 days before they decided to deliver them on the 5th day. Note: They had the bags, knew where they were, and did not deliver them until the 5th day of our stay - the bags were also pilfered with items stolen from them - so DO NOT CHECK YOUR BAGS - please learn from our mistake!

It's not cheap: our room was 190 Euros per night. And the beds are very, very firm in the style that I find is common in Western Europe. Another thing to note is that there is no elevator and the stairs between the 2nd and 3rd floors are steep so if you have children, are elderly, or have heavy bags, just be aware. One thing that surprised me was that no one offered to help us with our bags, and I think that was because there seemed to be only one staff person working at any given time at the desk. This hotel is very refined and understated and quiet, and since you cannot stay anywhere in Rome for less than 150 Euros per night and call it a hotel, I would definitely recommend it.

We were greeted by the friendliest of staff, the guy behind the reception desk, who asked us at the end of our stay, if we did decide to review the hotel, to refer to him as 'the bald receptionist' (he did ask, I'm not just being rude!) we were then given the key to a beautiful room, (there are only about 25 rooms, so i'm assuming each are as loveley, clean and welcoming as ours was.) One of the great things about this Hotel is it's stunning location, just tucked away down a quaint little side street, but walk less than 100 yards to the end of the street and there is st Peters Basilica in front of you, stunning! The morning after our first nights stay we had a great breakfast, (in with the very reasonable price of the room) and the lady serving was lovely.
