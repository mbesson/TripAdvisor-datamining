The staff and the owners were very kind and friendly. It was as if they welcomed us at their home. The hotel is not what you expect from a hotel. The entrance of the hotel is at the first floor of an appartment building and can be reached by elevator or stairway to be reached from a court yard separated from the street and closed as from 20.00 hours. Of course, you\u2019ll get a key so that you can come in whenever you like. Please note, that the stairway and the elevator does not give you a luxury feeling. However, once inside the hotel, there is nothing wrong with it. It has a cozy reception with a wifi connection. Our room was at the street side, very neat, tidy and very well cleaned. Nice beds, a small TV with local network and also a small but complete bathroom. Breakfast is from 08.00 to 10. something. The lady owner starts with your breakfast as soon as you come in. Fresh home made croissants, omelets, coffee, a complete choice of cheese and meat as well as jam, Nutella etc. The two of us together paid \u20ac 106 per night including continental breakfast and 10% VAT. Local tax was \u20ac 4 per night to be paid in cash. The hotel is at a 5 minutes walking distance from the Leonardo Express, the train that starts at Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci) Airport and without any stop ends at Termini station. From Termini station you can reach any point of interest by bus or subway. (In our case, we walked (and walked and walked and \u2026) For \u20ac 1 per person you can buy a ticket for the bus. Please note that it is very crowed in the bus as it leaves the station and therefore impossible to buy your ticket in the bus. It is better to buy your ticket at the mobile ticket office in front of the busses. The hotel and Termini are located in the middle of a very lively area of the city. Many hotels, restaurants, shops etc., but also many street salesman with all kind of rubbish and beggars. Conclusion. Hotel Malu is a nice hotel where you can stay for an acceptable price in a friendly and kind atmosphere and enjoy an excellent breakfast. All the major points of interest, which are more or less located very close to each other, can be reached from the hotel by foot but also by bus. (I also addressed the negative review about this hotel which concerned a fire during the night. It will certainly not surprise anyone that the staff of the hotel has a different view on things.)", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cIdeal location, wonderfully hospitable staff\u201d", "Author": "Salsad8", "ReviewID": "UR124427797", "Content": "This hotel is ideally located very close to the Termini in Rome, a very short walk.

The room was also very quiet, which is sometimes hard to find in Rome. Worthy of note, we forgot our camera in the room, being in a hurry to leave. After realizing our error, we called the hotel in a panic, knowing full well it was possible that the staff could say it wasn't found. Arianna and Dana couldn't have been more responsive. They went to the Post Office very quickly and had to go more than once since the P.O.s in Italy just aren't as efficient as in the States. Our camera arrived safely a few days later.

We booked in at the Hotel Malu' as it seemed like the best option based on price, location and the generally positive Trip Advisor reviews. That said, here's a summary of our experience: Rooms - We booked a superior room which was very clean, spacious and comfortable. We had two windows, one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area that both offered pleasant street views with minimal road noise (since the hotel is on a side street). Coupled with that, there are not one, but two A/C units for the bedroom and sitting area. The cool curved brick ceiling gives the whole room a very Romanesque feel. Front desk/staff: Very courteous and helpful and with no hassles checking in or out. The guy that we met upon arrival was great at showing us the best way to get around Rome and he offered very good advice. Location - One of the hotel's best features. The Malu is less than a 10 minute walk from Rome's main train station, but can be a little tricky to find since there's no sign outside of the hotel. Look for the corresponding street number address first, and you'll come to a large door with a buzzer box on the side. You'll see a listing for \"Hotel Malu\", press it, and you should be let in the large wooden door. Immediately as you walk in, you'll hit a small courtyard, where you make an immediate left. Take a couple more paces and you'll find an elevator and stairs. Walk/ride up to the 1st floor, turn left, and you should hit the reception desk for the hotel. Another plus: Its located off a quiet side street which makes it great for sleeping since there's very little road noise. We walked alot in Rome, and were able to walk to the Forum and Colosseum in just over 20 minutes. The bottom line - You simply cannot beat the Hotel Malu's perfect location and convenience. Very good value based on this alone, coupled with clean rooms and a nice Roman atmosphere. Five stars, and would definitely recommend to fellow travellers, particularly those arriving in Rome via the rails.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "sunjan", "ReviewID": "UR120454034", "Content": "Super friendly and energetic front desk staff (young woman with her little sister as assistant, forgot their names).

The hotel will send you a map when you book, it's a side entrance of the Termino station and can be hard to find otherwise (enter on tack 24, walk along the platform until you reach track 28).

While there we had the most horrifying travel experience of our lives. The second night we were there we went to bed early. A few hours later I was awoken by the smell of smoke. No alarm went off (this hotel is in a high rise building and has no smoke detectors). We were unable to get out of the room because it was pitch black (due to black out shutters), the electrical fuse had blown so no lights would turn on, and the door would not unlock from the inside without a key which we could not find in the dark. After struggling to find the key and finally getting the door unlocked the night watchman refused to call for help. Our room was full of electrical smoke and we saw that part of the air conditioner was melted through. No matter how many times we asked the night attendant to call for help he would not. We then realized there were no phones in the hotel rooms as well so we were unable to call for help ourselves. Our room wreaked of burnt plastic and was full of white toxic smoke. Then the night attendant (who turned out to be the owner's father) flipped the circuit breaker back on which caused the electrical fire to start burning out of the control. The entire floor was now full of smoke and tons of other guests were coming out of their rooms coughing. The night attendant still refused to call the fire department. My husband was running in and out of the room desperately trying to find our passports and valuables while coughing hysterically. All of our clothes and belongings ended up being randomly flung all over the breakfast room. All of our clothes smelled horrible like burnt plastic. The owner did not show up until well after the fire had happened (even though he lives in the same building as the hotel - it seemed he did not want to be witness to what was happening so he could deny how bad it was later). When he did show up he was completely unapologetic. He moved us to a new room and then told us we could talk about what happened the next morning. The next morning he was not in the hotel at all. Because of this we sent an email that a friend of ours translated into Italian asking him to have our clothes laundered and refund us for the night of the fire. We went out for the day and came back in the afternoon. When we returned the owner ATTACKED my husband and accused us of setting fire to the room. He and his father came up with a lie and said we had placed something on the air conditioner and that caused the fire. We NEVER placed anything on the air conditioner. It was clearly in disrepair. Then, he accused my husband and I (in a raised voice) of ruining the night for the rest of the guests by daring to have a fire in our room. It was unbelievable. At the end of this deranged conversation he announced that he had spent the whole day calling the company we booked with and our credit card company to tell them it was all our fault. The owner was clearly covering up because he knew that he had endangered his guests. It was truly disgusting. This hotel is not safe, and I do not recommend staying here unless you want to play Russian roulette with your life. All the other hotels we stayed at in Italy had phones in the rooms as well as fire detectors besides Hotel Malu.

The entrance Is found through a residential court yard like many Rome hotels. Check in is at 12 which is great when your on an early flight and the team are really friendly. The rooms are very basic, tiled floors, bed and desk. This is not a hotel for a treat but its priced well for Rome and just around the corner from Termini. The En-suit was tiny and built into the room which means the noise travelled. We had a street facing room and it \u0175as noisy even with double glazing. Breakfast was nice, simple continental.

Incredibly friendly owners who went out of their way to accommodate us. We didn't put our names out for breakfast the night before, and came out in the morning after they had served everyone else, but they went out of their way to provide us with breakfast, which was plentiful. We were caught in a dilemma with check out, as we forgot to set our clocks ahead, and we over-stayed our visit a bit, but they never made us feel like it. In fact, they served us breakfast with a smile, and held our bags for us all day while we walked to the colosseum and waited for check in at our next place. The woman running the place was incredibly kind. I felt kind of bad during breakfast because I kept asking for more coffee, but not only did she bring me more espresso, she brought a couple of desert pastries along with it. I couldn't communicate much with her because my Italian is so limited, but it didn't matter because her warm smile and friendly hospitality spoke for itself. Same goes for the young man who works there as well. Anything we needed, he had. His English was very good, and I was able to have some good conversation with him while we stayed. Easy walks to the colosseum/ forum/etc. Very conveniently located to termini station.
