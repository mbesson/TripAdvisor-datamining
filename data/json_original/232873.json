We spoke to the reception staff and they agreed to move us the next day. We were then moved to the 3rd floor to a bigger and better room, still a shame about the TV, but at least we could get the BBC world service... the room was adequate and the bedding and towels were changed daily. The shower and Bath were not the best and there was quite a bit of mould as the window overhangs the bath. Beware of the lifts if you don't like small spaces as they are only big enough for one. Also be aware the hotel is very noisy, lots of students stay here, and I don't know who georgie was but they need to get him and alarm clock as someone was banging on his door every morning at 5am for half an hour trying to wake him up. Breakfast was adequate but very boring with no hot food at all not even toast. Also the only healthy option was cornflakes. There is a supermarket just up the road from the Hotel where you can buy fresh fruit and yoghurts. Advice in general, the easiest way to get to the hotel from the airport is to get the Blue Cotrail bus outside of the airport to the last stop which is Cornelia ( underground station) it cost 3.50 euro's unlike the directions the hotel gave us which cost us 10 euro's each. Once you get off the bus at the final stop, walk past the bus terminal which is in the middle of the road on the left hand side, you will see a newspaper stand walk behind that (opposite the petrol station) and then carry on, up the left hand side. Walk up the road you will see a sign for the Giotto Hotel carry on until you see a carpark (for the supermarket) on the left, walk past the carpark and turn left, cross over onto the right hand side of this turning, you will see a small parade of shops and a news stand take the second right there is a small parade of shops, and you will see the hotel down the street on the left side. Getting around Rome is easy from the hotel go to the Tabbach shop and but a bus ticket they are 1 euro each and last 75 mins, walk back to the supermarket car-park and you will see the bus-stop, get the 49 if you want to go into cenral rome, you need to change to the 492 at the stop past the Vatican. if you want to visit the Vatican then I would advise going in the afternoon as it is very busy in the mornings. Food and drink are very expensive in the centre of the town, we bought drinks and snacks near the Hotel and then had picnics next to some of the beautiful fountains (Trevi) is stunning. Rome itself is beautiful, there is loads to see, we walked most of the time as each street has something to offer.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tzaneen, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cExpected More\u201d", "Author": "DonovanL_12", "ReviewID": "UR126723863", "Content": "With our trip to Rome we pre-booked our room from South Africa and with great dissapointment we arrived at Giotto and was cramped up like sardines in a tin!

The pictures on the website make it look like a lovely place to stay but do not be fooled, the hotel looks nothing like the pictures. It was dirty, smelly and run down. The rooms are very small, i have a bigger bedroom at home in a 2 bed apartment!! The bathroom has clearly never been cleaned properly as the taps were green and there was mould all around the bath. The shower was hanging off the wall, the toilet seat was cracked and the window was full of water between the glass. The double bed was 2 single beds put together and was very uncomfortable. There was heating in the room which luckily in ours it worked but many others were complaining about having to sleep in their coats as hotel staff wouldnt let them change rooms. The breakfast was cheese, meet, bread roll and stale croissants, no fresh juice and they serve cold water for a cup of tea. The bar hardly had a choice a drinks. The hotel staff were very unhelpful, rude and ignorent and every single time we went to the room we had to go back to reception to get the key card reset. The reception area looks quite nice but the rest of the hotel is old and dark but apparently it has just had a referb....dont think that is true!! Around the hotel is run down appartments, graffiti all over the walls, damaged cars and to top it all off you have a 10 - 15 minute walk along a rather busy road to reach the metro before you can get to the centre of Rome. We spoke to a a few different people staying in the hotel and all were very unimpressed...like us they booked online thinking the oictures looked lovely and were all very disappointed when they arrived. The hotel was so dirty the heating systems were blowing out dirt and dust which made a lot of people ill including myself. Also what you arent told is that they use this hotel for students on a regulary basis so you end up with a lot of noise and excited children running around at all hours of the night and the staff are unwilling to tell them otherwise.

We used TripAdvisor to see the comments regarding this hotel prior to our trip and we held our breaths regarding what to expect. The comments did not disappoint! (Trust me I've been to developing countries and their hotels were better than this one and I am not a fussy traveller.) I also realize that while one really does only sleep in the hotel and spends the remaining time sightseeing this hotel really wasn't that comfortable. This is a BUDGET hotel, which may be suitable for school age students who are on their first trip to Europe or on a band trip. The hotel is showing its age, and the pictures on its website: http://www.hotelgiotto.eu/en/photo-gallery.php might have been taken last decade. The chambermaids and cleaning staff tried their hardest to keep it clean. We had a room which had a shower that backed up and the cleaning crew was sent to unclog the shower in the middle of the night. The cupboard to hang clothing was filled with five mismatched clothes hangers. The walls were very thin we could hear the tv and conversations of the room occupants next door crystal clear. Like the hotel's website states: the hotel is in a quiet residential neighbourhood. I am from a big city and there is a difference between a \"quiet residential neighbourhood\" and one that is what we call \"suspect.\" This one was suspect. The hotel's proximity to public transit is a good 10 minute walk through an alley way and a very tight tight sidewalk to get to the main road where the bus stop is. The Vatican City is a good 45 minute bus ride from the hotel. The Corneilia Metro station is10-15minutes by bus and the bus stop is not the easiest to find once you exit the Metro Station (via the Aurelia Street exit). The kicker however was the \"stellar\" front desk customer service. We asked the front desk agent how long it would take to reach the airport from the hotel and how much it would be to hire a taxi to take us to the airport on the day we were departing. He was clearly on the computer messaging a friend. He took the time to finish typing his response before acknowledging us and then stated with a smirk \"Well, there's always traffic in Rome.\" I really wanted to say \"no SH@T! Sherlock\" but I held back. In Summary: Pros: -Bed Bug Free! (I think crossing fingers thus far!) -Basic Breakfast -Has a refrigerator -clean towels and hot water Cons: -Dreadful customer service -Old plumbing -Funky musty smell -Cigarette burns in the curtains -Distance from transportation Summary: Pay the extra money and stay closer to the centre of the city.

It stunk of flea powder - it was.....extremely unpleasant. Other contributing factor to this bad review of Hotel Giottto...location. To get to this hotel from Termini (the central Metro station and also the rail station) we had to (1) take Metro to very last stop, (2) walk a block and take bus 5 stops, then (3) walk a quarter of a mile.

Our room was quite large and a place for our case to sit although we spoke to people who said their room was small but again spotlessly clean. There was a plentiful supply of shampoo/body wash and for a basic hotel we found no problems realy. We were out every day straight after breakfast because come on we were in Rome and wanted to see all the sights. The hotel is a little way from the centre but just a few minute walk away we could buy bus/metro tickets for 1 euro and we found it quite easy to get to the centre by metro or bus. The staff were very friendly and polite and whenever we asked them anything they were happy to help. Several people said the bar/cafe across the road looked a dive and uninviting, well we went in every night and found the owner delightful and eager to help. We ate the first night there as very tired and had basic pasta and pizza which were hot and tasty. Each night after that when we had walked our legs off exploring the delights of Rome we called in there for a couple drinks and a snack. Once again the lady owner was very friendly and happy to oblige. The drinks and food was resonably priced and cheaper than many places in town. We would recomend it for sure. On the whole we could not find a lot of fault with the hotel exept maybe the breakfast could be a bit more exiting. We did though find plentul cereal, coisants, bread rolls and cheese and meats and fruit. A basic breakfast but enough to start the day, again all spotlessly clean.One thing was the coffe was not good but a trivial point. What more could you want from a basic cheaply priced hotel.

It was necessary to pay too at once. The sum for residing at me was 170 euro for 3 days, I have paid the first days. My big troubles and hotel Giotto shame further have begun. To me have given out a room key, I have risen on the floor and have opened a room. Actually, I lived in different hotels and hostels from 1 star in Lisbon from 2 stars in Tokyo, but ANYWHERE (I underline, even in Japan where numbers simply microscopic, but improbably cozy) weren't the so worthlessly planned space. The daylight didn't get to a room AT ALL, number was so close that my suitcase didn't climb through in an aperture between a case and a bed. If I have seen this number on a photo at booking, I for what wouldn't go to this hotel, but Giotto have placed photos of spacious number with the big bed. In a reality it was similar to close hospital chamber in which there is on a bedside table an old lamp TV. It having appeared in number, I have understood that I don\u2019t want to live in it. There it was impossible to be minutes. I left downwards to use FREE (as it has been specified on booking.com, now they have already corrected) wi-fi, BUT, by itself, have answered me that the Internet paid. All right, I have paid about 15 euro in an hour. Has then approached on a reception to warn that, possibly, tomorrow I will move down. On what the answer has been received: then pay one more days that have made book for 3 days and leave before term. Good - everything, everything if only to move down. Next morning hotel boy has literally partitioned off to me road and here the most interesting has begun. They couldn't understand among themselves in any way, in what number they have occupied me. Then it was found out that at me 2 (!) reservations through a site booking.com. That is one, on which I has driven also the second not cancelled. I PRECISELY knew that cancelled the first book. Besides, it has been confirmed by my account and the letter on mail!!! ANY SECOND RESERVATION was. But hotel boy hold the ground also in mandative tone has told to me to pay for days but not cancelled reservation. Yes, talked to me in mandative tone. There was a small probability that money nevertheless has come on a card and the employee of hotel has tried to pay to it an account part, but was refused. On what to me has been told: \u00abDo you understand, it is ECONOMIC CRIME to specify number of an insolvent card at booking?\u00bb . Hear it \u2013 economic crime!!! But every clever person knows \u2013 you can pay by cash too. It\u2019s really bad place even for 1 night. 70 euro for rudeness? No, thank you.

You could hear pretty much everything that next door were doing. The rooms however, were cleaned everyday, with new bed sheets and new towels etc. In the description of the hotel, it states it has a Bar, yes it does have a bar, which is NEVER open! So therefore there is nothing to really do in the evening, as the hotel is situated in the middle of nowhere! There is a little cafe opposite, but it looked at bit rough.

I think if you are planning a one/two night stay in this lovely city and you are not bothered about nightlife, Hotel Giotto is probably not a bad place to stay, and reasonably priced.

I have stayed in five star hotels to three star and spent 6 years in the army sleeping in fields and I can definately say this hotel is not a three star. The breakfast was adequate but did not have fresh coffee or fruit. Considering there was a fruit stall next to the hotel and we are in Italy - home of coffee, I thought this was very poor. The hotel used a coffee machine to supply all guests with cold, awful tasting coffee. The location of the hotel is not next to a metro station (like stated), it is a 20 minute walk and for two young females it is a little daunting to walk on a busy road with no path. Yes the bus stop is a little closer but it is still a long way from the centre of Rome and the metro is more convienient. The hotel has potential to be alot better. All the hotel needs to do is open up the terrace (which looks abandoned) as there is not a place for guests to sit and relax, incorporate fresh food into the breakfast menu and update and fix amenities in the rooms.

As a Manhattanite, I see MANY tourists come in and out of my beloved city. Some are more comfortable doing what the masses do and staying where the masses stay. Times Square is just fine, but those in-the-know are quite cognizant of where the deeper, more cultural wonders of our city exist. Of COURSE, this experienced urban dweller wanted to see all of the tourist traps of Rome. But, I also wanted to do as the Romans do. Hotel Giotto was perfect for this. The hotel is outside of Rome proper, so to speak. I would sort of compare it to staying in Berkeley and traveling into San Fran, or staying in the very hip and posh areas of Williamsburg or Park Slope and traveling to Manhattan. We did everything by bus and train, which was completely accessible and near the hotel. It was so nice because the hotel's location was away from all the tourists - it was more \"neighborhood\" friendly - and if I were staying in Manhattan, I'd rather stay in the West Village than Times Square, which was a similar experience here. Giotto was located near better, more authentic restaurants (rather than the Hard Rock Rome), was in a quite neighborhood near a school, had a wonderful grocery store within walking distance and a nice, higher end gastronomia (for NYKERS a delicatessen) even closer. The gastronomia sold slices of authentic pizzas, inexpensive bottles of wine, cheese, crackers, Nutella, etc. It was perfect for stocking our hotel for times when we were hungry and places were closed (due to jet lag or during siestas). On to the facilities themselves. Everything was clean. The rooms ARE small. Seemed everything was smaller in Rome compared to the US thoughg: tiny cars, smaller portions of food, etc. I didn't mind because, again, everything in NYC (apartments, hotel rooms, space on the subways) except buildings and population is probably smaller than most places due to space. Plus, I was always out of the hotel. You're in Rome, get out and see it! When I was at the hotel, everything was modern and clean and the right size and space for what I needed.

The hotel was difficult to find from the Rome Bus station even for the Taxi Driver, as much time spent map reading as driving! The first room (No 7) we were given was down a short flight of steps. I opened the door and didnt even stop, turned around, went back to reception and pushed the key back at the receptionist saying firmly NO!! The word Tiny does not do it justice. Two small beds almost at floor level. No view from window, no wardrobe, just a hanging rail. The receptionist apologised and said he could only move us to another small room (No 8) (but better than the first). The door to the second room could only be opened half way as it hit the bed. The wardrobe door could only be opened half way as it too hit the bed. Again No View from the window AT ALL, just the kitchen skylight. I walked through a door to see a toilet and sink, looked around and looked for another door for a bathroom (search didnt take long!) I looked back into the toilet room and above the toilet was a shower head!! To have a shower we had to remove the toilet roll from the holder to stop it getting wet and straddle the toilet to take a shower!! I had to shower first so I could coax out the cockroaches and get rid of them before my partner took her shower!! The second day they did move us to a decent room, air conditioned and quite satisfactory. There is nothing in walking distance to speak of. We found a Chinese restaurant and a little local restaurant, nothing else at all (the hotel doesn't do any food apart from breakfast). Nothing will make up for the outrageous first night and Wild Stallions wouldn't take me back to the hotel Giotto!!

Would suggest, however, that you eat before returning to the hotel as there is really NOWHERE to eat - except a small take away pizzaria and an average Chinese restaurant.
