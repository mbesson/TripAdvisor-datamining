The hotel cancelled my booking and even worst did not show any sign of empathy and hardly apologised for the inconveniance. They thought it was acceptable to book them instead at a hotel 10 miles away and were not even ready to discuss the possibility of accomadating them. I have not seen the hotel so I can't really give it a mark! I will never book again wih confort inn as when I plan a holiday or a break, I want to be able to rely on a hotel. I have travelled a lot and I never had a last minute cancellation from a hotel before.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington U.K", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for a London hotel\u201d", "Author": "mags48", "ReviewID": "UR77473775", "Content": "Room was much larger and more comfortable than Central London hotel rooms.

The breakfasts were good and there was plenty of choice for evening meals from the various restaurants on the complex.

Our double room was fine - clean and comfy, with a powerful shower. Others in our group had twin rooms, which also had air con and a fridge which was a bonus. Our double bed was actually two twins pushed together, which was fine for us. It made the bed huge! Free wifi was also available. The rest of the hotel was also clean and comfy, the staff were pleasant and the bar staye dopen as long as we wanted to stay up: bonus! The prices were also very reasonable for a North London hotel - \u00a32.80 for Boddingtons & \u00a33.00 for a pint of lager. There was a McDonald's, Cafe Rouge, Nando's, cinema, bowling alley & other restaurants on the same site as the hotel, which was brilliant. The only real down side is that the hotel is over a mile away from the nearest tube station, so we got taxis there - but local cab firms were prompt, polite and good value for London. I would definitely stay here again - only 20 mins from Central London by tube, offered free parking, had a lovely breakfast and a good value bar.

Hotel staff were all pleasant check in took 5 minutes and questions we had were answered effieciently., Room was massive, we had recently stayed elsewhere paid more for a tiny room so was impressed. Paid \u00a359 through octopus travel so most impressed once again. The bed was big and comfy although on the hottest day of the year we had to kick off the duvet as it was a bit big and bulky. Breakfast and parking were included in this price and we went to eat about 8.45am just before it was due to finish and it was still fresh and hot and tasty, although as usual toasters are sooo slow your breakfast got a little chilly waiting for it. Checking out was fine and simple once again pleasent staff and a check out of 11am was a bonus when your on a leisure break so thank you for that.

It's a few mins drive from East Finchley tube station on the northern line (loads of parking here for \u00a31 per day on Sundays) and close to the end of the M1 for a quick get away home to the Wirral. It all worked well last year, so we did the same for the 2010 marathon. Easy to locate on the main road near the Vue cinema/restaurant area on the main road. Plenty of free parking. Satnav took us right to the hotel. Fast check in and friendly and efficient staff. We had rooms 332 & 336, which were nice and quiet. No great views from any room, but it is Finchley. Rooms are standard lodge type, but clean and with everything you need. Good quality king sized bed. Plenty of storage. The outside window would not lock, but not really a security issue on the second floor. Bathroom has a good sized bath and in-bath shower. The hot water was blisteringly hot and could be dangerous for small children - the hotel thermostat needs lowering a bit. The adjacent Cafe Rouge provided us with a fine evening meal with pleasant and attentive staff. 2 min walk to the Vue cinema. Only problem we had was that the loo took an age to fill up, so we topped up the cister from the shower head to spped it up. Room 332. Breakfast was good quality for a lodge, with fried and scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, beans & tomatoes. Plus the usual cereals, juices etc. Nice filter coffee. Check out was fast and efficient. Free wifi in all rooms. Apart from the loo niggle, we slept well and had no complaints. We would use it again.

Its a standard chain hotel, clean a nd functional. Situated in Finchley North London about 7 miles from the centre, its next to a leisure park with bowling alley, cinema and a number of chain restaurants so if you're staying for one night only theres no need to go to central london. If you do need to go into the centre, the nearest tube station is East Finchley on the Northern Line. Thats about a 25 minute walk, though there is a bus which runs every 10 minutes or so (less often on sunday). Once on the tube it takes about 20 minutes to get to the west end. Breakfast was included in the internet rate I got and was full english on a buffet basis--it was ok, not great, but buffets seldom are. My only problem with the hotel was the bed which was one of the least comfy I think I've ever encountered. I could feel the springs/ ridges of the mattress and had to lay on top of the quilt to make it more comfy . In summary, Ok chain hotel and not a bad price for proximity to London.

Sadly, I rate this place as one of the worst hotels I've ever had to stay in and struggle to find anything positive to say about the place. The whole place is shabby and tired and I agree with the comments regarding the single very slow lift and the distance to walk to some rooms. On the nights I stayed there the number of vans in the car park outnumbered the cars by about ten to one which says it all in my book. Perhaps I just caught it on a bad week though. My first room smelt as though someone had chain smoked all night on the previous day and after complaining I was moved to another room. Although the air was fresher the room was tired, the bathroom grubby and the bed hard and uncomfortable. The peeling formica on the sticky breakfast table was probably the final straw; my colleague and I both complained to our company and will not be staying here again.
