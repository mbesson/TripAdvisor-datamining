{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Should know how to clean the room better...it's not a bar! This is the hotel for the youngsters who love to take a strike down in kuta beach, do some shopping, have some nightlife, get smashed and your room is just next door.I like the set up of the room, simple and modern with a good lighting. Although I found the room was very dusty. I had to pay for the hotel slippers and laundry bag. They make it like it's a souvenir of Hardrock instead of just a hotel amenities. I found it rather capitalize than accommodating...The service was ok. Location was good for tourists though, near by the mall, the markets, the good local restaurants (oh I haven't start yet about the restaurants in Bali, but don't worry I will!). I wouldn't recommend the beach to my friends though. Too crowded and dirty... JUst stay on their beach-like pool, better than the actual beach...If you still interested to stay there, please make sure that the staff clean it before you're checking in.

Staff were friendly and George at the front counter was very helpful when we needed to get a doctor. The drinks and food are very expensive you need to add ++ on to everything, the boys spent a few hours at the pool bar on day and it came to $100aus worked out to be about $8.00 for a hot beer. Breakfast has good selection but can get busy. Pool area is huge and i would say is the best assest of this hotel. We went out to eat everynight so cant comment of the food at night. Bands at hotel are ok but you get a better night out at the Bounty or other clubs. The only thing we were a little shocked about was the lack of Australians at the hotel seemed to be people from Singapore, Malaysia and othe asia countries.

We really enjoyed the hotel and the service was excellent. The location is good for shopping and the beach is right across the street. My wife commented to me that this hotel would perfect for younger people or singles looking to hit the nightlife. If your on your honeymoon and looking for peace and tranquility, then this hotel is not for you. I did a ton of research before we booked and I thought that 3 days would be a good amount of time to spend in Kuta. We then spent the remainder of our trip at a hotel in Jimbaran. The balance of the two places was perfect.The pool was large and very nice. We enjoyed lounging at the pool and even had a pool side romantic dinner, which was good. The breakfast buffet was good but very busy. It didn't matter what time we got there, it was packed. We also did a couples massage which was fantastic. The rooms are good sized but do need some updating. Also, the walls are paper thin so you can hear anyone talking outside of your room in the hallways. It didn't bother us, but I did notice it.

We stay at the hotel for 3 nights, the hotel enviroment was very nice with very tight security, staff was very polite. The swimming pool was really big, But one thing that we wasn't happy was that w arrived there in the morning as its too early so we can't check in to the hotel. So we waited at the lobby hopefully they can help us to do a early check in and indeed the reception staff was very good she give us 1 room first so that we can check in to rest for a while and get changed. Nearby the hotel has a lot of shops for us to do shopping, Please don't go to the shop just 2 steps away from the kentucky fried chicken restaurant. i think the shop is called Rusty or Volcom. when i was about to pay for a tshirt that i really like, I found some stain on the collar and so I ask the staff to get me a new piece and she wasn't very happy and use indonesian language to talk to her collegue saiding something bad about me. My boyfriend saw it and wasn't happy so my boyfriend drag me out of the shop and said don't buy since they not happy getting a new piece for me. The staff there is really very rude, please don't go to that shop to have the same bad experience like me. For massage you can go to the one next to a coffeehouse just another few steps away from kentucky fried chicken restaurant. their massage is good and cheap service also good. At night after all the shop is closed nothing for you to do you can go to their central stage to have a drink and listen to the songs that the liveband sang, the liveband is really good.

One of the best pool areas I have seen in a 4 star property. Great location, Kuta beach is right across the street. When I say the beach, I am talking about the crowded and dirty part of the beach, though. The rooms were a disappointment. Looked like a cheap motel room. I think thats the look they are going for. The television set was mounted on the wall like a hospital room. They were renovating some rooms near us, and while the noise was minimal at night, the smell of paint was all over the place.Also, don't book any activities from the hotel. We booked a morning of parasailing and it was one of the worst expeiernces of our lives. We were taken to a rundown place in Nusa Dua, with rundown equipment and had to go through a really agonizing sales pitch to try some more watersports. Waste of a morning.My recommendation, if you plan to spend most of the timeoutside, on the beach etc. (which you should if you are in Bali) stay in one of the cheaper hotels littered around the kuta beach area.

We recently returned from Bali and had 5 nights at Hard Rock Hotel with our 15yr daughter/12yr old son. We had a Superior room with 2 x king size beds. Basically a nice hotel room, not a lot of room but did the job, couldn't have spent much longer in it though. However, pool more than made up for it. Best pool we have ever seen anywhere, kids had a ball. Never had a problem getting a lounge, one day we rented a cabana for $14 (hotel dicount voucher), normally about $20. This was fantastic, had 2 day beds, ceiling fan, phone (for ordering meals/drinks), lovely relaxing day, Need to book this few days in advance though and wish we had booked one for other days even if we weren't there the whole time. Towels for pool are provided Great location if Kuta is your thing, very close to shops and restaurants, used laundry in Poppies Lane, hotel laundry expensive. Breakfast was magnificent, plenty of variety and never had to wait for a table despite going different times each day. Reception Manager and staff were fantastic and organised transfers to our villa after 5nights and gave us late checkout so we could watch AFL Grand Final on our last day there. Got invited one night to cocktail party, was free drinks and lovely nibblies for an hour - took full advantage of that! Put kids to bed one night after dinner and came back down to listen to band  have more drinks, great band each night but drinks pricey. We bought lunch couple of times from the bakery, great salad rolls for about $3-$4, only needed half each  we took them to pool with us.Rooms were cleaned daily and bottles of water supplied, once we explained we had 4 people, not 2, we then got 4 towels replenished each day. Didn't use the spa facilities, bit pricey compared to out on the street. We did Waterbom from here (walking distance) and Bali Baik Ride so had 2 full days out. Would we stay again? - only if it moved to different location LOL.

Been there for quite a few times and found it's still the same old HR Hotel we love. Booking made through hotel website, easy and fast. Got the package that included additional breakfast for children and airport transfer. A good deal. Airport pick-up was fast and efficient. Check-in was a breeze, the staff very polite and helpful. Since we've been here a couple times, they already have my data in their system that makes check-in extra fast! Also a welcome card from the hotel manager was in our room to greet us. Looks like they valued their loyal customers here. Breakfast was the usual crowded affair, however we've always been able to get seats. Food selection is very good, and gets replenished regularly. However the ratio of staff to customers in the restaurant that seems to be on the low side. It takes a long time to get your tea or coffee refilled, since they always seems to ran out of it every couple of minutes. The huge swimming pool was very nice with a sandy beach section and swim-up bar, sand volleyball court and daily activities, and their staff around the pool were as helpful and courteous as always. The cabanas around the pool are just as amazing as we remembered. You can lounge around and relax in there for a whole day in between taking dips in the swimming pool's crystal clear warm water. Food service from the poolside bar is quite fast and tasty. Last year my daughter and I took surfing lessons from the hotel's surfing school. This time we have another go at it and the same people who helped us last year were there to help us having fun on the beach, teaching us new tricks and encouraging us to try some new variations. The bar at the entrance of the hotel, the Centerstage, has a nightly performances by some very good bands. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and it's a great place to just chill in the evening after the children were put in bed. The Hard Rock Cafe is attached to the hotel's swimming pool. The food selection is good and they come in big portions. The best thing to do for lunch there is to dine al fresco in the back patio overlooking the pool. If you want variation, a few steps from the hotel there are gazillions of restaurants and eateries around the place. There are some convenience stores very close to the hotel in case you need additional snack and/or drink. Looks like the hotel tried to add 'funky' gimmicks to attract customers. This year they have just added a wallclimbing facility to the list of their things to do in the hotel. We didn't use the facility at this time, but plan to the next time we're there. Check out was done very fast, the airport transfer left on time and the driver was very helpful with all our luggage (which had expand and even gave birth to some other bags).We've seen quite some familiar faces among the staff from our previous visits. It seems that the management did a good job of retaining a very happy staff, and in turn they are going out of their way trying to please their customers! Staff at the Deli even let us use the internet for free at one time after we bought some ice cream.", "Date": "Sep 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR869459155", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KuwaitiExpat"}, {"Content": "great and lovely hotel Stayed 4 nites at this hotel last June with my family on holiday trip and we loved it so much.

The location and pool area were great and just what we remembered, but somehow the overall experience this time left a lot to be desired. Firstly, our check-in was a total screw up. We had booked via a travel website and gotten confirmed reservations (paid for in advance 3 - 4 months before via credit card). Three days before we arrived, we called to inform them our flight comes in late (10+pm) AND to confirm our room reservations (2 king rooms) AND that they will hold our rooms. They assured us over the phone that everything was confirmed. All seemed fine until we arrived. First, we were told that they were almost at full occupancy and there were no rooms (!!!!???). When we pointed out that we had confirmed reservations and paid in FULL and had called to confirm everything was in order, the reception clerk then backpaddled and said - oh, we have one room, but it is a suite and all of you will have to share the bed for one night, then check out the next day and check in again for your confirmed rooms. But I can't guarantee that you will get the rooms you booked. This was obviously something we do not expect or should accept from any establishment. When we pointed out we had booked 2 rooms and 5 - 6 adults couldn't possibly share ONE bed in ONE room, the guy then changed his tune AGAIN and said, How about some of you take the Suite and check again tmrw for a king room, and the rest can get their rooms? We refused to budge, as by this time, his stories were getting stranger and he started to offer all sorts of different options which he had insisted earlier on were not available. None of the options obviously were what we had booked. After we stood our ground for a good 15 - 20 mins and insisted on getting what we had paid for (which were 2 king rooms), they suddenly became available once we asked to see the general manager. It was terrible being welcomed in friendly Bali this way and the first time that any of us had experienced any sort of really bad service in Bali. It really left a bad taste in our mouths and made us determine NEVER to return to the Hard Rock again despite our love for their pool area. Having said that, to be fair, the pool area and cabanas are really great and the service staff there were wonderful. As our flight out of Bali was at 10pm, the staff also told us we could use the spa toilets to shower after we had checked out, which was nice since we could use the hot tubs and cold plunge pool in the spa too. The pool was large enough for everyone and has a good swim-up pool bar. However, on a few days, there were not enough deck chairs and people had to spread their towels on the floor!! The toilets at the pool also started to resemble a public toilet by the beach - dirty and wet! I used to love the fun vibe, the rock music at the pool and the friendly service at the Hard Rock. But I think other establishments who try harder and have equally good accommodation and pools deserve my money more. Bali, especially, has countless options for really good accommodation, so I will vote with my feet and my money the next time round.", "Date": "Sep 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR160340848", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Rach212"}, {"Content": "Great Location, Friendly Staff       Swim up bar", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR628971621", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "msladyk"}, {"Content": "A Little Bit Disappointed The Hard Rock Hotel pool area was fantastic, however you could be anywhere in the world.

I can find a million reasons to crib about the Hard Rock Hotel in Bali. The fact that it stands in stark contrast to the cultural, aesthetic and architectural beauty of Bali, the fact that it is located in the only area of Bali that I thought was truly disgusting, the lacklustre, crowded beach in front, the fact that one needs to weave ones way thru a 20 minute traffic jam to get in or out\u9225\ufe39\u20ac? I could go on and on. However, I was aware of all this before I even booked the hotel (and as you\u9225\u6a9de probably guessed, did not really stay here out of choice!). Therefore, I came with rather few expectations. At the very least, I was expecting a reasonably luxurious, clean room that I could shut myself in if need be. But HRH failed to meet even those threadbare expectations.We (a group of 10 'young adults') moved from a beautiful, tranquil villa complex in Umalas into Hard Rock. We were initially booked at the Villa for 5 days, but after a friend eagerly recommended and pleaded we stay at Hard Rock, we reluctantly decided to give it a try for 2 days. We moved from paradise at 70$\u9225\u6a9a to a hell of our own making at double the price.My complaints about the room and hotel are too many, and I really don\u9225\u6a9b want to get into details, in a nutshell: crappy reception, jarring corridor, tacky 70\u9225\u6a9a style room, bathroom  amenities that one would expect in 2* hotel. I\u9225\u6a92l give the devil it\u9225\u6a9a due: the swimming pool complex is stunning and the members of the staff like everywhere else in Indonesia are sincere and warm.The Hard Rock would be a disappointment anywhere, but if I consider the fact that remarkably stunning properties are available at the same price elsewhere in Bali, I feel cheated and angry.", "Date": "May 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR477939899", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "rahulkale"}, {"Content": "Good location, clean and nice room I spent one night in Kuta and stayed at this hotel.

I suggest you to pick one of the hotel @ Tanjung Benoa, or if in Kuta maybe something like AlamKulkul (for more economical rate). HRH isn't the place for honeymooners nor balinesse ambience seeker traveler. The superior room is quite economical similar to harris and mercure, but with pictures of singers and rockers on the wall instead of balinesse art, and a bigger bathroom with big round tub. As for the deluxe room, well save your money cause really you wont feel any different when compare to the superior one. However, if your intention of coming to bali is to party or to shop till you drop then this hotel is your best bet. The location is superb within walking distance to practically everything from cafe's  restaurants, clubs, and shops. The swimming pool is bound to give you enough fun for one whole day. The service is ok, the staff are young and more laid back people. Braeakfast is good. And of course Hard Rock Cafe is right next door. In short, if you're young and you're coming with a bunch of friends ready to enjoy the scenes, you could pay less and stay at mercure for the same reason, but you'll pay more at HRH for the pool and rocking atmosphere.", "Date": "Feb 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR604072863", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "azracat"}, {"Content": "loved every second from the moment we walked it, everything was amazing! could not have asked for a better atmosphere, room, staff etc. definately will stay again!", "Date": "Jan 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR172540971", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kakkles"}, {"Content": "A Bit Old But Happening Hotel       Hard Rock Photoshoot", "Date": "Jan 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR475555270", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "marcuswcp"}, {"Content": "consideration chooses room       Family Room ( not recommended for family )", "Date": "Jan 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR307218578", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Rizal"}, {"Content": "My Best choice ever.. never bore me a minute :)       At the pool...", "Date": "Dec 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR120107058", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "FuzzSpore"}, {"Content": "Absolutely nice place to stay It's the 2nd time we stayed there and we still love it.What we liked most was the fact that it is close to Kuta Town (a mere 5 minute walk) and the fact that we get to watch the live band every night (either live or in our room through the TV).The pool is wonderful, the sandy beach area is a plus!", "Date": "Nov 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR203174999", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ariesha"}, {"Content": "A unique getaway       Hard Rock Bali", "Date": "Nov 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR719163930", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Hburn10"}, {"Content": "Loved It THis was my 5th time to bali and when I go I like to stay somewhere nice 4 stars, My husband  I stayed for our honeymoon with another couple.

Booked through a travel agent as we had some travel vouchers to use.The hotel is very conveniently located in Kuta itself. Cross the main road in front of the hotel entrance and you have Kuta beach waiting for you. Unfortunately, the beach was a bit of a letdown. Our first excursion was at low tide, and the beach was FILTHY. Plus for some strange reason, there was a tractor on the beach. There were also too many touts around who did not seem to go away even after you've said no. But I digress, back to the hotel.The hotel is funky and the reception is not all that bad. In fact they were quite accomodating. I discovered that my room was not internet enabled as it was a Superior Room. Only the Deluxe Rooms had it (albeit at a price). When I asked the Front Desk, they gladly changed my room to a Deluxe room at no extra cost. I can't remember the cost of the internet service but it was sold in vouchers for blocks of 4 hours and 8 hours.The rooms were a nice size, very comfortable and clean. The bathroom is very big with a huge bathtub. Unfortunately, there were no toiletries, only a soap dispenser on the wall (kinda like those above sinks in public toilets). From the hotel, you can walk around to all the shops very easily. There is no need to take any form of transport. The buffet breakfast has quite a large spread and the menu changed somewhat everyday which was good.The only problem with the hotel was that the rooms had EXTREMELY thin walls. The main doors to the accomodation wings were good in keeping out the loud sounds of the band at the lobby. However, the room doors and walls themselves were very thin. You can hear people walking and talking in the corridors. It's even worse at night as late night revellers (it IS Hard Rock) make their way back to the rooms so you're waken up in the wee hours because of all the noise they make.Convenient location yes.

Lots going on in the hotel, lots to do and a band playing every night. Security is very high here although the Hard Rock Cafe open to the public has access to the hotel and I found this the only worry as security was pretty none existent here and anyone could have wandered in through the hotel entrance side. Kuta was the right place for the kids too and we enjoyed the surf and surfing, the great beach and the shopping. We had a driver take us around the island on a couple of days and that was around \u62e225 for a 12 hour day - amazing! I loved this hotel and would go back to it again next year if I could afford it! Swimming pool was the best in Bali - massive complex with cabannas, variety of eating places, good food, great entertainment and for those with young children a terrific nursery and activity programme for all ages of children. The rooms are not overly luxurious as say a Stamford but the facilities in the place are great and as I said the staff so friendly and welcoming and helpful.
