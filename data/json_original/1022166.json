{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Was a lovely hotel We stayed here a few years ago and had a fabulous time. We then stayed again this February and were surprised by the noise - a massive block of villas has opened nearby so there is a massive increase in traffic. We were also on the ground floor with a table outside the room so were constantly disturbed by other guest sitting outside our room smoking and talking loudly. There were even staff meetings outide our room. The furnishings and decoration are also looking a little shoddy. The staff are still excellent - it just isn't really a restful break anymore which is a real shame.", "Date": "Aug 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR806213014", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tomski2001"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d1022166-r19572837-Sarinande_Beach_Inn-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1022166", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
