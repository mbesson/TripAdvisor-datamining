Cappuchino coffee had to be requested from the bar and was not automatically offered - suprising for Italy. Our room was dark and we had constant problems with the lights - which had to keep being fixed by staff - when available.

It is a bit of a nuisance getting a taxi from Termini station when you arrive on the airport bus especially if you do what we did, knowing full well not to , and took a taxi which was unlicenced because the others were having a lightening strike.

Trastevere has a great mix of shops, bars and restaurants; some more gentrified/tourist-orientated than others. Walking to most of main sites or the Historic Centre is possible in approx' 30 minutes. Our family group had three rooms over two floors. All rooms are on the small side but clean. The decor in all three rooms was decidedly shabby with peeling wallpaper around the windows. Peeling paint on the staircase was definitely not 'artfully applied'! Urgent need of a re-furb. Breakfast was adequate with a mix of meat/cereal/ fruit etc. Desk and waiting staff were friendly, and spoke better English than my Italian! On the penultimate night of the stay there was no hot water available. This had not been remedied by the next morning. Whilst I don't mind a 'fresh' shower my 70 year-old mother definitely didn't appreciate a cold wash! We did get an discount on the room rate but guests in hotel should not be expect to go without such a basic for 36 hours.

Cons: -Dirty carpets (total deal breaker... Personal pet peeve) -Very \"hit-or-miss\" customer service (example, front desk told us no ice for our room, but immediately after shift change @ 10 pm, ice suddenly became available from the new night staff) - worst \"free\" Internet: we had three devices (iPad, iPhone and Blackberry) and for each device every 24 hours we had to go to the front desk to get a new password and then, we lost connection every 20 minutes and had to re-connect with user name and password...

The stairways are made of glorious white Italian marble and they lead up to the most fabulous rooftop smoking deck that offered spectacular panoramic views of all of Roma!!

Just a little more work on their part could result in a charming boutique hotel in an interesting location that actually matches their website. Starting with the pros. The building, which is connected to a centuries old church and convent, was charming, the lobby welcoming and the location in the Trastevere neighborhood was a plus for someone wanting a retreat from central Rome. Lots of restaurants and bars within a few blocks. There is a bus stop a block away and a tram stop two blocks away. The staff was always helpful and the sunny breakfast room and breakfast buffet were amazing and a great way to start the day. No hot breakfast items but a huge selection of meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, cereals, yogurt etc, even leftover pizza. We appreciated the free wi-fi access and the computer set up for guest use in the lobby. The rooftop deck was a real treat and provided some beautiful views of the church next door but it would have been nicer if the bar had been staffed. The lobby bar was also never staffed and the grand piano in the lobby was never played. Lost opportunities all. And although I have listed the bedroom below under the cons, the bathrooms were great. Large, sparkling white and black tile, modern fixtures, large window and high ceilings. Since we were on the 4th floor, we appreciated the elevator and though it was slow, it always worked the week we were there. But then there were the cons. The biggest one is the size and d\u00e9cor, or lack of d\u00e9cor, of the rooms. We were there with 2 other couples and so we know that these comments apply to the rooms in general. The bedrooms are tiny, and though they probably can\u2019t do much about that, any sort of decorating would be an improvement. Unlike other reviewers, we did not see any dirt or mold. In fact we were impressed with the cleanliness. But the chocolate brown wallpaper, unusual floor covering, dingy drapes, solitary black and white etching on the wall and badly chipped furniture and woodwork should be replaced. There was no where to sit in the room and no lighting for reading unless you laid in bed. So definitely not for someone who wants to spend time in their room. And no sense you were in Rome and not New Jersey. Luckily for us the weather was lovely for most of our week we were there so between exploring the neighborhood, sitting on the roof or in the lobby, we didn\u2019t spend much time in our room. And when it came time to sleep though, the beds were comfortable, the linens and pillows were always clean and in good condition and the windows and shutters kept out the noise and the light. The other big con was the lack of toiletries. Someone\u2019s priorities were definitely misplaced. Each day we got a new shoe polishing sponge and shower cap but there was no shampoo or conditioner, no lotion, no mouthwash (even though we were in the land of garlic), one tiny bar of soap that was supposed to be used in both the shower and sink, and no Kleenex other than a tiny packet that held 3 postage stamp size squares of tissue per day. And someone needs to spread the word about washcloths to Europeans. They sell them in the stores, so why don\u2019t hotels provide them? The bath towels were large and clean and very suitable. If you have business in the Trastevere neighborhood like we did (attending a graduation for John Cabot University) you\u2019ll find it to be a handy choice and one of the only hotels in that part of the city. The neighborhood felt safe, even though all the lovely old buildings are absolutely covered with graffiti. But if you are coming to Rome for the first time, the location away from the major sites and the lack of an Italian feel to the d\u00e9cor means you may want to look elsewhere.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, California", "Title": "\u201cHotel San Francesco: Great location, but not worth the price\u201d", "Author": "commpro", "ReviewID": "UR65785444", "Content": "This was our first visit to Rome and its Trastevere neighborhood. Before booking, I did extensive research. I checked out Trip Advisor and Venere reviews of many hotels, and finally chose Hotel San Francesco. As you will read, our experience was mixed. During peak season, San Francesco room prices average out to 209 Euros a night, taxes and breakfast included. Not cheap, but not as pricey as some of the hotels located near Rome's Spanish Steps neighborhood. Still, the property is probably not worth the prices they charge. The good news: San Francesco's location is great. Trastevere is a lively, happening place, and its many narrow streets and alleys boast numerous trattorias and bars. Trastevere feels more \"local\" than touristy, if that's possible in a city like Rome. The Hotel San Francesco sits on a quiet side street just a few blocks away from the Tiber River. We were on an upper floor of the hotel and had a lovely view of stately, elegant buildings on the opposite river bank. We slept with our window open, enjoying the cool breezes that blew across the river. The beds were good - firm mattresses, clean linens daily, nice pillows. Overall, the sleep quality was pretty good. The hotel served a very decent, buffet-style breakfast. The bad news: San Francesco has a run-down quality not at all in keeping with other hotels charging over $250 per night. Our room was tiny - about 3 meters square - roughly the size of a very large closet or very small guest room. Put another way, it was barely large enough to contain two side-by-side twin beds, a small desk, two small nightstands and TV sitting atop a barely functioning minibar. There was no dresser, and no place to unpack our clothes. There was one folding luggage rack, but we had two suitcases. That meant one of us had to keep our suitcase on the floor. Okay, I know many European hotel rooms are small by American standards, yet for $250 a night, I (frankly) expected more. All the furniture was beat up, scratched and chipped, like the owners had found it in a junk yard or second-hand shop. The TV was flat screen LCD, but it only had 13\" view screen. The truth is, I felt VERY disappointed when I got to the room and saw where we would be spending the week. Any hotel operator who thinks that's okay should not be in business. Our room's tiny closet came equipped with a small coat rack, two shelves and a TINY safe, barely big enough to hold two wallets and passports. There were just five hangers in the closet, not nearly enough for two adults staying for almost a week. The floor was covered with strange \"woven\" plastic tiles, intended (I think) to mimic straw floor mats, but having a really crappy, cheap feel. And they were somewhat dirty. (Shudder) Our bathroom was fairly large and sunny. It had a huge window that opened out over the street. Overall, the bathroom was nice, but there were a few problems. First, the shower's water temperature would fluctuate unpredictably from hot to cold. Several grout lines were disgusting. They desperately needed replacing due to mold and mildew stains. Finally, like the bedroom, there were no shelves or cabinets - no places to put anything. That made the bathroom inconvenient. The front desk staff at the San Francesco was overall quite professional. We were helped several times by a very pleasant young woman. (We nicknamed her \"the nice lady.\") Most of the others desk attendants were fine, with the exception of one young man, who bordered on lazy and rude. I won't share the nickname we came up with for him. One night we asked him to make a dinner reservation for us. At first, he told us, \"We don't do that for our guests.\" (You\u2019re kidding, right?) Finally, after much prodding, he acquiesced and begrudgingly phoned the restaurant (where they spoke only Italian) to book an 8:30 p.m. dinner appointment for us. The only problem was, when we got to the restaurant, the maitre-d told us that our reservation had been for 8 p.m. and we missed it. After much begging and pleading, the maitre-d relented and allowed us to dine there. We were glad, because it proved to be our most enjoyable dining experience in Rome. No thanks to the surly, lazy desk clerk at the San Francesco. The truth is, it wouldn't take much for the San Francesco to make things much better. They could invest in higher quality furniture. They could put a full-size dresser in the closet, along with a decent size safe. They could rotate the closet coat rack 90 degrees so it goes across the width of the closet, not from front to rear, and put more hangers. They could replace those cheap plastic floor tiles with carpeting covering, and fix the minibar or eliminate it altogether. (I'd rather have drawers to put my clothes than a non-functioning, tiny refrigerator!) They could put a dresser or decent table in the bathroom. Finally, they could train all their staff in excellent customer service. And they SHOULD fire surly desk attendants. In conclusion, we enjoyed our stay and learned to live with the hotel\u2019s shortcomings. Would I recommend this property to other travelers? Well, maybe, but travelers should definitely understand what they are getting for their 209 Euros.

We arrived on the 1st April for a five day stay . We arrived very stressed due to a member of our family taking very ill at the airport. On arrival we explained to the hotel manager our circumstance that our father and mother in law would not be arriving due to a sudden illness at the airport which hospitalised my father in law and meant they would not be able to make the journey. The hotel was very understanding and did not charge for the room. The weather was excellent when we were there and we hoped that the roof top bar would have been opened seeing it was the start of the good weather and it was a very busy Easter holiday weekend. Unfortunately it was not open and it would have been ideal for my father to relax when he couldn't keep up with the rest of us - he is 75 and likes to relax with an odd tipple!! - we are Irish after all!!

There were only a few reminders that the hotel was once a seminary; however you can hear the sound of the bells from the adjacent church (which weren't a problem at night but do help you to get up in the morning) and the view at the back of the hotel looks out over a small cloister. We found the staff to be courteous and friendly. Parking cost around \u20ac25 per night in the garage just down the next street, and there was a small good value supermarket down at the end of another street leading away from the hotel. During our stay we used a variety of public transport-the nearby tram on Viale di Trastevere which takes you to Largo Argentina was most convenient for reaching the Central area, though we also used a bus from just across the Tiber to the Vatican which took 45 minutes. The hotel is pretty far from the Metro however, the nearest stations took at least 25 minutes to reach by foot. Trastevere was very lively and fun in the evening and was only a brisk 10 minute walk away from the hotel. The immediate vicinity around the hotel felt relatively safe, though after dark was a little on the quiet side. The lobby was decorated in a grand style, but the room we had was less so. There were some nice features, such as a large bathroom with tub and good quality toiletries, comfortable beds and big fluffy pillows, but the lighting was a little drab, the bedroom was on the small side and the TV was outdated. As other reviewers had noted, the Wifi was temperamental. However, the room was clean and the air conditioning worked well. We were particularly impressed with the roof terrace, which was a lovely place to sit for a drink or two before bedtime, under a large canvas canopy and looking out over the Aventine Hill. The service up there was charming too. Breakfast was also of a good quality with a nice buffet laid out on the ground floor looking out over the cloister.

If you are healthy, you can easily walk to all the sites in Rome. Even the Vatican and Spanish Steps are not that far away; we never took a bus, a tram, or any other transportation. Our room was somewhat small but the ceiling was high and the third floor view over the neighboring convent was pleasing, especially at sunset. Arguably the bathroom is nicer than the bedroom -- spacious, with a big shower, a friendly sky colored motif, and a big window for good ventilation. Moreover, the bed was good, not overly firm like most Italian beds. It was also a true queen rather than two singles pushed together which sadly is often the case for so-called matrimonial beds. The walls were a bit thin, but our neighbors were mostly quiet. Also, even though the area is generally quiet, the convent bells begin ringing at 7 am; it might take a couple of nights to learn to sleep through them. Breakfast was mediocre relative to other Italian hotels that we stayed in. But you can get a cheap and much better cappuccino and pastry at the nearest bar on Via di San Fransesco a Ripa and see a little of the local culture, especially between about 9 and 9:30 am. There is also an organic store near the bar and a little supermarket on Via Carlo Tavolacci where you can purchase fruit to round out breakfast. When the concierge saw us return with food one morning he seem to nod to himself as in \"oh yes, they have figured it out\" unlike the Germans hurrying down to breakfast room at the crack of dawn. Via di San Fransesco a Ripa also has a laundry. Two minor issues. This hotel is stingy with soap. We had to share one little bar between the shower and the sink. After three days we had finally worked up to a nearly new bar in both the shower and on the sink. It felt like a triumph. Then there is the internet. It's free but as in most Italian hotels it is a hassle. I don't understand why Italian hotels can't just hand out a WEP/WPA key and perhaps change it once a month or week. Instead many of them have subscribed to a tedious system where you receive a ticket with a username and password good for say 24 hours. Both the username and password are eight (or maybe nine) characters and contain a tedious mix of lowercase and numbers, more suitable to a bank or trading account than mere internet access. Moreover, the system automatically logs you out after some period of inactivity, perhaps an hour, and it often seems necessary to reenter the tedious username and password (I was using an iPod touch). And the same username and password can only be use for one device (MAC address) at once meaning you would need to get a separate one if say both you and your partner have communication devices. Moreover, if you switch between WiFi connections (technically SSIDs) to get a better signal, the system sometimes gets confused and will not even let you get to the http://1.1.1.1/info.html page that shows your connection status. One day I got things to work only by changing the MAC address on my device but inasmuch as that required a jailbroken device and technical know-how, it will be beyond most users.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cCharming friendly hotel in Trastevere\u201d", "Author": "DeborahJaneCanberra", "ReviewID": "UR47457345", "Content": "The hotel is well-placed in Trastevere, the room we had was nice and airy, with a window you could open and a view; nice bed, clean and spacious bathroom and good bedlinen.

You'll also want to be in a good location for touring the city and walking to restaurants, but not perhaps right in the busy centre. On these counts, the Hotel San Francesco scores well. Previous reviews have been a bit mixed, so I'll try to put the hotel into some context here. It describes itself as a boutique hotel. I'm not exactly sure what that constitutes, but the description may be a little exaggerated. Our bedroom wasn't large and was rather dourly decorated and a little worn, as was the bathroom, though this was generously sized. Some of the common areas, particularly the stairways, are in need of some decoration. The reception area and breakfast room are light and pleasant though. Breakfast itself was varied and plentiful by Italian standards and served from 7.00am, allowing for early assault on the city if you chose (handy when temperatures climb as high as when we were there). We found the staff to be helpful and efficient throughout our short stay - providing maps, advice about bus stops and booking a return airport taxi for us. A great asset is the hotel's roof terrace which is especially pleasant in the evening for a drink before or after dinner. Yes, the seats could be a bit cleaner (but it's an outdoor terrace) and yes, it overlooks its near neighbours' rooftops, which include some satellite dishes. But it also offers views of the distant Rome skyline, the clear starry sky and the the occasionally tolling bell of the nextdoor church. How you see it depends on the romantic in you I suppose! Some previous comments about the location are rather unfair. Trastevere is a lovely district of Rome, with a lived-in as much as touristy feel. The hotel is situated off a small square and attached to a convent. People of all ages wander around in the evening and at no point did we feel in the slightest degree wary or intimidated (apart from dodging the odd scooter!) There's a frequented-by-locals trattoria just across the square and an enormous choice of restaurants is within a 10-minute walk. The river is also just 10 minutes away, nearest tour-bus stop is 15 minutes walk. We walked to the Colosseum from the hotel in 30 minutes. This is a case of 'you pay your money, your take your choice'.

How right they are! Ideal if you're happy to walk everywhere (if you hate to put one foot in front of the other, stay near the Trevi/the Spanish steps/thePantheon or Piazza Navona - it's tourist hell, but you'll be near the big stuff). In Trastevere you'll be living among the locals - loads of fabulous little pizzerias and trattorias in narrow cobbled streets and far from the madding tourist crowd. An effortless 20-30 minutes of walking will take you to most sites - unless spectacularly unfit, you really won't feel the trek as the surroundings are so captivating. Maybe I enjoyed being south of the Tiber as I'm a South Londoner, so it felt like coming home! For eating choices in the evening, you're unbelievably spoilt within 2 minutes of the hotel - Indian, Greek, Chinese ... but when in Italy, we stuck to the local fayre! About the hotel - our stay was slightly marred by being allocated a room which STANK of damp and had very noisy electrical equipment above it. We're a bit miffed that the receptionist selected it for us - did we look like we deserved it?!? Anyway, avoid 406 at all costs - it is damp and has a nasty dog-leg cut into it to accommodate next door's bathroom (presumably). We plucked up the courage to ask for a room change, and were allocated 304 - much better. Always ensure you have a room on the garden side - you overlook a very pretty convent garden rather than the street, and as long as you don't mind being woken by the convent bell at 7, you're definitely on the quietest, prettiest side for your stay! The fittings (windows, bathroom, etc.) are all good quality, but the decor is rather tired and feels a bit 80s in places. The entrance lobby is quite funky, the roof-terrace is fab (its bar wasn't functioning when we were there - didn't matter) but the bedrooms are just in need of a bit of TLC. The bathrooms, though spacious and well-fitted, have horrible sponged paint-effect walls above the waist-height tiles - your towels will be changed every day, so they haven't quite gone green yet. The beds are very comfortable with excellent quality linen and pillows. The breakfast is lovely - lots of fresh fruit, bacon and eggs, cereals ... but do people really eat cake and biscuits that early in the morning?! Some of the staff were very friendly and all spoke English (although we have a smattering of Italian and didn't expect English) but we are still mystified as to our initial receptionist and his allocation of the grim 406. Oh, and if you haven't read other travellers' warnings - don't expect any large hotel rooms in Rome and you won't be disappointed! This bills itself as a boutique hotel, which is pushing it a bit, it is brilliantly situated for all the culinary delights of Trastevere, only the equivalent Santa Maria is better-placed, but somewhat noisier according to the reviews. Trastevere rocks, and the San Francesco tries to keep up, but it just feels a little unloved - I'd still recommend it ... enjoy!

I would not say that hotel staff is jumping with joy like elves meeting Santa when you ask them something but they are kind, professional and will help you. I did not find those shabby dark areas and worn around the edges furniture some travelers spoke about and although you will not be able to play a tennis match on the room its size is ok if you just want to stay there to sleep and have a break before dinner.

Over-priced and small. If you keep this in mind, you won't be disappointed at Hotel San Francesco. Our room on the third floor was very small and dark because of the small, high windows. Our room faced the main street and there was no view except scaffolding across the street. There was some street noise, but we wore ear plugs so that wasn't a problem. The furniture looked worn with scratches here and there. The double bed was very firm, which we like. The bathroom was large and very clean, as was the room itself. Air conditioning worked beautifully. Overall the room was good for sleeping, but didn't have much ambience. That suited us fine since we were hardly ever in our room. Other pluses: the breakfast was excellent with a broad selection. There was sliced fruit, pastries, cereals, ham, cheese, eggs, toast, juice, coffee. It was the best of the five hotels we visited. The service was excellent during breakfast -- efficient and very courteous. Front desk service was outstanding and also efficient though not what I would call warm and friendly. Max specifically was very helpful. Here are some examples of the service he provided/arranged. One day the hair dryer didn't work and after breakfast I mentioned it to Max at the front desk. Back in the room and just 5 minutes later, a temporary dryer was delivered and then later the entire outfit was replaced while we were out of the room sighseeing. One morning I was sick and my husband asked Max if there was an orange that he could bring up to me rather than a glass of OJ from the breakfast bar. Max said he would take care of it. About 10 minutes later, a lovely tray was delivered with a full pot of tea, toast, and two oranges. What a nice surprise and at no charge. Pick-up from the airport was reliable. Though we had to wait in a long line to get through immigration, then another hour for bags, the hotel's arranged car service was still waiting for us two hours after we had landed. We never called once to say we were being delayed. If this had been NYC, we would have been SOL. Overall, for a 3-star hotel, I think this hotel is very satisfactory. This was my second trip to Rome and the Hotel San Francesco was far superior and a much better value than the hotel I stayed at five years ago in the trendy Spanish Steps/Via Condotti area. Trastevere is really a cool, not so touristy area, across the Tiber River. The area has a lot of delightful shops and restaurants and we really enjoyed stay there. Though not close, we did walk to all the major tourist sites and took cabs back to the hotel. Finally, don't forget to check out the roof-top bar.

Keeping these in mind, Hotel San Francesco is a good choice among Roman hotels, because even though it is also overpriced with small rooms (which are rather 2-star than 3), the bathrooms in this hotel are of nice size and clean. Ask for a room that looks at the garden (they are more silent and the garden is nice) and that is at the end of the hallway, cause those rooms have a bathroom with a tub. Trust me, it's really relaxing and revitalizing to take a bubble bath following a full-day walk in the city. :-) Other reviews praise the breakfast, but don't have high expectations: it's nicely set but rather simple; cakes and fruit juices are the cheap ones from the supermarkets, and the same selection every day. Staff at the reception - especially Max - is excellent, friendly and helpful beyond the Italian average, I have to say. The best thing about the hotel is its location. Trastevere is definately the most characteristic and charming part of Rome with excellent trattorias in the near on cute little old streets and squares. Max recommended us Paolo's Trattoria right on the next corner, which we tried and I tell you it's really worth it! Nice service, great food. But everyone of you will discover \"your own Rome\" anyway. We are in our 30s, so the hotel is at good location for us to walk to the major sites, yet for elder travellers it might be too much walk, but tram No. 8 (a ticket costs 1 Euro) stops a 100 meters from the hotel and takes you to Piazza Argentina (take bus 40 from here for e.g. that takes you in 10 minutes to St. Peter's Square), which is right in the near of many sites to see and also to Trastevere train station in the other direction, where the train from and to Fiumicino Airport is at. The hotel is a great choice especially if you arrive at Fiumicino Airport. From Ciampino Airport you'd have to cross the whole city. (No need to waste money on taxi or shuttle service offered by the hotel! Take a train that goes frequently from Fiumicino Airport and take off after about 20 minutes at Trastevere station. Tram No. 8 stops right in front of its building, which takes you to the stop next to San Francesco al Ripa Street, cross the street to the left side (there's a great little wine store on the corner!), walk along to the end of this street that leads you to Assisi St. France Square, turn right (there's Paolo's Trattoria at the corner) and you can already see the hotel. A train ticket costs 6 Euros / person, a tram ticket costs 1 Euro, so from 7 Euros / person you are there at the hotel or at the airport instead of spending 40-50 Euros on taxi or shuttle service. Bear in mind on your returning to the airport when you leave, that you need at least 2 hours to be on the safe side, especially that Fiumicino Airport is surprisingly huge!) All in all, if you want a low-budget accomodation, look for better deals than Hotel San Francesco, but if you have higher but not 4-star expectactations from a hotel and would prefer Trastevere in the near, go ahead and have a pleasant stay in Hotel San Francesco, just like we did.

We could not have been more fortunate in staying at the Hotel San Francesco! The staff was very helpful from the first e-mail contact as we weighed different time frames for our visit and most helpful in suggesting possible ways to see those areas, in Rome and outside the city, that we wanted to see. Every interaction we had with the Hotel's staff was positive, friendly and professional. Breakfasts were particularly pleasant, not only because of the lovely setting and the marvelous selection of foods, but because of the friendly and welcoming demeanor of the staff. By the third day, we felt like house guests when they had noticed that we each drank two pots of coffee each morning! The front desk was staffed by people who were gracious and knowledgeable. As travelers, we tend to avoid tours and this means we need help with local transportation (bus stops, bus routes, etc) which the front desk was more than able to provide. On the morning of our trip to Pompeii, the person staffing the desk prepared coffee (much needed) and a light breakfast for us, much to our surprise and appreciation given the horribly early time. The rooms, while somewhat spartan, are well-equipped and the bathrooms are luxurious and very clean.

Because of the maze of streets and numerous bridges, there are many possible routes to each of the major tourist sites. Our first visit to the Vatican required 45 minutes (at a run), but for our second visit we walked along the Tiber and reduced it to no more than 25 minutes. The neighbourhood is fascinating and dining is much more reasonable than in the more 'touristy' areas. Poor quality pizza was 65 Euros on the Piazza Navona -full meals in Trastavere were available at half the price and gave us a chance to enjoy dining amidst large, local Italian families. The neighbourhood felt quite safe and we didn't hesitate to explore late in the evenings.

Induno). Even on the Thomas Guide equivalent in the cab, it was hard to find the little street. Our cabbie Giuseppe was most gracious. Note that there are higher rates for travel between 2200 and 0700. Warm welcome: The lobby is welcoming with an elegant glass door behind security bars. Our concierges were competent and friendly (Marina, Benedetto) but the night concierge (Alessandro) is an absolute gem: the day we had o Eurostar to Firenze, he made us an elegant cappuccino at 0600 and you know what they say about a man who makes you a coffee drink in the morning time :) The maps issued by the hotel are wonderfully detailed and we filled every cargo pant pocket with them. You can walk anywhere as it is not more than 30 minutes away. We never took the trolley, tram or bus but they had very lovely suggestive ads on them. The high street, Via Trastevere, is literally a stone's throw from the hotel and there are at least three (3) GS (general stores) within a minute's walk. We walk briskly while in Roma. Concierges were competent in suggesting travel times and routes, and booking cabs and restaurants. We never needed advance booking for meals, and were always welcomed warmly. There are only 24 rooms and the clientele is mixed (Americans, Scots, English, German and Dutch), and older. No cruiseheads or students in this unit. Amenities abound - Brunch and service (tax) is included in the cost of the room. This past week the cost was E195 but I noticed some rooms getting a discounted rate of E165. Your mileage may vary. If you pay cash upfront (and in advance) you can get 10% off - ask for the offer. We were just not comfortable withdrawing that much in advance. The Bancomat (cash machine) is just around the corner. The neighborhood is safe to walk around at both 0600 and 0200. You always see carabinieri around Roma so security is not a cause for worry. The first night we returned, we simply asked for our keys by room number and were given them - puzzling without security identification. Since they had examined our passports upon entry, it is assumed, we had our images scanned but I do not know. Brunch is served daily 0700-1000 in a sunroom with a view of the cloister. It was not clear whether or not it was served on Sunday as Marina was not clear on this matter - it might have been a language barrier. The spread is adequate with the distressing use of canned fruits and the same CD (except on the weekend, when they switched to Lionel Richie's best: exercise caution when you wish for it). The bread was exquisite and the coffee brisk. Cheeses were repeated daily. The pastries were fine. It was certainly value for money. Room with a view - The rooms are small and European with hard carpeting. I am not sure the cooling units worked, and thus slept with both room and toilet windows open. While not noisy, it does permit tiny gnat like creatures to enter the room. My friend was stung by a little creature in the adjacent room, resulting in a little swelling with no superimposed infection to follow; she had slept with the windows shut. There are two small dorm room size nightstands with good lighting, a small desk you cannot possibly write upon (its width is size limiting), a double bed (European sized and thus short) with clean linen and adequate pillows, an armoire that holds approximately a dozen clothes hangars (half for full length items), a few shelves and a self-explanatory digital safe, and a stocked refrigerator we never used. The bathroom has non textured grouted tiled floors (skid alert), faux painting, porcelain fixtures (my hot and cold faucets were reverse labeled but indeed working well) including a stand up tray shower with flexible shower handle (with below average shower head pressure, and below average thermal mixing), a sparkling water closet and bidet. The sink is wide with counter room. ALl drainage was adequate. Face towels are thin and not absorbent. Bath towels are plush and served well. Toiletries could have been better but we stocked up from the GS nearby. Security - Instead of keycards, there are heavy filled cowbells with a key and a plug like device attached to them. At the base of the bell (not hollow) is an imprint of your room number. The plug needs to enter any of the black sockets in your room to switch the lights on. It is not an electricity activator as explained incorrectly by Marina as the telly will still need to be shut off. The brunch staff always checks the hotel room number by momentarily inverting the cowbell, but you see no extra charge for the coffee. We fail to grasp the significance of this action. Extras - Rooms were immaculate, bathrooms were clean, linen was straighted out (but top sheets were not necessarily always replaced). Dustbins are tiny so accumulated trash on the floor does not get collected. My wake up call was the 0700 pealing of the SF de Ripa church bells (with a snooze pealing at 0715). There were many gulls making a racket in the morning on the cranes posited nearby and the construction pretty much defeated any chance of a romantic rooftop evening. There is a reasonable amount of neighborhood construction in progress but we never heard it at night (we were not in the hotel during waking hours). The rooftop bar has retro chic (meaning lovely to look at but terribly inconvenient) sitting furniture and a standard cocktail menu; there were too many bistros, bars, pizzerias, osterias ecc. in the neighborhood to tempt us away so we never really used the service upstairs. As the crane obstructed the view, it was dissonant to having any drinks in quiet ripose. Leaving on a jet plane - On our final morning after a cracking brunch (we expected no less), Alessandro had our confirmed private hirecar ready to take us to Fiumicino on schedule. I should like to recommend the hotel on the basis of its location, cleanliness, quiet at night, access to attractions, included brunch and value for money (in that order). I would be absolutely ready wtih 50 euros to take a cab to the hotel (look for a white taxicab with the words TAXI on the top) just outside the Greeting area after baggage claim, negotiate a fixed rate and get to the hotel. The inconvenience of waiting for a cab and then not having one ready makes for a start that does not augur well and the hotel staff should be aware of the importance of first impressions.", "Date": "October 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio TX", "Title": "\u201cVery Helpful Staff!!\u201d", "Author": "SA Rose 41", "ReviewID": "UR4043870", "Content": "We spent three nights in Rome at the San Francesco Hotel.

Rome is a busy place that can overwhelm, so coming home to a quiet hotel in Trastevere at the end of the day was a welcome treat.

We went up there one evening at about 10pm and had the entire candle lit rooftop to ourselves.

There's no need for me to reiterate all the positive comments here. It's a charming hotel in an great area and the staff is warm and helpful. True, our room was small. This was only a problem because of the lack of closet space and it was a bit tight living out of a suitcase. I couldn't have packed any lighter (although my husband would disagree) because we had three weeks of travel ahead of us. We opted for a bathroom with a shower instead of a tub and it could easily have accommodated both of us. Yes, there were a couple of mouldy spots on the tile but it was basically a spotlessly clean hotel. My only concern here is that one of the reviews (June 2005) said that there wasn't air-conditioning but that's incorrect. We certainly had air-con in our room and a good thing, too, since we were in Rome during a hot spell. I'd hate to think that anyone would pass up this lovely hotel because they thought there was no air-conditioning! As we walked around Rome, everytime I passed a hotel that I had considered, I realized how lucky we were to have ended up in Trastevere! We often took the tram and occasionally even walked over one of the bridges to the historic centre. The few cab rides we took were short and inexpensive.

It is true, as others have noted, that the rooms are small. But there is an easy solution - pack light and use a laundry just a few doors north of the hotel. It was open every time we walked past - early in the morning, and late at night - and it also seemed to be an internet cafe and a station for making long distance phone calls. We did a load of laundry there about four days into the trip, with the help of the young man attending the place, who didn't speak English (we speak very little Italian). The cost was by weight for the wash and by time for the dry. It cost about $2 for one load of wash, about $3 to dry, and laundry detergent and fabric softener from the dispenser were relatively cheap - less than a euro for both. Although certain travelers might consider this a waste of time, others might find 90 minutes figuring out laundry in another language to be pretty fun. The hotel San Francesco is great for fast and easy-to-figure-out public transportation. Walk east across the river to catch the number 23 bus to the Vatican. Walk west about a block to Viale Trastevere to take the very frequent number 8 tram to Largo de Torre Argentina. From there, its a short block or two west to Campo de Fiori, north to Piazza Navona or the Pantheon, or east to Piazza Venezia and the Via del Corso. Or, hop on a number 63 bus here (at Largo de Torre Argentina) and you'll very quickly end up at the Via Veneto with a short walk to the Galleria Borghese and the beautiful park around it, which would be perfect for a picnic. One public transport warning; there is a different tram, the 3, which theoretically heads east to the Colosseo and beyond. We did take it to the Colosseo. But it was very infrequent and crowded - I wish we'd taken a taxi instead of ever waiting for it. The breakfast room at this hotel is lovely, with an occasional glimpse of the Franciscans walking through the courtyard. The gulls outside can be noisy at night, but we kind of liked them. We didn't use the rooftop bar until the last night, and then regretted not using it before.

The best part was the rooftop, where I think everyone hangs out in the evenings for drinks before going out to dinner. Weather was especially perfect for it and Luciano was the nicest and most accomodating and unobtrusive bar tender in the whole of Rome. Trastevere is the nicest location especially at Piazza Santa Maria where all the locals hang out, it's fun and bustling but not too rowdy. They have some pretty neat bars around this area which is a very short walk along San Francesco Ripa. Easy accessibility to tram #8, to get through to all the bus connections to most of the sights via Arenula. A couple of suggestions: ask regarding day trips to other cities such as Venice, Naples, Capri and Pompei, worth the money if you're already there. Try Brunello red wines, a bit pricey but truly worth the extra bucks. The only problem was the front desk people were not very suggestive with the restaurants, as they probably don't live in the area. A great place to try is Ditirambo, in Piazza Cancelleria --- along Corso Vittorio Emanuel II near Piazza Navona, the most authentic and delicious restaurant we had.

The breakfast is very nice, although I found it repetitive..would like more variety from one day to the next.

I can't say enough about how kind and hospitable the hotel staff was. The decor was lovely- a mix of modern and traditional. The rooms were simple but sparkling clean and comfortable. The bathroom was quite large. My husband's favorite part was that the hotel provided a limitless supply of yummy chocolates! The location in Trastevere was unbeatable- at least for what we wanted to do which was to explore Trastevere, Testaccio and the Jewish Ghetto. We were quite near the Tiber so we could easily cross over. We were also near the Porta Portese flea market and the Aventine hill. Transportation was very convenient- we took trams and buses which stopped right around the corner from the hotel. As far as the hotel, did I say how nice the hotel staff was to us? They recommended excellent restaurants, warned us about the train strike, called taxis for us and responded quickly and efficiently to all our questions and concerns. A prime example is that I left my wedding ring in the hotel room. When I called the hotel they looked for it immediately, found it and assured me that it was secure and that they would send it back to me right away. One last note is that breakfast (not included) is excellent and abundant- kept us going to late afternoon- and overlooks the absolutely gorgeous garden.

The decor of the reception and breakfast area is quirky and individual but extremely stylish. The rooms have a more pared down decor but are still very comfortable and the bathrooms are great. I really enjoyed the breakfasts, served in a covered cloister overlooking the garden. There was a lot more choice than at many Italian hotels and much of it seemed to be home made. There is a terrace and bar situated on top of the building but unfortunately it wasn't open when we stayed (I suppose al fresco drinking isn't very popular in January!).

We hope to visit again sometime in the future and will definitely come back to Hotel Francesco. I have also recommended the hotel to all my family & friends. Try the following resturants \"La Piazzeta\" in Via Francesco a Ripa which is just along the street from the Pizza Cafe \"Frontini\"(freshly made pizzas are great here both Pizza Rosso & Bianca) on the corner of main street. Food, especially pizza & steaks are very good, cooked in an open fired oven. Staff were also very nice to my seven year old son. Also, try my favourite, \"Da Albino il sardo all'angoletto\" in Via della Luce 44-45. It doesn't look anything from the outside but again, the food & staff were brilliant. Try the Sardinian dessert \"Sardea\" which is puff pastry filled with cheese and drizzled with bitter honey - absolutely immense. Pizza & meat dishes were delicious & perfectly cooked.
