We were offered an upgrade for 20 euros, stated that the upgrade had a private bathroom. (We thought the B&B did when we booked it.) We accepted and were taken down one block to a large building with a lift to the 5th floor where our room included a TV, bathroom, shower and view of the old Acquarium building and its piazza. Apparently, this was the B&B Fanti Rooms, according to the business card on the nightstand. There was a water cooler outside the room and a shared fridge. Unfortunately, the TV remote had to be reprogrammed, a 15 minute test of resolve. Also, the toilet sweat was broken and literally unattached to the toilet, making the bathroom a dangerous adventure. We told the staff about the toilet seat immediately and they promised to fix it. However, two days later, the seat was never fixed. The room would have been a reasonable value had the toilet been in tact. Breakfast was modest and somewhat below average.

The front desk is situated on the ground floor. Exactly on the main street where everyone who passes by can see you checking in. A blond lady received us, she took our IDs and she gave us the impression that she was not aware of the booking we've made nor she has anymore rooms left. But then a man came and take in change. He accompany us to our room and open the door with a duplicate key. I asked for the key of our room but he couldn't give me any because according to the man the blond lady had misplaced it. From then I really freaked out. The Hotel management is really unreliable. The room has a bad illumination. I opened the bathroom and a foul smell suddenly filled the room. I went in to check for it and found out that it's filthy. The shower dish has hairs all over it and then bin has not been empty by the cleaners. I doubt that it hasnt been cleaned at all. I try to move on to settle my things to the closet. The knob of the cabinet is broken and when i open the closet, it was full of blankets and pillows so I didn't know where to put my things so I left them inside my bagage on the foor! Then my breathing felt weird. This usually happens when I'm slightly exposed to dust. And Voi La \"DUST EVERYWHERE\". There's even no means to communicate to the front desk since there has no telephone inside the room. We had to go there personally from the fifth floor to the main street! When we complained about this, the man was even rude! I was really disappointed so we decided to stay out late as much as possible. The next day I didn't even dare to do breakfast since it was extremely poor! I really had to change the Hotel so we left of course paying the services they promised on their website even we didn't have it at all!!!

While I went to the hotel and gave the booking reference to the reception, he checked and then called a man, he said that we (I with my friend - two girls) should follow him and they are the same. So we followed the man to a apartment, there are three rooms in a flat. At that time I had no suggestions, so I paid the monies to the man and he gave me his card. At that time we knew it is a Bed & Breakfast and he gave me a map and also told me how could go the sightseeings. After he left for only 5 minutes, the light shut down suddenly, we were afraid and felt horrible, so I called the man and asked him why. He replied that there was no electric for 2 hours for the whole area. So we left the room and went back to the hotel and ask the receiption. He told me that this areas were always liked this and not be afraid. So I went to had a walked to visit some sight first and then turned back to the B&B before 5:00p.m.. At that time, there was electric. Then I checked my room and found that there was only a window in the washroom which cannot closed. Besides, people could see everything through the key hole. The door of the room is sliding to close that is very dangerous. The washroom had smell. So I hadn't sleep on the first night. The breakfast was having on the 4th floor in one room of a flat, and it was very poor. Then I booked another four star hotel for the following two days. I moved to the new hotel on the second night and checked out the B&B on the third day morning before 9:30a.m.. And I hadn't got back the monies for the third night. The hotel is very unreliable that I booked the hotel before 2 months. If they did't have any room then they could send e-mail to tell me, not the confirmation. When I went to the hotel on the first night, I told the other receiption my stories, he felt it was normal.

The mom doesn't know English. She looks like unfriendly, but actually she is soooooooooooo nice! She made a free coffee for me to wake up in the early morning I checked in! The son is very helpful and polite. He told me where I can buy low priced clothes, and introduced a very good italian restaurant next door (La Mensa di Bacci Rustirante Pizzeria). It's a 2-star hotel, u can't expect what facilities they have. At least they have a good location closed to the train station but safe. After u check in at the small lobby, u have to go out the lobby and go into the building by the entrance next door. They have a very old elevator that u have to open/close the door by yourself. The rooms are located on the 3rd & 4th floor. The room I stayed was clean. The room costed me euro 55/night including simple breakfast. There is a safebox in the room~ There is no curtain to separate the shower and the toilet, and there is no window in the toilet, so the floor would be wet for a long time after shower. Hot water will come out one minute after u switch on the tap. But it's fine for me. They don't provide toothpaste, toothbrush and shampoo, but have a soap and hair dryer on the wall. It takes u 2-3 minutes to the main train station. It's located on the street where so many Chinese open their shops. I don't feel dangerous on the street even at night (I am an Asian female solo traveller). The breakfast place is next to the front desk, a very simple breakfast serving bread, juice and coffee only. U can also take the fruit/bread/snack there anytime u need! Anyway, it's still good value for money in Rome!! I have suggested it for people who travel in tight budget! Tips: They have 24 hrs reception but the staff will lock the lobby door at 11pm for safe, and he may sleeps in the sofa that u have to wake him up if u arrive late or get back ur key on front desk. If then, u better save the telephone number and call the staff a few minutes before u arrive to ensure he is there.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great Value For money.\u201d", "Author": "RichardHalifax", "ReviewID": "UR45725859", "Content": "You get what you pay for.

This place was pretty much awful from the start. Checked in 10pm by a guy at the desk who, although was not rude, he wasn't exactly welcoming and kept converstaion to a minimum. Bathroom was tiny and i mean tiny- approx 7ft by 5 ft. The shower had no curtain so the water went everywhere. There was constantly a horrible sewerage smell coming from the shower drainage. The bedroom size was reasonable for a 2 star but the air conditioning seemed to be just a fan-it didnt acually cool the air. The TV didnt work properly-upper half of the screen didnt work!!! Sleeping was quite unpleasant as it was particulaly wam during the night. Our bedroom was located under the reception so it was particularly noisy in the morning when they were preparing breakfast for the other guests. We toured around rome the following morning and returned to find that the bedlinen and towels had not been changed. When I asked about it at reception they told me that because I didnt leave the room key at the desk in the morning there was way of the cleaner gaining access to the room. But we had not been told to leave keys at reception!!!! They gave me some [--] excuse about having a limited set of extra keys. To avoid a row I just got them to give me new towels and left it at that! Breakfast very plain and was the exact same every day. The only fresd foods on the breakfast menu was the small slices of bread. Overall-i was disapointed with the hotel particularly given that the majority of the reviews appear to be quite postitive.
