You can hardly beat the location. Just a step away from the tube, the Place de la Concorde, Place Vendome, Louvre, Rue Saint Honor\u00e9e, Op\u00e9ra, Madeleine... The hotel is in great shape and the bathrooms are all new. They are continually improving the decor and infrastructure. The service is fantastic and although there is only breakfast service, the wonderful Brasserie across the street delivers in the room, if necessary. The rooms are Paris sized, therefore not big for american standards, but adequate for european and they are so cozy and elegant, that staying in them is wonderful. Very comfortable beds!

The rooms are very small, VERY small, but it's normal for Paris. The hotel has a very pleasant modern design, I was told that the owner of the hotel is an art collector. It's walking distance to the Louvre, you can spend there days and days... Opera and Madeleine is in 7 minutes walking distance. Ladies, be aware! Next to the hotel is 31, Rue Cambon, the VERY first Chanel store opened by Coco Chanel. You'll end up going there as often as to the Louvre if you're a Chanel lover. ;) Just across the hotel there is a wonderful restaurant, loved by the locals, I'm highly recommending to check it out. There were 2 things that bothered me... a little. The hotel closes the entrance doors for the night, so you have to buzz the concierge if you're coming back late. And, hey, you're in Paris, city of Love and Lights. It's silly but I felt kind of awkward when I was going back to my room at 4 am with a guy, and had to buzz the concierge... Felt like a highschool kid coming home. :/ The other thing that bothered me was the payment. When I got to the hotel, I was told that the 255 euro a night included the breakfast. So every morning I had the breakfast at the hotel (not the best selection - just cheese plates, bread, croissants, fresh juices, yogurts). When I was checking out I had to pay 20 euro for every breakfast I had. :( And the same concierge that helped me during my arrival and confirmed that the total included the breakfast (she wrote - b+b meaning bed and breakfast on my papers), the same concierge told me I was mistaken and breakfast is never included. Otherwise, it's a good hotel, but I am not going back there.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location - very small rooms\u201d", "Author": "BeliNY", "ReviewID": "UR121603117", "Content": "Amazing location.

The staff are very helpful and friendly. Most of all, I have to thank the lady who cleaned my room. I left my engagement ring by the washbasin one day and left the room. I didn't realise I didn't have the ring with me till after dinner and was in a right panic thinking I've lost it. I wasn't even sure where I had left it.
