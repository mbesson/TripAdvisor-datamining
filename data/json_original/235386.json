I booked this hotel 10 months before my work conference. This was necessary since the conference brings in 30,000 attendees and hotels book up quickly.

To my dismay, the owner called me 4 days before the trip and told me they were overbooked and they would be moving me to a hotel 8 miles away in Lincoln Park. Since I booked 10 months beforehand, I questioned why I was the one getting bumped. The owner basically told me they made a mistake posting the price on Booking.com at $150 and it should have been $250. They were instead giving our rooms to European clients who were paying more and staying longer!! They backtracked and tried to claim these people also booked before me, but if they knew they were overbooked 10 months ago they would have called me 10 months ago. She told me she worked for days to try to find me a replacement hotel at the last minute, but then I never heard back from her with an alternate reservation. I had to scrounge around last minute to find a reasonably priced hotel last minute for a convention that had long since booked up all the nearby hotels.

Let me start by saying the place sure has great potential thanks to its old-style charm and unbeatable location for business travellers attending McCormick Place. Management however seems absolutely set on driving it to the ground. I have never encountered such attitude, not to say abuse, of guests. From the time we checked in through the time we left, there were numerous incidents more befitting an old-style Soviet gulag facility than an upscale, expensive hotel. Here are just a few examples: - Upon arrival, we parked the car on back and walked through open gate only to find back door locked with no bell in sight. In freezing cold, we knocked on door. When manager finally opened (after we called phone inside), his first comment was: \"why did you not use call box outside?!\". That's warm welcome Wheeler Mansion style. - The next morning (Sunday), our group (which BTW rented ALL 11 rooms for the week) had an early start at McCormick Place. We asked if we could have breakfast at 7:30 or 8:00 instead of the scheduled 8:30. The response: \"this would be against our rules\". - The next morning (Monday), we had one colleague leaving and another one checking in. As the new guy is at the door, in front of us one staff member said to another: \"what is he doing here? he was supposed to get here between 9-10\" (the time was about 8:30)... The manager went to open the door, then came back and in front of us said: I don't like the attitude here this morning!\"... - Then there was the freezing temperatures, the cold breakfasts and a general sense that we were not guests but some unwanted intruders to get rid of. Before we left, we asked the manager for an explanation. \"I'm just following the owner's orders\", he said. After speaking with the owner, I'd have to say: I believe him.

The \"general manager\" that showed me around when I checked in talked a good game, offering all sorts of concierge services (which I never used), but when it came time to pay for my stay I was given the same line about being liable for 100% of my reservation, even though I had to check out a day early. When I expressed my displeasure, and tried to explain that their policy didn't make any sense given that their proximity to McCormick place means that a lot of their customers will be business travelers and that business travelers' plans change frequently, the \"general manager\" tried to pass the buck to the owners, and just flatly stated that I should have known the policy when I made the reservation. Basically, I left feeling that I got screwed, which is a shame. The property itself is very nice, but it's in an absolutely deserted part of town. It's that part of town that's either \"up and coming\" or \"the wrong side of the tracks\", depending probably on your political persuasion. While the hotel is only two blocks from McCormick place, I would definitely not recommend that a woman walk alone around the neighborhood at night. The property's immediate neighbors are a parking garage/lot, a warehouse under construction being converted into condos, a humongous postwar factory that's showing its age, and a bunch of other buildings that would be a great place to host a rave. All in all, it's a shame that the customer service was so bad, because it has the potential, despite its surroundings, to be a good overflow option for the McCormick place hotels when they book up. However, I wouldn't recommend staying at the Wheeler Mansion if you're going to a conference. Another strange facet of the property is that the \"general manager\" is only on the property intermittently, and only during business hours.

At the time I made the reservations, they presented me with a standard reservation contract outlining the cancellation penalties, showing my deposit and final payment due when we arrived. The website, Amadeus reservation system, as well as their manager at the time the reservations/contract was made, assured me that they paid a travel agent commission. However, the problems started as the trip got closer and the new manager informs me that because the 'standard' contract made no specific mention of commission they owed none. I asked to speak to the owner \"Deborah\" who finally agreed to give me a small fraction of the actual amount due according to their website, etc. as a 'gesture of good will'. Then at the time for the final bill to be paid, Deborah informs me that she will add 14.9 percent tax to the contract when no where on the contract is that mentioned and in fact, each guest (including myself) received a statement saying 0 tax due (was to be included in all-inclusive feature). There is much more to this story - I could fill a book. As far as the property goes, it is a very lovely mansion and could have been a pleasant experience if not for the owner. The manager 'Michael' is very nice, but clearly a manager in 'name only' - all decisions come from Deborah and there is no discussion with her - she will adhere to the contract when it is in her favor and not adhere to it when she wants to add tax. She actually told me to take the entire group and leave with no refunds if we did not pay the tax (which was not in the contract). The 'gourmet' breakfast has been nothing more that a casserole/fruit and a bagel or croissant and if you are a group who likes to eat together, there are not enough seats for everyone, limited number of coffee cups/silverware, etc. Most mornings we had to wait until they washed more coffee cups and service was terrible! There is no one on premises after 7pm so if you have problems you are 'on your own'. Also, beware of the cancellation penalties - they will stick to them even if you break your back - one of my clients actually did and they were holding him accountable for the entire 6 nights $1500+. After I found another couple to take their place, I finally managed to get Deborah to agree to refund the original person, but it was not easy nor pleasant!

We were not informed before or during our stay that children were not allowed. Make sure that you do not bring any kids because they will charge you for their $10000 rugs if you spill anything on them. It is not close to the airport or downtown.

We arrived late (11:00 PM) because of some airline delays and had no problems getting into our room. The owners live on the property and are available during off hours. The staff is highly attentive and very friendly. All I can gather from previous negative reviews is that the owners were have some problems hiring the right kind of people. The good news is that they have them now. The Mansion is unique and tastefully luxurious. Each room is furnished with a mix period appropriate antiques and modern amenities. There is a large dining room and beautiful comfortable sitting room. It is a perfect alternative to the sterile one-size-fits-all hotel room for the McCormick Place conventioneer. It is the perfect hidden pleasure for those looking for a quiet weekend getaway. We're already planning our return. After only one visit, it has become our favorite place to stay in Chicago.

The reservationist assured me a spectacular evening - I requested champagne in the room. When I arrived, there was champagne perfectly chilled on a silver platter scattered with red rose petals, 2 glasses, each with a strawberry on the rim, chocolate covered strawberries(the biggest I have ever seen!) on the bed with a romantic love quote on each pillow. The lights were soft, and a Frank Sinatra CD was playing in the cd player. WOW!! In the morning, breakfast was spectacular, and we could sit by the fire in the living room drinking coffee and reading the paper. No rush to check out.
