There was a crack at the bottom of the door so you can see outside. The door didnt close at first so we called someone. He said we needed to stand a wait a second for it to restart and then try again. In order for me to lock the door at night, I needed to lift the door handle then lock it. It looked damp and musty inside. It was dusty and felt dirty. The front windows did not lock(it was broken). We had a fridge but it did NOT work and the freezer was filled with old water from who knows how long. In another room we had, the windows did not lock and neither did the sliding door. I was held closed by a stick! Also, there was a cable box, but there was not outlet connecting it to the wall, so it defeted the purpose of having it there to begin with.

The building is two story with steep stairs - no elevator. Bottom line: overdue for overhaul ceiling to floor. In any city except Los Angeles, rooms would be $30 a night or less, get a sub par rating or perhaps be out of biz due to failed city inspections. The in-town location is great but it comes with caveats - the office is kept locked at all times and check in procedure requires a copy of drivers license to be kept in the office for police access, according to staff. That was a first for me & I travel a lot. Contrary to other reviews, I found the front desk female both friendly when conversation was the extent of her required involvement and resistant when I required actual assistance. Her unprofessional behavior went far beyond not having a good day. Breakfast was on par with chains offering free food. All that said, if you view the hotel only as a place to drop your bags, sleep and go, the three reasons to stay will work fine; just arrive with expectations in check. I didn't and was stunned.

When we stayed before apologies were made that the room we were staying in was in the process of being redecorated this was OK, however when we stayed this time we were disappointed to find that our room for this stay was in a worse condition than the one we stayed in last time. We were in room 22 which we were given as we had requested a king sized bed with a kitchenette and balcony. We got a comfortable king sized bed (sheets not changed during stay) with an ajoining kitchenette which literally consisted of a coffee maker, fridge, microwave, some cupboards and sink. There was no cutlery or crockery to eat microwaved foods with which was quite inconvenient and frustrating to locate in the local supermarket. The window in the kitchen had nothing to secure it with, not a security issue as we were 3 stories up but it was not attractive at all being very dirty, rusty and held closed by pieces of duct tape on the glass. We did get a balcony, but unlike most of the balconies at the hotel it was not private -it was actually a walkway for other guests to get to their room. This meant it was very noisy through the thin balcony door and we were unable to open all the curtains to let the gorgeous sunlight in, as anyone could have peered in. In fact, for 2 days someone from a neighbouring room that did not have a balcony at all decided to park themselves in front of our window to read a book. There were 2 rooms opposite us and 3 more below, positioned as our room was at an intersection of rooms at the top of a flight of stairs. THe noise at night and in the morning from other families (children mainly running around, shouting) was awful. Doors slamming, shouting, parents telling children off. Add to this the incredibly loud air con... Sorry to say we did not feel safe in our room, as it was at the end of the hotel and our balcony door was accessible to anyone who ventured into the hotel. Had we had a private balcony we would have felt safe as it is not a bad area really, we felt safe walking through it during the day and at night it was just in the hotel that we felt vulnerable. If you stay then make sure you request a private balcony! There were ants in the bathroom which we reported but were not dealt with. The doors in our room had chips out of them and there were stains on the carpet.We had to clean the bathroom before we used it as it was quite dirty. The hotel is situated in a great place, located as it is on Hollywood Boulevard. It is worth noting this is a very busy road and as such very noisy. Not the hotel's fault, but ther it is it is a noisy location with sirens and traffic noise all through the night worse of course at weekends. On our first trip to the hotel the owners were readily available and very helpful, but now the breakfast is at a local cafe and not available form the front reception we did not interact with the owners at all except to check in and out, and they really seemed disinterested in our holiday and our eperience of their hotel. We liked that our bed was made each day (although sheets not changed)and that the hotel offers free parking. We were happy that the hotel was a 40 minute walk from Grauman's Chinese Theatre. We were not happy that the bathroom was not cleaned when the towels were replenished. It was frustrating that the coffee provided for the coffee maker was incostintenty replenished, so some days we could not make coffee.

There is a small (7ft deep) pool in the center courtyard surrounded by flowers. It is hard to get in and out the pool due to the gate that surrounds it. The pool changes colors at night, from blue to green to red. My room was nice (#24), decent and comfortable. Again, not a fancy place. There was 2 beds, a kitchenette in an adjoining room, a decent size bathroom (with great water pressure and HOT water!), and a walk-in closet/storage room.

The room came with 2 queen beds (semi-hard, I\u2019m not fussy about bed-softness), a desk, vanity mirror, TV with digital cable, and vanity self adjacent to the bathroom, and dresser.

We went to Disneyland one day and I wanted her to be able to do a bunch of SouthernCalifonia tourist-y things the next day. So I searched around Hollywood for hotels. We're both young and broke, so the Hollywood Downtowner was the most appealing, of course, based on it's super-cheap rates [especially in comparison to the rates of surrounding North Hollywood hotels]. I was definitely a little leary. Even though I fell in love with the look of the Hollywood Downtowner, after I read through EVERY review I could find... I got a little nervous. Too many reviewers painted this hotel to be a bedbug-ridden, stain-covered, blood-on-the-walls and vomit-in-the-stairway place in the middle of tons of criminal activity. And we were two twenty-year-old girls that were going to be arriving in the middle of the night. Oi. I was so enthusiastically satisfied with this hotel. The staff there are amazing. So friendly, personable, and helpful. You become friends with them instantly and feel comfortable with your stay as soon as you check in. Obviously, the accomodations are what they are for a $60 hotel room. Nothing too fancy; you've got pretty much the bare minimum... but who spends that much time in the hotel, anyway? You've got a clean, comfy place to sleep. And a high-pressure showerhead! It looks like a crummy showerhead... but it delivers some power! Such a nice change from most hotels. And if you're lacking in anything during your stay, again... the staff is super friendly and more than willing to accomodate what you need. The place has character. It's appearance is like something right out of a movie. Again... there's not much to your actual room, but it's a fantastic place to stay and we have absolutely no regrets. Not much for breakfast [cold/hot cereals, some fruit, packaged danishes, milk, coffee, and orange juice], so don't expect some grand breakfast rollout in their tiny lobby. I highly recommend the Hollywood Downtowner Inn to EVERYONE traveling on a budget... and to anyone looking to stay in a place with some character and great staff. I apologize for the long review.

It looked pretty scary actually and I didn't even know which direction to go. I have to give a local woman a big thank you. She pointed out the direction and got me onto the right bus. Whew. A big plus to this local which was a pleasant surprise. I arrived at the motel and the area was very ghetto looking. I was happy for the liquor store across the street because my nerves were a bit shaken by the gang style looking folks hanging out around the area and needed a drink. Or two. Now to the motel itself. It is pretty seedy - not kept up well, rather noisy window a/c units and a bit of a rank odor to the rooms. More of mold then urine - I could live with that. I did feel that the staff, who were VERY nice to me kept a good eye on the place and I did feel safe. They were also very helpful in pointing out how to get to various places. I slept ok and trusted the staff to keep out any riff raff which they did. And there were no vermin or that kind of thing. But all in all I would probably never stay here again. I would go father to the west where the neighborhood is less frightening looking and probably pay a couple extra dollars as I was here on a short vacation & the room really was not a place to hang out in other then for sleeping. The pool was also not filled but I probably wouldn't have used it anyway. I probably wouldn't have been quite as shook up upon my initial arrival if I had drove up in a car.
