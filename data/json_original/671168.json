The first morning that the maid came, we asked her to come back after about 20 minutes and she went off on how many rooms she had to clean and asked if we needed it to be cleaned or could she just leave us clean towels. We just took the towels since she seemed to be to busy to come back at a later time. The second morning no maid ever came at all. My husband had to get towels and toilet paper off of a maid cart he saw outside of another room. They also didnt supply coffee for the coffee pot. Every hotel Ive ever stayed at has had coffee packets in the room. The room was a nice size, yet the kitchen is outdated. The cabinants smelled of strong musty wood and the dishes in them had this smell to. There was no stopper for the drain to wash dishes so you had to just wash them under the water as it ran and add dish soap to each thing you washed. There was mold in the bathroom also. When we checked out, the man asked if we needed a receipt and I said no, he then said well this is all I need then as he took our room keys and said have a good day. He never asked how our stay was or anything. (If he had, I wouldve told him about the maid not ever cleaning our room) The staff checking us in though was very nice and helpful with finding our room and giving us parking instructions. They also charge for each adult in the room and they count children over 7 as an adult. Ive never had a hotel do that before. The good things about this motel was the size of the pool. They did have allot of chairs and it was a huge pool. Very nice area to lounge in. The beach is close also. For the most part, it was ok for the price but I doubt we will stay here again in the future.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWeekend trip to the Beach.\u201d", "Author": "Nick S", "ReviewID": "UR134908619", "Content": "Real nice place to stay.Real short walk to the beach with a real big pool.park your car and take the bus to go to the boardwalk for a fun weekend.A perfect place to stay if you are on a budget..", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mechanicsburg", "Title": "\u201cGreat beach location, clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "Tod S", "ReviewID": "UR134529671", "Content": "I found the place to be very nice.

Their cancellation policy is a 100% forfeiture of the deposit if the cancellation is made less than 7 days prior to stay, regardless of circumstances. Now, that is all fine and good, and I understand I agreed to it. However, after having a last minute emergency, my group went from needing 2 rooms to only one. I called 6 days in advance to see if we could work something out, and no dice. I understand policies are policies for a reason, but my issue comes here: when I asked if I would be in the same situation whether I cancelled 6 days in advance, or when we showed up at the motel, I was told yes, but it would be NICE of me to cancel now so they could rent the room to someone else, since they are booked up. The representative knows fully well that they are highly likely to rebook that room in the next 6 days, and they are simply being greedy wanting to be able to charge someone else full price for the room, and keep my deposit, essentially getting paid double for the room.

We were only staying in the hotel to sleep at night, during the day we would be at the beach and at night at the bars or the boardwalk. When I arrived at the Beachmark, the lady at the front desk (can not remember her name) was very friendly and willing to negotiate a reasonable price. I told her I would take the room as long as I could see it first, and she was happy to accomidate my request. The room was a little dated but very clean and most importantly the sheets were clean, needless to say I took the room. I was told that every room is a 2 full suite. Each room had a full refrigerator, sink, stocked cabinets, and two burners. There was also a desk, two chairs, a leather couch and tv on a wide dresser as well as a mirror. The bathroom looks like it may have been renivated recently or it is cleaned extensively. The location was great, no more than 25 steps to sand, and our area of the beach great, just the right amount of people. Beachmark also boast having the 2nd largest pool located in the courtyard, although we never used it, it appeared clean. 73rd street is a great location as well because is a market and a few restraunts within a 2 minute walk, your also away from the noise of the boardwalk. Additionally Generals Kitchen is built into the Beachmark, a great place for breakfast. Overall the Beachmark is a great place to stay, clean and affordable. The kitchen aspect seemed appealling for guest who would be staying for a week, and would rather cook food then eat out every night.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York State", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed very much\u201d", "Author": "nurseeo", "ReviewID": "UR25201900", "Content": "I was sure I had reviewed this motel before but am unable to find it.

I like the idea of being able to cook a meal if I want etc. We got clean kitchen linen each day also. The pool is large and clean and they improved the look since the year before. Only thing wrong is no elevator which is hard on my Mom to walk up the stairs. But it is not many. Short walk to beach. Price not bad either. Get the bus to go to boardwalk. Will try to add pics.

We booked last minute and this was about the only thing I could find. The price was very reasonable by Ocean City standards. However, the place had quite an odor in the hallways and in the rooms. Parking was a disaster. The first full day we were there, the maids never showed up to clean our room. When they did come the next few days, is about all they did was leave fresh towels and make the beds. The counters and tables were not wiped down and the bathroom never looked clean to me. The beds were the worst hotel beds I've ever slept on. It was like sleeping on a box spring rather than a mattress. There were two blankets in the closet that were't on the beds. When I pulled them down to cover my kids they stunk horribly - like they hadn't been washed in awhile. Also, the rooms have air conditioning units. They are so loud that you could barely sleep at night because of the noise. The front desk was very rude when I called and complained about the maid that didn't show up. And they were SHOCKED when I told them how disappointed I was when I checked out! It is a cheap hotel but you get what you pay for.

We made reservations through an online database of ocean city rentals. When we arrived at the hotel, the front office told us they didn't have our reservation, they said the online system we used wasn't correct and not valid because we never received an email from them. They had no available rooms except for that night, and perhaps, a night to night basis (we were supposed to be booked thurs-sun). They then preceded to tell us that this happenes all the time, and the same thing had happened to someone else the day before! Of course, we accepted this as being our own fault and we were lucky enough to be able to book another hotel for our stay. However, the front desk of the hotel we DID stay at was appalled by the Beachmark's behavior. They use the same system, and said that management is supposed to check the system and make sure there are enough rooms available for those booking online. Even if the room wasn't available, some form of notification of that would be nice! Looking back on it now, it seems like the perfect way to ensure your rooms are always filled, and get people to stay for individual nights, just overbook! My boyfriend and I are young enough to be flexible about our vacation. What would have happened had we been a family of four with 2 young kids expecting a room there?

We booked it as it had the cheapest prices and was still on the Ocean side of town. We were a little concerned as we have never heard of the place before, but after our stay we will definitely be back! We liked it was far enough away from the boardwalk but close enough to take the bus and not have an hour ride back and forth. It was also very quiet! You can occasionaly hear the loud bikes or cars on the street (as the hotel is right on the main street) or you might also hear the sirens from fire engines as it is right across from the station. However, once nightfall came, these sounds were few and far between. My wife is very picky when it comes to noise and even she slept through the nite! The room itself was a little old (as are most rooms in OC), but it was very clean. The beds were comfy and the A/C worked great. Housekeeping was on top of things -- we left for about an hour and came back and our room was cleaned and fresh stocked. The rooms also have dishes, a full-size refrigerator, and stovetop, and sink so there is no need to go out to eat for all meals (hopefully that saves a bit of money). While we were there, the beach, although a very short walk away, was infested with grasshoppers! It felt like we were part of a plague or something! So we spent most of the time at the huge pool the hotel had. We saw someone cleaning it every morning and it was big enough to where one could swim laps if they wanted and not interfere with anyone else in the pool. The only thing that went wrong (beside the grasshoppers, which is no way was the hotel's fault) was that it took us forever to find the stairs -- maybe we just arent too bright :) The hotel has plenty of restaurants and stores within walking distance. All in all, we are extremely pleased with our stay and as I said in the beginning, we will definitely be back -- along with the rest of our family!", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bunker Hill, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWasn't that bad.\u201d", "Author": "ERat", "ReviewID": "UR10858804", "Content": "We wanted to spend a couple of day at the beach without spending an arm and a leg. This motel fit the bill. It was without a doubt the most affordable places that I called. We were going on short notice and most of the other places were either booked or charging $200+ per night. I was totally satisfied with the price. The last time I went to OC we stayed on the boardwalk and I swore that I would never go back. I hated the entire place. We decided to try OC again, this time nowhere near the boardwalk. I was pleased to find out that this motel is on the north side of OC. It's in the much calmer and more laid back section of town. There are condos and houses surrounding the motel. I felt like we were in a neighborhood and not a tourist trap. The motel is an older building, but it fits in with the other building in the area. It has the biggest pool in OC and it is very easy to find a spot to chill out. The beach is only 30 steps away from the motel. We got a side room where you could sit out on the balcony and see the ocean. There is a building between the back of the motel and the beach, but you can see the ocean if you're on the side. The only complaint is that there isn't an elevator. We were on the 3rd floor, not a big problem. But if you're lugging up 3 bags of luggage it can be a little difficult. The room was just fine. The bathrooms are old, but very clean. The beds were ok. A little soft for my liking, but it wasn't bad. The room had a fridge, stove, and you could use one of the irons from the front office. Overall I was pleased with my stay at the Beachmark. I would go back, if the price is right. I wouldn't pay more than $90 to stay here, it is a pretty good place if you're on a budget or have limited choices.
